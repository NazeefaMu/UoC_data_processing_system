CAB organizes Annual Interbank Quiz

The 26th Annual Interbank Quiz Competition organized by the Clearing Association of Bankers (CAB) is to be held on May 13, from 4.00 pm onwards, at the Balmoral Hall of the Kingsbury in Colombo.
The competition, which is open to all commercial, development and savings banks and financial institutions has already received an overwhelming response with over 40 teams including the defending champions, the HNB ‘A’ team and last year’s runners-up, the Seylan Bank ‘A’ team.
The objectives of this annual event are to foster the rapport among bankers, encourage interbank fellowship and impart knowledge on varied subjects such as current affairs, law in relation to banking and finance, international trade, sports, entertainment, etc. As in the past years, the Quiz Master will be Ravi Molligoda.
One should also be keen to know how the Inter Bank Quiz will be worked out. Each team will comprise five members who will face the Quiz Master together and there will be five such rounds on the given subjects and each round will have 10 questions.
The main sponsor of the Quiz is the Bank of Ceylon and Pronto Lanka, while Transnational BPM Lanka (Pvt) Ltd has taken on the role of co-sponsor.
The Clearing Association of Bankers (CAB) is an association formed by the staff of the cheque clearing departments of all commercial banks in Sri Lanka, the National Clearing House, Lanka Clear (Pvt) Ltd and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
CAB was formed with the objective of enhancing the knowledge of bankers as well as to promote goodwill, understanding and fellowship among professionals engaged in clearing and to acquire cutting edge technology in the world with regard to Clearing for member banks.
CAB currently constitutes more than 450 life members from the banking fraternity and the incumbent President is Mr. M. Razak Deen from MCB Bank. The Association has been striving hard to make the Quiz program popular and the most sought after annual event of the banking fraternity.
