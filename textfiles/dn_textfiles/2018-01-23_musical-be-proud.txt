The Greatest Showman
A musical  to be  proud of

P.T. Barnum’s imagination has inspired in making this musical biopic which tells the tale of a visionary who rose above all to create a spectacle which became a worldwide sensation.
Imagine Hugh Jackman of ‘Wolverine’ fame singing and dancing to some rhythmical beats and in the centre of a circus as showman PT Barnum. A little known fact about the celebrated actor is that he was an award winning stage musical star before he bared his claws. Now many years into the Hollywood movie scene it is a pleasure to note that his abilities in the stage musical scene have not faded because he delivers a performance which deserves a standing ovation. Since Barnum finds himself out of a job he decides to buy a museum and make a circus out of it. Soon he lay his hands on every possible showpiece he thinks he can gather from dwarves to tattooed guys, tall and pot bellied men and tries to put them on display for an audience. And being Jackman he manages to pull it off with wit and twinkling eyes.
The opening scene itself, much like the successful ‘La La Land’ begins with an energetic performance by Jackman and a troupe of professional dancers. This promises of better things to come and does not cease to disappoint the audience. Thus begins an all-singing and all-dancing show which will keep you entertained for hours. However like in many successful stories Barnum’s too must come to an end. When Barnum decides that he wants to be a part of the elite world as well as continue making money from his team he begins to lose respect from the troupe. The whole project boasts of some of the top names in the industry. The lyrics are by ‘La La Land’s Pasek and Paul. The cast comprises of some of the most promising actors in the scene like Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya. However director Michael Gracey is relatively new to the director’s seat and has been handed a script which is difficult to visualize. Plus making the movie a musical adds more fire to the hay but he has done wonders in making a magical piece which has a lot of spunk and heart.
For Bollywood fans some scenes in this movie might remind you of the Aamir Khan starrer ‘Dhoom 3’ but apart from the circus performances, the similarities end there. The bright hues which put life into the dull 19th century backdrop and the angles of the camera which capture Williams’ graceful moves are commendable.
There will be plenty of humming and toe-tapping when the movie is at full swing because the music and songs are quite infectious. The cast carries the dance items so effortlessly that it is a joy to watch. Ringling Brothers may have closed up shop, but through ‘The Greatest Showman’, Barnum lives on.
