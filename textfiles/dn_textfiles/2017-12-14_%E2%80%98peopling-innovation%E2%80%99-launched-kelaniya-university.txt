‘Peopling for innovation’ launched by the Kelaniya University

The National Summit of People’s Management by the University of Kelaniya was launched at the Kingsbury Hotel<U+200B> on Tuesday.
The summit with a vision of ‘Peopling for innovation’ consisted of three separate sessions, The Academic Convention, The Postgraduate Caucus and The Undergraduate Confab. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs Dr. Sarath Amunugama graced the occasion as the Chief Guest while the Chairman of Hela Clothing, Dian Gomes also graced the occassion.
The minister addressing the gathering said, “I take this as an opportunity to invite the foreign students who are present here today to make the most of this occasion. The subject you have selected is of great importance to this country and management is the key to development”.
“I must tell you that the Port City which is under construction is of 680 hectares with 80 hectares consisting of greenery. The Sri Lankan government has collaborated with a Chinese Company in building this great architecture within two years. Now this is a brilliant example of good management,” he noted.
“The biggest problem affecting the growth of Sri Lanka is the public sector and it is mandatory that we face this blunt truth. Poor management is the promary reason behind this. After independence, many governments have been making state ventures by bringing in their relatives and political supporters into power and this has caused many losses in the majority of government institutions.”
