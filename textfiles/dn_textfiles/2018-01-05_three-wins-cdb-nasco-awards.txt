Three wins for CDB at NASCO Awards

The NASCO Awards held annually to recognise and reward sales leadership organised by the apex national marketing body in the country, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing saw its timely theme of ‘Prepare to take charge’.
Citizens Development Business Finance (CDB) has always espoused team skills in marketing and sales as an integral facet to its continued success, which has placed the company now among the Top Seven entities in the NBFI financial services sector.
CDB team members wear the exalted NASCO crowns as Territory Manager and Frontliners – Lalith Peiris winning gold as Territory Manager and Nadeeka Geethani from the Ragama Branch and Prisad Jayamal from the Mahara Branch winning bronze as Frontliners.
Chosen to wear these laurels after a stringent selection and evaluation process which included a half day training programme conducted by SLIM, this national event which recognises efforts and performance of sales personnel is the only such event held in Sri Lanka to reward the country’s sales force. The three winners from CDB who won under the Finance category are now among an exalted roll of honour of sales personnel who are in the forefront of ‘Preparing to take charge’ where their performance, capability, capacity and potential have been recognised.
The two Frontliners who won bronze awards, Nadeeka Geethani and Prisad Jayamal have now proven that they have the ability to move up their career path undertaking the imperative responsibilities that come with such roles.
For CDB, the NASCO wins reiterate its commitment to developing a world class sales force who thrive on challenges, exploit opportunities, think beyond the norm and are on a quest for excellence. “We are indeed proud to have forged and nurtured a winning team that has unequivocally proven that they are the best,” says CDB MD/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara. “Winning the prestigious NASCO awards which heralds the country’s best sales personnel highlights that CDB truly has a team that is built on the platform of excellence and we intend growing that team to be the best there is.”
