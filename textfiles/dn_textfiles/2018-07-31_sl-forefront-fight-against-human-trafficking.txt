SL in forefront of fight against human trafficking

Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday pledged to take all possible measures to combat human trafficking.
The deputy minister was speaking before the walk organised by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to commemorate World Day against Trafficking in Persons. According to the US State Department and the United Nations, Sri Lanka has come to the forefront of countries taking stiff measures to combat human trafficking and strong measures have been taken by the SLBFE to combat human trafficking.
ILO Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Simrin Singh said that trafficking in persons is a big illegal business which generates about US$ 150 billion in profit annually. “We want to make sure those who are going out as migrant workers are not exploited because they do not need to be a part of this illegal business,” she said.
She said that trafficking is not the same thing as moving from one country to another to look for work. “ILO has done a lot of research into how many people are in enforced labour and are trafficked around the world. At least 25 million people and 70 percent of them are girls and women and 25 percent are children under the age of 18. It’s a very ugly business,” she said.
