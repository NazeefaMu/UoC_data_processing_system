Setback for Pohottuwa

Nomination lists of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) known as Pohottuwa were rejected for several Local Government authorities yesterday.
The SLPP’s lists for Weligama Urban Council, Maharagama Urban Council, Badulla Pradeshiya Sabha, Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha, Panadura Urban Council and Agalawatte Pradeshiya Sabha were rejected.
Nominations for 93 local bodies closed at noon yesterday.Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya speaking to the Daily News said the list for the Weligama Urban Council was rejected as it was handed over by an unauthorised person and the Maharagama Urban Council did not have the stipulated number of female candidates on the list.
Deshapriya explained that a nomination list has to always be presented by an authorized person; the party secretary, a candidate or a previously authorized person. He added that in the Maharagama ward, there needed to be four female representatives but the list only had three names.
A government official explained that according to election laws, the party had to nominate an authorized person to handover the nomination list by 8 December, 8.30am.
In the Badulla Pradeshiya Sabha, a government official explained that the SLPP list had a candidate who had simply signed his name but not written it in full. In Mahiyangana, they have not mentioned whether the candidates on the list were male or female.
When it came to Panadura and Agalawatte, the Party Secretary’s signature had not been properly certified.
Apart from the SLPP, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as well as the Ilangai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) too had their nomination lists rejected in the Ampara District.
The SLFP’s list was rejected in the Dehiyatakandiya and Padiyathalawa Pradeshiya Sabhas while the ITAK’s lists in Alayadivembu and Samanthurai were rejected.
According to the Election Commission sources, the SLFP and ITAK lists were rejected since they were handed over by persons not authorised to do so. The parties had also missed the deadline to nominate a person to hand over the list.
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) too had bad luck in Samanthurai with their list being rejected. According to government officials, the list had not been signed by the Party Secretary.
The UNP in the meantime had the candidate for the Gondennawa Ward in the Nawalapitiya Urban Council rejected for not fulfilling conditions set on the nomination paper, said the Returning Officer, H.M.P. Hitisekara at the Kandy District Secretariat.
The parties whose lists were rejected yesterday will not be able to contest for the respective local bodies at the election next year.
The date for the election will be set once nominations for the remaining 203 local bodies have been called for. According to the Elections Commission, nominations are to be called for these bodies from December 18-21. They will close at noon on December 21. The nomination of the authorized agent has to be made on December 15 before 8.30am.
There are 336 local bodies in total which have been dissolved. Of that number, 203 have petitions against them and had nominations delayed. Of the remaining 133, 40 had typos in the gazette calling for elections and thus the gazette had to be reissued. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils earlier this month stated that the amended gazette for the 40 local bodies was being prepared and would be ready soon.
SLPP to take legal action
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will go before court over the rejection of nomination papers for several Local Government institutions in the Kalutara, Colombo and Matara districts on Monday, said Matara district Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma.
Alahapperuma when asked about their future course of action following the rejection of several of its nomination lists said that this type of minor incidents have taken place throughout history.
The Parliamentarian said that several nomination lists of the Sri Lanka Podu jana Peramuna have been rejected citing technical reasons which are very trivial. Alahapperuma added that his party has fulfilled all basic requirements to be accepted by the election officials.
He said that the candidates fielded by his party have already declared their assets. “We will go before court seeking a Writ Order.
