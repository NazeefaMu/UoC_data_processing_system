‘Police can prosecute against liquor offences’

Under Excise Ordinance a policeman too is an excise officer:
Galle Chief Magistrate A.Nishantha Peiris asserted that the Police are legally empowered to initiate legal proceedings before a Magistrate’s Court in connection with liquor related matters. The Magistrate made the affirmation yesterday, when he delivered an order regarding objections challenging the legal empowerment of the police to prosecute offenders of liquor related violations.
The defense lawyers raised the above objections. With regard to a number of cases reported from different Police stations within the Galle Police Division several persons were prosecuted by Galle Police at the Galle Magistrate’s Court for transporting arrack and beer without valid permits. In the prosecution the accused pleaded guilty and the Magistrate fined the offenders. Subsequently as the prosecution asked court to confiscate the nine vehicles used for the unlawful liquor transportation the defense lawyers who looked after the interests of the vehicle owners who were a third party to the case objected saying the police had no legal authority to initiate legal actions against the suspects in a liquor related case under the statute 52 (1) A of Excise Ordinance.
