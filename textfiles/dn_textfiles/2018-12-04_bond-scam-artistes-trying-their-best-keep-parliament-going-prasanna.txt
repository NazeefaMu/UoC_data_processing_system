Bond scam artistes trying their best to keep Parliament going - Prasanna

The persons who received the money robbed from the Central Bank through the Bond scam are now trying their best to keep the current Parliament, MP Prasanna Ranatunga said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said it was the UNP which said that the JVP took money from them. Now the UNP leader is trying to buy UPFA MPs.
“There is no supremacy in the 225 Members in Parliament and it lies with the people of this country. The entire country is demanding a
General Election and a petition is being signed by them. Holding a General Election is the only solution to the current situation,” Ranatunga said.
According to MP Ranatunga, the main objective of the Opposition is creating an environment similar to Libya in Sri Lanka and bringing in a leader who is loved by the West.
The funds are being pumped by foreign countries and certain local companies. The TNA is trying to get Eelam through Parliament while the LTTE failed to get it through arms.
“In 2005 the former President and current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa took over a country that was devastated by a huge Tsunami, a country with a brutal war and a country in the throes of a food shortage etc.
Then he handed over a financially stable and peaceful country in 2015. Again in 2018, he has received a country with an economic crisis created through the Central Bank Bond issue, violence in the North and the East, a strong under world, a widespread illicit drug business etc.
