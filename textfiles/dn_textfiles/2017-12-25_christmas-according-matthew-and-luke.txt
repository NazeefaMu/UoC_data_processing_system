Christmas according to Matthew and Luke

Obviously, the most eye-catching item at Christmas is the crib. Children love to make it or buy one. But, are we aware of the fact that a traditional crib is an amalgamation of two Christmas stories?
St. Francis of Assisi is said to have made the first imitational crib with life-size statues.
The Christmas stories or the infancy narratives occur only in the Gospels according to Saints Matthew and Luke.
The story and the theological message of Matthew differ drastically from Luke. They write to two different communities and thus their messages and characters highlighted in their stories differ accordingly.
Shepherds do not appear in the Gospel of Matthew while the Magi are absent in Luke.
The Christmas liturgy presents the Matthean version of the Christmas story on the vigil of Christmas on the eve of December 24. The Christmas Masses at midnight and at dawn on December 25 proclaim the Lukan perspective of the Christmas with two subsequent parts related only to the shepherds.
The Matthean Christmas message
The Matthean Gospel is supposedly written to a predominantly Jewish readership.
Thus he begins with a genealogy of Jesus that highlights Abraham, the divinely-chosen forefather of the Jewish Race and the great King David to whose dynasty was promised the Messiah bearing the symbolic name of Emmanuel as was also prophesied by Isaiah (7:14) about 600 years before the birth of Jesus.
Thus Matthew points out to the doubtful Jews that the baby born is a true and noble Jew: a true descendant of Abraham and David and they are related to Lord Jesus through the foster parenthood of Joseph, the husband of Mary.
The “Emmanuel” prophecy in the infancy narrative is the basis of the central theme of the Gospel of Matthew as it occurs at the beginning (1:23), in the middle (18:20) and at the end (28:20) of the Gospel.
Etymologically it refers to the fact God has come to our midst from heaven to be with us forever.
Why does Matthew opt to speak of the Magi and the plot of King Herod the Great? It points to the future destiny of the Infant Jesus.
While the chosen race of the Jews have rejected their Messiah, the less favoured Gentiles have come to accept and adore the babe as their true Lord, God and King as symbolised by their gifts. The chosen race has rejected their true King and Saviour as an infant through King Herod and as an adult through their religious and political leadership.
The Lukan Christmas message
Luke’s main message is reflected in the angelic announcement to the shepherds keeping their night watch over their flocks in the fields: “For today in the city of David a saviour has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord” (2:11).
The Holy Land of Israel was under the Roman imperial rule. The Roman emperor was to be addressed by the citizens as the world’s ‘saviour’ and ‘lord’. The application of these titles to Lord Jesus now emphasises the fact that Jesus is the true Saviour of the world and its Lord. In addition, the contemporary world history adds to the historical factuality of Lord Jesus’ birth.
The title “Messiah” is addressed to the Jews and it invites them to acknowledge the infant as their long-expected Messiah.
Luke makes it a point to cite the place the baby was laid in, wrapped in swaddling clothes reminiscent of King Solomon – a manger. Jesus now lies in a manger not only as a rejected poor child but also as the life-giving true food of humanity.
The central characters in the Lukan infancy narrative are the shepherds.
What is their theological significance? Adult Jesus’ solidarity with the poor and the social outcasts is a major Lukan theme.
Thus in the body of the Gospel Luke speaks of sinners, tax-collectors, women, Samaritans who were rejected or oppressed by the Jewish society but loved and associated by the adult Jesus. Thus, Luke wants to highlight the fact that this tendency was present even at the birth of Jesus. The shepherds who were poor and social outcasts were welcomed as the first visitors to the Infant Jesus.
In today’s context
What messages can we derive from Matthew and Luke when they are treated separately? Matthew speaks of the rejection of Jesus by the chosen race. As Christians, we are the chosen of Lord Jesus now. How do we respond to our Christian calling vis-à-vis the new converts to Christian fundamentalist sects? How fervent are these new converts in their faith! On the other hand, how lukewarm are we, waiting for the constant push of our pastors and ready to leave the Church at the least mistake by them? Reflecting on the Lukan perspective, how much are we in solidarity with the poor and the social outcasts whom we meet daily? - Messenger
