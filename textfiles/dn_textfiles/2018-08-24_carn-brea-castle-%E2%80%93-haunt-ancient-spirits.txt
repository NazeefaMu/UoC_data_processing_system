Carn Brea Castle  – The haunt of ancient spirits

Juliet Coombe discovers Cornwall’s tour de force and dines out on the experience
Carn Brea Castle is small and yet majestic, built on top of natural giant grey boulders balancing precariously together with huge gaps between them, 738 feet above sea level. The rock formations give it a magical mysterious unexplained feel and Carn Brea translated means ‘rocky hill’.
In many ways, it has a striking resemblance to Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft and I learn, over dinner in the fabulous Carn Brea Castle Middle Eastern restaurant, that it does have a rather amusing connection to The Harry Potter film, The Chamber of Secrets. The film features a flying turquoise Ford Anglia car, which Harry and Ron ‘borrow without permission’ from Mr. Wesley when they miss the Hogwarts Express. The original car used in the film was stolen from the studios and later, in 2005, found abandoned in the car park outside Carn Brea Castle. Given that it had no engine and would have been extremely difficult to tow to the top of the hill un-noticed, its appearance at Carn Brea Castle seems to back up the theory that there is some sort of magic at work here in this inhospitable place.
Built on a Neolithic settlement as a chapel to St. Michael, in 1379 AD, on the eastern tor of Carn Brea Hill, the building has had many uses. Around 1790, its purpose was changed from a chapel, when it was converted into a castle folly by the Basset Family, who once owned the hill as part of their Tehidy Estate. During the Elizabethan period, it became an extremely popular hunting and feasting lodge and so it is perhaps appropriate and ironic that this non-symmetrical Grade II listed building is now a restaurant serving steaks and lamb skewered cooked by a Jordanian chef who fell in love with the place in the 1880s.
There is nothing symmetrical about the building’s architecture, with its four turrets, quirky central building and decorative battlements, and yet it is a perfect castle shape, with its magnificent roof terrace and warren of small hobbit-like castle rooms inside. The floor just before the roof terrace has been kept as a play area for the kids, and sells eclectic vintage memorabilia, ranging from a Pinocchio statue with a very long nose to a Bavarian Beer mug. I learn from the boards, with black and white historic photos and drawings on the first floor of the restaurant, that around 6,000 years ago the area was a major Early-Neolithic settlement and fortress. Its true origins, however, are still something of an archaeological mystery. The display includes flint arrowheads and replica gold coins with images on, found in the area. Remnants of burnt wooden palisades suggest that the Castle was attacked at least once in its history. The area, with its unusual stone formations, is so unique that it is not only listed, but has also been assigned its own name – a ‘Tor enclosure’. There is also a holy well nearby, complete with stone cross and a number of ancient Neolithic tombs and rock formations indicating a settlement for a period of time. Legend has it that there is a smuggler’s cave – perhaps, a secret escape tunnel through the hilltop to the sea, for if it was ever captured.
The restaurant, situated inside the gothic style castle, overlooks Camborne, Pool, Barncoose and across to Redruth, opening each day for dinner at 6.30pm, just in time to watch the sun setting. Otherwise, you can enjoy a later dinner, as the restaurant does not close until midnight. Although surrounded on all sides by modern civilisation, you feel, as you tuck into mouthwatering steak, lamb kebabs and mezzi platters, as if you are a whole world away from it all, exposed to the elements. If you decide to go on a brisk walk beforehand, and being the highest point in the area you can get a grandiose sense of being on top of the world, looking out towards coastline to the north and lots of amazing historic Cornish tin mine chimneys below. The rocks further along the track have clearly been used for making things, maybe even coins and there are many theories about them both real and mythical.
Around 1898, the castle started being used as a beacon for ships, with a candle permanently lit at night in the north-facing window. Like a lighthouse, it was visible to the boats passing between St Ives and St. Agnes. It sadly fell into disuse during the early 1950s and in 1978 it was restored and then, in 1982, turned into a superb Middle Eastern restaurant.
In old books on the area, there is a legendary claim that the rocks where Carn Brea Castle now stands were once the lookout seat of a mighty giant called John of Gaunt, whose stride was four feet in distance. They say when he died; he lay out on the hillside and turned to stone. Near the castle, there is a rocky formation known locally as the giant’s head. Also, one of the best examples of a mythical sacrificial stone (table) can be found around 340 metres to the southwest and has an eerie feel about it - as if the unhappy spirits have hung around, looking for vengeance, hiding out in the fallen rocks.
In the winter, I am told it is even more fun than the warm summer months, with roaring fires, and, as there is no electricity in the castle, the beautiful candles, everywhere, give the place a medieval feel. There is an excellent children’s menu, including Jordanian style curry, which my sons loved, and chicken kebabs. The steak in red wine sauce with mushrooms was phenomenal and we ended up with two out of the three delicious deserts to pick from, with the cheesecake taking top billing. Make sure you have cash or be prepared to do the dishes, as this is a place that has yet to move into the modern world of credit and debit cards due to not having electricity.
On leaving the castle, do take a last look back at it - it is even more magical late at night, lit up by the stars, half moon and one twinkling candle in the Carn Brea window, reminding all those that sail past these shores to be super careful of the precarious sea rocks that once made this unpredictable Cornish coastline a pirate wreckers paradise.
