Kuwait Airways adds new Boeing 777-300ER to New York route

Kuwait Airways, the official National Carrier of the State of Kuwait, highlighted that its flights to New York has recently increased to Daily Flights service, with a significant increase in demand driving to this decision.
There has been a significant 20 per cent increase in market share to Kuwait Airway’s key North American destination in 2016. The additional flights service now also benefits from the fact that the airline’s new Boeing 777-300ER Aircraft are primarily servicing this route.
This has allowed for increased passenger capacity, per flight, on the longest international route on Kuwait Airways’ network.
Kuwait Airways has Flatbed Facility on All Flights Ex-Colombo to New York as well providing Wi-access on-board. Kuwait Airways offers special deals to New York with Economy Class return and Business Class return.
In addition, the carrier provides Free Lounge Access to Economy Class passengers at the Palm Strip Lounge, Bandaranaike International Airport.
Commenting on the recent frequency increase, Rasha Al Roumi, Chairperson and CEO of Kuwait Airways said “New York is a key hub and gateway to the North American market and Kuwait Airways is excited to be increasing our capacity and frequencies to one of the world’s most exciting commercial and travel destinations.”
