Illegal tapping amidst water scarcity in Anuradhapura

Although several intermittent gusts have been experienced in the Anuradhapura district, no sufficient amount of water had accumulated in the 12 major and 85 medium tanks. According to statistics from the Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director's Office, the water capacity of the Hurulu Wewa remains at 7,000 acre-feet, whereas the normal capacity is 85,000 acre-feet. The water levels of the Nuwara Wewa, Tisa Wewa and Mahakanadawara, Mahavilachchiya, Wahalkada, Nachchaduwa tanks are low; below 50 percent at present.
It was reported that amidst the water scarcity, certain farmers are attempting to illegally obtain water from the tanks, breaching the water-management criteria agreed upon at the kanna meetings.
A group of farmers cultivating under the Heen Ela canal of the Nachchaduwa reservoir, was reported to have broken the padlocks of regulators at four distribution canals in order to obtain water for their paddy fields. Also, at night on the same day, certain paddy cultivators had broken the locks of the main sluice of the Heen Ela canal, causing a large-scale water wastage. Nachchaduwa irrigation Engineer Amal Bandara told the Daily News that culprits were not arrested, despite three complaints concerning these criminal acts being reported to Hidogama Police.
"At present, we have tightened our night patrol with irrigation officers and farmer organisation members having joined together to thwart the vandals, since police are not cooperating. If these acts of vandalism continue, we will be at a great loss of water, which would adversely affect the limited Maha paddy cultivation in 44,000 acres under Nachchaduwa Maha Ela canal," Irrigation Engineer Amal Bandara said.
It was learnt that water is being illegally tapped at the main feeding canals of the Nuwara Wewa, Tisa Wewa and Hurulu Wewa tanks, and farmer organisations have urged the Anuradhapura government agent and the zonal irrigation director to take the necessary security measures to put an end to such illegal activities.
In the meantime, the Mahaweli water issued to Hurulu Wewa by the Mahaweli Authority from Bowathenna, is about to be halted at the Hiriwadunna, Habarana, and Thalkote tanks, preventing a large volume of water to flow into Hurulu Wewa through these tanks along the 60-km long feeding canal.
Hurulu Wewa Irrigation Engineer Athula Wijewardhana told the Daily News that Mahaweli water flowing along the feeding canal is being illegally tapped up to 20 km from the Lenadora area by tourist hotel owners and large-scale paddy and additional crop cultivators. Due to this prevailing situation, Hurulu Wewa farmers have been suffering in every cultivation season, being deprived of cultivating the full acreage of 15,000 acres. Wijewardhana said he, along with the Hurulu Wewa farmers, have urged authorities to take permanent action to prevent this vandalism.
According to the agreement with the Mahaweli Authority, the annual intake of Mahaweli water to Hurulu Wewa is 20,000 acre-feet, he added.
