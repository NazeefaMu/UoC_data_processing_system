I am unbiased when serving people: Sajith

Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said he was unbiased when serving people in his electorate.
He was addressing a meeting held in Tissamaharama recently.
The Minister said people of all walks of life were in this gathering and they were in various political parties. “They all strengthens my political journey,” he said. The Minster said he would launch a special programme for the Visira loan recipients and would set up a follow up programme to see whether those who received Visira loans have built houses. Minister Premadasa said 205,000 families were provided with housing loans to set up houses and 80,000 families in the Hambantota district have no proper dwellings. “I want to provide houses for all of them under ‘Semata Sevana Housing Programme,” the Minister said. “Minsters of the previous regime worked for the welfare of their family members and neglected the people who brought them into power. The policy of the yahapalana regime was to serve the people without political discrimination,” the Minister said.
