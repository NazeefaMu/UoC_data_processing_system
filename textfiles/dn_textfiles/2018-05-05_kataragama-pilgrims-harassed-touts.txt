Kataragama pilgrims harassed by touts

Pilgrims who arrive at a place called Kada Hathaliha in the Kataragama town to buy fruits as offerings to Kataragama Maha Devalaya are harassed by the touts and brokers of pooja watti vendors, pilgrims complain.
The traders conduct their business at a car park in front of the CTB pilgrims’ rest. There are 40 pooja watti shops out of which 30 shop owners engage in the pooja watti business.
The brokers and touts in the car park force pilgrims to buy fruit from their shops. If pilgrims did not buy from them, the brokers accuse the pilgrims in foul language, sometimes attack them and do not allow vehicles to park in front of their shops. If pilgrims do park ignoring them, they vandalize the vehicle after the pilgrims go to worship the Maha Devalaya and Kirivehera.
Kataragama Lake House Newspaper Agent K. M. Ariyasena said these thugs sometimes do not allow persons to park their bicycles and motorcycles in front of his agency to buy papers. They push aside their bicycles after threatening them.
An official of the Kataragama Urban Development Authority said they constructed the car park and shops, and handed them over to the Kataragama Pradeshiya Saba who had rented out the car park to an individual.
Although the individual charges fees from vehicles, neither he nor the Pradeshiya Saba takes responsibility for vandalism.
Meanwhile, Kataragama Police Chief Inspector O.I.C. Upali Kariyawasam said he had received many complaints regarding this matter and that he had stationed two police constables in the location.
