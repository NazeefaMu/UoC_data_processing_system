SL prisons to learn from foreign systems

The Justice and Prison Reform Ministry is studying the prison systems of other countries to improve local prisons and the welfare of prisoners.
Justice and Prison Reform Minister Thalatha Athukorale recently visited Singapore to study its prison system.
The Minister told the Daily News that there could be more lessons to be learnt from the prison systems of other countries, regarding the security of prisoners, welfare activities, the arrangement of prison cells, and the advanced technology used.
Minister Athukorale said that she closely studied the steps taken by the Singaporean government to improve prisoners’ welfare, get rid of corruption in prisons, and rehabilitate prisoners. She had visited some prisons, including the prison at Changi.
She said the Singaporean Home Minister assured maximum support for prison and judicial reforms taking place in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the present security situation in prisons, she that instead of a prisons’ intelligence body, a prisons’ police has been established, and it will be empowered with legal authority to participate in prison affairs. The formation of the prisons’ police has been executed for the first time in the history of local prisons.
The Minister said there is no person held responsible for the detections made by the prisons’ intelligence unit. It is learnt that on some occasions, the decisions of the intelligence unit were not executed or were tampered with by politicians or high-ranking officials.
“That can’t be allowed.” Minister Athukorale said. “As a result of tough decisions we have taken recently to stop the activities related to the drug racket operated by some underworld members from prisons, some of my staff face death threats. My ministry is determined to take correct decisions to anticipate any threat to justice.”
