Red Cross Marks  – write wrongs  or right wrongs?

Rainbow’s violet says majesty - red says vulnerability
Coming here as man, bear injustice suffering ignominy
Red Cross marks man did to man became mine Cross
Unite races heal peoples o’er ancient divides and dross
 
What do you do with wrongs of others
How strongly do you mark them foul
By the mark you made - others in kind return
Tit for tat and butter for fat
You kicked my dog I kill your cat
Society is red to the teeth
Politics academics theatrics
There was One who turned his cheek
Gave His back to the plough
To Him my wrongs all bow
“Lay not this charge to their account
I will pay - my merit for them count”
 
It’s my turn to receive the whip I put on others
I cry for mercy hoping to prevent just deserts
“As you sow you reap; which throne do you go
Mercy or wrath- accordingly paid good or woe
 
Teacher takes red pen hastily to mark
He knows the boy’s a crook so stark
Readily hand forms to cross the sum
He never gets it right and never will
All his life this rascal will go wrong
Teacher puts a hex that’ll vex him long
Boy ends in jail none helps to raise his head
Teacher’s own son is with him in the cell
 
He without sin cast the first stone
For stones boomerang get your own
Oppressor today victim tomorrow
Prosecutor turns accused next day
Wheels of justice surely grind
Grace and mercy is better to find
Sword of Damocles not on my head
If I forgive as God forgave my debt
Shylock’s pound hemlock deathly brew
Give not another, in your own juice you stew
 
Roman whips and crown of thorns crucifixion agony
Vividly portrayed man’s cruelty and human villainy
Montague and Capulet world over kill love and beauty
Resurrection morning proclaimed Mercy’s Victory
 
Engrave on heart of stone or erase with kindness
Marks that come on the lives of fellow travellers
Write a wrong so easy, right a wrong needs mercy
 
The way you choose gives back dividends aplenty
Between majestic violet and the vulnerable red
God comes in Green giving life to spiritually dead
Blue is omnipresence yellow wisdom from heaven
Orange says change new fruit for a new season
