Let them eat bread

Bread is important. One cannot put it more simply, and yet the reasons could scarcely be more complicated. It is the staff of life, transubstantiated in the eucharist into the body of a divinity; we break it with our companions (com– + pànis, with + bread); we pray for it daily to our Lord (from the Old English word hlàford, which originated from hlàfweard, meaning loaf-ward or bread-keeper); at the Passover Seder, observant Jews eat the bread of affliction, the unleavened matzo (the Catholic communion wafer is made to the same recipe).
There is the enriched challah, which is blessed and thus sanctified on the Jewish Sabbath, the sweet Twelfth Night bread that contains a token effigy of the infant Jesus, dozens of Easter breads, numerous iftar breads baked for ending the fast in various Muslim cultures, and the Parsee dròn offering.
In the Hebrew scriptures lechem is the sole word used to denote bread, although it is also used to signify food in general, or a particular unit of food, so when God, in Genesis 3:19, tells Adam “in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread”, He is employing synecdoche to express Adam’s vast punishment.
Yet, as Scott Cutler Shershow points out in his eye-opening short book Bread (which treats bread as an object, in a series that also includes Refrigerator, Hotel and Cigarette Lighter), the Jewish Sabbath blessing over bread doesn’t mention human toil, but praises God “who brings forth (ha motzi) bread (lechem) from the earth”.
Moreover, in the Rabbinic tradition, man doesn’t thank God for the harvested grain itself, but for the baked loaves; and there has been Talmudic speculation that, when the messiah comes, “God would yet again bring forth not merely grain, but also bread itself, directly from the earth”. Note, too, that Jesus was born in Bethlehem (beth–lechem, the house of bread). Before all this, in ancient Greece, the Eleusinian Mysteries involved the goddess of the harvest Demeter (Ceres in Rome), and, according to surviving inscriptions, initiates would glimpse the secret in “an ear of grain in silence reaped”.
Our “bread and butter” is the source of our income; “bread and water”, our severe punishment; and “bread and circuses” describes how a despot (or even a legitimate ruler) keeps hoi polloi from rebelling. But man does not live by bread alone, although we strive to earn our crust, to put bread on the table, because we want to be the breadwinner, not on the breadline, or fed the crumbs from the rich man’s table; we struggle against having the bread taken out of our mouths.
From the ancient Greeks to Karl Marx, from Peter Kropotkin’s The Conquest of Bread (1892) to the cry – “le pain se lève!” – of the Jacquerie in the peasant revolt of 1358, and the Egyptian bread riots of 1977, provoked by the abrupt end of government grain subsidies, bread has represented the concept of value itself.
The overarching slang trope of money as “bread” is easy to explain (“dough” is a bit more puzzling). As Di Murrell comments in her surprisingly wide-ranging Barges and Bread: Canals and grain to bread and baking, as early as 1266 in England the creation of the Assize of Bread and Ale used grains of wheat as the underlying measure from which all weights and measures were derived, and in 1303 it decreed that “an English penny shall weigh 32 grains of wheat dry”. (Commentators have long noted that even the premodern taxman could not have been bamboozled into thinking that thirty-two grains of wheat, though “taken from the middle of the ear”, was an exact measure.) Perhaps more optimistic American slang prefers “dough” because dough can expand and increase.
Before dough can be made, though, wheat must be ground or milled. Volume Two of Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoya’s Modernist Bread (which comes in five massive instalments plus a spiral-bound kitchen guide, encased in its own metal bookcase, the whole weighing 24 kg) lists some “common expressions derived from flour milling”, including the serious impediment implied by having a “millstone around your neck” (for Jesus it was not only a difficulty, but a method of capital punishment: Matthew 18:6, “But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea”); “putting someone through the mill”; and “grist for the mill”.
Keeping your “nose to the grindstone” can mean working conscientiously by being alert for the smell of an overheating millstone – or it might be related to knife-sharpening. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s threatening verse, “Though the mills of God grind slowly, / Yet they grind exceeding small”, can be traced back at least to Plutarch, while separating “the wheat from the chaff” – making a judgement of quality – has a literal as well as metaphorical application, as does “run of the mill” meaning average, in reference, say Myhrvold and Migoya, to the mill run, “which includes all the grain processed by the mill before it’s sorted”.
“The British Isles, with a population of about 3.5m in the 1300s”, write Myhrvold and Migoya in their first volume, “needed to have at the ready as many as 7m loaves of bread [weighing 1 kg each] every single day”. Today, the UK population (which they put at 65 million at the time of writing) buys about 12 million loaves daily. Whereas most of pre-modern mankind relied on this single food for subsistence, bread is no longer our primary food; bakers no longer occupy a central place in our culture as, with a few exceptions such as war-time, the bread supply is no longer a matter of state.
Still, we can appreciate the force of this, from a poem by John Penkethman in 1638 (quoted by Shershow): “Let Butchers, Poulters, Fishmongers contend, / Each his own Trade in what he can defend; . . . / Yet no man can deny (to end the strife) / Bread is worth all, being the Staff of Life”. The staff of life, Shershow reminds us, also represents death. In Robert Burns’s version, from 1872, of the ballad of John Barleycorn, three kings swear “a solemn oath / John Barleycorn should die”.
They plough, and sow him under a clod, but in cheerful spring he is resurrected, to their surprise; and in summer he grows “thick and strong”, before growing “wan and pale” in autumn, when his enemies cut him at the knees, and take him to be tortured – “a miller us’d him worst of all, / For he crush’d him between two stones”. Or, in a couplet Shershow remembers (but can’t attribute), “It goes in living, it comes out dead; / It goes in dough, it comes out bread”.
His contemporary John Wesley, meanwhile, compared the life and death of wheat to the Passion of Christ; and the Yiddish proverb has it that “Alts drait zich arum broit un toit”, everything turns on bread and death.
