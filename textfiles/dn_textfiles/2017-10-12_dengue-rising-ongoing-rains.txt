Dengue rising with ongoing rains

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the National Dengue Control Unit to implement mosquito control activities without interruption because there is a possibility of dengue increasing with the ongoing rains in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, North Western and Northern Provinces, a Health Ministry Spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, a total of 158,024 dengue patients and 394 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of the country this year up to October 9 (last Monday). This is the highest number of dengue patients and deaths reported in Sri Lanka so far. There is a possibility of dengue increasing again with the ongoing rains, he said.
Meanwhile, the National Dengue Control Unit sources said during the last National Mosquito Control Week which concluded on September 26, the inspectors discovered positive mosquito breeding sites in construction sites (6 percent), religious places (3 percent), schools (2 percent) and institution (3 percent).
“If there are dengue patients at home, school or workplaces, residents should inform the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) or the Public Health Inspector (PHI) of the area for mosquito control activities and outbreak prevention. If a large number of schoolchildren are infected with dengue, school authorities should arrange early shramadana activities, the sources said.
“If anyone is suffering from fever, seek medical attention without delay. Appropriate treatment should be given according to medical advice.
"Those who are diagnosed with the more severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), they should be hospitalized for in-ward care. All should be protected from mosquito bites during daytime.
"Children when resting during daytime and those who are suffering from fever should be nursed under a bed net to avoid mosquito bites,” the sources added.
