Two people dead  in Paris violence

Two French football fans have died as violence erupted across the county following Les Bleus’s World Cup victory over Croatia.
After the team celebrated their second ever World Cup win in Moscow, there were jubilant scene across France.
In Moscow, Emmanuel Macron was memorably pictured leaping onto a gantry to wildly celebrate a goal in a break from the usual presidential reserve.
But back at home, the joy turned to violence in several areas.
A total of 292 people were placed in custody across France, the Interior Ministry revealed.
The most violent disturbances took place in Paris on Sunday, where 102 people were arrested, and 92 taken to cells.
Michel Delpuech, the Paris Prefect, said: ‘Given the crowd present and despite unacceptable disorder, we have record a measured balance sheet.’
Some of the worst scenes were in central Paris, where celebrations turned into widespread rioting, looting and ugly clashes with cops.
French police fired tear gas and dispersed crowds from the Champs Elysees late yesterday following the 4-2 triumph in Moscow.
Meanwhile, in nearby Saint-Felix, a man in his 30s was killed when his car crashed into a tree as he celebrated his team’s win.
Such accidents were accompanied by baton charges by CRS riot squads, as officers desperately tried to keep crowds in order.
“Rioting broke out soon after midnight as large crowds refused to disperse,” a police source in Paris said.
“Shops including the Publicis Drugstore close to the Arc de Triomphe were ransacked. Windows were smashed and officers who intervened were attacked.
“There have been scenes of absolute chaos that have spoiled the party.”
Millions of French fans had taken to the streets in joy after the final whistle, with thousands gathering along the Champs Elysees. Even President Emmanuel Macron had been earlier seen punching the air at Luzhniki Stadium as his country’s team scored a goal. But as the evening wore on, a small number of fans clashed with police, damaging some businesses and properties along the avenue. Some threw stones and other projectiles at riot officers. And in response, tear gas was deployed.
