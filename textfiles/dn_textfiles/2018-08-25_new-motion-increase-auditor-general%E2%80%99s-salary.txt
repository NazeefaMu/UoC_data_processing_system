New motion to increase Auditor General’s salary

The Government will present a new motion to increase the salary and allowances of Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
He made this clarification with reference to the Government’s move on Thursday to withdraw a ‘Determination under the Constitution’ pending in the Order Paper to raise the salary and allowances of Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe.
The minister said the new motion would raise the AG’s salary and allowances to a level higher than what was proposed in the withdrawn motion.
“Our effort is to give him more recognition by further increasing his salary, and the claims that we try to take revenge on him were not true,” he explained.
He said the Government would revise the determination and present it again to Parliament in the near future. JVP MPs demanded a clarification from the Government on Thursday as to why it decided to withdraw the proposal relating to the salary and allowances of the AG. They pointed out the said proposal to raise the AG’s salary has already been delayed for three years.
