Colombo Port to be opened for public: Samarasinghe

Even though the Colombo Port had operated as a high-security zone during the 30-year war period, in the near future, it would be opened for the public having considered the prevailing peaceful conditions in the country, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said, while addressing a passing-out ceremony of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) security personnel held yesterday.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority had posted a profit of Rs. 13.2 billion in 2017, which in turn, had created a positive impact on the country’s economy.
Hence, the Colombo Port would be opened for public considering it as public property, Minister Samarasinghe added.
One hundred and fifty security officers were passed out during the ceremony, which was held at the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy. Deputy Ports and Shipping Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigama, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Security Director Major Genaral Gamini Hettiarachchi and several other officials took part in the event.
