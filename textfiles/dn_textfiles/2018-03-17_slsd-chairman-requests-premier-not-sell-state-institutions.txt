SLSD Chairman requests Premier not to sell State institutions

Chairman of the <U+200B>Government Surveyors' Association<U+200B> Duminda Udugoda requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to immediately stop the initiatives taken to hand over several operations of the Sri Lanka Survey Department (SLSD) <U+200B>to a US firm.

Udugoda said that under the purview of President Maithripala Sirisena, a committee has been appointed and even before the committee presents its recommendations, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is taking initiatives to sign in secret.
"Preliminary measures had been already taken to assign the most of the SLSD's activities to the foreign company. We have been engaged in union strike action against this initiative since January 8, but nobody seems to care. Therefore, we resorted to protest march," he said.
He requested the Prime Minister to stop selling government institutions to foreign elements.
"If the Prime Minister fails to take any action with regard to the above issue, we will resort to continuous union action," he said.
