Plans to cultivate crops under agrowells

Plans are under way to rehabilitate dilapidated agrowells to enable farmers to cultivate short term crops in the Anuradhapura district throughout the year. Data on cultivation wells, tube wells and deep common wells are being collected by the Agriculture and Agrarian Services Development Departments.
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayaka said the assistance of the Local Government bodies, other government agencies and non-governmental organisations is sought in addition to direct government funds to renovate tube wells, agrowells and common wells.
According to a survey, it has been revealed that there are 30,500 agrowells, 2,428 tube wells and 2,450 common wells in the district. About 18,788 agrowells, 1,353 tube wells and 1,373 common wells are to be rehabilitated.
Wanninayaka said the Presidential Secretariat and the Disaster Management Ministry have been requested to provide funds. NGOs have agreed to support the endeavor in view of drought, he said.
