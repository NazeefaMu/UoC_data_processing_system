Repent at leisure

Even though he held a prestigious job with ample perks he was never satisfied but aimed at earning more and often said he liked to work overseas. Finding employment on contract basis for seven years he left abandoning his love of three years. Her pleadings not to leave fell on deaf ears. Pretty Cathy was now a jilted lover, all her hopes for the future were dashed by Mark's harsh words, when he had said he did not wish to marry her. It was too late when she realised that the past years he had not been serious and his scathing words kept ringing in her ears, 'Find somebody else', wasn't that very demeaning. How could he do this to me, he had forgotten the vows they had made to each other constantly whenever they met, it was like throwing pebbles into the ocean, burying them. She had cried for days after his departure.
Cathy was a quiet and sensitive girl and her parents too were very disturbed over their daughter's plight having wasted her young years. The vibrant young girl now hid herself in a cocoon. 'Give her time she will get over it', her grandparents had said. Her parents were very angry with her for not listening to them and her friends had repeatedly warned her that Mark was a hypocrite and cheat, she had not heeded their advice but carried on her affair regardless. It was only Jenny her one faithful friend who stood by her side consoled her. 'Let him go Cathy stop lamenting he is only a 'saalaya' there are so many fish in the sea with your beauty and goodness you could find a good 'thora' she had said; they had both laughed and gone into the canteen. Jenny's jovial remarks enlightened her and her troubles vanished whenever she was depressed.
Concentrating with her work in the office made her forget him gradually, when one day she received an invitation. It was from Mark, he was getting married in another three days. Once again he had re-kindled the old fire and she had sobbed when her father had found the card, shredding it to bits threw it into the hearth. 'How dared he do this to my child, this scoundrel should be shot', bellowed he, when he was pacified by her mother to calm down. What audacity her friends had said, he was a brute just think the man is dead, wash him off your system they had advised.
The episode was fast forgotten when the office held its annual get-together. It was at the masked dance that Cathy met Eric. Much to her amusement he never left her side and partnered her at all the events. She had enjoyed dancing with him, and at the end of the day he had shyly proposed to her. With no reply and only a smile from her he refused to take an evasive answer. Eric was quick to notice her change of behaviour and light-heartedness when she enjoyed his jokes but at times he noticed that she was not listening and was in a mood of her own. Something seems to be disturbing this pretty girl, let me find out. Cathy vowed that she would never marry all men were the same she had told Jenny. "Lets' see, hold a bet, Cupid is around the corner, do not waste your beauty' she teased. Finally, after much persuasion and still the answer was in the negative, Eric decided to confront her parents and ask for their daughter's hand. Delighted at his politeness, they did not with-hold to tell him of Cathy's former involvement and her awkwardness to marriage. 'Dad, I am not interested of the past, let by-gones be by-gones' he had said. With parental blessings from both sides, Eric and Cathy tied the knot.
Meanwhile, Mark had spells of misfortune. Now abroad for the past five years he led a very unhappy life. His sophisticated wife a high society dame neglected the house whilst he had to shoulder all responsibilities. Moreover her evenings after office were spent at pubs returning late at night. He was compelled to wait up for her resulting in breaking rest. Since his work entailed as an Overseer at a construction site, the delay to attend office on time hampered the on-going work which was prolonged much to the wrath of the contractors, thus he was reprimanded by his superiors for the lapse. Dejected and disgusted with his problems and his failure in marriage, he finally decided to end it and managed on his own until the expiry of his contract. Later on he decided to return to his place of origin.
None of his former associates knew that Mark was in town. With a haggard look and unkempt hair he looked very much older, could not be recognized, but Cathy's mother who had accidentally seen him in town quietly disclosed it to her husband. Mark thought he would use his charms once again and seek solace in his former love, who knows she must be still pining for me. When he learnt that she was happily settled having a small family, a wild jealousy cropped up in him with vicious and random thoughts to find ways and means to destroy her happiness. How could I do that he pondered?
Making enquiries of her husband's place of work he tried to contact him but was unsuccessful since he was at several important meetings. Finally, one day posing off as a business partner he was put through to speak to Eric when he had blurted out his relationship with Cathy several years ago. Being the respected gentleman he listened patiently and knew at once the man's motive. He was trying to create mischief and destroy my beautiful family? I should act fast and keep this dirty man at bay, let me give him a good hearing and invited Mark to meet him at coffee the following evening.
Warned by his in-laws that the man may have returned with bad intentions, Eric planned his retaliation. He watched Mark walk in with vicious glee on his face and he pretended not to show any ill-feelings. 'Look here friend where were you all these years, do not repeat your sayings of yesterday I am not interested, just let me hear about yourself' he said. It was then that Mark blurted out his unhappy marriage. 'You have reaped your own sins, now sink in them', was Eric's answer.
