Sri Lankan refugee in Papua New Guinea ‘takes his own life’

The death of a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee in Papua New Guinea is the sixth fatality on Manus Island in four years.
Australia’s immigration department confirmed the death at Lorengau Hospital but directed inquiries to PNG authorities.
Authorizes believe the 32-year-old man took his own life early on Monday morning. The man’s death is reportedly the second suicide on the island in the past two months.
Former Manus Island MP Ron Knight said the magistrate on the island will be conducting a coroner’s investigation over coming days.
‘It seems like a suicide but it’s not confirmed yet,’ Knight told AAP. He said locals had become increasingly frustrated with the problems that have come with hosting the immigration detention centre, which is slated for closure at the end of the month. ‘It’s given the island a bad name, it’s given the people a bad name, when people are being looked after by our government and the Australian government has to resort to something like this to prove a point, it means that something is terribly wrong with the whole system,’ Knight said. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said the man had been sent to the hospital three days earlier. Greens senator Nick McKim said the case was ‘catastrophic neglect’ from Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.
‘This man had suffered for years in a system that Australia’s Labor and Liberal parties deliberately designed and operated to cause mental harm,’ he said in a statement.
The body of Iranian refugee Hamed Shamshiripour was found near refugee accommodation in early August. The death comes as more than 50 refugees last week left Manus Island and Nauru for a new life in the U.S. More are expected to follow in coming months.
