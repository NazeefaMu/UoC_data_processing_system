China welcomes PM’s  remarks on debt

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang yesterday welcomed remarks made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that his country was not falling into a debt trap because of loans from China nor did the country cede control of strategically vital ports to China, the Global Times reported.
China welcomes the remarks made by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the two countries’ co-operation under the China-proposed Belt and Road (B&R) initiative has benefitted both countries and their people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press briefing Thursday.
The comment came after a CNBC report saying Wickremesinghe had denied the claim that the country was ceding control of strategically vital ports to China. He also said he didn’t believe the country was falling into a debt trap caused by Chinese loans.
“China’s aid to Sri Lanka had never been attached to any political conditions.The B&R initiative will continue to contribute to regional development and connectivity in the future,” Geng said, the Global Times reported.
