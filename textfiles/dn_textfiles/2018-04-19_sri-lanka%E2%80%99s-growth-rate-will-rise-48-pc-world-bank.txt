Sri Lanka’s growth rate will rise to 4.8 pc: World Bank

Sri Lanka’s economic growth rate will rise to 4.8 percent next year, the World Bank predicted in a report this week.
However, the authors warned that “accelerating reforms to promote competitiveness, better governance, and a more balanced budget,” were critical to achieving higher levels of development.
The World Bank’s Spring Economic Focus report analyzed the economic conditions in Sri Lanka and other countries in the region.
They predicted that despite a prolonged drought, Sri Lanka’s economic growth rate would rise from 3.1 percent in 2017 to 4.8 percent in 2018.
Sri Lanka’s growth tracks with the region as a whole.
According to the World Bank, South Asia is again the fastest growing region in the world, bolstered by the economic recovery in India.
“With the right mix of policies and reforms, growth (in the region) is expected to accelerate to 6.9 percent in 2018 and 7.1 percent next year,” they said.
“The good news is that economic growth is creating jobs in the region,” said Martin Rama, World Bank South Asia Region Chief Economist.
“But providing opportunities to these young entrants, while attracting more women into the labour market, will require generating even more jobs for every point of economic growth,” he added.
In Sri Lanka, the working age population increases by 10,000 people every month, they said, adding that the market must grow by 63,000 jobs a year to maintain its employment rate.
