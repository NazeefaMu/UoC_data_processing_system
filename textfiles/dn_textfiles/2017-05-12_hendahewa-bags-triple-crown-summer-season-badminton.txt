Hendahewa bags triple crown  at Summer Season Badminton

Thilini Hendahewa clinched a triple crown while Buwaneka Gunathilaka grabbed a double when the annual Nuwara Eliya Summer Season Badminton Championship 2017 came to a close at the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Indoor Stadium recently.
The reigning national champion, 20-year-old Hendahewa beat Kavidi Ishadika in a thrilling women's open final (21/16, 16/21, 21/16) and also teamed up with the same opponent to defeat Hashini Ambalangoda and Dilmi Dias in the doubles final. Hendahewa clinched her third gold in Nuwara Eliya when she teamed up with Sachin Dias and got the better of Rajitha Dhahanayake and Nadeesha Gayanthi in a three-setter (18/21, 21/10, 21/10) mixed doubles final.
Gunathilaka also showed his impressive form to win the men's open crown when he defeated Sachin Dias in a closely contested final.
The two opponents were seen playing for the same side in the men's doubles and they eventually went on to win the title easily by overcoming the duo, Imesh Hasaranga and Vibhavi Madhusha in a straight set final (21/8, 21/13).
Over 485 shuttlers were in action during the six-day event which saw 615 matches and 26 events being conducted.
The matches were played on rubber carpets and it was the first time such surfaces was used for cooler weather conditions. The high profile tournament which has a history of 20 years was organised by the Central Province Badminton Association (CPBA) under the patronage of Sri Lanka Badminton Association (SLBA) with the assistance of Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council. The tournament turned out to be a great success due to untiring efforts of the CPBA secretary Chamara Aluthge and his team.
Mclarens Group chairman Rohan De Silva was the chief guest at the award ceremoney while former Nuwara Eliya Mayor and CPBA president, Mahinda Dodampagamage was the guest of honour.
