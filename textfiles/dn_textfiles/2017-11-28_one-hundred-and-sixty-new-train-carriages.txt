One hundred and sixty new train carriages

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said his ministry hopes to buy 160 train carriages and 10 train engines to further improve the public transport system in the country, yesterday.
The minister noted the above while explaining the details of the Colombo suburban railway project during a workshop at the Waters Edge Hotel. The project is to be funded by the Asian Development Bank.
The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, together with the Sri Lanka Railways, plan to develop Sri Lankan railway stations, construct new parallel lines, and modernise associate railway stations. This project is to be implemented with a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The Kelani Valley line from Maradana to Padukka will be constructed as a double line and the existing single line from Padukka to Awissawella will be rehabilitated.
The main line from Maradana to Ragama will be upgraded to a quadruple track, the Ragama - Veyangoda line will be constructed as a triple track, and the existing double line from Veyangoda to Rabukkana will be rehabilitated.
The coastal line from Fort to Maradana will be developed to three sections and the existing double line from Pandura to Kalutara will be rehabilitated.
It is also planned to develop the Puttalam double line from Ragama to Negombo and to connect the railway line with the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayaka.
