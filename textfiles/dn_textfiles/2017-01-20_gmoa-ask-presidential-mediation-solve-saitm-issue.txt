GMOA ask for presidential mediation to solve SAITM issue

Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anurudda Padeniya said the GMOA will seek President Maithripala Sirisena involved in the SAITM Medical Faculty issue to provide an acceptable solution.
He said the GMOA Central Committee unanimously decided to send a letter to the President urging him to mediate and decide whether the SAITM is acceptable as a medical faculty.
Padeniya said the Medical Council had not yet accepted the SAITM.
It has to fulfill several criteria set by the Medical Council Act to be considered it as a medical college, Padeniya said.
The political leadership and the judiciary system should provide an acceptable and justifiable solution for the SAITM issue, he said.
