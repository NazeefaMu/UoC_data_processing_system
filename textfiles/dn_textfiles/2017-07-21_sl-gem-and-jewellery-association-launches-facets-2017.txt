SL Gem and Jewellery Association launches FACETS 2017

The Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association (SLGJA) will host the 27th edition of the FACETS International Gem and Jewelry Exhibition, from August 31 to September 3, at the BMICH.
Following its inception in 1991, FACETS has gradually grown in scale and size to become one of the most popular exhibitions of its kind in the world.
FACETS 2016 saw the introduction of the Premier Jewelery Pavilion and the Gem and Jewellery Mart, both of which received much admiration and interest from visitors, including President Maithripala Sirisena.
Sri Lanka Export Development Board, Chairperson Indira Malwatta highly commended the FACETS and said it has been able to survive all turbulent times even during the conflict period.
FACETS Sri Lanka , Chairman Mushtaq Jabir highlighted the value of conducting such an exhibition and said this globally renowned show will strengthen and promote the Sri Lankan gem and jewellery industry further. “This exhibition will also help us to increase sales of valuable local gems including Ceylon Sapphires and other gemstones as well as our own jewellery products to overseas markets."
Delegations and individual buyers from countries such as Nepal, Myanmar, Hong Kong, China, Russia and France, will feature at the exhibition, and many more individual buyers are expected to attend the event, thereby increasing international exposure for the local industry.
The exhibition also offers visitors a glimpse into the world of gem and jewellery production.
A number of stalls will feature various pieces of machinery and tools used to cut and polish gemstones and craft jewellery. There will also be a number of laboratory stalls where visitors can get a look at the process of examination that a gem is subjected to.
They can even test their own gems and receive a certificate proving the stones value and authenticity.
The FACETS organizing committee has also announced the introduction of a special app, designed specially for the exhibition.
The FACETS app will provide users with a list of the booth-holders, specific events, a layout of the booths, information about FACETS, the exhibitions rules and regulations and a list of the members of the SLGJA.
Organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association and sponsored by the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and the Export Development Board, the FACETS International Gem and Jewellery Exhibition will be held, as always, under the patronage of the President and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment.
