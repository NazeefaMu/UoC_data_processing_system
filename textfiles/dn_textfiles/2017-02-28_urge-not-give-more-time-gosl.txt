Urge not to give more time for GOSL

Eight Parliamentarians of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have written to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) chief requesting him not to give more time to the Sri Lankan Government to address the accountability issue. The TNA in the letter has said that already the UNHRC has given the government ample time to address the accountability issue and has added that giving more time will set a bad precedent. The letter has been signed by TNA Parliamentarians S. Sritharan, S.Yogeswaran, C. Nirmalan, S. Adaikalanadan, K. Kodishwaram, S. Siddharathan, S. Viyalendran and S. Anandan.
However, TNA leader R. Sampanthan and eight other MPs have not signed the letter.
