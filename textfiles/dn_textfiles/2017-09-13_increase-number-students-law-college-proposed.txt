Increase in number of students for Law College proposed

The Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office has put forward a set of proposals to increase the number of students accessing legal education.
The proposals come in the light of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) requesting that the Office look into ways to increase the number of qualified lawyers in the country.
A study into the subject conducted by the Office had shown that high cut off marks for the internal LLB degree at State universities have limited the opportunities available for legal education at the Sri Lanka Law College .
In 2016, 8,432 students have missed the opportunity to enter state universities to get their LL.B degrees due to high cut off marks. In the same year, of 5135 students applied to the Sri Lanka Law College, only 239 were selected.
The Office has proposed that strong District Bar Associations open up opportunities for practitioners to be teachers at a Law College in the district with universities nearby providing the necessary academic support. In addition they also suggested:
“Conducting of entrance examinations under the supervision of Commissioner General of Examination and Council of Legal Education, as of now, and other internal exams conducted by the Council of Legal Education, as of now, have been identified as a sensible method of quality control.
Successful students can indicate their choice of the Colombo or a district law college and will be selected on a competitive merit plus residential basis. The Law College of the Council Legal Education is a fee charging institute, and this expansion will not be a strain on the state coffers.”
Admission to the Bar would remain a matter for the Supreme Court. The Office believed that the proposals would open up opportunities for youth to access legal education.
