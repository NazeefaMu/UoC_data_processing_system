Sri Lanka Army, HRCSL to work together

The Sri Lanka Army while assuring its best cooperation to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka yesterday, said bilateral understanding and coordination would certainly enable both parties to sort out those pending issues amicably as early as possible.
The Army in a media communiqué issued by the Army Directorate of Media, said the SLA is much more contended to have been screened by HRCSL at a time when the country is expanding its participation in UN assignments.
“Sri Lanka Army, much more contented to have been screened by our own independent authority, i.e HRCSL, particularly at a time Sri Lanka is expanding its participation in UN assignments, accordingly, began submission of details of Army personnel, selected for UN missions for HRCSL’s independent vetting. In the meantime, UNDPKO in constant touch with the Sri Lanka Army, has been inquiring into reasons, attributable to delayed dispatches of Sri Lankan troops for scheduled rotational releases as agreed upon,” the statement said.
Full statement:
Bilateral Cooperation with HRCSL would Resolve Pending Screening Issues of UN Peace Keepers Sri Lanka as one of the Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) to the United Nations (UN) since the year 2004, has been in the practice of sending her troops for UN Peace Keeping assignments in large groups in close collaboration with the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO).
To be in line with the UN Secretary General’s decision No. 2012/18 on 11 December, 2012 in relation to ‘screening of UN personnel for Human Rights,’ the Sri Lanka Army, consequent to discussions with the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNDPKO and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), resolved that an own national mechanism be followed with respect to independent screening of personnel through the HRCSL.
Accordingly, this national process of screening which needs the fullest cooperation of both the HRCSL and the Armed Forces for vetting its UN bound own members, came into effect early this year, although previous such clearance procedures were executed by authorities in the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The Sri Lanka Army, is much more contented to have been screened by our own independent authority, i.e HRCSL, particularly at a time when Sri Lanka is expanding its participation in UN assignments, accordingly began submission of details of Army personnel selected for UN missions for HRCSL’s independent vetting. In the meantime, UNDPKO in constant touch with the Sri Lanka Army, has been inquiring into reasons attributable to delayed dispatches of Sri Lankan troops for scheduled rotational releases as agreed upon.
A round table conference to this effect was attended by the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chairperson and Commissioners of the HRCSL, visiting UNDPKO officials of the UN, New York, Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force Chief of Staff, Director General of the Directorate of Army Overseas Operations, STF officers and Ministry of Defence officials took place as recent as on Thursday (21) in Colombo. The Sri Lanka Army would always cooperate with the HRCSL for clearance of this backlog since information that had been produced by the Army for screening in some cases, could also contain shortcomings, complications, discrepancies due to operational commitments, change of residential addresses, etc.
The Sri Lanka Army while assuring its best cooperation all the time to the HRCSL for the implementation of its mandate, expects this bilateral understanding and coordination would certainly enable both parties to sort out those pending issues amicably as early as possible.
At present, Sri Lankan troops, the majority being from the Sri Lanka Army, have been deployed in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as Military observers, Liaison officers, Staff officers, Staff officer assistants or General Contingent troops for peace keeping. To-date a total of 450 Sri Lankan peace keepers are serving 7 UN peace keeping overseas missions under the UNDPKO.
