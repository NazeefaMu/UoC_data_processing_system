Dream Cricket Day - memorable event for 89 Differently abled Kids

 
The Rotaract Dream Cricket Committee (RDCC) announced the successful conclusion of Dream Cricket Day 2016 (Second Edition) at the Stanley Jansz Playground, Perahera Mawatha on Saturday.
Dream Cricket Day 2016 (Second Edition) for 89 differently abled children was organized by five Rotaract Clubs sponsored by the Rotary Club of Colombo West: Rotaract Clubs of Alumni of University of Moratuwa, American National College (ANC), Colombo West, National School of Business Management (NSBM), and University of Moratuwa.
Dream Cricket Day (DCD) is a fun event for differently abled children to experience the excitement of different aspects of the game of cricket: batting, bowling, catching and throwing. DCD is aimed at providing differently abled children with a fun experience that would boost their self-confidence and self-worth.
Founded and supported by Dream Cricket Australia, Dream Cricket was introduced to Sri Lanka in 2012 by the Rotary Club Colombo West (RCCW), in partnership with the Sir Donald Bradman Foundation and the Movement Disorder Foundation in Australia. Up to date, RCCW hasheld a total of 9 Dream Cricket Days across Sri Lanka.
Eighty-nine differently abled children from five different homesparticipated in this time’s DCD: Chitra Lane School for the Special Child, Camilla School, Madiwela Home, Rehabilitation Centre for the Communication Impaired (RCCI), and Merill J. Fernando Charitable Foundation.
Their teachers, care givers and parents, who were pleased to watch the young ones in action, accompanied them. Following a morning snack, the children were divided into 8 teams and theytook part in 5 activities that improved different cricketing skills like batting, bowling, catching and throwing. The children used cricket equipment especially designed for differently able kids.
The 8 teams rotated among the different activities every 15 minutes to experience the various components of the game of cricket.
After lunch, the children took part in the awards ceremony, each one receiving a gold medal. The children accepted their gold medals with immense excitement, happiness, and gratitude.
Some even ran, leapt, and danced in joy when they received their medal. The awards ceremony was followed by baila music for dancing: needless to say, the children took to dancing insheer glee.
Rtn Jit Seneviratne, president of the Rotary Club of Colombo West was the chief guest.
