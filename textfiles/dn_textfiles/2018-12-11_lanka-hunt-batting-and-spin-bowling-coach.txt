Lanka on hunt for batting and spin bowling coach

Sri Lanka are on the hunt for a batting coach and at the moment negotiations are taking place to have someone appointed probably ahead of the tour to Australia next month.
It is reliably learnt that ex-Durham opening batsman Jon Lewis who quit as head coach of Durham on December 7 is one of them.
Presently former Sri Lanka batsman Thilan Samaraweera is the national team’s batting coach that is currently touring New Zealand.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka is also looking for a spin bowling coach to work with spinners at the High Performance Centre (HPC) and the name of former England off-spinner Gareth Batty has been mentioned as one of the candidates.
At present former Sri Lanka spinner Piyal Hewage is the spin bowling coach at the HPC.
Last Saturday Sri Lanka Cricket announced that former Australian wicket-keeper/batsman Steve Rixon would take over as fielding coach of the national team replacing Manoj Abeywickrama who has been drafted into the HPC.
Rixon who is contracted till the end of the 2019 World Cup in June is expected to join the national team in New Zealand on December 24.
