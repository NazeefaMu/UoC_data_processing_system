Akkaraipattu residents plead for road rehabilitation

The Akkaraipattu Fiscal concrete road is in a dilapidated condition.
Students travelling to the Akkaraipattu Muslim Central College (National School), Ayesha Muslim Ladies College, Munawwara Junior College, Akkaraipattu Government Boys Vidyalaya and Hijra Vidyalaya undergo much difficulties due to the bad condition of the road, which is the only road leading to the schools.
Residents have brought the issue to authorities several times, but no action was taken to date to repair the road, they said.
