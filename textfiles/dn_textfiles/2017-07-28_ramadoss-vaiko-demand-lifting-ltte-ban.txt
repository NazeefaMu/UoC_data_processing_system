Vaiko described the verdict as a turning point in the history of Tamil Eelam and said it would open the gates for demanding justice for Lankan Tamils in United Nations Human Rights Council and general assembly.
It gives hope that those who indulged in 'genocide of Tamils' could be brought to book and a referendum for Tamil Eelam could be held.
Sri Lankan government was unable to show that LTTE indulged in terrorist activities after 2009, Vaiko added.
Expressing happiness over the judgment,VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said inclusion of LTTE in the list of banned organizations was a set back to the Tigers.
Tamils throughout the world were unable to mobilise funds and people support for the LTTE after the ban.
Describing the Tamil Eelam liberation struggle as a fight for freedom of a nationality.
