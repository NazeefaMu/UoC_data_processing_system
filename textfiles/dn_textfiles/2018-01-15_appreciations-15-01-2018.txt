[APPRECIATIONS - (15-01-2018)]

Sita Perera
Dedicated music teacher
Music teachers always hold a special place in every student's heart. Sita, you were the most dedicated music teacher I had in my life, and I want to thank you for all your patient efforts and persevering ways in teaching me how to sing and play the piano for nine long years.
As you left us last April, after more than three score and ten years of life, I have to thank you for helping me get through up to my grade four exams. Not only were you a teacher, but you acted like my grandmother and advisor whenever I required it.
You were a teacher I will never forget, who gave me wings and made me believe in myself.
You showed me right from wrong and was always there beside me giving confidence, pushing me to my limits to make me what I am today. I am deeply touched by your efforts.
If I played a passage incorrectly, you never hesitated me to tell to play it over and over again, “once more,” until I met your expectations. Not only did you teach me the art of music, but you also empathized with children, respected them and believed that each one of them had something special that could be built on. From grade three to 11, when I walked through your door, you were my pillar of success. When my exams were drawing near, all those extra classes and tiring days of teaching will always be engraved in my heart.
Sita, you were the best example of how to stay positive in all situations, and taught me that there is always room for improvement. You taught a skill that can stimulate the entire mind.
With your faith in God, you continued teaching to the very end, until you suddenly left us. If I do not thank you, I will bear guilt for not telling others about a person who changed me.
As you left us on April 13th, last year, I felta loss at your parting. I will always take with me the lessons you imparted on me, especially the way you taught. Not just to listen to, but to experience music myself.
May your soul rest in peace in the arms of Jesus.
