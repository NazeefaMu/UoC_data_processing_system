Aquatic acquaintances

Water bodies combined with plants not only make your garden attractive, they actually are an oasis in the middle of Colombo. Your own oasis in the very heart of Colombo. A place where you feel relaxed and at ease. Garden Talk speaks to Director of Deputy Provincial Agriculture Office Rathmalana, District Agriculture Instructor G.D. Udaya Kumara on Aquatic Plants
"Water plants can be divided into three. One is edible water plants for food, the other is water plant with medicinal value. Then there is the third category which is foliage water plants for attraction and beauty. Today we will examine Aquatic Foliage Plants maintained for attraction," said Udaya Kumara.
We see Aquatic Foliage plants mainly in large or small glass fish tanks. Here we create an entire environment in the water. A marine eco system on a small or large scale. We can maintain these tanks in our gardens out in the open, in a landscaping way, even creating a bed of sand at the bottom of the water tank. You can create a lovely environment in the tank.

"Like foliage plants used in gardens for attraction, these aquatic foliage plants are maintained in water tanks for attraction. Normally the tanks contain fish, which goes well with these plants. The fish also eat these foliage plants. Because it is their environment," stated Udaya Kumara.
The plants can be specially selected according to variety and design, and these are maintained in these tanks. Even in these Aquatic foliage plants there are categories -
Floating aquatic water plants- the plant and its roots floating above the water surface. (Not connected to the sand)
A variety where half of the plant is submerged under the water and the rest is above the water. The roots are under the sand.
The other grows completely beneath (the plant and the roots are all below) the water surface, but sometimes the flower may appear above.
"There is of course a sand medium in the tanks. We can plant these plants in pots and lower them to the bottom of the tank and then nicely apply a level of sand or pebbles over the pots that have been lowered to the bottom of the tanks, so then only the plant can be seen. Then we can fill the tank with water. Or we can keep them as pots below the tank. But if you apply the sand and pebbles the quality is more. The tank can be designed this way," added Udaya Kumara
These aquatic foliage plants are exported from Sri Lanka to European countries.
"However these pots need to be changed. After some time a new pot needs to be used with the old one being taken out. This is because the root system of the plant becoming too large. And naturally these foliage plants (in the natural environment) grow large. And once these foliage plants grow too big, they lose that beauty, and so a new one has to be introduced with the old one being taken out. Also it is a small space in the tank and the medium is also small," explained Udaya Kumara.
Importing from Bangkok
We do import aquatic foliage plants because the plants - Nelum and Olu that we have in Sri Lanka cannot be used for our small tanks. This is because they have not been modified. But from Bangkok we import aquatic plants that bear small flowers. These can be accommodated in our small tanks. So in Sri Lanka there is a market for this. These too have their smell and color.
"In our country we have aquatic water plants, but in order to bear flowers they have to grow big. These plants grow in our lakes. In our small tanks we are not able to grow them because we cannot give them that environment. If we grow them in our tanks the flowers will not bloom. The environment in our small tanks is inadequate. There is no space for the plant to grow. That is why we import small aquatic plants from Bangkok. For our Sri Lankan plants to bear Olu and Nelum they have to grow big. The soil medium in our tanks is inadequate and there is no space in our small tanks. The plant is not successful. We cannot duplicate the natural environment in this small tank. Because in the natural environment there is ample space and there is seed propagation after maturity. In the natural environment there is so much space for the plant to expand. None of this is possible in a small tank. There is no proper growth and thus no maturity. The types we import from Bangkok are smaller plants that have no problem reaching maturity in small spaces. Because these are improved varieties," Udaya Kumara gave a detailed explanation.
But what we import from Bangkok can grow in small spaces. But if we are creating a bigger pond in our home garden, then maybe our local varieties can work. We have beautiful foliage plants, and they can be grown in larger water bodies.
"Also in aquatic foliage plants, there are those that are admired for their beautiful flowers and leaves. When it comes to Nelum, Manel and Olu, the flower has value - its color and smell, and then there are plants with beautiful leaves - the shape, pattern and color," pointed out Udaya Kumara
"Sometimes we use the tissue cultivation technique. Because it is illegal for us to take plants from their natural environment and export them.
Because we are losing out on our natural heritage. So we use tissue cultivation technique to grow flowers and then we import them. This is because every week we need to send a new batch. Because this is now an industry," he noted finally.
