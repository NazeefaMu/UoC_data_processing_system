Driver posted to school with no vehicle

A driver at the Naula Sri Naga National School has been drawing his salary for the last one and half years even though he does not have any work to do since the school has no vehicle.
The issue has caused consternation among some members of the School Development Society. They allege that the school is already having 15 non-academic staff in excess.
Principal Tudor Perera confirmed that his school has a driver idling since he cannot be assigned with other duties. The principal had informed the Zonal Education Office about it.
The Principal said the driver was a resident of Kurunegala. “He comes to work by bus and signs the register and goes back home in the evening,” he said.
