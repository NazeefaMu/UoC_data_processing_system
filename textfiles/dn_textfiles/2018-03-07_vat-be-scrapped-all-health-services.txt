VAT to be scrapped on all health services

A Cabinet Paper will be presented in order to exempt all health services from Value Added Tax (VAT), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
Minister Senaratne had instructed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe on March 5, to prepare the relevant Cabinet Paper soon to present it to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Minister Senaratne had taken a decision to exempt all health services from VAT after considering the numerous
hardships the public have to undergo due to VAT being added to their hospital bills when obtaining various services from private hospitals.
Several Patients’ Organizations and Private Hospitals’ organisations had pointed out this issue to the minister.
