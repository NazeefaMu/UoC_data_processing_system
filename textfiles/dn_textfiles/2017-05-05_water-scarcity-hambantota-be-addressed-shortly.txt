Water scarcity in Hambantota to be addressed shortly

The Gin ganga and the Nilwala ganga will be diverted to Hambantota as a solution for the water scarcity in the Hambantota district. A feasibility report on the project has been nearly completed, Weeraketiya Irrigation Engineer K.N.S.Kumara said. The project was to be implemented several years ago but protests from several quarters in the Matara district delayed it, he said.
