Navy’s proud moment

The Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) entered a new era last week with the commissioning of the first of two Indian-built Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessels (AOPVs) by Commander-in-Chief President Maithripala Sirisena in the presence of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne. This event signals SLN’s entry to the elite club of deepwater navies.
Named SLNS Sayurala (Pennant Number P623), the 105.7 m long vessel is the largest ship to be operated by the SLN. It was handed over to the SLN on July 22 by India’s Goa Shipyard Limited. The second vessel (P624) is expected to be named SLNS Sindurala once it enters service in 2018.
The vessels have a top speed of 24 Knots, feature a full-load displacement of 2,350 tonnes, an overall beam of 13.6 m, and a hull draught of 3.6 m, according to Jane’s Fighting Ships. The new ship has a travel range of 7,000 nautical miles and has a landing facility and hangar for an Advanced Light Helicopter. The new vessel can accommodate a crew of 18 officers and 100 sailors. The vessel is powered by two MTU 20V 8000 M71 diesel engines driving two controllable-pitch propellers.
The Sri Lanka Navy played a major role in the military defeat of the LTTE and hundreds of sailors made the Supreme Sacrifice in defence of the Nation. The Navy aborted many Sea Tiger attacks aimed at crippling the Security Forces’ naval capability. We must not forget the Navy’s role in logistical support, troop transport and casualty evacuation in the theatre of war. Despite certain limitations of vessels available at the time, the Navy successfully engaged several LTTE vessels in the deep sea, which marked a turning point in the war against terror. The Navy successfully ventured into Asymmetrical Naval Warfare with amphibious landings and land-based operations. The heroic exploits of its Special Boat Squadron (SBS) are already legendary.
We are no longer a nation at war, but this does not mean that the Navy can lower its guard even for a moment. As one threat has receded, others have taken its place. Terrorism has taken on a global dimension, with other challenges such as human smuggling, human trafficking, narcotics and gun running and sea piracy becoming more prevalent. Hence the Navy’s newest vessel will see plenty of action on the high seas. Sri Lanka does have a nascent Coastguard spun off from the Navy itself, but the Navy which has better and bigger resources will still keep defending our International Maritime Boundary Line and other sea borders.
The SLNS ‘Sayurala’ is thus expected to conduct patrols, policing, reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and pollution control missions in Sri Lanka’s territorial waters. It can also be used for external fire-fighting missions. The Navy will seek and receive the support of the Army and the Air Force should the need arise in any situation. The Navy even had to engage in an unusual mission recently to rescue three elephants washed out to sea.
The Navy has also been able to earn millions of dollars for the State by again conducting anti-piracy sea patrols which were given over to a private company by the previous regime. The new vessels will hopefully play a bigger role in operations like these. The Navy is also partly responsible for the security of commercial ports around the island, along with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. This role came under the spotlight recently when the Government reassured that in spite of the agreement with a Chinese company for operations at the Hambantota Port, the Navy will completely be in charge of security at the Port with no foreign military activity allowed.
The Navy also deserves praise for the ingenuity of its engineers who have not only made improvements to its vessels and operating systems, but also produced useful inventions in other spheres. The Navy has produced Infusion systems vital for Thalassemia patients for the removal of excessive iron deposits gathered in vital organs due to frequent blood transfusions. The equipment which costs around Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 150,000 in the open market is produced by the Navy at a cost of just Rs. 5,500. It is also active in what the private sector calls “Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR). The Navy’s public welfare initiative in installing Reverse Osmosis (RO) water treatment plants in areas prone to kidney disease has provided easy access to safe drinking water to over 115,925 families and 81,316 schoolchildren. So far the Navy has produced and installed 242 RO plants across the island since December 2015.
The roots of the Navy, which celebrates its 67th anniversary as a Regular Force in December this year, actually go back 80 years to 1937, when the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force was established. With an eye on the next 80 years, the Navy’s operational and manpower capabilities should be strengthened to meet current and future threats to our maritime borders. The welcome addition of several large vessels to the Navy will no doubt help it immensely to fulfill this avowed mission.
