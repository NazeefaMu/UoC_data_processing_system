Compensation for Britisher deported over Buddha tattoo

The Supreme Court yesterday awarded compensation and costs amounting to Rs.800,000 to the British tourist, who was arrested, detained and deported for allegedly displaying a Buddha tattoo.
The Supreme Court ruled that the Katunayake Police have violated the fundamental rights of a British tourist when she was arrested, detained and deported for displaying a Buddha tattoo on her upper limb at the Katunayake airport in 2014.
The Supreme Court ordered the State to pay Rs.500,000 to the British tourist as compensation for violating her Fundamental Rights.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera further ordered the state to pay the petitioner’s costs in a sum of Rs. 200,000.
Police Sergeant Upasena and Police Inspector Suraweera of Katunayake police station were also ordered to pay Rs.50,000 each as compensation to the petitioner. In her petition, the British tourist Naomi Coleman had sought a compensation from the respondents and further sought a declaration that her detention was null and void and contrary to Articles 13(2) and 12 (1) of the constitution.
“In the ‘B’ Report itself it is stated that the Petitioner had no intention to outrage such feelings. A charge relating to Section 291 B of the Penal Code cannot be maintained i.e “outraging the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs”. There is no acceptable evidence placed before this court that there was a possibility of public outcry, though the police attempt to say so in their statements recorded. I agree with the Petitioner’s learned President’s Counsel that “surmises will not suffice”. As stated above bona fides or mala fides of the arresting officer is irrelevant in deciding whether Article 13(1) has been violated,’ Justice Anil Goonaratne observed.
Petitioner Naomi Coleman (37), a nurse by profession at the Hawkesbury Lodge, Rehabilitation Mental Health Services filed this petition through President’s Counse J.C. Weliamuna and Pulasthi Hewamanne and Thishya Weragoda on the instructions of counsel Vishwa De Livera Tennakoon on “Pro Bono”.
In her petition, she had cited the Attorney General, Police Sergeant and OIC of Katunayake police station, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Inspector General of Police and OIC of Negombo Prison as respondents. The petitioner stated that she is a devout practicing Buddhist, who has attended meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India. She stated that as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teachings, displaying a tattoo of the likeness of Lord Buddha seated on a lotus flower on her upper right arm; accordingly she is aware that there are many followers of the Buddhist path who display such tattoos as a mark of respect and reverence to their religious leader. She further stated that she visited Sri Lanka on two occasions and possessed the same tattoo and had no hindrance in displaying the said tattoo on those occasions. The petitioner stated that she arrived at the Katunayake International Airport on April 21, 2014 around 5.00 a.m. She stated that an individual purporting to be a Civil Defence Officer initially informed her that her tattoo was unacceptable and further asked her to the nearest police station. She said she was deprived of her liberty to continue with her travel in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that on April 21 at around 10.30 am she was taken to the Negombo Magistrate’s Court and detained behind bars with several other female suspects. She stated that she was detained at the prison transfered to the detention centre. She said she was detained for two nights at the Mirihana immigration detention camp. She further stated that she was escorted to the Airport by officers of the Immigration Department and her thumbprint was obtained. The petitioner stated that she met her friend at the airport and she was checked into the business class, whereas her friend checked into the economy class of Sri Lanka Airlines flight to London. She said her passport was kept in the custody of a member of the cabin crew of the said flight during the entirety of the flight and returned to the petition upon landing in the United Kingdom. She further stated that the unlawful detention has been based on order made by the Magistrate who had made such order without any jurisdiction whatsoever and without fair inquiry.
J.C. Weliamuna PC appeared for the British tourist while Deputy Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe appeared for the Attorney General.
