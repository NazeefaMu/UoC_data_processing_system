Customs nab Brazilian cocaine smuggler

A 35-year-old Brazilian was taken into custody at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Friday for attempting to smuggle cocaine valued at Rs.10 million into the country.
Customs officials interrogated the suspect and found out that he had swallowed condoms filled with cocaine, Customs Media Spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said.
He was later examined at the Negombo General Hospital where medical officers had confirmed that the suspect had swallowed capsules of cocaine.
The Customs officers had recovered 600 grams of cocaine from the suspect, according to Jayaratne.
Investigations are continuing.
