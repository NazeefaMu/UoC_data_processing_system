Arimac Digital shines at Infotel Awards

Sri Lanka’s digital disruptor, Arimac Digital, won two awards at the recently concluded INFOTEL Awards Night 2018. The event was organized by the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) to appreciate torchbearers of digital innovations in the country. The full-service software development company—web enterprise mobility solutions, gaming and creative development studio, immersive technologies, artificial intelligence and robotics and automation—bagged the “Most Creative Stall” from a list of over 250 participants at the ICT exhibition and was adjudged the “Overall Winner”.
The Arimac stall, conceptualized on the guidance of Chamira Prasad Jayasinghe, focused mainly on IMI Games—Sri Lanka’s first and only cross-platform gaming portal—and was manned by software developers and creative specialists who were drawn from the Gaming and Creative studios at Arimac Digital.
INFOTEL has been the premier ICT exhibition for more than two decades and has contributed immensely towards the growth in the usage of Information Technology by Government, Businesses and Consumers in Sri Lanka. The exhibition was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) from 2 to 4 November 2018 and was widely patronized by the ICT community of Sri Lanka.
