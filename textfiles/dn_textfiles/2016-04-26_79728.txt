Cinderella : New magic in old fairytale

You know this tale by heart now. ‘Cinderella’, the evergreen fairytale has been one of the most popular stories that have been brought again and again onto the screen throughout the years.
In Disney’s latest 2015 version we meet the age old princess with a modern twist. When 10-year-old Ella sits on her mother's deathbed, she gets a bit of advice about how to live life: “Have courage, and be kind.” This is the theme which runs through Kenneth Branagh's ‘Cinderella’.
Cate Blanchett plays the evil stepmother with Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as the evil stepsisters
The gowns are vibrant in color and the set design is packed with detail. Symbolism is aptly used in ‘Cinderella’. Years after her mother's death, when Ella learns of her father's death during a business trip, and is quickly isolated by her stepmother, along with Drisella and Anastasia, the stepsisters who nickname her “Cinderella”, she is shown standing against an open doorway clutching a tree branch, a sentimental gift from her father. Branagh lights the scene between the gray, dimming glow of the outer world and the dark chamber lighting of the home now ruled over by her stepmother. As a grief stricken Cinderella stares out, the viewers are struck by the reality of the episode: whatever horrors the future holds, the home also houses memories of her loving family which the world at large simply cannot. This is a rare scene which captures the essence of the moment beautifully.
Familiar points
One of the drawbacks of the movie is that it could have been presented more artistically. Familiar points in the tale such as the prince’s impending ascension to the throne seem to overshadow any other lively discussions which the characters could have had.
Another noticeable point is that too much action seems to be crammed into some scenes. This is especially evident in the episode in which Cinderella encounter her fairy godmother. The transformation process is rushed through so aggressively that the fairy godmother hardly lingers in the viewers mind after the sequence comes to an end.
Genuine complexity
Though many artistes like Lily James, Richard Madden, Holliday Grainger, Sophie McShera, Ben Chaplin, Hayley Atwell, Nonso Anozie, Helena Bonham Carter, Stellan Skarsgård, and Derek Jacobi have taken part in the film, it is mainly Cate Blanchett who stands out though she plays the evil character. Her character registers genuine complexity, conjuring years of heartbreak, violent jealousy, and calcified empathy. She's the only character that offers a convincing counterpoint to the overtly romanticized nostalgia in the script.
This might not be Disney’s best movie yet but it certainly keeps the audience entertained. Well told and beautifully presented ‘Cinderella’ is for all those who nurture a wish, aspiring to become a princess.
