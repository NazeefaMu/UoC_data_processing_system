The wonder world of books

Our eyes are upon a printed page. We have perhaps had the same experiences so often that we do not stop to think about it. A newspaper or a magazine is delivered at our door for a sum of money paid.
We can buy a book or a magazine or one of the masterpieces of the world for a certain amount of money either affordable or unaffordable depending on the earning capacity. But we can go to the library and get the same free of charge on becoming a member.
But do we really know how we have reached this standpoint in our lives?
The growth of the printed work that comes in the form of a book has come a long way. Why do we call a printed work a book? According to a number of sources there had been an old English word that goes as 'buk' which changed later into 'buoh'. Quite a number of historical events are encircled in the development of the book. To denote something ought to be preserved it came to be termed as 'book'. From this comes the term 'bookie'.
Later on the erudite masses denoted the book as a set of written, printed or blank sheets bound together into a volume. The book thus created later came to be known as a long written or printed literary work. The stage players of England and America denoted the script they used for their performances and in rehearsals as a book which eventually paved the way for the use of the term 'handbook'. The book that is held in hand to get information was known as a handbook.
With the growth of the massive libraries around the world the use of the book and the concepts behind it gave way to numerous other allied references. Book clubs have been organised both in the UK and USA in 1905. But long before this, lovers of books have been termed as 'bookish', 'book worms' and 'bookmen'.
The Book of Prayers has come to use from 1549. The sacred books have been preserved in special places under the guidance of scholarly clergy, both in the Orient and Occident. The sacred books were listed by scholars in both sectors. One of the leading collectors of sacred books of the Orient happened to be the great scholar Max Muller, who knew several oriental languages.
He is credited to be the pioneer translator of the sacred Buddhist book Dhammapada into German as the UNESCO McBride report known as 'Many Voices One World' points out that civilizations have sprung up in keeping with the information that was stored in textual forms in such civilizations as the Chinese, the Indian, the Egyptian or the Greco or Roman, the invaluable repository of thought and knowledge was the book which provided a means of collating a considerable store of information in a small space and in durable form.
The first important advance in the growth of the book and the growth of writing various types of books came with the discovery of papyrus which eventually led to the invention of the paper. This happened to be a material that superseded the older forms of writing on parchment. Paper came to be used in China in the first century AD, in the Arab world in the eighth century, and in Europe in the 14th century.
From this point onwards, the term 'press' had been used for printing purposes. Although the book had come a long way as a result of the printing process, the actual story of the book lay in the world of religious communication. The paper books consisted of bound pages used by clergy and those who followed them in religious audiences and other religious gatherings. The scrolls that were in use gradually went out of circulation with the advent of printing prayer books and other religious documents. It is believed that the great speakers or the oral communicators like storytellers and thinkers may have given way to record their respective messages later.
One widely known event is the recording of what Socrates said as written down by Plato, his pupil. Then the pupil of Plato, known as Aristotle, is known to have prepared most of his lessons on paper which later appeared as books. His well known work 'ethics' consists of ten books each written by him as lessons prepared for his pupils of Lyceum. Most of what we now read of Aristotle has come as documents left incomplete or found as fragments of longer versions.
Certain influential books gradually became the shared intellectual equipment of many who had a certain degree of erudition as gained from schools of learning. This was a stimulus for literacy which in certain countries happened to be very high and in some others quite low. The books have played a vital role in this direction. The books have to be distributed widely in keeping with the needs became a single voice that reached the masses via schools of learning.
Libraries have to be built or updated in order to meet the demand of the readership. The use of a book became gradually transferring into a day to day commodity. This happened as a result of the book production technology on the part of book publishers.
The general masses had to purchase books as their private possessions. This enabled the building of private home libraries. With the rise of school libraries and university libraries, the book production gradually expanded its horizons. More and more books had to be selected and published.
Book production companies flourished with the opening of bookshops. One such example comes from the pioneer British book publisher Allen Lane who had a plan to invite a wide gamut of writers to bring out various forms of manuscripts that would eventually be printed simultaneously. He too had a plan to simplify some of the more serious works to be used in the schools. This type of books which emerged into the book scene was known as AL Bright Story Readers.
With the expansion of the Commonwealth of Nations, colonial education schemes, the English reading habit too became a significant factor in the growth of a new readership of English books globally. This in turn enveloped works as translated from other languages. This was also observed as a joined effort where an original work was translated by two individuals instead of a single translator. One example is the pioneer collection of Russian short stories as translated from the original works into English by Kotelienski and D H Lawrence. Most of the books originally written by the French writer Andre Gide and Albert Camus came to be translated into English in the same manner.
The brand name Penguin books came to be more known when the book production was at a growing stage. Since the post Second World War situation, 'little book' or the 'pocket book' concept came to be used. More and more people wanted books to be read with ease. The reading patterns are changing. This gave way to a massive book publishing industry with varying types of published works, which in turn needed regulatory measures, a subject that has come to be widely discussed today. The children and juvenile all round the world need books of varying types is the clamour of the parents and teachers. This has to be addressed with care and creative intelligence.
When all these are laid down, as random thoughts I feel the world of books as an unfathomable wonder world. ([email protected])
