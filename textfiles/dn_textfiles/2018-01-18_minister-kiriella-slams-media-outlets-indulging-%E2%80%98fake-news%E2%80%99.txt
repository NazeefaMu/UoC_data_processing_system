Minister Kiriella slams media outlets indulging in ‘fake news’

‘’Certain media institutions were fabricating fake news and misleading the people,’’ said Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella, at the ceremony to vest the Polgahawela flyover with the people, yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the Minister said US President Trump could win the election despite false propaganda by 99 percent of the American media. But Donald Trump explained the false propaganda by the media using the term ‘fake news’ and he won the election.
He further said that certain media outlets ought to function within limits and should not unduly cross that line. The people will teach some media outlets a lesson on February 10 at the local government elections.
Minister Kiriella further said that he had commenced three flyovers in Rajagiriya, Ganemulla and Polgahawela in 2016 as Minister of Highways. These flyovers were given to these areas after careful study. Although some ministers prefer to give development projects such as flyovers to their own electorates, as a minister he allocated such projects to the areas which badly needed these projects. Polgahawela needed a flyover long ago and the present government fulfilled that requirement.
“We may get assistance to construct another ten flyovers from the government of Spain this year,” Minister Kiriella said. “Government hopes to construct a flyover at Yangalmodera where there was a serious accident recently. Every district will have a 75 km carpet road.”
Referring to the local government elections, the Minister said that President and Prime Minister had decided to allocate more funds for development projects in local government authorities. The present government will continue definitely till 2020 and government needed fullest support from the people.
Ministers and MPs of the area were also present.
