Through the trammels of life : Aspirations reached against all odds

Eighty-year-old Kiyoko Ogawa was born in a small town in Japan known as Niigata, a town so obscure that it was only known to the world after the Tsunami in 2011. Her life too though persevering, would have been lived unnoticed if not for a chance acquaintance in 1994 which introduced her to an education system in an island nation which was not delivering equally to all its citizens.
Ogawa has visited Sri Lanka 42 times, more frequently than she has visited Niigata and in 2000, she used her savings to set up the Madam Kiyoko Ogawa Scholarship Fund. Initially set up with Rs. 6 million or 10,000 Yen, it awards bright, underprivileged students in their A/L classes a sum of Rs. 2,000 per month (for 24 months) to complete their schooling.
Since 2000, 382 students have benefitted from the fund.
The fund also has a strict selection criteria such as; applications must be called through the principals of the schools and the zonal director of education and followed by recommendation by the Grama Niladhari. Students who have obtained the highest marks at their O/L exams, students who have lost both or one of their parents, the number of school-attending siblings and students who have achieved reasonable results and their parents having no employment are also criteria for selection.
Growing up
To understand why an 80-year-old Japanese woman would take such interest in Sri Lanka, one must first know the story of how her life came to be. Born in 1938 to a family of eight children, she was the 6th among her siblings. Her father, a rice farmer, worked in an agricultural cooperative and often had to struggle to make ends meet with his large family.
Life was hard growing up. My mother was similar to Oshin, she said, evoking the famed Japanese television character who battled all odds to become successful.
“My older sisters got married early and they brought their husbands too to live with us as it was our tradition. And though my family was big, we did not stay together for long, with time, each of them moved out in search of work in factories. My older siblings only completed schooling up to grade 6,” recalled Ogawa.
They went to work in factories in the Kansai region, 600 km away from home.
With the end of the second World War, the Japanese government determined to rebuild the country, made schooling compulsory for all and this allowed Ogawa, unlike her siblings, to complete her education until Grade 9, before she had to go look for work in a factory. At 15, she started working at a thread manufacturing factory.
Two years later, she received a telegram from home asking her to return; her parents needed her help. She dutifully returned, but soon got bored and hated staying at home; so six months later, she once again packed her bags and left, this time to the big city, Tokyo.
“I had no money in hand, just what I had borrowed for my eight-hour trip. And I left with just the clothes on my back,” she said, having left on the premise that a job had been arranged for her there as a maid.
In Tokyo, she looked after three young children for a salary of 1,000 Yen a month in 1955. The average salary of an office worker was 13,800 Yen per month.
But since my food and lodging was covered and they gave me clothes twice a year, I saved up all my salary, explained Ogawa.
“At this time, I also figured that I was not too pretty and that I would probably not be able to get married. I could not go back home, so I decided to concentrate on work. I wanted to be a professional, so I looked for a job as a trainee in a factory.”
But as fate would have it, she found work as a trainee at a tailor shop. So she made up her mind to learn to make clothes, which she did for four years. In the meantime, she also worked part-time as a dishwasher in a café to earn extra. Her goal was to save up enough to be able to afford her own apartment.
Japan, however, was a very traditional society at the time and a woman living on her own was frowned upon. Her friends and family discouraged her from moving out on her own and a distant relative suggested that she come work for him in his dispensary and she could live with them too.
And so she switched careers once again to nursing, attending nursing school from 6-9 pm every night while working in the dispensary during the day.
“By then, I was able to earn a salary of 8,000 yen per month there,” she said.
It was there, at the age of 27, that she met the man she would later marry. He was a contractor and with the boom in the Japanese construction industry, he had managed to do well for himself.
Fortunes change
“He told me that I did not need to work anymore and that he could afford to look after both us. He also said that he did not want anything from me. So I agreed to marry him and move in with his family, unlike my other siblings,” she said.
Her husband, however, had two younger siblings at home and his mother, a single parent, worked, so she found that once again she was called onto to babysit.
“It was then that I realized that if you don’t study, life is going to be very hard for you. It was as if I had been put into the role of a maid rather than a wife,” recalled Ogawa.
Three years later, she gave birth to a son, but when their son was 12 years old, her husband was diagnosed with cancer.
“For five years he struggled with the disease and at 48, he passed away.”
Cancer ran in his family and within the year, his sister and younger brother too died of it.
The deaths devastated her mother-in-law and made her mentally unstable. She too then died eight years later.
The sudden death of her husband, however, resulted in his life insurance paying her a premium three times that which was originally agreed to. And his company looked after her son’s education. Thus, at 56, she found that she had very little to do in life and with no one to do it with.
It is then that she saw an advertisement in the paper, asking if anyone wanted to donate their old spectacle frames to people in Sri Lanka. It was an advert by Haruo Kumagai who was working with a Sri Lankan Student Association at the Keio University. She met him and offered to become a volunteer in his venture.
Coming to Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka Students Association had also started a scholarship programme together with the Japan Association for Sri Lanka Friendship (JASP) to help underprivileged Sri Lankan A/L students in 1994.
Former Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education and current senior advisor at the Ministry of Social Welfare and Empowerment, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawarathne was a student at the University at the time and said they initially started off with giving Rs. 1,000 per month for the two-year period for 60 scholarships a year. Dr. Nawarathne, who has built a close relationship with Ogawa over the years, has been a strong influence in her work in Sri Lanka.
“There are many bright students suffering from economic hardships. At the time, there was no fund; we would send money whenever we raise some to the bank accounts of students. But now, we have a steady fund,” said Dr. Nawarathne.
Ogawa’s fund thus has helped the scholarship programme going in a more systematic manner,
“In Japan, you have no such social system to assist people in need. Everyone has to work. I have little wants and my husband’s insurance money has been more than sufficient. so I donated half of it to the fund,” added Ogawa, who has been the key player in the programme since the death of Kumagai to cancer.
It was she who negotiated to set up a separate fund in 1999 with the assistance of the Japan Sri Lanka Technical Cooperation Association (JASTICA) and donated 10,000 Yen for it.
“I had planned to spend retirement with my husband, but I cannot do that now, so I want this money to help children who can study and be prosperous,” she said.
She believed that education was the only way for one to realize their dreams and her dream was to make their dreams a reality.
“I want to do the little help I can to help these kids, if they in turn contribute to their society and country, I will be happy,” she said.
I feel that my hometown is here, not there, said Ogawa, as she lived mostly on her own in Japan. Her family lived too far to visit frequently, but in Sri Lanka, she has found a new kind of family and home.
The difference between Japan and Sri Lanka is that in Sri Lanka, people are grateful for even the little assistance a woman like me can give whereas in Japan, they don’t care, said Ogawa.
“Since my childhood, people have been telling me to do this and that. I was bullied throughout, but here, I have become an asset; people appreciate my service,” she said, having lived her own life no different to that of Oshin’s.
