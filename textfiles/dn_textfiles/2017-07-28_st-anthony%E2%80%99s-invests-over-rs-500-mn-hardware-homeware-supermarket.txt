St Anthony’s Consolidated (PVT) Ltd officially opened HOMEMART hardware supermarket and homeware retailer with a total investment of over Rs. 500 million on July 26, at Nawala Road, Koswatta.
Managing Director of St Anthony’s Hardware (Pvt) Ltd, M. Thayananthan speaking to Daily News Business said that they have invested Rs. 225 million for the three storied HOMEMART building and they have bought the land and have invested more than Rs. 500 million for the land and for the building.
“We have a big building material and manufacturing group and we are planning to bring our unique products under one roof. We want to make it more comfortable for our customers to get products from one place and they can get products from foundation to roof from HOMEMART. We have superior products at HOMEMART and we are planning to bring in steel very soon,” he said.
“HOMEMART is a one-stop general hardware and home-ware store with a wide range of high quality products for customers.
We have everything that customers need like power tools, hand tools, three paint brands, cement, kitchenware, sanitary ware, home appliances, design solutions, locks and many more items. Our goal is to make life easier for customers,” Praveen Gnanam, Executive Director, St Anthony’s said.
“Like any construction site, HOMEMART is very much a work in progress. We’re nowhere near finished with what we’ve started here. There are far more products we have yet to introduce that aren’t even available in the local market yet. There are entire product categories and comprehensive support service offerings that we will continue to study and phase in, when the time is right, and the facilities are adequate,” he said.
