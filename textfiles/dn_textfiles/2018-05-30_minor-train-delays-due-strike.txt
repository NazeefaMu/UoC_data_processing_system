Minor train delays due to strike

Minor train delays were reported yesterday after the Railway Technical Services Union launched a token strike demanding the government heed their requests for salary increment among other issues.
Union Chairman Sampath Ranjith, whilst announcing the train strike, warned commuters to expect delays. He said that the union was agitating for a salary increment of 12 percent.
He also said that the employees wished to work only for eight hours a day, for a total of 40 hours a week and not more than that.
The Transport Ministry announced that leave of all railway employees will be cancelled for as long as the strike is on.
