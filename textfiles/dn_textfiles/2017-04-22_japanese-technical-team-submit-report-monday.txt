JAPANESE TECHNICAL TEAM TO SUBMIT REPORT ON MONDAY

The Japanese special technical team which has inspected the Meethotamulla garbage dump twice since their arrival on Thursday evening is set to submit their recommendations to the Sri Lankan government on Monday.
The team arrived in the island on a special request made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during his recent visit to Japan. “They have looked at short term and long term solutions. On Saturday they will visit the Karadiyana and Dompe sites too to make their observations,” JICA representative in Sri Lanka Takuya Manabe told the Daily News.
He added that any further assistance from Japan to Meethotamulla would depend on the recommendations made in the report and any future programmes would also be based on Monday’s report.
The eleven member Japanese team consists of environmentalists, waste management specialists and geologists. The specialist team is expected to provide advice on the prevention of garbage landslides and waste management to the relevant government agencies.
On Wednesday, Japan sent a stock of essential goods as relief to the victims of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse.
