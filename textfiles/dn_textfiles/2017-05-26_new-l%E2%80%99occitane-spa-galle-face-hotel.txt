A new L’Occitane spa at Galle Face Hotel

The Galle Face Hotel is cutting the ribbon on a new L’Occitane spa paying tribute to the property’s glamorous association with Hollywood over the decades.
Adorned in a romantic palette of soft textures, alpine and iced teal hues, the L’Occitane spa’s clean and crisp interior is accented by natural, dark ash-stained wooden floorboards, doors and window frames, recessed Oriental-style rugs, silk screens and exquisite upholstered furniture.
The Galle Face Hotel’s General Manager Deni A. Dukic said in a press release that the spa would stay true to L’Occitane’s traditions, including its essential oils, natural ingredients and traditional massage techniques, yet be distinct in character, inspired by the grandeur of the hotel’s historical association with some of Hollywood’s most recognizable icons.
“This is a spa that strives to transport you to an early Hollywood era, a gentler, more luxurious time when glamour reigned and time moved slower,” said Dukic. “We want to ensure that the services offered at the spa are equal to the standards guests from around the world have come to expect of The Galle Face Hotel.”
Spanning a palatial 1,115 square metres, The Galle Face’s ‘Spa L’Occitane En Provence’ will feature eight therapy rooms, including couples and Ayurveda rooms, as well as a nail spa, lavish indoor and outdoor relaxation areas, gym, steam rooms, dry saunas and Jacuzzis.
Situated adjacent to The Galle Face’s relaxed Pool Bar and Terrace overlooking the Indian Ocean, the spa’s lush outdoor area, replete with daybeds and tropical plants including fuchsia of rich pink bougainvillea designed to attract pockets of butterflies, will serve up a spa menu ranging from healthy snacks to specially created cocktails.
L’Occitane Spa will offer an ample choice of massages, facials and other treatments based on natural ingredients such as lavender from Provence in the south of France and shea butter from Burkina Faso in west Africa.
Due to open mid-2017, the spa’s emergence follows a 30-month restoration completed in late 2015 that brought the hotel’s rooms and suites, restaurants and bars, and lobby and ballrooms of the North Wing back to their original grandeur.
