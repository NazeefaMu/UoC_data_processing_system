Taliban, landslides complicate Afghan earthquake rescue effort

AFGHANISTAN: The mourning family had to buy the burial shroud, 20 metres of white linen, on credit from their district bazaar in northern Afghanistan. But at least the two crushed bodies of their teenage sons, pulled from the wreckage of a devastating earthquake after three hours of digging, could be put to rest on Tuesday.
But for the family, living in a Taliban-controlled area near the centre of Monday's powerful earthquake, the ordeal was not over: Dozens of militants lingered around the house after the burial ceremony, demanding to be fed.
The extent of the family's wealth had come down to several apricot and mulberry trees, a half-dozen sheep and a cow. To feed the insurgents, the family had to slaughter one of its last goats.
"Every night, every day, we have 20 or 30 Taliban coming asking for food," one of the relatives said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of Taliban reprisal. "And we can't even afford one loaf of bread for our own children."
For many in Afghanistan's eastern and north-eastern provinces, the earthquake, which killed more than 300 people across northern Afghanistan and Pakistan and destroyed about 7000 homes in Afghanistan alone, was just a new layer to their misery. For months, residents had already been caught in a gruelling conflict as the Taliban have waged offensives against government forces and militias in the north-east, and as the militants claiming loyalty to Islamic State and using its brutal methods have gained a foothold in parts of the east.
Now, the rumbling earth has left many families homeless just as winter is about to set in.
