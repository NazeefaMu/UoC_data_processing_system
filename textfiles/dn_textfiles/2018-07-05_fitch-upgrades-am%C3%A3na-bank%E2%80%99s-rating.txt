Fitch upgrades Amãna Bank’s rating

Fitch Ratings Lanka has upgraded Amãna Bank’s rating outlook to Positive from Stable whilst affirming its National Long Term Rating at BB (lka) its latest rating review concluded in June 2018.
According to the communiqué issued by Fitch Ratings “The outlook revision on Amãna takes into account our expectation that the bank will continue to improve its financial profile on better profitability metrics and enhanced capital position arising from future capital raising.”
The Bank’s profitability has consistently improved since breaking even in August 2014 and topped Rs 500 million in PAT for 2017, whilst recording a bottom line of Rs 162.8 million for Q1 2018. In this positive backdrop, the Bank recently announced an interim dividend of 7 cents per share for the year 2018.
