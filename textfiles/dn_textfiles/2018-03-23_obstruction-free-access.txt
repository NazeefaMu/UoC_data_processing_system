Obstruction free access

Making our pavements and pedestrian areas safe and creating a barrier-free pedestrian environment is fundamentally important to those with physical impairments or the differently abled. It is essential that when designing Colombo’s beautification projects, attention is also paid to the needs of people with mobility impairments and these should be to the highest possible standards. This requires knowledge of the capabilities of different types of persons’ ease of movement. In designing or modifying facilities, the aim should be to become generous in the allocation of space.
For many of us who are fortunate to have complete mobility, it is insignificant or unimportant and most often unnoticed that a pillar or obstruction exists on the centre of a pavement or an elevated pavement or bus stand, as we have the agility to manoeuvre past it without much effort. Yet for someone on a wheel chair or with mobility impairments this can be an obstacle that hampers their free movement and restricts them from independently moving about.
Smart City needs to be liveable
During the previous government, much emphasis was placed on the beautification of the Colombo city. Even today there is greater attention paid to transforming Colombo into a smart city, but overlooking the question of whether it is a liveable city. In Sri Lanka, we have created an environment for those with mobility restrictions to be looked upon with pity and as a group in our society that needs our assistance, without empowering them to be independent and live with dignity just like the rest of us. For someone in a wheel chair or even an elderly person with limited or impaired mobility, it is totally impossible for them to use public transport, be it trains or buses. Most of the buildings in the city lack wheel chair access, such as ramps etc. and many of the toilet facilities provided at even some of the larger hotels in the city, have no toilet facilities for those on a wheel chair or for those having mobility impairments. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and fast as Sri Lanka is fast becoming a country with a high aging population. Before we make Colombo a smart city, should we not make it liveable for all?
While activists have been fighting for disability rights in the past, these trio have achieved their goal not by protesting by the street side or opposite important ministries. Instead, Prasanna Kuruppu (disable rights activist), late Cyril Siriwardena (disable rights activist) and Vidya Abhayagunawardena adopted a more direct and effective lobbying approach. They targeted the right persons in key institutions, such as the CMC and took the message ‘that people with mobility restrictions too had the right and could be independent if the right facilities and access was provided’. This approach obviously worked as the Colombo Municipal Council Eng. Lalith Wickremaratne (Acting Commissioner CMC), Eng. Anura Wickremaratne (Director Traffic), Eng. M. Fazal (Director Engineering), Eng. Devika Abeysuriya (Deputy Director Engineering-Central Road Maintenance Unit), Nihal Wickramaratne (Director Engineering – Traffic Design and Road Safety) and architects and TOs at the CMC responded with much enthusiasm.
According to Vidya Abhayagunawardena, “When a city meets a Liveable City status (having all the physical infrastructure in place and other services), it will help to work towards a Smart City status. Further it will make a pathway to apply to all ICT platforms for the city services which will invariably lead to a high quality of service delivery.”
As a result, a meeting was held on February 21 this year with the participation of concerned citizens namely Prasanna Kuruppu, Vidya Abeygunawardane, Sasanka Mendis and CMC officials. At the meeting, a presentation was done and some locations which are not accessible for disabled persons on Baudhaloka Mawatha were highlighted.
Moving towards accessibility
All the points were well noted by CMC and it was decided to select one road and to do a pilot project. Hence, Baudhdhaloka Mawatha was selected and decided to have a site inspection with the concerned citizens and the CMC officials to identify the rectifications to be done.
The site inspection was carried out on February 26, 2018 with the participation of both parties.
The inspection commenced from No.69, Gregory’s road and continued to Baudhdhaloka Mawatha. The Baudhdhaloka Mawatha (from Baseline Road to Maitland Place) and a small section of the Gregory’s Road were inspected.
Several locations and the adjustments needed to facilitate wheelchair access and access for those with impairments were identified during the inspection.
1. Lowering of foot walks near the by lanes and entrances in order to facilitate a wheel chair and free movement. Approximately 40 locations were identified in Baudhdhaloka Mawatha and 6 locations were identified in Gregory’s Road in front of D. S. Senanayaka College.
2. Two bus halts were identified and alterations that need to be done in order to facilitate the disabled community. There were no space for a wheel chair to move due to the step. It was suggested to have a ramp and remove a bar (shown in the photograph) which was obstructing free movement.
3. One manhole was identified to be raised. It is already informed to Dialog.
4. The road crossing at Wijerama Mawatha is fully blocked due to the bollards of the British High Commission. (Photo attached)
5. Two locations were identified to provide ramps due to the roots of the trees.
6. Foot walk near the entrance to BMICH to be lowered to facilitate them to reach BMICH.
7. A guard rail near the European Union office to be removed.
8. Guard room between European Union and embassy of China Republic to be shifted.
9. Storm water gullies which are fallen on the road crossings to be shifted in several places.
10. Old traffic signal poles to be removed at the junction of Baudhdhaloka Mawatha and Maitland Place.
11. A foundation erected for the display board across the road that was too big was also identified.
Based on the inspection and identification of the changes that need to be done in order to facilitate free movement for the mobility impaired, the CMC team commenced the lowering of the foot walks and other related works on Baudhdhaloka Mawatha on March 12.
The concerned citizens who participated in the inspection had also made a special request to provide free accessibility for the disabled community on Baudhdhaloka Mawatha from Galle Road to Baseline Road before the Vesak festival. The CMC team has assured them that they would try their best to fulfil that request.
Meanwhile, Vidya Abhayagunawardena told the Daily News that they had also requested to see the possibility of marking a wheelchair sign along the stretch of foot walk with free accessibility in order to avoid motor cycles using the foot walks once the entrances are lowered.
He said, based on the accessible regulations by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, the Supreme Court Judgment on accessibility rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) which will be implemented in Sri Lanka after having the local regulations in place, people will have more power and the State institutions should get ready to deliver such services from now onward. “Having accessible pavements will bring humane face to the city and many other benefits.
What the people need
First, Sri Lankan cities should work toward achieving a Liveable City status. Improving transportation, Complete Streets, Open Spaces, Land use, Housing for poor, Employment opportunities, Water and sanitation, Waste recycling, Zero stray dog population, Crime prevention and safety, Use of renewable energy, Zero Dengue outbreak and other communicable diseases, Flood control mechanisms and overall, having an integrated environmental policy,” said Vidya Abhayagunawardena.
He noted that once we achieve a Liveable City status we can think of having cities with Smart City status. Namely, Mobility, Health, Safety and Productivity - mostly run by ICT platforms and leading to a high quality of life. Singapore became the best Smart City in the World last week beating London and NY. Singapore has shown its superiority in the use of ICT advancements in their services delivery. This is the end of the tunnel story or the end goal of a Smart City. No doubt that having ICT platforms will help to ease a lot of congestion currently facing service delivery points in Sri Lanka. But that does not mean that Sri Lankan cities will have Smart City status with the use of such ICT platforms in their service delivery points.
Focusing on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, by 2030 there will be 10 targets to be achieved according to Goal No.11 and we hope that Sri Lanka will be able to achieve this Goal's target if we start planning and executing them properly from now onward,” he added.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, Acting Municipal Commissioner Eng. Lalith Wickremaratne said that the CMC is committed and willing to work with the people in delivering a safe and accessible city for all. “It is indeed welcoming to see normal citizens approaching us and getting involved in these activities. This will also help us to identify the areas that are sometimes overlooked. “Our culture is that when a person is disabled, he must be confined to his home environment and we don’t give them the opportunity to move around independently like others, probably because we don’t have the proper facilities. So we have to start taking note of their rights and empowering them to make them part of our society,” he said.
“With regard to persons with disability, our society has an attitude problem and because of that certain things are just ignored. When children are at a young age, certain corrective action must be taken. Because of this fear of coming out, these people with impaired abilities are kept isolated within just their family circle and parents too prefer to keep them to themselves. This must be changed and these persons too are members of our society and they have a right to have their needs catered to, to live freely enjoying the same facilities accorded to every other citizen,” said Nihal Wickramaratne (Director Engineering – Traffic Design and Road Safety).
“The problem here is that we are used to looking at those with impairments in a charity based approach. It should instead be a rights based approach meeting their needs,” added Eng. Devika Abeysuriya (Deputy Director Engineering - Central Road Maintenance Unit), under whom this project is being implemented.
Eng. M. Fazal (Director Engineering) said, “People with impairments should be empowered to make them independent and live as every other citizen with dignity, instead of having to depend on others. This will enable them to function independently and reach their full potential, instead of being made to feel inferior. Most of those with impairment resent pity and they want to be treated like every other citizen, being able to live an independent and dignified life.”
The CMC has assured that this programme will commence from Colombo and eventually reach all other cities as well. It is also mandatory for all new buildings that are being constructed to include access for those with mobility restrictions. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of making the city accessible and friendly to those with mobility and visual impairments. There is much to be done, but it is indeed a welcome sign that the CMC has taken the initiative in the right direction and it is hoped that the new Mayor, Rosie Senanayake will take the lead in making Colombo a city that caters to all alike, able or not and empower our fellow citizens with mobility impairments to live freely without being restricted in any manner enabling them to live a life free and independent.Singapore became the best Smart City in the world last week and rated as a leading Liveable City.
