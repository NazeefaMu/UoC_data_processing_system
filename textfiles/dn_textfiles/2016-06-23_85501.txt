During elections: PM calls for banning Advertising by candidates

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament suggested including a Clause in the new Constitution to give power to Parliament to either ban media advertising by candidates vying for elections or to impose a ceiling for political parties on such expenditure. He said such a system had been adopted in some European countries.
He was moving a Resolution under the Constitution on the media guidelines to be followed by the Electronic and Print Media during Referenda and Elections.
The media guidelines were published by the Election Commission in the Gazette Extraordinary issued last February.
The Prime Minister commencing the debate on the Resolution said, if the First Past the Post system is adopted under the electoral reforms, the candidates need not spend colossal amounts for media publicity, as the candidates only have small constituency to cover.
“Even when candidates are selected by the proportionate representation system, we have to think of imposing a ceiling on the expenditure borne by the Political Parties for media advertising. It is high time that we consider these proposals as we are discussing on electoral reforms based on a hybrid system,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the necessity for media guidelines during election time was strongly felt during the previous Presidential Elections.
“There were many complaints on the conduct of the State Media during the previous Presidential Elections and some even lodged complaints before the Human Rights Commission. The set of guidelines presented today was a concerted effort by the relevant authorities to correct the situation,” he noted.
The Prime Minister observed the Resolution on Media Guidelines and the Right to Information Bill were two important points in the direction of the good governance presented by the Government this week in Parliament under the leadership of the President. When the Prime Minister was speaking at the Joint Opposition (JO) MPs were standing in the House in protest of not allowing MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage to raise a privilege matter.
“The JO should not disturb this type of an important debate. You spoke about life threats today. How many journalists were killed during the period of your government If you have any problem, settle it at the office of the Deputy Chairman of Committees.
"Then duly raise the matter next day” he told the standing JO members.
It was agreed at the Party Leaders’ Meeting to debate the media guidelines yesterday, but to postpone approving it in Parliament till the Resolution is overlooked at the Parliamentary Oversight Committee allowing to make any amendments if necessary.
