Make proposals for party reorganisation

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday instructed the top ranking United National Party (UNP) officials to make proposals to reorganise the party.
The Premier gave these instructions when leading officials of the UNP met him at Temple Trees last morning. The Premier instructed that a group should run the government while the others should formulate a programme that the party has to implement during this year.
The Premier also had observed that when a party is in power naturally they forget the party’s programs that a group will have to attend to the implementation of the Party’s projects.
