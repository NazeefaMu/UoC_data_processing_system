Lalith Athulathmudali’s absence very much felt today: Minister Fonseka

Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sri Lanka experiences today the loss of the late Lalith Athulathmudali.
He was delivering the commemorative speech to mark the 25th death anniversary of the late Lalith Athulathmudali at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
Minister Fonseka said he first met Athulathmudali in 1986, the National Security Ministry at the time. “The first and the last official meeting with Athulathmudali was in 1986 when I was the Major General of the Army. He met us to speak about training and the ongoing anti-terrorit operations. I was impressed by the young Minister; he addressed many issues of army officials. He spoke with intelligence in a practical manner. He did not fail to spend a whole day with us. It was the first and the last time I met him,” he said.
Minister Fonseka said the country today is experiencing his absence. “I rushed to the hospital as a colonel working at the Army Headquarters no sooner than I heard that he had been shot at. Unfortunately, the country lost a great leader that day,” he added.
Minister Fonseka said Athulathmudali’s performances as the National Security Minister were remarkable.
“He concentrated and responded to two main areas to complete the responsibilities entrusted to him in national security. First preparing and dealing with non-military actors including politicians locally and externally and secondly, building up the military and strategic methods,” he said.
Minister Fonseka said that being a leading political figure in government, Athulathmudali spoke in length in Parliament about the enormous sacrifices made by the military and also informed the civilians about the situation, the nature and the need for the operations to be carried out by the Army in the north and east.
“He could understand the real situation and respond to false accusations. He became a strength and encouragement to the troops. He strongly believed that the people in the military were sacrificing their lives and future for the sake of others and he insisted that civilians should understand this truth,” Minister Fonseka said.
“The late Athulathmudali spoke to the people about the need to protect democracy in all parts of the country. He rejected communalism and racist and religious differences,” he said. Minister Fonseka said that as Athulathmudali was new to the field, he interacted with senior and junior military officials to know facts and information about the situation and studied the strength and shortcoming of the military and immediately took necessary measures.
Minister Fonseka said that when Athulathmudali wanted to strengthen the military, he did not received enough support from the then Finance Minister and he confronted difficulties in finding required finance.
Then he came up with establishing a defence fund. “Even at that time, political undercutting had been the order of the day more than the national interest as much as what’s happening today.” he said.
A book titled Lalith Athulathmudali - Rejitha Semarum written by Udaya Wanasinghe, Ranjith A Palihapitiya and Nandana Kumarapeli was also launched.
