Charges of money laundering: Basil, Thirukumar Nadeshan served indictments

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and Thirukumar Nadeshan were served indictments before Gampaha High Court Judge Priyantha Fernando on the charges of money laundering and aiding and abetting money laundering under the Money Laundering Act.
The High Court judge ordered them to be released on bail on the conditions issued by the Pugoda Magistrate earlier after signing a bond and obtaining fingerprints of the accused.
The lawyers appearing for the first accused, Basil Rajapaksa, pleaded the court to rescind the earlier order on their client to appear in FCID once in two weeks. The High Court Judge rescinded the order on the request of lawyers who appeared on behalf of the first accused.
A team of senior lawyers led by President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe, PAP Weerathna appeared for the accused. State Counsel Thusitha Mudalige appeared on behalf of the Attorney General.
The case was put off for December 8 for hearing.
