Prevailing arid weather impedes tea harvests

The harvests of the Hinidumpaththuwa and Morawaka Koralaya tea plantations have dropped by 25 percent due to the prevailing arid weather, hence reducing the quantity of tea leaves that is transported to factories, tea planters said.
Tea factory labour work has been restricted and some labourers get work only four days per week. Land owners face difficulties in maintaining their lands as well, they added. If the arid weather continues even further, the produce would fall to 40 percent, tea planters said.
