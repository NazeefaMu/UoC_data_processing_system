JSA officials to act as Presiding Officers at BASL election

Judicial Services Association (JSA) officials have agreed to act as the Presiding Officers at the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) election scheduled to be held on March 15.
BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya said this decision was taken at a meeting of JSA and BASL senior officials and Executive Committee members held at the District Court of Colombo on Saturday.
Accordingly, District Judges and Magistrates will act as the Presiding Officers at the forthcoming BASL election which will be held to elect the new BASL Chairman. “The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) election which was earlier scheduled to be held on February 21 was postponed due to a decision taken by Judicial Services Association (JSA) to refrain from acting as the Presiding Officers at the election because of the difference of opinion the two associations had over President Maithripala Sirisena appointing an Attorney-at-Law as a High Court Judge,”Randeniya said.
The JSA had strongly objected to the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan,a lawyer practicing at the Private Bar in Batticaloa as a High Court Judge citing it as a violation of the Constitution and the judicial service tradition.
