Healthcare strengthening at Grama Niladhari level

The Primary Health Care Strengthening Project will be launched on July 20 at 6 pm at the BMICH in Colombo, Project Director and former Health Services Director General Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
He said this five-year project will be launched with World Bank assistance. The agreement will be signed with the Secretary of the Treasury shortly. At present, the world's best medical treatment is available for Sri Lankans free of charge but disease prevention is not satisfactory.
According to Dr. Bandara, at present, 24 percent of Sri Lankan males and 23 percent of females under the age of 20 suffer from hypertension. Hypertension leads to several other health complications and diseases. Under the new programme, each Sri Lankan will be registered to a health centre. This process will commence at Grama Niladhari level.
A health centre will accommodate 20,000 people. All of them will be screened for Non Communicable Diseases and other health issues. They will be graded and categorised according to the risk in developing a NCD in the future. Their current health condition will be managed accordingly.
