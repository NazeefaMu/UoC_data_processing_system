Colombo, highest HIV affected district

Colombo North, Central Colombo and Borella are the three most HIV affected areas in the country, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday, he said the most affected province is the Western Province and the most affected district is Colombo.
The CMC conducts free monthly clinics and carries out blood tests but no one wishes to take part if they hear the words `HIV' or `AIDS'. Expensive drugs are given free of charge for infected persons but they abandon treatment after the first or second session.
Consultant Epidemiologist attached to the National STD / AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka Dr. Sriyakanthi Beneragama said a total of 3,900 Sri Lankans are living with HIV by 2016 (last year) and there were 550 estimated new infections in 2016. There were 110 AIDS related deaths in 2016. The estimated HIV prevalence in Sri Lanka in 2016 was less than 0.1 percent. According to Dr. Beneragama, in Sri Lanka, the HIV infection ratio is one woman to every three men. The gap between men and women who are infected with HIV is widening. This means that more males are infected with HIV than women. By the end of October this year, 2,783 HIV infections are reported and 693 of them have developed AIDS. Out of them, a total of 444 have died. Over 80 percent of the HIV infected persons were between the ages of 25 and 49.
