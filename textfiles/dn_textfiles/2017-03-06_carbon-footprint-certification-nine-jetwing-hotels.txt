Carbon footprint certification to nine Jetwing Hotels

Jetwing Hotels achieved another milestone by being awarded ISO 14064 certification for nine of its properties recently.
This prestigious honour was given to Jetwing Blue, Jetwing St. Andrew's, Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions, Jetwing Lighthouse, Jetwing Beach, Jetwing Sea, Jetwing Lagoon, Jetwing Yala and Jetwing Vil Uyana. The International Organization for Standardization has a membership of 162 countries, and with a portfolio of more than 21,000 standards giving world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency.
ISO standards provide a model to follow when setting up and operating a management system. These standards are formulated and a result of international, expert consensus which provides a number of benefits, such as efficient use of resources, improved risk management, amongst others. The ISO 14064 standard published in 2006 is a part of the ISO 14000 series of International Standards for environmental management. It specifies principles and requirements at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals. It includes requirements for the design, development, management, reporting and verification of an organization's GHG inventory.
Certified by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund (SLCF), which is a private-public partnership company under the purview of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, all direct emission sources and energy indirect sources have been accounted for in the GHG inventory across the nine properties making Jetwing Hotels the first to be verified under the ISO 14064 standard in Sri Lanka.
“With the certificates we have received we have achieved quite a milestone indeed. Nine of our 19 resorts are now certified, and it is a great honour to have our efforts recognized and verified according to international standards,” states Jetwing Hotels Chairman Hiran Cooray in a press release.
