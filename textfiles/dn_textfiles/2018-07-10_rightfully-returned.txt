The release of lands was facilitated by the Security Force Headquarters Jaffna (SFHQ-J) under the guidance of Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna Commander Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi and a significant portion of land was released to the people in April this year as a New Year bonanza on the eve of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The gesture organised jointly by Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, District Secretariat for Jaffna and the SFHQ-J, was attended by a large gathering of people, including the beneficiaries.
The military had come to an understanding to meet the needs of the people who had lost their lands in the North. Meanwhile, the military has also asked the Rehabilitation Ministry for Rs. 880 million to relocate its military installations in the north and east.
Further, the government also had taken measures to identify lands that belong to people who are overseas and it is said that most of them cannot be located. The authorities are trying to locate these owners and take over their lands legally on rent or lease to be utilised for development.
New beginning
Some of the landowners in the North who fled the country during the war have now returned only to find their lands being occupied by other parties who lay claim to these lands. Speaking to the Daily News a Jaffna resident who preferred to be referred to as Ravi said that his family had a land of around five acres in Jaffna, but when he had returned in 2010, he found that this land was being occupied by another party who had claimed this land as theirs.
Having contacted these occupants he had even offered to pay them a substantial sum as compensation. However, not being able to resolve the matter amicably, he had to seek justice through courts and the case has been dragging on since 2011 for which he has had to pay a substantial amount of money. He now wonders if the whole exercise is worth it, as he definitely has no intention of settling down in Jaffna again.
The TNA has been agitating for a long time about the releasing of lands to the civilians which are being held by the military and the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake is of the view that the lands should be released to the people without further delay and they too deserve to return to their lands and commence their lives, which is still in limbo nine years since the war had ended.
The Jaffna Security Force Headquarters Commander Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi said while the rest of the country has resumed their lives and have left the pain of war far behind, being nine years since it ended, some are still suffering in IDP camps, which is definitely not fair. “Some of these innocent people have been living in IDP camps for over 28 years and they too have a right to return to their lands and rebuild their lives and live a normal life. It is not fair to allow them to suffer any further while the majority of the country has long forgotten the effects of the war.”
