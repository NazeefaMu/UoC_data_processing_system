Three-member committee to probe misuse of govt funds

A special three-member investigation committee was appointed by the North Western Provincial Council to investigate into the alleged misuse of government funds from the special fund set up for the eradication of Thalassemia from the NWP by 2020.
It is alleged that Rs. 10 million had been misused.
This fund was set up in 2009. Opposition Leader of the NWP-PC Shyamal Senerath requested the new NW Provincial Minister of Health Lakshman Wedaruwa to explain as to what has happened to the investigation report prepared on the misuse of funds allocated for this special fund.
Senerath asked the Provincial Minister of Health to table that investigation report before the NWP-PC meeting in due course.
Parents of children who suffer from Thalassemia in both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts complain that the report has been hidden by authorities due to political influence.
