Aussie women grab easy win over Windies counterparts

Australia’s opener Nicole Bolton’s brilliant unbeaten ton (107 runs) well supported by a superb 70-run knock from the fellow opener, Beth Mooney laid a solid 171-run fist wicket stand which steered them to a comprehensive eight-wicket win with 11.5 overs to spare against West Indies in the ICC Women’s World Cup cricket match at the County Ground, Taunton, England yesterday.
Batting first Windies women were skittled out for 204 runs in 47.5 overs. Hayley Matthews and Stafanie Taylor top scored with 46 runs and 45 runs respectively. Ellys Perry bowled best for Aussies capturing 3/47. Jess Jonassen and Kristen Beams shared two wickets apiece.
Australian openers put up a magnificent batting show in Bolton’s 116-ball 107-run innings including 14 boundaries and Mooney’s 85-ball 70-run knock consisted of seven hits to the ropes and one over it. With Tailor dismissing Moony in the 30th over, Meg Lannin joined with Bolton, but was removed by Taylor for 12 runs in the 34th over. It has been an easy task for Ellys Perry (five runs) to continue with Bolton to victory. Australia women will earn two point with this win.
