Disturbed student told to wear ear plugs

A female undergraduate billed to sit for her finals shortly who went to a Grama Niladhari in the area to complain about the disturbance caused to her studies at night by a neighbour's barking dog had a harrowing experience when the Grama Niladhari advised her to wear ear plugs during study time to overcome the irritation, a report from a village in the outskirts of Alawwa said.
The report said, the family living in the house adjoining the undergraduate's house and property which had bought a dog recently had been in the habit of tying the animal to the fence bordering the two properties at night as a safety measure. The animal had been in the habit of barking at night to overcome loneliness disturbing the girl studying next door. When repeated requests made to neighbours to tie the dog elsewhere failed to earn a positive response, the girl had gone and complained to the Grama Niladhari. The officer had visited the house concerned to advice the occupants to take measures to prevent causing disturbance and the neighbours had responded by keeping dog indoors for several days.
However, they had once again resorted to the earlier practice of tying the dog on to the border fence and the barking had started once again as usual disturbing the girl in her studies.
The girl had gone and complained to the Grama Niladhari once more.
The Grama Niladhari had then said that there is no legal provision to take action regarding such issues and requested the girl to wear ear plugs when studying at night and even gone to the extent of demonstrating the manner it could be done.
