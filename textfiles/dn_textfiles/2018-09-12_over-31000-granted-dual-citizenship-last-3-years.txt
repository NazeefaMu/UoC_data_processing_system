Over 31,000 granted dual citizenship in last 3 years

The Government has granted dual citizenship to 31,322 the last three years, the Immigration and Emigration Department said in its Performance Report for 2017.
The report said 10,648 individuals had been granted dual citizenship last year. In 2016 and 2015, the Department had granted dual citizenship status to 17,544 and 3,130 individuals respectively.
The dual citizenship scheme was temporarily suspended in 2011 and resumed in 2015. Under the Citizenship Act, persons whose Sri Lankan citizenship had ceased due to obtaining citizenship in another country and who thereafter desire to be a citizen of Sri Lanka, can apply for dual citizenship.The fee for applying for dual citizenship is Rs 300,000, while it is Rs 50,000 each for the spouse of the applicant and unmarried children below 22.
The Performance Report was tabled in Parliament last month.
