Deepavali messages
Victory of light over darkness

It is a pleasure to send this message of greetings on the occasion of the festival of Deepavali celebrated by Hindus throughout the world, symbolising the victory of light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance to inculcate noble values such as spiritual discipline and wisdom in the hearts of the people.
The meaning of Deepavali is to illuminate the lives of all individuals, just as lighting a lamp eliminates darkness, and dispels evil. Deepavali is also a unique cultural festival that builds deep bonds of love and kindness between people. Cultural festivals such as Deepavali play a pivotal role in building coexistence and reconciliation among different communities that suffered numerous adversities due to separation over the past decades.
I believe that Deepavali offers a fresh opportunity for us to foster cultural relations.
I wish all the Hindus in Sri Lanka and around the world a happy Deepavali festival as they celebrate this important day with utmost devotion to nurture love and moral values.
