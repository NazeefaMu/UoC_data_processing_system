No state land sold to any foreign hand -Mahinda Amaraweera

After the land transaction with Shangri-La, no public property was sold to any foreign individual or an overseas state, remarked State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was making the key note address at the Galle district Sri Lanka Freedom Party convention held on Saturday at Hall De Galle.
“Today, all party members can boast of an unblemished and genuine Sri Lanka Freedom Party. We could on principal end enduringly the direct sale of state property to foreigners or any foreign state.
After the notorious Shangri-La land deal where straight possession of Sri Lankan soil was sold to an overseas firm, we did not allow any government property to be sold to foreign hands.
As long as we are in the National Unity government, we would not allow such deals. We stopped many similar attempts during the recent past.
It was during the previous regime that arrangements had been made to sell the Hambantota Port. We could halt such destructive moves and win many victories for the country through directing the present government in the right track," he further remarked.
"We are not prepared to hang onto the coalition government forever. We do not want rule the country in combination with the United National Party persistently. We formed this government to achieve some vital aims and objectives with utmost national importance. We joined the present government on a collective decision taken democratically with the majority’s agreement of the party. We never betrayed our party,” he added.
“At present, some baseless rumours are spread by the opposition alleging that we are afraid of elections. If President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved the Parliament soon after his presidential victory, the SLFP would have suffered a major election defeat. Had we faced the Local Government election at that time we would have lost the power of all Local Government bodies. However, the President evaded such great setbacks to the party,” he pointed out.
“We are not scared to hold elections. We will hold the Local Government elections before the end of this year. I urged all party organizers to prepare lists of potential contestants for the forthcoming LG polls.
We have further decided to hold three Provincial Council elections also. The Provincial Council elections may take precedence over the LG polls. A favourable political ground to win the elections has been fashioned for us throughout the country.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party will contest all upcoming elections as a single party. Public will not be misled and they will use their vote wisely. They will vote for the politically clean and virtuous representatives.”
“Erudite and intellectual public will rally round clean and genuine leaders. Youth are always against corruption and fraud. We should formulate a workable national strategy to attract such social sections. We invited the moderate Joint Opposition’s loyalists also to join with in our principled mission.
However, we did not receive a good response from them. President Maithripala Sirisena is the only such national leader in contemporary politics that can be trusted as a genuine leader with a gallant national vision and a mission.
During the previous Presidential election we worked wholeheartedly for the victory of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as he was our party candidate.
We did everything we could for his success. We gifted the people all possible assistances.
We did not work for President Maithripala Sirisena at the said election for he was not our party candidate.
We love our beloved party, but people rejected the former President as he was violently charged with corruption, fraud, manipulation of national wealth and sponsoring family prejudice,” Amaraweera said.
