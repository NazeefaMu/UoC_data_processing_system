AG to attend international asset recovery forum

A high level delegation from Sri Lanka, led by Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, will travel to Washington, D.C., next week to headline a conference on global asset recovery.Asset recovery is the process of recovering funds that were taken through corruption or graft and hidden in offshore bank accounts.
Though Sri Lanka has never completed a high-level asset recovery case, countries like Nigeria and the Philippines have successfully recovered millions of dollars that were stolen by corrupt public officials.“The Sri Lankan government will have several bilateral meetings, and it will be essential to see what the outcome of the (forum) will be,” said Asoka Obeyesekere, the executive director of Transparency International Sri Lanka, at a press conference Thursday.
“It’s encouraging to see they are working with experts in this area,” he added. “However, as for the progress on all of this, there’s a question mark there.”Under the current laws in Sri Lanka, the state needs a criminal conviction in order to start the asset recovery process, Obeyesekere said.
“This could slow the recovery process down in a majority of cases, and Sri Lanka should look at reforming its laws. The important message to get through on this point is that we don’t need to depend on criminal justice proceedings to ensure that assets can be recovered and returned to Sri Lanka,” he said.Although there is no official estimate of how much public money has been hidden overseas, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne in 2015 said that a minimum of USD$ 10 billion had been deposited in foreign accounts by Sri Lankans, including USD$ 3 billion at the National Bank of Dubai.
“These are things that belong to the citizens of this country,” Obeyesekere said Thursday. “So the return of these assets is essential.”A delegation of Sri Lankan government officials, along with civil society groups like Transparency International, will attend the Global Forum on Asset Recovery in Washington from December 4-6.
The event is hosted by the US and UK, and will highlight the cases of Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Ukraine.
