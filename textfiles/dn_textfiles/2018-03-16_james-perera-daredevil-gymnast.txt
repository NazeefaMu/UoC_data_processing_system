James PERERA the DareDevil Gymnast

In the not too distant past GYMNASTICS was a craze among clubs, schools and Community Centers. And one school that dominated this sports was St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena.
Due to the foresight and love for the sport, former Directors of the school they set up a gymnasium and gave the enthusiastic gymnasts all the necessary equipment. More importantly they had a coach who had no parallel at that time in the schools, the tough looking yet likeable GEORGE ATKINSON.
Atkinson had the naturally ability to make top class gymnasts of those who came under his tutelage; and loved the sport. To name those who excelled will need reams, but one standout man was JAMES PERERA whose name and expertise is still spoken about where gymnasts of that era gather.
Natural athlete
PERERA was a natural athlete when it came to that sport. In excelling in every aspect of that sport, he was tagged ‘tough boy’ and was fondly referred by that name by his school friends.
Out of the many aspects he excelled in that sport was that he rewrote the school and the country’s record books by being one of the dare devils to dive through six rings of fire. To him the Horizontal bars, Paraell bars and the Roman Rings associated with gymnastics was child’s play. As if to say he toyed with them.
The Benedictine gymnasts were in great demand by the governments of that time to perform at Independence Day celebrations.
And while the team performed all the art in gymnastics the man who was appreciated and cheered lustily by the large crowd watching and lapping up the action was PERERA for his daredevilry diving through the rings of fire.
Immense interest
PERERA who showed his talents as youngster was awarded half colours and within an year was awarded full colours of the school for his immense interest, excellence, devotion, dedication and discipline for the sport.
His coach Atkinson who noticed the rare talent in him once told him: JAMES I have taught you everything in the sport to go places and to also spread the gospel of gymnastics as a coach. Your talent is immense and as a favor and in remembrance of me promise me to spread this king of sport for me all over the county.’
And PERERA never forgot his guru Atkinson. He took it upon himself to spread the game of gymnastics to several clubs, schools and Forces. There was no Ministry of Sport during that period. He started the first club known as the Young Thrillers Gym club at St.John’s Mission House and he received full support from the famous Fr.Martin and Bro Charles who watched the keenness and hard work put in by PERERA wanted him to coach St.Joseph’s College, Grandpass which he gladly obliged.
Atkinson first President
PERERA formed the first Gymnastics Association of Ceylon and had its first president his guru George Atkinson. He served as the first secretary . Noel Rupesinghe was the treasurer. Betrem Pererand Amal Gomez the first pair to excel in hand to hand balancing at St. Benedict’s, Capt W.M.H. Perera, Ashley Perera and Ranjit Boniface served as committee members.
PERERA was in great demand and he joined the Playgrounds Department of the Colombo Municipal Council and also coached the Y.M.C.A. and Y.M.B.A. PERERA’S love for the sport had no limit. In those days to continued the request and the promise he made to his guru Atkinson, there was a big barrier and that was finding the equipment. Importing the equipment was out of the question because the prices were so expensive.
But determination was writ in him and he purchased a local Electric Plant. His C.G.R. experience in Engineering gave him the experience to launch out on producing the equipment. He had the help of his wife Sriya Perera who was also a keen gymnast and incidentally love struck when he was coaching the CMC where Sriya was employed which led to marriage and even today they are like two love birds.
Training session
After the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany the. G.D.R gymnasts performed here. The team comprised Erikaze Hold, Mattias Bremne Bermn Jagger and Marian Noack and had a training session with the local team. Ericka who was twice world record holder with three silver medals performed on uneven bars and balancing beam with SRIYA and was impressed with the local girl’s expertise. Incidentally SRIYA was the first to train a girl’s team at Stace Rod Community Centre and Kirilapone Community Centre in 1968 and produced many champions.
To further detail the expertise and the many champion gymnasts they produced would require reams and reams of newsprint and every act JAMES produced in school and wife SRIYA will tell it all in a book they are producing that is on the production lines.
Several champions
But JAMES’ contribution to the sport, the clubs, the schools, the community centres, the forces and universities and the champions he turned out are legion and too numerous to mention. His pupils still speak in admiration and appreciation of the manner he turned them into experts in Gymnastics, that sadly today is not what it was in the late 1950s,’60 and 70s.
But names of those who performed with and were his seniors are Bertrem, Perera, TrevorBuultjens, Happy Gomez, Ananda Zoysa, P.Don Susantha and Robin Fernando. Buultjens was the first to dive through six rings of fire with Robin Fernando the second and JAMES PERERA the third. Many feared to perform this life threatening acts, but not Buultjens, Fernando and PERERA.
Grateful to Sugathadasa
PERERA is grateful to the first Minister of Sport V.A.Sugathadasa, also a Benedictine all round sportsman. He also acknowledges and compliments the Prime Minister of today Ranil Wickremasinghe who was then Minister of Education who helped develop sports. PERERA says Wickremasinghe picked right when he appointed Sunil Jayaweera as Director General of Sports in the Ministry of Education.
Jayaweera too was a glutton for hard work and sport being his first love and devoted a lot of his time for the betterment of sport in the country. Men of his calibre are what sport lacks today.
