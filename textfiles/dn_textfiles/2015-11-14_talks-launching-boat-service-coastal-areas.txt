Talks on launching boat service in coastal areas

A proposal to launch a boat service in the coastal areas to transport people and goods with the aim to ease vehicular traffic was discussed recently, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry sources said.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said the matter came up for discussion during a meeting presided by him but no decision on the matter had been taken.
"Such a boat service may be popular among people in the coastal areas and fishing ports, but, it would not be practical during the off season when strong winds and rough seas are prevalent," State Minister Wedaarachchi explained.
