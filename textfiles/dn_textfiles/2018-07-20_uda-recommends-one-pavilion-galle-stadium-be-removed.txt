UDA recommends one pavilion of Galle stadium be removed

The Urban Development Authority has recommended that one pavilion of the Galle International Stadium be removed in order to comply with the UNESCO regulations on world heritage site as the cricket stadium is bordering the Galle Fort which has been declared as a World Heritage site.
A spokesman for the UDA said that the Galle International Stadium has been located near the Galle Dutch Fort which has been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO and that the pavilion has been constructed without the approval of a responsible authority.
Several unauthorized constructions in the Galle Fort and its buffer zone pose a danger to the World Heritage site of the Galle Fort.
“The Archaeology Department’s approval is required to carry out any construction or renovation within a heritage site. From time to time UNESCO has requested us to take action to remove unapproved constructions which have been built within the old Galle Fort and its buffer zone if Galle is to safeguard its heritage listing. It is necessary to take action to safeguard the Old Galle Fort as a UNESCO heritage site,” the spokesman added.
Meanwhile, UNESCO has issued a red notice to the government for the urgent removal of unauthorized constructions in and around the Galle Fort in order to protect the Outstanding Value of the World Heritage site of the Old Town of Galle and its fortifications.
Following the assessment carried out by the UDA, it has been revealed that there were many unauthorized constructions in and around Galle Fort. However, the final decision on the Galle International Cricket Stadium has not been taken yet and discussions with the relevant authorities, including the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Archeological Department, Urban Development Authority and officials of Sri Lanka Cricket and Western Province Cricket Association about this matter is on track.
Meanwhile, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the problem had arisen with the setting up of this pavilion in the Galle International Stadium without any permission, during the former regime. Even though UNESCO warned earlier to remove this stadium, it was not removed as the former President’s name was attached to it . “We think it will be possible to remove only the unauthorised pavilion and keep the stadium as it is,” he stated.
