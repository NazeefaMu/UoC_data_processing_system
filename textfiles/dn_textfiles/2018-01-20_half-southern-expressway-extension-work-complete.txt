Half of Southern Expressway extension work complete

About 50 percent of the construction work on the Southern Expressway extension from Matara to Hambantota, with a length of 96 km, has been completed. It will be vested with the public next year.
A Highways Ministry Spokesperson said the rest of the work is progressing expeditiously. “We are on schedule to complete in early 2019,” he added.
The Southern Expressway extension from Matara to Hambantota comprises four main sections including Section 1 - a 30 km stretch from Matara to Belliatta; Section 2 - a 26 km stretch from Beliatta to Wetiya; Section 3 - a 15 km stretch from Wetiya to Andarawewa and Section 4 – a 25km section from Hambantota to Mattala via Andarawewa.
He said about 50 percent of the construction work of the first section and third section had been completed while there is around 65 percent progress in the construction work of the fourth section.
He said about 30 percent of the construction work on the second section is already completed.
The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 103.2 billion. The government has signed four loan agreements with the EXIM Bank of China to finance civil work contracts and the construction work of all four sections are ongoing without any significant hindrance.
Project Director for Section four A. P. K. Abeydeera said there are eight interchanges in the Southern Expressway extension which are Godagama interchange, Aparekka interchange, Beliatta interchange, Kahagalla interchange, Angunukolapalassa interchange, Wetiya interchange, Suriyawewa interchange and Andarawewa interchange.
The extension initially with four-lane carriageways will be developed as a six-lane expressway later, he added. The project will provide massive benefits as it will link with the country's major economic centres such as the Hambantota Sea Port and Mattala Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport in Southern Province with the Colombo City and the Northern part of the country through the Outer Circular Highway, Colombo - Katunayake Expressway and the proposed Northern Expressway.
