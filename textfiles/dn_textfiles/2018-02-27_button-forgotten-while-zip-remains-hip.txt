The button is   forgotten   while the zip   remains hip!

It was somewhere in the sixties, if my memory holds right, that the zipper beat the button in the ‘Battle of the Fly’. The new-fangled accessory created a revolution in Sri Lanka couture although it had caught up in Europe some three decades earlier.
That was when French fashion designers raved over zippers in men’s trousers in 1937. Esquiremagazine declared the zipper, ‘The newest tailoring idea for men.’ And among the zippered fly’s many virtues was that it would exclude ‘the possibility of unintentional and embarrassing disarray.’ Obviously, the new zippered trouser owners had not yet discovered the experience of forgetting to zip-up.
Before zippers, clothing was held together with buttons and buttonholes, hooks and eyes, laces and, buckles. They all took an irritatingly long time to do up, not exactly a convenient way to dress. Because zippers are so commonplace, it is easy to forget their technical wizardry and hard to imagine a world sans zippers. The fastener, whose name is derived from the sound, or ’zip’ the slider makes when being closed, took over 20 years of determination and many great minds to create.
Today, except for a few traditionalists, the button has been forgotten while the zip is still ‘hip’. Some old conformists warn about the dangers of the zipper becoming a ripper in careless, hurried hands. But this could only happen to those free-wheeling males who go shockers over ‘jockers’ and hold no brief for restricting underwear. Many years ago I used to have my clothes designed by a master cutter, a European tailor named Mayer. Mr. Mayer’s suits were elegantly stunning.
His tailoring establishment was located in Canal Row in the Fort on the first floor of the old Mathew building in the heart of Colombo’s bustling business district. Mr. Mayer a middle-aged, burly man with a shock of greying hair spoke flawless English with an east European accent. He had an impish sense of humour and loved pulling practical jokes on his clients.
His skills required to give impeccable structure and refinement to men’s garments were astoundingly stylish. In addition, good-natured witty one-liners were his strong suit as well. Besides, his sewing jokes were strung seamlessly together. Whenever a client politely inquired how his business was doing he would say: “It’s sew-sew!”
His creations were pure magic! Every stitch in the outfits was so neat and true and the cut was exquisite! The suits were authentic masterpieces of sartorial splendour. This self-effacing master tailor ran his business with boundless energy, greeting clients, overseeing his staff, doing some of the intricate detail work himself. Yes, Mr. Mayer had incredible pride of accomplishment and could measure you to perfection. You had the suit hanging on your body as naturally as if you had been born wearing it.
But he too was enamoured by the zipper as opposed to trouser buttons because as he rightly surmised they give you an elegant flat front without the slightest hint of a bulge. I heard him once sounding a warning to a habitual ‘knickerless’ male: “It’s always better to safeguard Solomon Grundy by always slipping on an undie.” As one die-hard, anti-underwear chappie said, about zippered slacks: “That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth.”
That is because one slip of the zip could give incurable males with an anathema for underwear a painful nip on the pip or even worse, an excruciating rip.
For as long as I can remember people have been debating whether zippers are superior to buttons as a method of keeping the fly shut. But still the zipper has won a lot more people over. But they both have pros and cons. The zipper is effective in that you can pretty much operate it with only one hand. On the other hand you run a risk of the zipper getting stuck, and snagging a vital part of your anatomy. Zipper-dee-doo-dah!
For the preferred method of closure, it’s a battle fought between two camps, button believers and zipper zealots, with each side insisting their accoutrement superior. Buttons are easy to undo, but you’re going to need two hands to shut them, which might be too much effort for some people.
But again a button almost never breaks, and if it does you only sew in a new one. The closure debate goes beyond just a question of ‘old school’ versus ‘new wave.’ It is also one of function. In terms of the technical adeptness required, most concur that the more efficient zipper wins out, with an undeniable convenience that keeps pace with our modern high-speed world. Besides as I see it zipper has a certain panache to it and sounds way cooler than button.
Apart from the occasional male model who, we are assured, is making some sort of gaping statement on the catwalk, an open fly is a little lighthouse that beams out to the world not only that you’ve had a wardrobe malfunction, but also that you are still unaware.
During the old button-up era an open fly was brought to the attention of the unsuspecting wearer quietly with the abbreviation TBO, meaning Trouser Button Open. Cousin Arlen’s warning on the same issue was far more mischievous and intriguing when he laughingly whispered to the unwary victim: “Hey man, Tiny Baby Out!”My brother Denis goes entirely the other way around and takes a leaf from the common book of prayer: “We have left undone those things which we ought to have done!”
But the times certainly are a-changing. And so are the kids who have become more precocious than the older generations have their own zip codes. Many kids I know deal with this issue in a matter-of-fact way. A zipper is open. The kid walks up to its owner and resorts to acronym : “XYZPDQ”. Unsure the guy exclaims: “Huh? What does that mean?” The kid replies: “Examine Your Zipper Pretty Darn Quick!” He looks down, surprised. Zips it up. End of issue.
When the subject came up for debate whether to tell someone about the embarrassing gap in his pants or not our computer whiz grandson Rex Tharindu said: “I would tell him he has windows on his laptop.”
But his kid brother Kingsley took a leaf, not from old Father Adam’s underwear, but from his newly learned kindergarten song and dance routine to steal the thunder. With a mischievous glint in his eye he took a lyrical excerpt from ‘That’s the way the money goes.’ He said with brevity: “I would tell him. Pop goes the weasel!”
