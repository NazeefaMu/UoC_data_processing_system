Hospital Director intervenes to provide denied treatment for patients

Forty six patients who arrived at the Anuradhapura Hospital Day Surgery Ward to get consulted from Eye Surgeon Dr. Nalinda Samarakoon on August 14 were ordered to get away from the clinic by another consultant doctor.
The patients later complained of the issue to the Hospital Director Dr. Lionel Muhandiram, who intervened and let them obtain treatment from Dr. Nalinda Samarakoon.
