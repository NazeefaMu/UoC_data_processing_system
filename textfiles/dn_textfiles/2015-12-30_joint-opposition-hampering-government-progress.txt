Joint-opposition hampering government progress

The joint-opposition of the country is attempting to prevent the people-friendly journey of the government in order to fulfill their personal desires for power, Deputy Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Karunaratne Paranawithana said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, the Deputy Minister said the joint-opposition is a collective of defeated politicians, persons with criminal records, thieves,and racists, etc.
He said the present government is a labour-friendly government which will fulfill the requirements of working community of the country:
“The present government has changed the way of using bullets to respond to trade union requests,” he said. The Deputy Minister urged the general public not to be misled by the insane political slogans of an unholy alliance.
Responding to the request made by MP Gammanpila to hoist black flags in houses, shops and vehicles, the Deputy Minister said: “On January 8th , we raise the lions flags for the sake of democracy, freedom and the good governance of the country.
People of this country do not want to see black flags in their houses at the dawn of the new year.”
