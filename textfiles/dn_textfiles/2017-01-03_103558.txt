As parents and teachers, we need to identify their temperaments and encourage them to develop those hidden talents in a good manner. Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy is the first institute in Sri Lanka that was started with this aim and uses drama, dancing, singing, speech and other aspects of performing arts to develop leadership skills and the personality of children in this country. We are also focusing on entrepreneurship, public speaking and debating, critical analysis and team building activities to build up the character of young children.”
