Confidence instilled by new selectors a key to success - Gurusinha

ABU DHABI: Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that the confidence instilled on the players by the new selection panel headed by former Sri Lanka speedster Graeme Labrooy has brought about an “unbelievable improvement” in some of the players and contributed immensely towards Sri Lanka pulling off a stunning 21-run win over Pakistan in the first Test played at Abu Dhabi on Monday.
“It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where it started to go right but the pre-tour five-day program which we put together got on very well and got the team together. It was the confidence that everyone was giving the team,” said Gurusinha who was a member of the previous selection committee as well as the present one.
“The first thing we wanted was to have a stable environment so that players are not going to the middle and thinking ‘will I play tomorrow’. That’s the worst thing to do. Our main goal was to give that confidence to the players and talk to them individually. All the selectors spoke to most of the players individually and told them how important they are to this side. If there are any areas to improve we addressed those with the players,” he said.
“I’ve seen unbelievable improvement in some of the players not on the playing side because we knew their talent but it’s the whole focus of what they do and confidence. Some of the players actually came upto me and said ‘I need to thank the guys who helped me here’.”
Comparing the two selection committees Gurusinha said, “I was actually part of the early selection committee for three months but when there is a change, players also have a different focus on things and that’s what the new selectors have done talking to the players and giving them confidence. The earlier selectors did a lot of hard work but when you lose, at the end of the day you are responsible, you can’t run away from it. It’s changing and the players are binding a lot together here and most probably one of the other major aspects is playing away from Sri Lanka. The pressure was so much in Colombo they are enjoying more privacy here and that’s helping them as well.”
“They don’t work as seniors and juniors they work as one team. The senior players are actually disciplining the juniors and that’s the best way to build a good culture in a sporting team. Chandi (Chandimal) and the senior players have taken ownership on that and even at training you see it is the senior players who are running around a lot and the new guys also have to do it. Kaushal Silva coming into the side on the first day when we had a very tough session he did 3 to 4 laps on his own. Nobody told him to do. That’s the kind of leadership these guys are bringing into the team,” Gurusinha said.
TOUGHEST PERIOD
The win over Pakistan was a long awaited one considering the criticism and pressure the team had to undergo in the past six months that the country’s cricketing stocks come plummeting down with a maiden Test loss to Bangladesh, a maiden ODI series loss to Zimbabwe and a total whitewash across all three formats against India.
“Most probably it was the toughest in a cricket environment that I have gone through,” described Gurusinha those six months.
“I realised that I need to get through this first and we were beaten by a good side yes, and there were other issues in selections but we had a lot of faith in this young team and that’s the reason that we kept going. It is all history now what happened but I wouldn’t say that I am relieved.
“I am very happy for the team because at the end of the day we can be here today and gone tomorrow but the players are the ones who suffered in that Indian series. I am really happy for those guys because they suffered a lot,” he said.
The win actually was achieved in the absence of Angelo Mathews, the former captain and the most experienced batsman in the side who failed to make the tour for the first Test with a calf strain and most unlikely to be out of the second Test that is starting at Dubai on Friday.
“Angelo has been a great cricketer for Sri Lanka he is injured and we can’t go back and think about where he is. We had a lot of confidence with this team and we picked the best side,” said Gurusinha. “Playing Dickwella at six and Dilruwan coming in at seven we knew the team was well balanced on this track. A lot of people questioned when we played the fifth bowler with Dilruwan and it paid off at the end because we realised this wicket was going to be tough. We missed Angelo but the other guys stepped up very well.”
For the first 11 of the 15 sessions of the Test it seemed the game was doomed for a draw as both sides played cautious cricket until things started to happen in the final session of the fourth day where four Sri Lanka wickets fell and was followed by a further 16 wickets on the fifth and final day.
“I feel yesterday (fourth day) the last one and a half hour we played negative cricket and we got Pakistan into the game. I feel Pakistan played negative cricket today (fifth day). They were just trying to hang around and this is not a track when the loose ball is there you’ve got to go for it and rotate the strike,” said Gurusinha.
“We went into a big shell yesterday and we lost four wickets. If you look at those wickets it was not taken by the bowlers we gave some of them. Both sides went into a negative mind set and thought more about the wicket rather than playing the ball. It is a very tough wicket to play and Yasir Shah turned a lot because he is a wrist spinner and he can do it. But our guys also showed how tough it is if you bowl straight, there is a lot of chance of getting wickets.”
PRAISE FOR TOP PERFORMERS
Gurusinha said that Lakshan Sandakan who is also a wrist spinner were two different bowlers. “The speed of the wrist is the reason that Yasir got so much turn and bounce whereas Sandakan is a bit slower through the air but still a wicket taking bowler. The score wasn’t enough for us to take a risk with him but luckily Rangana and Dilruwan did it. Otherwise we had the option of going to Sandakan and seeing what he can do.”
On veteran spinner Rangana Herath’s outstanding bowling performance where he took a match bag of eleven wickets and became the first left-arm spinner to cross the 400-wicket barrier in Test cricket, Gurusinha said, “He is a legend. He came in for about 10 minutes and i actually went up to him and said, ‘I don’t care what you do, I want you to get out there and play the whole day’. He replied, ‘Don’t worry I will be there till the last ball’. I knew he will give everything he’s got and that kind of character is very rare in a lot of team’s these days. Sri Lanka is very lucky to have him. He might give us another year but we will play it by ear with him.”
There were also two other significant performances that contributed towards the Lanka victory. Skipper Dinesh Chandimal’s first innings marathon effort of 155 not out and wicket-keeper/batsman Niroshan Dickwella’s two matured knocks of 83 and 40 not out that gave Sri Lanka a second innings total barely enough to bowl Pakistan out.
“Chandi’s was a real Test innings and captain’s innings. It’s not just occupying the crease but the way he batted and the way he built partnerships with a couple of players to get us the score. He led from the front and that is leadership we are looking at and Chandi is giving us tenfold,” said Gurusinha.
“We had a nice long chat with Dickwella in Colombo and he is one person we said is how important is to this team. He threw his wicket away against India so many times but still scored a lot of runs. Our main thing was to tell him to start scoring those big runs because he can still do it without those fancy shots.
“He changed his mind set with our batting coaches Hashan (Tillakaratne) and with Nic Pothas (head coach) with whom he worked very hard. He eventually came up with his own plan how he would tackle. That’s the attitude he’s got now very focussed and, he knows what he wants to achieve. He knows there is a long future for him. The future is in his hands and he is showing more maturity, he said.
