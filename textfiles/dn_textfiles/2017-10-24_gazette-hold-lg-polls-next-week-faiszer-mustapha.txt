Gazette to hold LG polls next week: Faiszer Mustapha

 
The gazette notification allowing Local Government election polls to be held next year will be issued next week, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha said today.
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said last month that the Local Government polls would most likely fall on January 6, 20 or 27, next year.
