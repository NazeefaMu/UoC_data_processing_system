SLFP will not participate in PJP MayDay rally

No Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) member will take part in the May Day rally organised by the G.L. Peiris-headed Podu Jana Peramuna, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
Amaraweera said, “The SLFP this year will hold a May Day rally which will go down the annals as one of the most successful. I have no doubt that SLFP members will turn in their numbers at Getambe, Kandy, for this historic rally.”
Speaking at a public event in Colombo, Amaraweera said that the political party, led by former minister Peiris, was not affiliated to the UPFA.
“The popularity of this party will no doubt be revealed at the upcoming May Day celebrations,” he added.
