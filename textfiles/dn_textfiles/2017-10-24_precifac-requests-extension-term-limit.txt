PRECIFAC requests extension of term limit

 
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has submitted a request to extend its term in order to prepare its report.
PRECIFAC Secretary H.W. Gunadasa said they are yet to receive an official response regarding the request.
According to Gunadasa, the request for an extension was sent two weeks ago.
The term of the Commission is due to end on November 3.
Meanwhile, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue received an extension of six weeks to submit its report.
Thus the new deadline for the report submission will be on December 8.
The mandate period of the Commission to end investigations is on October 27.
The Commission concluded its hearings on October 8.
