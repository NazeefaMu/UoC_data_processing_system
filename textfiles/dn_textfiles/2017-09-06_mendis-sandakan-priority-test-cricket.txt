Mendis, Sandakan priority for Test cricket

Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that special priority will be given to batsman Kusal Mendis and left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan to play Test cricket over one-day matches.
“We rested Kusal for the fifth ODI and the T20I and we haven’t played him in the T20Is against Bangladesh either. At this stage we don’t want to play him in T20s we prefer to wait for another 6-12 months before we look at playing him in that format,” said Gurusinha who is also a national cricket selector.
“Kusal will probably not be playing the T20Is against Pakistan either. We just want him to focus on Tests and ODI cricket for him to get first established and then look at the T20. He is a player for the future and we prefer to work with him closely.”
On Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman, Gurusinha said, “We want Sandkan to settle down in Tests first because he is a wicket-taker. Without putting him into Tests, ODIs and T20Is we first want him to play only Tests for the next six months or so. Once he has settled down and has more control and confidence we can get him into the ODIs. These are the guys in the next 5-10 years who will be the main players that people will talk about.” - ST
