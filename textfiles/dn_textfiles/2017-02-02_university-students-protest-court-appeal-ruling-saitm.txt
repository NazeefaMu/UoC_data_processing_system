University students protest Court of Appeal ruling on SAITM

 
Over 2,000 university students are currently marching into Colombo Fort in protest of the Court of Appeal ruling on the SAITM medical degree.
On Tuesday (Jan. 31) the Court of Appeal ruled that the SAITM medical degree was lawful and that SAITM students could register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
The protesting university students are demanding the closure of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) on the basis that the court order would lead to the privatization of the country's education system.
The protest march into Colombo Fort has caused heavy traffic on the roads. 
Anti-riot squads have been deployed in anticipation of unrest, Police said.
