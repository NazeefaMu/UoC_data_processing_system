UNP leaders concerned over delays of judicial enforcement: Minister

Expressing concerns about delays with regard to instituting legal action against fraud and corruption committed in the past, United National Party heavyweight and Cabinet Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera yesterday said, UNP leaders have raised their concerns about Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha. Minister Perera said, “As a government with responsibility to fight corruption and to empower key government institutions and the Judiciary and commissions of inquiry on corruption or crime-related offences to assist that fight, there should be a commitment on the part of the government to prosecute the corrupt on a priority basis.”
Minister Ravi Karunanayaka matched the government’s words with deed by resigning from his post to safeguard the government’s commitment to anti-corruption, so that investigators evaluate allegations against him and ascertain the truth, he said. “He set an example, “the minister said and added,” Parliamentarian Thilak Marapona has been appointed as the Foreign Affairs Minister, the post held by Karunanayaka. On an earlier occasion, Marapona resigned from his portfolio pending an investigation, of which he came out with a clear name.” Asked if there is a possibility of presenting a no-confidence motion against Justice Minister Wijeydasa Rajapaksa, Minister Perera said, “ the party leadership has not discussed such a move against Minister Rajapaksha.” “The UNP has voiced that the cases of the infested past too be brought to light,” he said.
