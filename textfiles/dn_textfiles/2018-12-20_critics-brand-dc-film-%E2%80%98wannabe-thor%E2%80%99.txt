Critics brand DC film  ‘wannabe Thor’

Warner Bros has finally unveiled its standalone ‘Aquaman’ film, directed by James Wan, after what seems like an eternity of promotion.
Having made his debut in 2016 film ‘Batman v Superman’, the character – real name Arthur Curry – is only just receiving the solo treatment in a spectacle starring original ‘Game of Thrones’ actor Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and, in what was originally a secret role, Julie Andrews.
Compared with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the majority of films released as part of the DC Extended Universe have had a fairly rough ride with the critics: ‘Batman v Superman’ was maligned, as were mash-ups ‘Suicide Squad’ – which starred Jared Leto as Joker – and ‘Justice League’.
The jewel in its crown thus far has been ‘Wonder Woman’, the Gal Gadot-starring period adventure which made Patty Jenkins the most successful female director of all time.
But what’s the verdict on Aquaman? If the first reactions were anything to go by, it seemed the fish king could sit alongside ‘Wonder Woman’ as a DCEU success story - however, the consensus among professional critics has been far more lukewarm, with IndieWire branding the character a “wannabe Thor.”
