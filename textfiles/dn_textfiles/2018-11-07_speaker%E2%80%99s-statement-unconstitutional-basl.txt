Speaker’s statement unconstitutional - BASL

The appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa by President Maithripala Sirisena complies fully with the Constitution, Bar Association of Sri Lanka President U. R. De Silva, PC, said yesterday.
The BASL President while stressing that the statement made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is unconstitutional said the President enjoys the exclusive power with regard to the prorogation and reconvening of Parliament. It can also be dissolved after four and a half years under the Constitution.
“Article 70 of the Constitution ensures that President has full authority for the prorogation, reconvening, dissolution of Parliament after four and half years of Parliament and the conclusion of a Parliament session,” he added. He said the President has the full authority to determine the date of reconvening Parliament and the Speaker can only make a request when Parliament is prorogued by the President. The Speaker can do nothing but make arrangements for the inauguration of the next Parliamentary session after the publication of the gazette notification on reconvening Parliament by the President.
