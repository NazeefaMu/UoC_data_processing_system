A bouquet to Higher Education Minister

At a time when inhuman ragging in universities has become a national scandal, the Higher Education Minister is attempting to put the house in order. Over the last few decades, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that the learned minister now has a formidable task.
Leaving aside petty politics, cheap popularity and sanctimonious humbugging, it is the duty of the whole nation to support the minister to the hilt.
Any person who derives pleasure by inflicting physical pain on a fellow human being is a sadist - a person with a sick mind.
Such persons must be prevented from roaming the sanctuary of the university premises to torture fellow students.
The complacency and the lackadaisical attitude of university teachers seemed to have exacerbated the problem. Their policy of non-interference may have encouraged the sick minds. Media conferences will not simply absolve the dons. As an octogenarian grandfather of a university student, I earnestly request the learned minister to take a closer look at all institutions of higher education in the country.
Elsewhere in the world universities are the birthplaces of amazing new inventions and theories. Have our universities not failed miserably in this sphere? Unfortunately, our university teachers appear to prefer Facebook and Twitter, to the laboratory and the library.
No wonder Sri Lanka has failed to produce one single Nobel Prize winner for the last one hundred years.
