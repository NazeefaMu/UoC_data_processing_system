Minister Nimal thanks Janith

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday expressed his gratitude and presented a letter of commendation to Janith Dimantha Withaanarachchi for providing his expertise and technical assistance to repair the Colombo bound express train which came to a halt in a jungle area known as Mahagalkadawalain in Galgamuwa causing great inconvenience to passengers on September 19.
Janith Dimantha is pursuing his higher studies at a private university after completing his education at the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute in Moratuwa.
The No. 4021 express train operating from Jaffna to Colombo was subjected to a technical fault and came to a halt in Mahagalkadawalain and even railway technicians were not in a position to make it operational again.
