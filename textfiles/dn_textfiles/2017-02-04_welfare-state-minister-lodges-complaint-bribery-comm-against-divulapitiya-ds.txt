Welfare State Minister lodges complaint at Bribery Comm. against Divulapitiya DS

Social Empowerment and Welfare State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission regarding the irregularities of the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat yesterday.
Speaking to the ‘Daily News,’ the Sate Minister said that four tipper trucks owned by a ‘Grama Niladhari’ under the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat had allegedly used them at the illegal soil excavation site in Divulapitiya. These Government employees engage in corruption when they were the ones who were responsible in tracing down irregularities and producing the offenders before law, Ramanayake added. He also said that he would be fighting against illegal soil mining and other environmentally harmful activities until they are stopped.
