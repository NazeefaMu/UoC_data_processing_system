16 Army  personnel  suspended for inappropriate behaviour

Sixteen Army personnel including Officer In-charge of Horowpathana Army Camp were arrested and suspended from service on Saturday for inappropriate behaviour.
This was followed by a quarrel between two drunken groups who attended a Musical Show that night in Horowpathana. A security officer of the Horowpathana Army Camp was also in the incident, and he was rescued by the Officer In-charge.
 
It was reported that around 12 personnel from the Army Camp behaved inappropriately in front of the Horowpathana Police station on Sunday. They also had created a fuss by shooting at the sky in the town. Horowpathana Police are investigating.
