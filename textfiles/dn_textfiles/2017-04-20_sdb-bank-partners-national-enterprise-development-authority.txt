SDB bank partners with National Enterprise Development Authority

SDB bank (SANASA Development Bank PLC), a pioneering financial institution founded on supporting the grassroots levels of Sri Lanka recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) to further extend its support to the Micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.
The MoU primarily aims to encourage and guide prospective entrepreneurs in the rural communities while further uplifting existing business players in the Micro, small and medium enterprises.
National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), an institution established under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce currently serves the MSME sector with 235 development officers attached to the Divisional secretariats, to elevate Sri Lankan Enterprises to be an integral part of the economy.
Commenting on the MOU signed with SANASA Development Bank PLC, Omar Kamil – Chairman of NEDA said, “This new partnership will certainly add value to the work being carried out by NEDA currently as we now stand as a consolidated business development service provider to the prospective entrepreneurs in the country.
We selected SDB as our partner in this instance as we identified them as an entity that spoke the same language as us. Being a financial institution extremely receptive to the needs of the grass roots of our country, their goals aptly complement our vision. Moreover, as we both intend to widen the scope of the SME sector in the country, it was easy to venture into this business partnership and lay out our objectives”.
NEDA has been conducting a graduate entrepreneurship program since year 2014, where 100 second year students are selected every year and granted the necessary financial support and guidance to execute their business idea.
We are also working collaboratively with SDB bank on an incubator technology transfer center in the Wayamba University which will facilitate the research process required to test an innovative business idea.
The necessary research equipment has been carefully chosen based on the industries in demand in the surrounding areas to optimize effectiveness of this project.
