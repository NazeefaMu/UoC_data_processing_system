Case against Range Bandara fixed for December 12

A case filed against Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Palitha Range Bandara for allegedly obtaining Rs. 5.4 million by dishonestly inducing a person to deliver a vehicle registration permit, was yesterday fixed for December 12 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the Court was informed that the Attorney General is expecting to deliver his opinion regarding the defence claims that the case cannot be maintained.
"The Attorney General is perusing the facts presented by both defence and complainant regarding the maintainability of the case," Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake said.
Filing the indictments in the Colombo High Court, the Attorney General maintained that the State Minister had committed this offence on or around March 22, 2002 in Madiwela after dishonestly inducing a person called Dinesh Ratnayake to deliver a vehicle registration permit for a luxury jeep (WP GK 4271) after a period of five years.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Section 403 of the Penal Code and listed 49 persons as witnesses in the case. Furthermore, the AG listed 36 documents as production items of the case.
At a previous occasion, State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and another person were acquitted and released from another connected case by the Colombo High Court following the virtual complainant's decision not to proceed with the case.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the Attorney General.
