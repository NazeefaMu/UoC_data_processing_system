‘Spider Boy’ breaks world contortion record

A 13-year-old Palestinian boy has twisted his way into the record books. Mohammed Alsheikh of Gaza broke the world record for most full body revolutions maintaining a chest stand in one minute, according to Guinness World Records.
Alsheikh, aka Spider Boy, managed to run around his seemingly elastic body 38 times during his record attempt in Amman, Jordan.
This is one time where a GIF really is worth a thousand words. Alsheikh smashed the previous record of 29, set earlier this month by circus performer Leilani Franco. Hopefully, Franco won’t get bent out of shape - Wait! That’s her job. She still holds a world record for the fastest time to travel 20 meters in a contortion roll (17.47 seconds) and the fastest human backbend walk (20 meters in 10.05 seconds).
Alsheikh is proud to have the record but still looks to Franco as an inspiration.
“I’m very excited that I have achieved a Guinness World Records title and I managed to exceed the previous record holder who was a lot older than me,” he told Guinness.
