A gentleman sportsman as head of CB

So after much deliberation we finally have a Governor appointed for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan economist who is also a gentleman sportsman to the very letter.
Dr Coomaraswamy is not new to the Central Bank because he had served there in the Economic Research, Statistics and Bank Supervision divisions since 1973 and as a staff officer till 1989. From 1981 to 1989 he was seconded to the Ministry of Finance and Planning before moving onto work in the Commonwealth Secretariat from 1990-2008 holding the posts of Director, Economic Affairs Division and Deputy-Director, Secretary-General’s Office and later to head the Social Transformation Programme Division as interim director.
While Dr Coomaraswamy’s career as an economist has been penned in the news pages following his appointment as the new Governor of Central Bank we like to take stroll along memory lane and pen a few words about his career as a sportsman where he represented Royal College, Colombo, Harrow School in England, Cambridge University and University of Sussex.
Although Dr Coomaraswamy had his formal education at Royal College he was admitted by his father Rajendra ‘Raju’ Coomaraswamy (an iconic diplomat affectionately nick-named ‘Roving Raju’) to Harrow for higher studies. By the age of 14 he played in the Harrow first eleven cricket team at the Mecca of cricket – Lord’s against traditional rivals Eton. He captained Harrow in 1967 and the following year he led them to beat Eton by seven wickets with a match bag of 12 wickets for 92 runs. Coomaraswamy took 7 for 42 off 21.4 overs to dismiss Eton for 210 in the first innings and 5 for 50 off 24 overs in the second innings when they were shot out for 141. Coomaraswamy’s contribution with the bat was 34 and 8.
Wisden Cricketers’ Almanac referred to as the ‘Bible of cricket’ said, “… some commendably accurate and well flighted left-arm slow bowling by Coomaraswamy, made this a notable match”.
In 1971 and 1972 he played first-class cricket and rugby for Cambridge University. Returning to Sri Lanka Dr Coomaraswamy was a part of the Tamil Union cricket team that played in the division I inter-club tournament. He was vice-captain to S Skandakumar in the year Tamil Union won and lost the Lakspray trophy on a technical point to Bloomfield in 1983.
Going down memory lane Skandakumar reflected, “Against CCC in a tough P. Sara game on their grounds prior to that season he (Dr Coomaraswamy) and I shared a 154-run partnership to get us out of a hole and clinch that match.”
Describing the appointment of Dr Coomaraswamy as Central Bank Governor as “an excellent choice” Skandakumar who is presently the Sri Lanka High Commissioner in Australia illustrated him thus “Gentlemen do not come any better than him ......anywhere in the world!”
Although he performed well at cricket and rugby Dr Coomaraswamy once confessed that his first love was rugby. He captained Harrow for three years and also CR&FC and later led Sri Lanka in the 1974 Rugby Asiad in Japan to become runner-up which he treasures as one of the unforgettable moments of his sporting career.
His late uncle Sathi Coomaraswamy, an opening bowler was captain of the All-Ceylon cricket team of the fifties and was long active in Sri Lanka cricket administration that included being chairman of selectors.
In an interview when asked to pick his cricketing and rugby idols Dr Coomaraswamy chose Michael Tissera (the former Sri Lanka captain) and Sir Garfield Sobers (former West Indies captain) at cricket and said his rugby idol was Sari de Sylva ‘one of the best the country has produced’.
A MUCH NEEDED CHANGE
The ICC has finally decided to cut down on the massive advantage given to umpire’s on the lbw referrals which at times on television replays looked simply ridiculous when the ball tracker showed the ball to be hitting middle stump and because it was an umpire’s call the decision being ruled not out.
Now from October 1 the ICC has decided to modify the umpire's call aspect of lbw referrals. For on-field lbw decisions to be overturned, half of the ball would now need to hit any part of the stumps. Earlier, half of the ball needed to hit a zone between the middle of off stump and the middle of leg stump.
The ICC’s chief executive Dave Richardson has said this has been made possible because of the MIT testing had proved ball tracking was good enough. "And for that reason we are able to safely reduce the margin of uncertainty or the umpire's call as we refer to. Because the middle of the ball was just marginally, one millimetre, to the right of centre of the stump, then the umpire's decision wasn't reversed. So what we have done really is just made that margin of uncertainty slightly bigger. Now the middle of the ball must be in line with the stump, which means half of the ball hitting the stump is going to be given out in the future.”
All bowlers will welcome the change and batsmen must be wary not to use their pads too much when defending.
