Zaman career best 61 underpins Pakistan

Harare, Sunday: Pakistan cruised to a 74-run win Sunday over their hosts in the opening match of the Zimbabwe Twenty20 Tri-Series.
A career best 61 from opening batsman Fakhar Zaman, and a late flurry of boundaries from Asif Ali and veteran batsman Shoaib Malik set up Pakistan’s imposing 182 for 4.
In reply, Zimbabwe mustered just 108 all out, with the wickets shared around Pakistan’s bowling attack. Mohammad Nawaz, Usman Khan, Mohammad Hafeez and Hasan Ali picked up two apiece.
“We decided that whether we batted or bowled first didn’t really matter,” said left-arm spinner Nawaz. “But with the start Fakhar Zaman gave us, and with Asif Ali and Shoaib Malik finishing it off, we felt we had enough runs.”
Zaman’s efforts were vital to Pakistan’s total. He kept Pakistan steady through the first half of their innings while Zimbabwe, having opted to bowl first, chipped away at the other end with regular strikes.
With Mohammad Hafeez, Hussain Talat, and captain Sarfraz Ahmed all falling cheapy, Pakistan were helped by Zaman’s fluent scoring at the other end, and he brought up his second T20 international half century from 33 deliveries with a flick through square leg in the 13th over.
Zaman appeared settled at the crease, but two overs later he missed a heave at Chisoro and had his leg stump pegged back. AFP
