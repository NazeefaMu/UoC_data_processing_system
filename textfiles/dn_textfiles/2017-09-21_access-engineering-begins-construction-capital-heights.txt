Access Engineering begins construction of Capital Heights

Construction of the 242-unit Capital Heights luxury apartment project commenced on September 18, when Blue Star Realties (Pvt) Ltd., a member of Access Engineering PLC, formally received China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) to the site in Buthgamuwa Road, Rajagiriya.
CSCEC mobilised its team to the site, in association with Access Projects (Pvt) Ltd., as the Piling Division of Access Engineering PLC successfully completed the piling stage of the venture.
Speaking at the mobilisation ceremony, Access Group Chairman Sumal Perera said, “Capital Heights is already receiving great interest from Sri Lankans living overseas, who are keen to invest in a home that is away from the busy city, yet with all the modern conveniences and ease of access. China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd., in association with Access Projects (Pvt) Ltd. and the other partners on this project, are leaders in their speciality and together with them, we hope to deliver homes that balance construction excellence with low maintenance and comfortable living.”
Set in the idyllic backdrop of the Diyawanna Oya, this venture of Access Engineering PLC will see 242 apartments in two and three-bedroom configurations and 10 plush penthouses crowning the property. The location, just minutes away from all conveniences and government services, offers residents the tranquillity of living close to one of Colombo’s thriving wetlands. The apartments will be ready for occupancy in March 2020.
“Buthgamuwa Road, Rajagiriya, known as the Manhattan of Sri Lanka, with the backdrop of Diyawanna Oya is a much sought after residential location and Capital Heights will boost its property value further. Access Engineering PLC is a name synonymous in the area, having built the bridge across the Diyawanna Oya and now fast completing the Rajagiriya flyover,” said Rajitha Jayasuriya, Director Sales and Marketing of Blue Star Realties (Pvt) Ltd., the developing arm of this high-rise project.
Access Engineering PLC has gained a reputation for setting the benchmark in construction excellence, building quality residential and commercial spaces and its contribution to the development of national infrastructure. Its partnership with CSCEC, which is listed at 24 on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2017, reinforces Access Engineering PLC’s commitment to quality and engineering excellence to create ideal living and working spaces for the modern Sri Lanka.
Access Engineering PLC recently opened doors to Access Tower 2, a 30 story A-Grade office tower, adding 190,000 square feet of rentable office space was reserved 3 months prior to the opening of the building.
