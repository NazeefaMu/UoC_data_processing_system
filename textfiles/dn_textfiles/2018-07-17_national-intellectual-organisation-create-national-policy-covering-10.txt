National Intellectual Organisation to  create national policy covering 10 sectors

A National Intellectual Organisation has been set up to create a national policy in respect of 10 important sectors to find lasting solutions to current problems in Sri Lanka. The organisation comprising university dons, professors, lawyers and professionals numbering over 150 was formed during a seminar held at the Maharagama National Youth Services Council, a member of the organisation Attorney Upul Kumarapperuma said. He said it has been planned to introduce this national policy in respect of education, health, economic, agriculture, transport, Sri Lankan community, art and culture, fisheries and environment as well as several other vital sectors of the country.
The intellectuals involved in the exercise were also introduced during the seminar held at the NYSC. Kumarapperuma said instead of finding piecemeal solutions to country's problems cropping up from time to time lasting solutions should be found to overall problems to ensure an environment free from problems to the country and the future generation.
