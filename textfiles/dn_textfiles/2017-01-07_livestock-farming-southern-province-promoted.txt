Livestock farming in Southern Province promoted

Southern Provincial Animal Productions and Health Department has taken measures to promote regional livestock development projects.
Diary families were given hybrid milch cows, equipment and materials to construct cattle sheds. They receive mineral mixtures, fodders and grass as well.
Hybrid goats and materials for sheds were also given.
A modern incubator and a separate factory were established at the Kekanadura Livestock Farm to produce quality animal food.
Regional Animal Productions Development Director H.B.S. Ramanayake said all these development programme were carried out under the initiatives of the department.
