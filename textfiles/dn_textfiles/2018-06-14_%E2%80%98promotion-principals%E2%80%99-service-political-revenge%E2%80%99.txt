‘Promotion to Principals’  Service for political revenge’

Convener of principals’ and teachers’ trade union collective, Joseph Stalin told the Daily News that 800 teachers are going to be promoted to the Principals’ Service illegally, for political revenge.
Several trade unions of principals and teachers organised a protest in front of Isurupaya yesterday urging the Education Ministry to stop political appointments to the Principals’ Service and to redress 18 long-felt issues relating to their services.
When asked the reason for the protest, Stalin told the Daily News that around 800 teachers who have not fulfilled the necessary qualification to be promoted to the Principals’ Service, are going to be offered Grade 1, 2 and 3 principal appointments, for political revenge.
“Even though there are vacancies in the Principals’ Service, those vacancies should be filled with suitable and qualified persons in a proper manner,” Stalin added.
However, the Education Ministry Secretary promised the collective to look into the matter when a representation of the protesters had a discussion with him yesterday. The Secretary has further promised to issue a gazette notification next week in this regard, Education Ministry sources said.
