Bangladesh debutant teenager puts England in a spin

Chittagong: Teenage debutant Mehedi Hasan claimed five wickets for 64 runs to stun England’s top order and give Bangladesh the upper hand in the first Test in Chittagong on Thursday.
Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow scored half-centuries each as England reached 258-7 at stumps on the first day, after skipper Alastair Cook elected to bat first at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium.
Moeen survived five reviews on his way to smashing 68 runs and Bairstow made 52 as England steadied against some superb bowling from Bangladesh’s spinners to post a respectable score.
Chris Woakes was 36 not out and Adil Rashid unbeaten on five.
Experienced left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan finished the day with 2-46 to complement 18-year-old Mehedi, who became the seventh Bangladeshi bowler to take five wickets in his Test debut.
“I never expected such a debut of this kind,” Mehedi said. “I thought that I would pick up two wickets and score 30 runs but what happened is something I will remember all my life.”
Mehedi, named player of the tournament at the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, made an immediate impression, bowling Ben Duckett for 14 before trapping Gary Ballance for one in his opening spell.
Shakib removed Cook for just four, in a disappointing start for the skipper who became England’s most capped player with 134 Tests.
Mehedi opened the attack for the hosts, beating Duckett on several occasions before he spun one beautifully to hit the middle stump as soon as the England debutant offered some room. Three balls later Cook was also gone, attempting a sweep shot off Shakib only for the ball to hit him on the forearm and then the body before smashing onto the stumps. AFP
