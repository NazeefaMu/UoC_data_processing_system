Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge’s murder case:
CID suspicious of Hettige’s visit, want more security for suspects

The CID investigating into the murder of senior journalist and Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge's murder said the CID is suspicious of former president’s parliament affairs secretary Kumarasiri Hettige's visit to former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara (third suspect) in the guise of visiting former MP Duminda Silva.
The CID officers made this submission before Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohomed Mihal when the Lasantha Wickrematunge murder case was taken up for hearing.
CID officials submitted that statements of 18 members of the 112 Brigade have been reordered so far.
Earlier, a person named Jesudhasan was arrested and imprisoned for Lasantha’s murder and two motorcyclists had been mysteriously murdered and there were issues regarding the security of those suspects, the CID added. The CID said that they had informed the Prison authorities to take the security of the suspects, former DIG Nanayakkara and CI Sugathapala seriously, since the CID is worried of what is happening now.
The CID told court that according to investigations, the DIG had instructed Sugathapala to remove the pages of the GCIB where he had altered the notes.When Sugathapala showed his disapproval, DIG Nanayakkara had warned Sugathapala and revealed that he was following a directive. CID also said according to the findings DIG Nanayakkara told Sugathapala that the IGP had wanted to destroy the evidence leading to Wickrematunge’s murder and Nanayakkara had further asked Sugathapala whether he would like to be killed without implementing those orders.
This information had also come to light during the interrogation of SI Sugathapala. Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed by two assailants who had followed him on a motorcycle at Attidiya on January 8, 2009.
But investigations remained stagnant with no promising progress for around nine years.
However, the present government recommenced investigations under the CID and evidence pertaining to this crime has been surfacing gradually.
The Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate allowed the request of Attorney-at-law Milindu Sarathchandra to lift the travel ban on retired SSP Hemantha Adhikari (suspect). The Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate ordered to remand former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara and SI Tissa Sugathapala (second suspect) until April 9.
