Bizarre trick to concealing dark circles under eyes

Nothing screams "I had a rough night" more than those tell-tale dark circles under our eyes. That, and the fact you're mainlining fizzy pop and crisps like there's no tomorrow.
Of course, dark circles are also linked to stress, allergies - even our genetics, and they are notoriously difficult to disguise effectively. As such, there is a plethora of beauty hacks available, ranging from the simple to the extravagant.
There are eye creams, concealers and home-made remedies advising you to pat lemon juice around your eyes (which we're too scared to try). Now there's one doing the rounds which has to be seen to be believed - concealing those pesky shadows with red lipstick.
Wait, what?
It might seem like the last thing on earth which would work but beauty writers are touting it as a pretty effective concealer. As Spring St reports, it works because the red tones should cancel out the blue and purple tones under our eyes which make us look so tired.
Application is pretty easy and you can use any shade of red too. You blend the lipstick in a bit, and then apply your regular concealer over it, making sure you blend that in too.
Rather than resulting in a gory-looking mess, the combination of the red lipstick and the light concealer gives a nice pink/peach shade, which gives the appearance of a healthy flush to the tops of the cheeks. In Style
