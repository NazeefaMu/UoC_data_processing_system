Ekneligoda Habeas Corpus petition inquiry laid by

The Court of Appeal yesterday decided to lay by the inquiry into the Habeas Corpus petition filed by the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda and his two sons.
However, the Court of Appeal ordered the Homagama Magistrate to proceed with the magisterial inquiry into Ekneligoda. On October 30, 2015, the Court of Appeal issued an order to temporarily suspend the magisterial inquiry (at the Homagama Magistrate’s Court) into Ekneligoda consequent to a requirement that arose in the Habeas Corpus petition.
The Army Commander and Director of Military Intelligence who had been newly named as the respondents in the Habeas Corpus petition had sought time to file objections in respect of the petition.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal temporarily suspended the magisterial inquiry into the missing journalist until the objections were filed by two respondents.
On October 19, 2015, the Court had issued notices on the Army Commander and the Director of Military Intelligence to appear before Court in connection with the original Habeas Corpus filed by Sandya Ekneligoda and her two sons.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal granted permission to the Homagama Magistrate to summon those added as respondent to the Habeas Corpus petition including the Army Commander and Director of the Military intelligence or other officers or agents acting under their direction for the inquiry and recording of such evidence as necessary for the magisterial inquiry.
Senior Counsel Chrishmal Warnasuriya appeared for the petitioner.
