International sports Federation for persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS) successfully conducted a four day workshop for the para athletes last week to focus on the forthcoming International meet in Brisbane in October 2018.
National Paralympic Committee (NPC) headed by Major General Rajitha Ampemohotty coordinated this workshop while INAS project Manager Michael Thomson and Psychologist Peter Hyninan conducted it at the Hotel Renuka, Kollupitiiya during the four days.
Sri Lankan doctors in the Psychology field also got a chance to take part this workshop and all of them with more than 50 Intellectual Disability para athletes had a very successful work shop said President of the National Paralympic committee Major General Rajitha Ampemohotty. He also added Sri Lanka has already obtained membership from INAS with 81 other countries.
This is a good chance for the Para athletes who will take part at the Brisbane athletic meet next year. We are going to start our preparation with this workshop and a ten months period is good enough for the athletes. They are Intellectual disability athletes and we have to focus very well. The participants who were at this workshop obtained a good knowledge of International law of the para players groupings according to their disabilities.
Anula de Costa the Sri Lankan coach who lives in Australia came forward to coordinate with the NPC and INAS to conduct this program while the Sport Ministry gave good support added NPC Chief.
During the next year Intellectual disability players meet in Brisbane, games like Athletics, Table Tennis, Basketball, Cricket, Cycling (indoor and outdoor road race), Horse Racing, Futsal Handball, Para Hockey, Rowing, Taekwondo, Tennis, Marathon and Half Marathon , Cross country race, and Indoor Athletics sports will be conducted and NPC already plan to select the players for a few games which have facilities here in Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lankan para athletes bagged 14 medals at the recently concluded Para Asian Games in Jakartha. NPC have long term and short term plans to get successful results from the Para athletes. Already two para athletes have won the most important Paralympic medals recently” said the NPC chief.
