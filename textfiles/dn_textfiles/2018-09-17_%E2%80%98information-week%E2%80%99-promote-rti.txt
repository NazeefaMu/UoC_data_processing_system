‘Information Week’ to promote RTI

Cabinet has approved the proposal by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera to implement the mobile service ‘Right to Information to the Village’ and various competitions will be conducted in schools islandwide to make students aware of their rights under the Right to Information Act.
Sri Lanka, one of the countries which has ensured the right to information of the public, possesses the third-best Right to Information Act in the world. Accordingly, the government has declared the week from September 21 to 28 as ‘Information Week’ to make the public aware of their rights under this Act.
‘Information Week’ will coincide with the UN’s ‘International Right to Information Day’ which falls on September 28. The year 2018 has also been named the ‘Year of Public Awareness’. The mobile service and school competitions will be held under this programme.
