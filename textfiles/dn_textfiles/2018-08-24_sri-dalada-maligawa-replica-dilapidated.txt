Sri Dalada Maligawa replica dilapidated

The Kataragama Sri Dalada Maligawa replica constructed in 1978 under the Gam Udawa project, has been dilapidated for a long time.
The building was left unprotected and as such, it had become a den of illegal activities.
The Kataragama Pradeshiya Sabha had previously housed its library in the building.
Residents urged authorities to take immediate measures to renovate it.
