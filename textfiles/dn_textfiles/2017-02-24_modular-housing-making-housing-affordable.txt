Modular housing: Making housing affordable

Shelter, food and clothing are some of the most basic needs of all human beings but data from the Population and Housing Census of 2012 show that close to 3,418 families are homeless in Sri Lanka.
Adding to these numbers, the Ministry of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms as of August 2016 states that three decades of war has left 13,670 internally displaced people who need to be resettled.
Housing thus is a major challenge as well as a need at present but due to high construction costs and time taken to build a house, many have been left homeless, despite the government promising one of the most ambitious housing projects since the late 80s.
On the other hand, plans such as the Megapolis and increased urbanization will also bring with it consequences such as ‘unaffordable housing’, rendering those on the margins of the housing market, homeless.
It is amidst such problems that the option of ‘pre-fabricated’ homes have been proposed and while there are many models to be followed, a recent presentation done by Dr. Samudra Jayasekera, former National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) civil engineer and present Research Director at Modular Building systems based in Australia, has proposed the concept of ‘modular housing’.
She promises that this system would make housing affordable if done right, thus we first must understand why it is important to have a home within the reach of all.
The need to keep housing affordable
If the government ensures that all have access to a home, it will succeed in putting a stop to one of the biggest challenges any government faces; that is to put a stop to an increase in the informal housing sector. If people can afford a decent house, they are less likely to opt for a shanty.
According to the Habitat III-Sri Lanka National Report 2016, most low-income households are not ‘bankable’, “and cannot afford access to formal housing finance. The banks classify about 80% of the nation’s earners as low income. Only 20% of all low-income earners have regular employment, potentially allowing them access to bank loans for finished housing”.
This has led to the government proposing the plan of ‘Affordable Housing for All by 2020’ to develop a functioning housing market that meets the need of all segments of the population. They target to increase the supply of adequate housing to 100,000 units a year (including the improvement of existing stock) to address the backlog and ensure adequate and affordable housing for all.
“A substantial share of these annual new buildings, possibly around 40–45% in the initial years and then an even larger proportion, will be in urban areas. But meeting this target will be challenging given past trends. For example, each of the two largest municipalities – Colombo and Kandy –approves 1,000 building permits a year on average, and Galle 500”, according to the 2016 Habitat report.
However, the Habitat report also pointed out that for this to work, it was important to have the removal of, “constraints on the supply of land and housing finance that limit the production of formal housing by the private sector and that keep formal shelter beyond the reach of most of the urban population. The needs of the poorest people must also be met, through well targeted housing assistance programmes (for example, credit enhancement for affordable housing and home improvements).”
A survey carried out by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) in 2011 around Colombo estimated that 68,812 households lived in 1,499 underserved settlements, accounting for more than half the city’s population. These settlements tend to be small and scattered, and about 74% of them have less than 50 housing units.
The results also showed that even cities outside of Colombo are faced with the challenge of underserved settlements.
“In Matara, 17% of the housing stock was deemed to be unsanitary, due to the use of low quality material and unsafe locations. In Kandy, 18% of the population lived in 3,602 low-income housing units in 45 underserved settlements. Nuwara Eliya had more than 7,000 temporary houses constructed with non-permanent materials, equivalent to about 20% of the total housing stock. The suburban cities of Colombo, such as Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kollonnawa, Kotte, Moratuwa, and Wattala, have on average 10–15% of their urban housing stock at substandard quality”.
Pre- fabricated Modular housing
It is in this backdrop that we come to the concept of ‘modular housing’. The former NBRO engineer who has worked in Australia for the past few decades has returned home to propose that the NBRO take on the idea of pre- fabricated modular housing as a possible option to solve the housing crisis in Sri Lanka.
“Most believe that a house is a lifetime investment, and many will only finish construction on their house when they reach the last stages of their life. It is their biggest asset and greatest life investment,” said Dr. Jayasekera presenting her plan to the NBRO.
“Conventional housing however is also rigid and cannot be expanded. Modular pre-fabricated housing on the other hand can evolve during a lifetime,” she added.
The pre-fabricated houses are built in sections in a factory controlled environment, and she explained that site work could be started while the components are being built. The ability to build a house at a much quicker pace than traditional construction has been one of the major selling points of modular housing.
“Short timelines and reduction in overall project costs are one of the main advantages. We can also build permanent modular buildings to the same building codes as traditional buildings,” said Dr. Jayasekera.
She estimated that it would take around ‘6.5 man-days’ to build a single unit with a 2,000 sq ft house which would traditionally cost AUD 3.2 million would cost AUD 1.5 million in modular form.
A significantly streamlined construction process, earlier occupancy due to a shorter construction timeline and reduced environmental impact and various Green Building optionswere some of the other advantages of choosing a modular house.
“These are not shanties but houses providing all facilities needed for a person to live in,” Jayasekera said. She also added that contrary to popular belief that all pre-fabricated houses would look like ‘match boxes’ in a row, the houses provided the owner with the flexibility to meet any design specifications and be customized according to the needs of the environment. “It is available as a small single story building to large multi-story complexes.”
This is not the first time pre-fabricated houses have been proposed. Minister of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, D.M. Swaminathan too brought forward the idea of steel pre-fabricated houses in 2015 as a quick and easy way to build houses for IDPs in the North.
The initial project of 65,000 houses from Arcelor Mittal which was to cost an estimated US$ 1 billion faced much resistance due to the expense as well as the use of steel to build a house in the scorching heat of the North. Each house which was estimated to be built at around Rs 2.1 million however, was later brought down to Rs 1.6 million.
When Dr. Jayasekera was asked whether her own modular homes would be cheaper than steel fabricated ones, she replied in the affirmative, as steel was a much more expensive building material. “It also usually costs less than half of that of a traditional model house,” she said. The modular houses which have also been tested for extreme heat conditions in Australia would also be more suitable for conditions in the North.
Green Building
Furthermore, as energy efficiency and reducing environmental harm becomes a key consideration and Sri Lanka looks to meet its climate change goals, modular housing has sought to incorporate such considerations into its building specifications.
Hence the introduction of ‘Smart Panel Technology’ that incorporate; Smart Wall Panels, Smart Floors, Smart Ceilings, Smart Roofs and Smart Structural Connections.
According to Dr. Jayasekera’s presentation, ‘smart walls’ were the next generation of structural insulated panels (SIP) which were constructed using a superior outer membrane made of composite materials. The walls also have ‘inbuilt memory’ and ‘will generally return to its original format if damaged’.
The structure has also been tested for extreme seismic, cyclone, hurricane and landslide areas. Allowing it to withstand most natural disasters. In addition, it is not susceptible to decay, insects or termite attack and impervious to most acids and solvents.
The walls themselves are also light and can be manually handled. Dr. Jayasekera also noted that it is not only housing but also hospitals and large apartment complexes could be built using the same model.
The model though attractive has one flaw. It will only make economic sense if the units are built at a local factory, otherwise the added costs of transport would not guarantee the promised cost savings.
“We need to set up a local factory and produce houses on a mass scale to make economic sense,” quipped Dr Jayasekera who has proposed a partnership with the NBRO for such a venture.
At present her Australian company has set up a factory in Thailand where the need for modular housing has risen sharply over the years.
“If we start a manufacturing plant here, we can also create new jobs and skill sets locally. It requires a significant investment but in the long term, it is very cost effective," she said.
Smart floor and ceilingSmart Floor & Ceiling take a holistic approach to building design and construction, working in conjunction with Smart Wall to form a practical solution that results in superior insulation and strength. Floor and ceiling panels can be manufactured from 2.4 m to 3 m wide and up to a 6 m span to allow quick manual construction. For a span of more than 6 m a supporting crane is needed to install. The same smart connection type is used to join the walls, floor and ceiling resulting in less fixtures and fittings (one connection type fits all). Once locked into position this transforms the building into a solid cube, fully insulated and extremely strong. The Smart Floor base is manufactured from roll formed light weight steel with Smart Floor attached, creating an extremely strong floor, soft underfoot and able to accept most floor covering including ceramic tiles. Smart Wall can be used in traditional situations and fixed directly to concrete or timber floors and a roof system pitched directly to the walls or can be used in conjunction with Smart Floor & Ceiling.
Smart wall panel specsSmart Wall can be manufactured in lengths to suit individual building layouts and in any length (up to 12 meters due to transportation limitations if it requires transportation). The height of a single panel can be manufactured between 2.4 m up to 3 meters. Lengths of 6 meters are generally considered the optimum size for safe manual handling. Above 6 m the support of a crane in needed. The outer membrane is manufactured in 106 meter rolls for maximum panel length laminated to the core substrate. Smart Wall’s superior construction allows it to span a far greater distance than standard Structural Insulated Panels (SIP), while requiring less support and with a greater load capacity. Wall joints are rendered invisible as the connections are located in junctions or intersections within the construction. The Primary material composition for the panels include EVA (Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA),closed cell high density foam core with either phenolic FRP or epoxy FRP (Fibre-reinforced plastic) (fibreglass) structural surface skins. The perimeters of each panel beingframed with Extruded PVC frames incorporating the panel to panel connections enabling the buildings to be assembled with no individual mechanical connections. All connections are continuous accommodating the in plane and out of plane flexural resistance, diaphragm and cracking resistance and waterproofing. The material composition combined with the connection system makes the system ideal for extreme wind conditions including impact and seismic conditions.
Smart connectionsSpecially extruded connections are exclusive to our Smart Wall system. The same smart connection type is used to join the walls, floor and ceiling resulting in less fixtures and fittings. Snap the panels into place to create a secure watertight connection. A connection that is extremely difficult to take apart without the use of mechanical tools. The connection runs the entire length of the panels. The result is the formation of a cubic structure that offers strength and rigidity that traditional Structural Integrity Panels (SIP) cannot achieve.
