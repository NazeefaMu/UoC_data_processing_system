We did too many mistakes – Herath

A maiden Test defeat at the hands of Bangladesh was not the result Sri Lanka’s acting captain Rangana Herath would have scripted at the commencement of the second Test at the P Sara Oval. But it so happened, that Herath on his 39th birthday suffered his first loss as Sri Lanka captain in four Tests.
“I thought we did too many mistakes while fielding and batting. We dropped a couple of crucial catches and that was the main reason for us to lose the match,” said Herath at the post-match press conference.
Bangladesh won the second Test by four wickets to draw the two-match series one-all.
“If you take the second innings we were batting well. After Upul (Tharanga) got out, Dimuth (Karunaratne) and Kusal Mendis were going great and then we lost five wickets for 40 runs. That was the key. That turned the game. That shouldn’t have happened. That started our collapse,” said Herath.
“Before the series started I said that this was going to be a challenging one as both teams were equally balanced. We had a good chance in Galle as we got close to 500 runs. Here we couldn’t do the same. The team that played well won the game today.”
On the progress made by Bangladesh as a Test nation, Herath said, “They have certainly improved a lot. Earlier when they got partnerships going, they didn’t take pressure well. Now they counter our plans and they have been very clever.
“I thought that we could defend the target of 191. We have played games with India and Pakistan and defended low scores. So having three spinners I was confident that we could pull it off. We got two early wickets but after lunch they were attacking and the game slipped away from us.”
Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha admitted that Sri Lanka had not fielded well in the series.
“I don’t think we are one of the worst fielding sides. We dropped a few catches which is bad,” said Gurusinha.
“Working on little things is important. I am observing what we are doing well and what we are not doing well. Fielding will be one area we will focus a lot before the one-day games with coach Graham Ford. Its skill and a lot of repetition.
“It’s not the amount of time you do It’s the quality of training do. We need to improve the intensity and not the time. You can do one hour or half hour. It’s the intensity we have to concentrate on. We will increase our intensity levels in training.”
Bangladesh’s winning captain Mushfiqur Rahim owed his team’s success to how much each member valued the match.
“What made me happy was how we understood the value of the match even when we were ahead of behind in the game,” said Mushfiqur. “We tried to understand the value of a run, a misfield. Giving away runs in the first innings may not seem much at the time, but it comes back to hurt you at the end of the day.
“We tried to recognize these small things. The fact that we realised each and every bit of it was quite impressive. The batsmen and bowlers played with responsibility, which made it a happy moment for us,” he said.
“It is new for us to chase in this type of wicket on a fifth day. We needed a 50-plus opening stand, but Tamim and Sabbir really made it easy for us with their 100-plus stand. But no opposition would let us have it easy. We had the belief in the end stages, though unfortunately, we lost Shakib. We had Mosaddek and Mirza, and we thought we could do it in singles.” - ST
