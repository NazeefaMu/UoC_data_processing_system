Better environment for education sector is govt’s aim - Grero

The government’s aim is to make a better environment for education sector development since the development and progress of the education sector directly links with the overall development of the country including economic development, University Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
He made these comments after visiting the hostel construction site at the Moratuwa University on Tuesday.
The minister said the government focuses on finding a proper solution for hostel scarcity of undergraduates of every university.
"Steps have also been taken to improve the facilities of hostels aiming to create a better education environment," Grero said.
He said in line with the government’s move to provide every undergraduate with hostel facilities, another set of over 1,000 undergraduates of the Moratuwa University will receive hostel facilities under the ongoing project which is scheduled to be completed early next year.
The state minister requested the authorities to hand over the two hostels nearing completion by next January.
The two hostels will provide hostel facilities for 600 female undergraduates.
He also advised to build a new hostel for 400 male undergraduates utilising government allocations.
He also observed the on-going building construction project at the university premises.
Considering the issue of land limitation for further expansion of the university, the Sate Minister advised the university administration to look into the availability of buying two plots of lands around the university premises.
