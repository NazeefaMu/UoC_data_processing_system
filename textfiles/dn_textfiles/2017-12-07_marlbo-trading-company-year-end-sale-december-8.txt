MARLBO Trading Company year end sale from December 8

Marlbo Trading Company has made arrangements to hold a Year-End Clearance Sale from December 8 to 10 from 9.30 am to 6.30 pm at their head office premises at Abdul Gaffoor Mawatha, Colombo 03.
Marlbo Trading Company, importers and distributors of electrical equipment having been established in 1989, has reached unimaginable heights within just two decades, becoming a well-known name synonymous with quality in commercial lighting, industrial safety equipment, LT switchgear, industrial tools and testing and measuring instruments spheres. Operating under the leadership of the Proprietor, M. Maniymuthu, the dedicated sales and maintenance teams of Marlbo Trading Company are always prepared to assist their valuable customers.
The Chief Executive Officer of Marlbo Trading Company, Neel Weedagama, spoke to Daily News Business on the progress achieved by the company so far and the forthcoming sale. “At the launch of the Company, primarily our business focus was on the Power Sector products and even today, 65% – 70% of our business is derived from the Power& other Utility Sectors. Over the years we have been closely working with many prestigious international brands like, Fluke from the USA, Kyoritsu Electrical Instruments Works, Ltd. of Japan, Sensorlink Corporation of the USA, Michaud Export from France, P & B Weir Electrical from UK, Honeywell Safety Products from USA, Dubuis from France, Kulitkraf Safety Shoes from Malaysia, ITL from UK, Hastings from USA, and Andeli Group Co. Ltd. of China. We exclusively represent most of these brands in Sri Lanka.”
“The Ceylon Electricity Board is one of our main customers and we cater to all their low, medium and high voltage safety requirements.”
“In the field of industrial lighting also, we supply a lot of equipment to blue-chip companies and Lighting is also a very rapidly growing market when the construction sphere is on a boom. There are certain requirements in lighting and our products conform to all of them.”
“When talking of industrial tools, we supply entire range of products for workers day to day work and their smooth operation.”
“Furthermore, the construction industry in the country is slowing down. Before 2015 there was a boom in the construction sphere but at present it is on a slump, creating more challenges for us, hopefully we are expecting the construction industry to revive itself in 2018 or 2019, but still the things are not moving in the right direction. We have become a household name of supplying quality products for any industry.”
In conclusion Weedagama said, “This is not just like any other year-end sale where showroom items, shop-soiled items and suchlike are sold off. All the products on offer are brand new and carry relevant warranties. We want people in the industry to come and see the products and build up a rapport with us. As per the vision of M. Maniymuthu, we are not looking for quick profits but we want to establish long-term relations with our clients.”
