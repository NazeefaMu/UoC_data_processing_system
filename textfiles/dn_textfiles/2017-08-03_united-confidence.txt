United in confidence

The two major parties within the National Unity alliance were last week busy grappling with contrasting issues, even as the government went ahead with landmark events such as the signing of the Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese government and the handover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe to the state.
For the United National Party (UNP), there was both cause for concern and celebration. The last week of July saw the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the UNP’s historic general election victory in 1977 under leadership of J. R. Jayewardene. To this day, that election has delivered the largest ever landslide to a single party in Sri Lankan elections, with the UNP winning 140 seats out of 168.
This coincided with the entry of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to parliamentary politics. Then a young man of 28, Wickremesinghe contested the Biyagama seat at the invitation of Jayewardene, his uncle, and was returned to Parliament. In the current Parliament, he is the only MP to serve uninterrupted for 40 years.
Though the UNP celebrated these events, commemorations were low key, in keeping with the wishes of the Prime Minister. Party seniors- and their surviving family members- were honoured by the UNP in a ceremony that marked the anniversary. Many party members who attended observed that the unity and camaraderie in the party appeared to be high and that all appear to have rallied behind Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Central Bank bond sale
Among those so honoured were Joseph Michael Perera, Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake, Neville Fernando, P. Dayaratne and Gamini Jayawickrema Perera. Hema Premadasa and Srima Dissanayake also received mementos, honouring the services rendered by their late spouses, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake respectively.
Even if the UNP was in celebration mode, it did have cause for concern. That was because of the fallout from evidence led at the Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond sale. Giving evidence, one witness, Anika Wijesuriya, daughter of business tycoon Nahil Wijesuriya, made a startling revelation.
Wijesuriya stated before the Commission that, when a penthouse owned by her was rented to Ravi Karunanayake’s family, the rent was paid in person by Arjun Aloysius, who headed Perpetual Treasuries. Aloysius is the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran. The penthouse was later purchased outright for use by the Karunanayake family, Wijesuriya said.
At the time of writing, Karunanayake was due to appear before the Commission to give evidence and provide his version of events. He has refrained from making any public comments on the issue, as it is now under investigation and his evidence is pending.
However, there have been growing calls for Karunanayake’s resignation. This is on the basis that, even if nothing irregular or illegal had occurred, there appeared to be a conflict of interest when the son-in-law of the Governor of the Central Bank was paying rent on behalf of the then Minister of Finance. That the Bond sale which occurred under the supervision of the Central Bank was controversial only adds to the speculation.
Karunanayake served as Minister of Finance until the recent Cabinet reshuffle when he swapped portfolios with then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera. It will be recalled that President Sirisena was also instrumental in not renewing the tenure of Governor Mahendran when it expired in June last year. After what appeared to be a battle of wits with his UNP colleagues in government, President Sirisena was instrumental in appointing respected economist Indrajith Coomaraswamy as the new Governor of the Central Bank.
Karunanayake’s resignation
Despite numerous calls for Karunanayake to step down from the Cabinet, the UNP leadership has not commented on the issue. At the time of writing, Karunanayake is yet to be heard on this matter. In any event, the Commission of Inquiry will be able to make its own observations with regard to the minister’s conduct and comment on whether any impropriety had occurred.
As it is only to be expected, the Joint Opposition (JO) was quick to demand Karunanayake’s resignation. Former Minister and JO stalwart Bandula Gunewardena was to declare that it would submit a motion of no confidence against the Minister. There have been similar calls by other opposition parties.
What raised eyebrows however was a comment by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera. Jayasekera was to suggest that Karunanayake should resign forthwith, until the probe into the bond sale is concluded. “If Ravi is a gentleman, he should step down until the probe is over or he is cleared from charges. This is a blow to the Yahapalanaya government. Therefore, if there is a no-faith motion against him, I will support it,” Jayasekara said.
Jayasekera has himself been at the butt end of criticism recently for his public berating of the national cricket team. Cricketer Lasith Malinga launched a thinly veiled attack on the minister. The minister has also been lampooned for his incorrect pronunciation of the Royal College motto at a public function. Thus, Jayasekera is no stranger to controversy but his comments- openly asking a Cabinet colleague to resign- wouldn’t have endeared him to many, even within the SLFP faction of the government.
Naturally, there were questions being asked as to whether Jayasekera was attempting to pave the way for a SLFP group to take control of the government. For some weeks now, there has been speculation about a ‘group of eighteen’ SLFP MPs breaking away from the National Unity government and sitting in Parliament as an independent group, not aligning with the JO either.
There has also been discussion- at least with a section of the SLFP parliamentary group- about the prospect of forming a SLFP led government. This would require some leap of imagination because the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the SLFP led coalition commands only 95 seats in Parliament. To secure even a simple majority, it requires the support of eighteen other MPs.
As neither the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) nor the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is likely to support them because of ideological differences, it would then have to secure the support of no less than 18 members of the UNP to do so. Though stranger things have happened in politics, this is extremely unlikely at this time, given the current climate of amity within the UNP.
It appears that these concerns have not escaped President Maithripala Sirisena. Speaking at a public function at Hingurakgoda this week, President Sirisena noted that an opposition parliamentarian as well as a former minister had said that the power of the government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members in Parliament. “Under the Constitution, no one can form a new government without the President’s blessing,” the President noted.
JO camp
These comments were a pointed reminder to the JO camp that, while there may be significant differences of opinion with the National Unity government, it did not mean that the JO could simply muster the numbers and form a new government. The President is particularly piqued about some family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa having talks with SLFP parliamentarians towards this end.
As if to reiterate his position, a day later at another public function at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, President Sirisena declared that the next general elections would be held only in 2020 and that the present government would be in office until then. This statement would have allayed concerns in the UNP as well about recent political developments in the SLFP. Both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim also this week stressed that the party was keen to continue with the National Unity government, in keeping with its agenda of development, reconciliation and constitutional reform.
That will still be a challenging task. However, with the Constitution prohibiting a general election until 2020 and with both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe echoing the same sentiments, it might still be possible.
