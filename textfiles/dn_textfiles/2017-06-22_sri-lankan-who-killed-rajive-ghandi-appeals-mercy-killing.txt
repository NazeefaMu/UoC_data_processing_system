Sri Lankan who killed Rajive Ghandi appeals for mercy killing

 
The Sri Lankan convict, Robert Payas serving jail time for assassinating former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has appealed the Tamil Nadu government for a mercy killing.
According to the Sri Lankan national, none of his family members have paid him a visit in years and since the government is not very keen in carrying out an execution or releasing him, it’s time that he should be allowed to give his life.
In a letter to state government, Payas wrote, “Despite the Tamil Nadu government supporting me, no efforts are being taken. Both the Central governments (UPA and NDA) have remained silent on this issue and (it) seems to me like both want my life to end in prison.”
In 1991, Robert Payas was among the 26 sentenced to death for conspiring to assassinate late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi but 19 of them were released later.
