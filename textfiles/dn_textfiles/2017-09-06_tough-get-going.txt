As the tough get going

Head Prefect of Carey College Joel Dilshan Siriwardena is a young man but he is experienced. He knows the pitfalls of life and understands that nothing in this world comes easily. Perfect Prefects features Siriwardena who understands that anything of value in life must be purchased with blood, sweat, and tears. He believes in never giving up.
“I believe in the phrase ‘When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going’. You need to talk less than you know and show less than you have,” said Siriwardena.
Own prejudices
In human society conflict very rarely is one sided. You cannot pin all the blame on one person. Most of the time tensions could have been festering and building up to the point of explosion. The abuse could have been going on for a long time. People can misunderstand. Most often people judge other people by their own insecurities and their own prejudices. What people think you are is mostly what they think of themselves. Therefore a leader must grasp all of this. He/ she needs to understand that humans are complex creatures.
Society is torn apart because of political, racial problems and gender based problems. People hate what they fear. People often fear what they don’t understand. A leader must take all of this into consideration. And when they don’t understand they judge through their own fears and insecurities.
“As a head prefect, your problem-solving skills should be as sharp and effective. One technique I use is to look at the situation from the eyes of another – ‘What would I do if I was him or her’. This is no easy task and I need to consider multiple views. I think as a leader what should I do? Harsh reprimands sometimes are not the right thing to do. At the same time being soft will not also work. So there needs to be a lot of understanding,” said Siriwardena.
Encouraged and motivated
Siriwardena also believes that you need to be young at heart. He does not view youth as an age related factor. He believes it is a temperament. He believes it is state of mind. This is essential for leaders. He firmly believes in appreciating people for the work they put in because if you make someone feel that his/her work is appreciated then they will continue to work enthusiastically doing their best for you. They will feel encouraged and motivated.
He also feels that one should never give up on things easily. Sometimes you put in your very best and work very hard but you do not achieve it. But that does not mean that you are weak in any way or at fault. You should not feel so dejected.
“I believe you need to have a strong faith in God. God has a plan for your life. Your life is a garden and he wants to work on it. You need to have faith in God, learn from everything and never falter. The day you give up is the day you fall. The harder things you go through the better you will become. Give God first place and everything else will fall into place. Impress God with all your heart and anyone who needs to be impressed will be impressed,” said Siriwardena.
Character built
Siriwardena points out that no one is perfect and leaders are human. He is not running a one man show and when his loyal prefects of the Prefect Guild come together then everything works well. A leader should not rise alone but to rise up as a team.
A school, though a school, is a group of human beings. You need to be able to help fighting factions reconcile. A school is a cross section of society. You need to help students settle their differences in a peaceful way. “We need to help them understand Carey College has a history of 104 years and it has produced strong men. And we need to understand that these men had character. And character is built not through violence,” pointed out Siriwardena.
Siriwardena has experienced everything that Carey College has to offer and the Head Prefect-ship was not something he anticipated. The best part of his school life is that he has been in almost every stage a student can be in. He attributes his success to Jesus. His life has steadily progressed. Success has been measured in his life.
Quick decision-making
He became the Best Athlete in 2016 with one new school record in 800m in Athletics and then in 2017 broke 3 new school records in 400m/ 800m/ 1500m at the Under 20 level. He has also won medals in Basketball. At the district level, he became 2nd in 1500m and 3rd in 800m.
Basketball is the second fastest game in the world which requires quick decision making. You need to have patience and never lose your cool. Team work also matters in Basketball.
“I have been blessed in every way from God. The rugger coach wanted me to play rugger but I did not have the time. I have so many other activities with classes, basketball, and church,” said Siriwardena.
Siriwardena believes that you should dream, sometimes you may fail after coming so close to it. But that does not mean that you do not deserve it. God always has a plan. He has a better plan for you. “You need to motivate yourself. Your tough times have not been in vain. You have to work for your success.”
Siriwardena is also the President of the Literary English Association at Carey College. He has been the former Vice Captain of Carey College basketball team and Vice President of LEO club of Carey College. He is in the band as well (Drum Stand leader of Carey College Senior Brass Band)
He wished to thank especially the two Masters in Charge Bandula Pushpakumara and Janaka Ruwanjith and Principal Hemamali Bibile.
His family has helped him a lot in every way and they are a family of prayer, believing in the power of prayer. Though initially, he wanted to become an accountant Siriwardena has been prophesied to become a pastor. Now he says he wants to be whatever God wants him to become. A pastor who came from abroad prophesied about Siriwardena. From speaking to Siriwardena it is obvious that he has a bright future. A young man with a heart of Gold he wants to take care of his parents and make them happy.
