Music  with a message

Zaghloul Bangsajayah is a man of few words. But when on stage with his band members, the audience is psyched to see them perform. When they are on stage the one thought on everyone’s mind is – ‘Wow this band is smoking!’ Melodies features Killfeed where the lyrics create that rock ambience.
“We started off within the walls of Wesley College in 2009. The five of us from the initial line up were eager to start a band after we experienced some live performances of some major bands at that time. Our first ever live performance was Battle of the bands in 2011 which was held at the Overseas School of Colombo and then we took part in TNL Onstage 2012,” said Bangsajayah.
Four American bands-Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer-are credited with pioneering and popularizing thrash metal and they have come to be called the "Big Four of Thrash". Thrash Metal has a huge history. In Europe, the earliest band of the emerging thrash movement was Venom 1979. So as you can see initially Killfeed had a lot to live up to. These bands are huge. Thrash Metal is intense and exciting carrying with it a lot of aggression.
“Initially we started off as a Thrash Metal Band, and now with time our style of music has changed and we are experimenting by incorporating some of the different genres into our songs. We are inspired by international bands like – Metallica, Megadeth, Kreator, Death, Kamelot, Anthrax, Lamb of God, Iron Maiden. Locally, Stigmata and Tantrum are two major bands that inspired us,” explained Bangsajayah.
Thrash Metal lyrics often deal with social issues. For Killfeed their lyrics are often based on Life and Society. Their music comes out of their life experiences. That’s what makes their audience say – ‘wow this band is smoking’! Their music really pack a punch. Their music runs deep and it is diverse because they themselves are diverse coming from different backgrounds.
“Most of our lyrics are based on Life and society. Our lives as a whole is the greatest inspiration to write lyrics. Music is a universal language. We are all from different races and communities. But then music is the only thing that helps us share a message as one. And that is where we find peace,” points out Bangsajayah.
Bangsajayah says that they are constantly trying to raise the bar and keep on trying to achieve a much higher standard from where they are now. They are always trying to better themselves. Take their act and performance to the next level.
“We would like to make more music, and grow heights as local artistes in Sri Lanka. And release more singles and albums and cater better songs by day. We would like to thank Suresh from Stigmata, Andrew Obeyesekere, Tharaka Seneviratne, Tennyson Napoleon, Javeen Soysa, Akila Pieris, and everyone else who have been there and guided us through our journey,” stated Bangsajayah.
The name Killfeed was randomly suggested by a friend when they were struggling to figure out a name. Now Killfeed is a household name in houses where metal is the way! Right throughout they never gave up. Their commitment would have been the main reason for their success. As is the usual way some of their critics told them they would not make it in the industry. But they did!
“We stuck to what we believed. And worked toward our dreams, there have been embarrassing moments, some quit, and many told us that we will never be known. But still we kept doing what we loved. And here we are,” said Bangsajayah
The message that Bangsajayah wants to give out is that to succeed you need to identify what exactly you want. If you believe that music is right for you then by all means go for it! Music is exciting and rewarding. It is exhilarating.
“If you believe that music is your way you will never be disappointed,” said Bangsajayah.
