Ape Gama in Anuradhapura  to recreate ancient Sinhala kingdom

Baladurage Chandrasiri, winner of several global awards for creativity, sustainability and leadership, for creating Forest Rock Garden Resort Hotel in Andarawewa, is to build a third hotel.   
Chandrasiri clinched the Gold at the 19 International Star for Leadership in Quality Awards, held at a gala ceremony in Madrid, Spain. Chandrasiri beat competitors from over 137 countries to win this much-coveted global accolade.  
“This award inspired me to build a third hotel - Ape Gama - in Anuradhapura, investing nearly Rs. 300 million.”  
He said that he was based in Italy for over two decades studying architecture and working and developed a liking for tourism. “I wanted to create a landmark and leave a lasting image in everything and first built Palm Garden Village in Puttalam to have the largest swimming pool and banquet hall in the area.”  
"The three star hotel is situated on a 50-acre plot of land that was originally used for chena cultivation. The land was devoid of trees and completely abandoned at the time of purchase on the early 1990s. Since then, a new forest has been created through hard work and patience. For the landscaping of the hotel, more than 500 big trees were planted."   
"The success of this 62-room hotel prompted me to build my second hotel, Forest Rock Garden Resort Hotel in Anuradapura which resembles an ancient kingdom, just seven kilometres away from Palm Garden Village.   
"The hotel stands 20 feet above ground level to ensure that the surrounding beauty is not disrupted and the entire property links seamlessly with the natural beauty of the landscape. The entire resort has been built atop concrete pillars providing ultra-luxury rooms to pamper and relax guests. In order to ensure the continuance of the natural landscape, nearly 100,000 rare herbal plants have been planted on the premises."   
“The resort will also give guests an insight into the cultural interests of the region, through the 50-acre resort premises which is moulded after the Anuradhapura Kingdom.”  
Chandrasiri said the demand for the hotel from guests and travel agents prompted him to build another hotel on similar values and this is how his third hotel Ape Gama is being built. “This would be a fully eco-concept hotel depicting the ancient Sinahla traditions.”  
"Staff would wear traditional uniforms and even guests would be encouraged to wear sarongs. The guests would be picked up in bullock carts at the reception and taken to their villas which would also be built with traditional Sri Lankan architecture using clay."   
“I will also build a mini kuttan pokuna (swimming pool) and other similar ancient monuments too. A typical village pola, fish market and tea kiosk too would be created along with other traditional themes to take guests back to the ancient era. We hope to open the hotel by end 2018.” (SS)
