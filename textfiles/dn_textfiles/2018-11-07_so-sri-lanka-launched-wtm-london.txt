So Sri Lanka launched  at WTM London

Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Vasantha Senanayake unveiled new slogan and strategy for Sri Lanka Tourism at WTM in London.
The new slogan “So Sri Lanka” goes beyond being a place descriptor and embodies the vibrant qualities that inspire us about our travels and tales from the island nation.
At the launch of the new strategy and slogan the Minister Wasantha Senanayake said that the So Sri Lanka brand is not only exhilarating – it’s the beginning of a new era.
“We envisage that tourism will flourish to be the most significant sector contributing to our economy - that’s the goal we aspire to reach in the next few years,” he said.
The Minister unveiled the new slogan along with Chief Guest of Honour Lord Nasby.
In the last 10 years, Sri Lanka has seen a steady growth in arrivals and investments. Based on qualitative research findings on inbound tourists for the last three years, the most endearing feature of Sri Lanka as a destination brand is its authenticity.
This authenticity is an attribute that is alive in the country’s heritage, cuisine, landscape, architecture, culture and mostly in its people. Recently, Lonely Planet ranked Sri Lanka as top destination to travel in 2019 based on its diverse and authentic offerings.
The resulting brand “So Sri Lanka” is laser focused on elevating Sri Lanka’s destination brand to include all its diverse offerings and unique attributes.
MsAlyna Hajji Omar, CEO, J Walter Thompson explained, “The objective of the brand “So Sri Lanka” is to inspire us to proudly own our finer qualities while at the same time be open enough to continuously work on improvements. We have moved away from investing in a passive identity and we are seeking a dialogue with our socially active millennial travelers.
