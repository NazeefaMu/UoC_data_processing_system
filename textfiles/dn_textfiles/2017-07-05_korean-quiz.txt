Korean quiz

The key to successful bi-lateral ties between two countries is the attitude. It is not a case of putting it on paper – a written agreement. That is just ink on paper. What must be done is to create permanent friendships. And that needs to come from within. One powerful way of changing attitudes is through culture. Daily News attended the preliminary round of the K-Pop festival and saw and heard the love!
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Sri Lanka this year, the Embassy of the Republic of South Korea, the National Unification Advisory Council South West Asia Chapter, the Korean Residents Association of Lanka, and the Korean Businessmen’s Association in Sri Lanka are co-organizing a variety of programs on two separate occasions – in July and November.
The South Korean Cultural Festival 2017 was held last Saturday at the Bishop’s College Auditorium. The event is organised in partnership with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Culture Affairs of Sri Lanka, and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.
The 2017 Festival consists of two main events, - the Quiz-on Korea and the K-Pop World Festival.
The Quiz-on Korea is a quiz competition where the questions will be on generic topics on Korean lifestyle, traditional culture, history and language. The winner will be invited to learn and experience South Korea this September and compete with national representatives from different countries around the world to win the top prize.
The K-Pop World Festival is a K-pop performance competition, for which the Embassy has invited talented Sri Lankan vocalists and/or dancers to show their K-pop spirit on stage. Winning team(s) will stand the chance to go to South Korea for the final round and compete internationally this September, following a screening process. They will also be able to meet and perform together with K-Pop stars.
The K-Pop World Festival was proof of this ‘Korean Wave’, epitomised by K-Dramas and K-Pop. This deep interest and love for the Korean culture manifested in song and dance. The thunderous applause the performers received, coupled with the enthusiasm of the crowd lifted these performers up.
It was heartening to see young Sri Lankan girls singing in Korean. It was really very beautiful, the way they sang. This is exactly the reason why this Korean Cultural Festival has been organised over the years – the youth. Young people showing their passion for Korea culture.
It was not only the singing but the power packed dances that appealed to the audience. It showed vigour, dynamism and energy. It showed love for the Korean Culture. It showed creativity and it showed commitment. It showed why exactly song and dance can soothe the savage beast. Why it can break down barriers of prejudice.
“Culture has played an important role in the relationship between our two countries. And today we are celebrating 40 years of diplomatic ties between our two countries. Our seeds of friendship have been planted in many sectors, of which culture is one. Cultural relationships between our two countries have been especially strong. We can see the South Korean Television and pop influence in Sri Lanka which is actually popular worldwide. I understand that it has a fan base amongst Sri Lankan youth. This is a cause for great happiness. Their interest in Korean language and culture is something we greatly appreciated,” said South Korean Ambassador Won Sam Chang.
Because of the interest displayed by Sri Lankans, this cultural festival has been held repeatedly in Sri Lanka and the Ambassador felt that this festival has strengthened our relationships even more.
“The quiz will test the participants’ knowledge on various sectors of South Korea and will be an excellent and rare opportunity for him/her to visit South Korea. The winner will go to South Korea representing Sri Lanka in September competing with 24 countries in the finals. I wish the participants for K-Pop all the best and wish them warmly. They will also get to display their talents in the finals in South Korea this September. K-Pop is a festival held in Korea annually since 2011. It is now spread worldwide. This year it is taking part in 70 countries,” said Chang.
Chang commented that he was pleased to see the hype and enthusiasm generated because of this festival.
“I am sure this festival will be something special to you and enliven you. I ask for your support in the future as well and for your keen interest and hope you will take a great interest in the Korean week scheduled to begin on November 14. This too celebrates our anniversary. I wish to thank all those who have made this event possible,” added Chang.
Deputy Minister Home Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural, Palitha Thevapperuma, expressed his delight at being invited to grace the occasion.
“If there is no culture in a country, the country’s morals and values suffer. Our country is now facing this threat. A culture is vital to a society, and whatever progress Sri Lanka has experienced, whatever we have, it is because of our culture. Because of external influences outside of our culture, our culture has suffered and morals and values have collapsed. I think having these sort of festivals in Sri Lanka, is very positive because, through these festivals, the cultures of the host country and foreign country equally benefit. That bond is very important. Like I said before there are external forces outside of our culture that are threatening to tear apart its fabric,” said Thevapperuma
Thevapperuma highlighted the importance of preserving the environment and morals and culture.
“We need to leave behind a legacy for those coming after us. We must be proud of our country as Sri Lankans and we have reason to be proud because we have achieved much in our past. We must all contribute to building our country. We must take it in the right direction. South Korea is a country with good values and is a humane country. It is a country where the citizens have proper conduct and human qualities. Its citizens are educated. We hope that our ties will continue long into the future. We must go from strength to strength,” pointed out Thevapperuma
Meanwhile, celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the South Korea Navy Cruise Training Task Group is also scheduled to visit Colombo Port from October 26 - 29.
