Former dengue patients more prone to depression, anxiety

(Dr. Miyuru Chandradasa)
A recent study revealed that patients who had suffered from dengue are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety more than people who have never been infected with dengue, Dr. Miyuru Chandradasa from University of Kelaniya, Monash University (Honorary) said. 
According to Dr. Chandradasa, the study was on psychological effects of dengue fever among Sri Lankan patients. There have been studies in the past of acute psychological effects in dengue from other countries. 
Patients who had suffered from dengue have significant higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than the control group according to the DASS-21 and CESD-20 tools. This is the first and only such study in the world.
However, this is understandable considering the stress of having a physical illness. The researchers studied the delayed effects mentally after months from the dengue infection. This may warn health care professionals to incorporate mental counseling for dengue patients, he said.
