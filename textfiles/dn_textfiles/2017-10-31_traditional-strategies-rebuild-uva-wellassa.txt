Traditional strategies to rebuild Uva-Wellassa

It was a herculean task to rebuild the broken economy which the government inherited under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, said the Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa.
The Minister made this comment at a meeting held at Moneragala, Madulla Divisional Secretariat office on Sunday(29).
Minister Zoysa said, nearly 200 years ago Uva-Wellassa was destroyed by the colonizers who governed our country and since then, all governments have had to face the challenge of rebuilding Uva-Wellassa.
“The government is implementing traditional strategies to rebuild the Uva-Wellassa region by rehabilitating the tanks, ponds and other water resources destroyed by the British rulers,” he said.
He explained that the Kumbukkan Oya Water Project in the Moneragala Divisional Secretariat area and the Hada Oya Water Project in Siyabalanduwa DS area were the main water projects that the government commenced recently and that the resettlement of people in the catchment areas was the key issue to be solved soon.
The Minister further added that the Kumbukkan Oya water Project could add 15 MW of electricity to the national grid, provide drinking water and water to cultivate 18,000 acres of paddy.
Minister Zoysa said that though the economy was agrarian based, many farmers who engage in chena cultivation faced many hardships as they did not possess proper legal documents for their land. Thus it was a timely need to have them focus more on more economical crops such as paddy and rubber, the latter he said would help increase the forest density in the area.
Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anuradha Jayaratna said, the President will take all measures to ensure protection of the environment through the implementation of eco-friendly projects throughout the country.
Minister Anuradha said forest cover should be increased to minimize natural disasters that Sri Lankans face annually.
He said, the farmers should pay more attention to the issues pertaining to environment when they engage in cultivation.
The Deputy Minister assured a long term solution to grievances raised by the farmer community regarding the conflict between wildlife officers and farmers, on the ownership of government land that they cultivate.
The Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathna, Irrigation and water Resources Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, Director General of Wildlife Conservation Anura Satarasinghe, Moneragala District Secretary D.S.Pathmakulasuriya, Additional District Secretary Land P. Somarathna, Wildlife officers and other officials conducted field visits to Pubbara Village in Medagama DS area on the same day to ascertain the feasibility of resettling the people under the Kumbukkan Oya Project.
