Nearly 4,000 get solar powered electricity

Under the ‘Sooriya Bala Sangramaya’ (Battle for Solar Energy) project 3,909 consumers have obtained solar power electricity connections and another 2,000 applicants would get the connections shortly, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
The ‘Sooriya Bala Sangramaya’ project got off the ground in September 6 last year to promote the setting up of small solar power plants on the rooftops of houses.
The Deputy Minister said solar energy connections provided under this project would total 68MW by the end of this year.
He said ‘Net Metering, Net Accounting and Net Plus’ systems are in place for consumers to get registered with this project based on their preference.
He said the Government expects to add 410 MW generated by wind power and 440 MW generated by solar power to the national grid by 2020.
The Deputy Minister said a hybrid renewable energy park that would generate 1040MW from solar and wind power is proposed to be constructed in Pooneryn in the Northern Province. “Within the next couple of months, we will call tenders for 170MW of wind power and 100 MW of solar power in this park. At the same time, 220KV transmission lines will be constructed to distribute power generated in the park. This will be a priority project of the Government,” he said.
He noted the goal of the Government is to generate a total of 1,246 MW from renewable energy by 2020 and increase it up to 1,912 MW by 2025 and 2,476 MW by 2030.
“Even among the renewable energy sources, our priority lies on solar and wind power,” the Deputy Minister added.
