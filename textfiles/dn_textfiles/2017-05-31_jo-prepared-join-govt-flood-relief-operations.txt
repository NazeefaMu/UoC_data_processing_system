JO prepared to join Govt. in flood relief operations

In a rare show of consensus, the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they were prepared to set their differences aside and work with the government to help the disaster-hit people.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, JO member Bandula Gunewardene MP said the JO was ready to carry out relief work with the government and also support any endeavours to collect funds to assist the affected.
Gunewardene proposed that funds allocated for the Parliamentarians official needs, such as, vehicles, renovations to existing office premises, equipment etc. should be diverted to help provide relief to the affected.
He also said that the government should take prompt measures to remove the hurdles which obstruct state sector officers in taking urgent measures to help the victims.
Gunewardene also called for the setting up of District Coordinating Committees to carry out relief measures and noted that the JO was prepared to take part in such committees. Meanwhile, Prof. G.L.Peiris said that if all Pradeshiya Sabha members are more active,it would greatly help carry out the relief measures.
Peiris recalled that there were 2,628 PS members in the country and they could play a pivotal role in relief work as they are political representatives who are connected to the people at grassroots level.
