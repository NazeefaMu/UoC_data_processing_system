Toyota Lanka launches Toyota Coaster in Sri Lanka

Toyota Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, formally launched the latest “Toyota Coaster” designed for premier passenger transportation at the Toyota Plaza in Wattala. The event was attended by key clientele comprising of members from the leisure and travel sector, and the senior management of Toyota Lanka.
Speaking at the launch Managing Director of Toyota Lanka Shungo Yoshioka said, “The Coaster is the only coach in the Toyota line-up and has been playing a vital part in catering to clientele who have specific transportation requirements, especially in the travel and leisure sectors. The Coaster is a name that reflects reliable, durable and trusted transportation with over decades of global acclaim. The same, I believe applies in a Sri Lankan context where Toyota Coasters from many generations can be seen on the roads daily, fulfilling transportation requirements of a well-matured vehicle market.
With this unveiling Toyota Lanka will for the very first time offer 2 specifications of the Coaster, the mid-grade and the high-grade . The all-new Coaster comes with a sleek, innovative new design while staying true to the Coaster's identity.The interior has also been significantly revamped and is now more spacious due to wider and taller cabin dimensions.Noise insulation has also been improved contributing to a quieter ride with a plush interior giving an enhanced sense of ride comfort. Both versions have semi reclining seats as a standard option. Additionally, for anyone who wants to pay extra for a bit of luxury, the high-grade Coaster has a factory fitted cool box to keep you refreshed during long journeys.
One of the Coaster's main selling points is its durability. The circular frame structure is adopted to ensure high body rigidity and strength.
Laser welding has also been used for rigid body panel bonding. All of this contributes to enhance quality, durability and reliability. The availability of safety features, which is of paramount importance in the present day context, has also been enhanced. Driver airbags and ABS are standard features on the high-grade spec while 3 point seat belts are standard on all models.
Also speaking at the launch Director-COO Manohara Atukorale noted, “With the introduction of the new Coaster, we are looking at adding more value to your business requirements with enhanced reliability and more emphasis on passenger safety. With unparalleled after-sales care, only Toyota Lanka can offer such an extensive value proposition.”
Sold with the 3 year/100,000km exclusive Toyota Lanka warranty, the Coaster available for the local market has been built to specification considering local conditions.
Toyota Lanka invites all potential customers to come and view the all new Coaster at Toyota showrooms in Wattala, Ratmalana, Negombo and Kurunegala to experience the next chapter of “Reliable Journey Making”.
