energy management solutions from access

Access Energy Solutions provides Sri Lankan companies with energy management solutions for electrical and thermal energy systems.
The company’s unique service offering is an arrangement under which it assumes ongoing energy management responsibilities on behalf of its clients, and helps them to increase overall energy efficiency.
“Many companies the world over are seeing the benefits of outsourcing energy efficiency management to third party entities. Here in Sri Lanka we have already helped a number of companies in the banking, manufacturing and healthcare sectors to reduce their monthly energy overhead by upto 20%. This in turn has helped these businesses to increase their operational productivity and systems efficiency by 40%,” said Roshal Perera, Director Access Energy Solutions. The first step in energy management is to identify where a businesses’ energy is being spent. Access Energy Solutions helps companies do this by conducting an energy audit, which helps pinpoint the problem areas. Thereafter the company develops a tailor made strategy to manage and reduce energy usage and helps their clients implement best practices. Energy efficiency reduces running costs for businesses, lowers carbon emissions and shows the public that a company is environmentally aware. The unique challenges faced by manufacturing and engineering firms can appear to make energy efficiency difficult to achieve; automated systems and processes usually run 24 hours a day, meaning that machinery is constantly powered up and cannot be turned off.
However, there are technologies which can make massive differences to the energy consumption and maintenance costs involved in running this equipment all the time.Access Energy Solutions has partnered with the world’s leading energy technology expert, Honeywell, in order to provide clients with advanced solutions. Honeywell’s solutions help address immediate and long-term energy challenges, increase efficiency, decrease costs, increase reliability and security and improve facility management. A robust energy management solution can also help organizations get a higher LEED certification for buildings, reduce operations, maintenance and repair costs and extend the life of existing plants and equipment.
Access Energy Solutions provides turn-key project solutions for HVAC Systems, Steam Generation and Distribution Systems, Building Management Systems, Biogas Systems and Lighting Systems. Established in 2005, Access Energy Solutions is a subsidiary of the Access Group. It is registered under the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) as an Energy Audit Efficiency Improvement (EEI) and an Energy Audit Service (EAS) company.
