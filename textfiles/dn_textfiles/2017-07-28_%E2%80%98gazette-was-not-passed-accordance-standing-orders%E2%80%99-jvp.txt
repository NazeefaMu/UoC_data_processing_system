‘Gazette was not passed in accordance to Standing Orders’:  JVP

 
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) observed that the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act that declared petroleum supply and distribution an essential service was not passed in accordance with the Standing Orders in Parliament.
JVP Parliamentarians made this observation at a press conference held at the Parliamentary complex after the parliament sittings came to an abrupt end this afternoon.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that when the vote was taken the Mace was not in the bracket of the table.
"When the Mace is not on the bracket of the table, House cannot be accepted as legally in progress," said MP Dissanayake. "The mace was in the hands of Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms."
He also said that the Chair is not effective when the Mace had been taken out. “Whatever is being announced from the Chair is not valid when the Mace is not in its proper place,” he said.
“Further to that, the result of the vote was not announced. It was a vote taken by name. We do not know the result of the vote. Vote did not come to an end. So one cannot say the resolution is passed,” Dissanayake said.
“We do not consider the resolution is passed,” he said.
