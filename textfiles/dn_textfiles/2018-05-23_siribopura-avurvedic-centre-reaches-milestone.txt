Siribopura Avurvedic Centre reaches milestone

The Ayurvedic Hospital and Research Centre at Siribopura in Hambantota provides a grand service for low-income families and others since its services are available for them for free.
It maintains a herbal garden for research activities along with qualified Ayurvedic physicians. The centre also provides specialist treatment free of charge.
A large number of low-income people seek treatments from the centre every day. They said they get rid of many of their illnesses thanks to the effective treatments they receive at the centre, which has reached a milestone of its service now.
Many donators assist the centre in various ways. Regional politicians, government officials, and philanthropists provide their assistance for the centre to carry out its services towards the poor effectively.
