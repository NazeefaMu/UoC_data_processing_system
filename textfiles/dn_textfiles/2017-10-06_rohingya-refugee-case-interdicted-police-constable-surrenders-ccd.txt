Rohingya refugee case: Interdicted Police Constable surrenders to CCD

 
An interdicted Police Constable who took part in the attack on the Rohingya refugees in Mt Lavinia on September 26 surrendered to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) today.
The constable identified as Prageeth Chanaka (40), is a resident of Mahawadduwa, Wadduwa.
The Police said that there are three ongoing cases to the suspect’s name, at the Panadura Magistrate Court already.
Of those cases, two involve attacks on a mosque and the other is a result of him having threatened the principal of the Pandura Balika Vidyalaya.
Chanaka will be produced before the Mt Lavinia Magistrate’s court.
