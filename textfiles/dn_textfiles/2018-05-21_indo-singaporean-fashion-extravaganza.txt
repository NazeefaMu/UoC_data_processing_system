INDO, SINGAPOREAN FASHION EXTRAVAGANZA

Threads of Time, an Indo, Singaporean fashion extravaganza will be staged by Anita Dorai and Kavita Thulasidas bringing the best of Western and Eastern chic in a collection of exquisite designer wear.
The designer, Singaporean Kavita Thulasidas who is of Indian origin is the Creative and Managing Director of Stylemart Bridal Collection since 1999. She studied in Perth Western Australia at Prebyterian Ladies College and moved to live in France till she returned to Singapore in 1998. In 1999, Kavita formally took over the management reins of Stylemart.
The show is being presented by Anita Dorai, also a Singaporean of Indian origin who has long been an ardent fashionista. Anita who is now residing in Sri Lanka has plans to stage many fashion and other spectacular productions on a regular basis.
Threads of Time will see both Sri Lankan and foreign models on the ramp, while the show will be choreographed by Brian Kerkoven and produced and managed by Anusha David of Headlines PR and Imran Saibo of Funtime.
“To date we have Seylan Bank, Porsche and South Asian Textiles on board as sponsors while the Hilton will be our partner hotel and Ramani Fernando Salons our hair and beauty partner,” said Anita.
“Over 100 exclusive outfits will be showcased on September 2 at the Hilton ballroom with all of them being on sale the next day, while choice wines, canapés, and a gourmet dinner will be served at the show which is strictly for invitees only”.
According to Anita their decision to limit Threads of Time to invitees was to ensure the exclusive nature of the event and showcase Kavita’s designs to those who would genuinely appreciate her work.
Once she took over the reins of Stylemart, Kavita quickly identified the need for a change in the management strategy, and the need to create a new niche in the market. Within a year, she established Stylemart Bridal Collection Pte Ltd. Focusing on an area of specialization, Kavita started catering to a growing demand in the bridal segment. Today Stylemart is a high end fashion label, thanks to Kavita’s tireless focus on branding, customer service and her personal charisma and creativity.
Born, brought up and educated in Singapore, Anita did her degree in Sales and Marketing in Singapore where she ran a successful business dealing in high end Sports cars for 12 years, prior to which she worked at Price Waterhouse.
“I have always been interested in fashion and grooming. How we carry ourselves is largely dependent on what we wear and what we wear is very much influenced by both the media and our personal experiences.
Having lived in Sri Lanka over the last five years, I have observed how many women desire the stylish and elegant synergy between the eastern exotic and western chic, yet are cloistered and restricted due to the limited fashion scene.
It is for this reason that I picked Kavita Thulasidas as the designer for this fashion show. Kavita's styles have appealed to both Indians and non-Indians alike. She combines comfort with class and style with sophistication.
She advocates staying rooted to the Asian culture through the detailing in her clothes, yet is modern and progressive in her fabric and cut - a concept I can truly identify with,” Anita said.
