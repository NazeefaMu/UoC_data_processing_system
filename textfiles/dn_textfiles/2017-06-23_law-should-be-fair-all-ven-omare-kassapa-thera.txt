Law should be fair to all :  Ven. Omare Kassapa Thera

 People belonging to all communities should be treated equally before the law of the country. It should not distinguish between Wigneswaran, Sivajilingam or Rauf Hakeem, said Ven. Omare Kassapa Anunayake Thera of the Sri Rohana Chapter of the Shyamopali Maha Nikaya and General Secretary Ruhunu Rata Bhikku Peramuna.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Asokaramaya Vidyalaya, Dharmapala town in Matara on June 21 to express support to a statement issued by the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter.
Ven. Kassapa said their support was with the government if the government was committed towards 'Yahapalanaya' it should act with responsibility to thwart attempts made to ridicule the Sinhalese. The Maha Sangha in Ruhuna would vehemently condemn anyone trying to insult and ridicule Sinhalese or the Maha Sangha irrespective of their position.
Matara district Lekakhadhikari Ven. Paraduwe Jinaratana Thera said they always stood by the statement made by the Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera against the de-religionization campaign carried out by extremist forces.
