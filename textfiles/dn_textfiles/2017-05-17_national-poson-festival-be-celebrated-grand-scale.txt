National Poson festival to be celebrated on grand scale

The National Poson Festival will be celebrated on a grand scale in Anuradhapura, Mihintale, Awkana and Thantirimale.
Anuradhapura government agent and the head of the National Poson Celebrations Steering Committee told the Daily News that around 800,000 to 1 million devotees are expected during the Poson season in Anuradhapura.
The Poson Full Moon Poya Day falls on June 8. The period between June 5 to 11 has been declared the National Poson Celebrations Week.
The government agent said in view of Poson, all liquor shops and meat stalls in the Anuradhapura district will be closed between June 4 to 12. Also, the sale and use of cigarettes will also be discouraged.
The traditional Poson week-long pirith chanting will commence when the water from Tisa Wewa tank is taken to the special pirith mandapaya in Mahamewnawa in a procession starting from Isurumuniya Raja Maha Vihara on June 6. The Mihintala Lakehouse Aloka Pooja will be held on five days starting from June 7 and ending on June 11. The President and Prime Minister are expected to participate in the illumination programme on Poson Full Moon Poya Day.
Government officials said the prevailing drought conditions in the Anuradhapura district would affect Poson arrangements since the water level of tanks is decreasing. Officials said all arrangements are being made to provide sufficient drinking water to the devotees although there could be a problem of bathing and washing. Bathing at Tisa Wewa has been discouraged while water levels at Nuwara Wewa and Basawakkulama tanks are low.
Meanwhile, Ruwanweli Chetiyaramadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera told the Daily News that the forthcoming Anuradhapura National Poson Festival will not be a carnival, entertainment event or commercialized festival. “Authorities will take action to maintain the spiritual values and interests of devotees during Poson,” the thera said.
The prelate requested devotees visiting Anuradhapura and other sacred shrines to be dressed in white. He also requested devotees not to bring, use or distribute alcohol.
