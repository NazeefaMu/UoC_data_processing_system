Tourism Leaders’ Summit launches two commemorative stamps

The much-anticipated Tourism Leaders’ Summit and International Research Symposium got underway for the 3rd successive year at the BMICH.
The event which was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena saw the launch of two commemorative stamps marking the occasion.
Over 1000 industry leaders, hoteliers and nearly 100 foreign delegates took part in the summit which hosted a series of informative and interactive sessions on tourism and in particular development and sustainability.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga who spoke at the Summit remarked that Sri Lanka is a key player in world tourism and the government’s tourism vision 2020 will enable the country to achieve grater and sustainable benefits. “Development and sustainability are two words that have become an oxymoron in the tourism sector, for being somewhat mutually exclusive,” said Rilwan Razick, CEO of Universal College of Learning (UCOL), a vocational training centre for tourism and hospitality studies. “There is no point in tourism growth if it ignores the plight of the vulnerable, address climate change or alleviate poverty.”
A number of students from UCOL who were present at the summit cited that there was a dearth for such sessions and events that delve on how today’s tourism leaders can pave the way for sustainable development in tourism, which is essential in a country like Sri Lanka. The event also saw the participation of many foreign academics and delegates who were there to share their lessons and experiences.
