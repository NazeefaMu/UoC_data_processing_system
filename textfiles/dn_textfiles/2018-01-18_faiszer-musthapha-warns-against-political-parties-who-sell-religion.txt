Faiszer Musthapha warns against political parties who sell religion

Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha held several meetings in Biyagama recently in support of former Malwana Pradeshiya Sabha member Anwer, to assure victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, in upcoming local government elections.
Minister Mustapha said that there were some parties with a religious label which said one thing to the public while having a hidden agenda and were trying to mislead the public. These racist parties were selling religion and were involved in a massive fraud against the innocent population and will finally join the government after obtaining money.
Such politics was of no use and religion was a purely personal matter and has nothing to do with politics.
“Under the leadership of Anwer as done in the past, we can develop this district further. so I therefore request you to support Anwer in this election,” the Minister said.
