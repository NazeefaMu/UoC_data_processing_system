Mike Brearley: Captaincy and the human mind

In 1976, the year that Mike Brearley first played for England, he applied to train at the Institute of Psychoanalysis under Anne-Marie Sandler, a prominent analyst from Switzerland.
Initially, she turned him down, saying that he needed to have more experience with people who were in psychological trouble before he could make a full application.
Two weeks later, he received another letter from her. The British members of the admissions committee had informed her that Brearley had captained a cricket team (Middlesex) and that such a position had more relevance to training to be a psychoanalyst than she had realised. She allowed him to proceed with the application.
I like the story because of its inference that a cricket dressing room is full of damaged types — or, if not damaged, then enough of the broad spectrum of humanity to interest the most curious of observers. A team is made up of all sorts: the confident, the insecure, the exuberant, the introverted and the content, as well as the damaged. In 1971, this melting pot encouraged Brearley to return to cricket from academia after five years away and has helped him to retain a fascination with the game ever since.
We are sitting in an eyrie at Headingley, the ground that in 1981 made his reputation as a cricketing alchemist, and the conversation centres on the two aspects of captaincy — understanding how people and teams work, and tactics. Most England captains of my experience have expertise, or come to have expertise, in the second of these areas. Brearley’s lifelong interest in the deepest fathoms of the mind, and his eventual expertise as a practising psychoanalyst, make him a unique member of the club, started by Len Hutton, of professional players who captained England, and one of its best practitioners.
“One of the things about cricket, and this was certainly true then and is probably true now, is that you get people from every class and every walk of life,” he says. “There was Fred Titmus and John Murray, for example, at Middlesex who had come to the game through the boys’ clubs of King’s Cross and Notting Hill, rough areas in those days, and we also had the Honourable Tim Lamb. It was a fascinating mix.”
His new book, the first since The Art of Captaincy, is entitled On Form and is, he tells me, “a psychoanalytical look at being on form in cricket and life”. It could easily have been called “On Empathy”, since much of it melds together his experiences as a cricketer and his expertise as a psychoanalyst to prod, probe and understand the workings of the mind, and how that affects our performance in whatever walk of life engages us.
Brearley has always believed the psychology of the game to be vital. “Cricket is a psychological game — a lot goes on in the head in terms, for example, of shrewdness, resilience, bluff, individualism and team spirit,” he says. “Captaining calls for a down-to-earth sense of what makes players tick, both to help get the best out of one’s own team and to probe the weakness of the opposition. People ask me if psychology helped me in this role. It did, but the reverse applied equally: cricket helped me to be more psychologically aware.”
This curiosity in people began to take concrete shape at Cambridge University, where Brearley joined the Samaritans. He found that people didn’t ring off quickly, that he could listen to them and wanted to understand why they were so despairing or suicidal. His never-to-be-finished PhD was entitled “Emotion and Reason: Explanations of Action” — the reason being that he wanted to try “and find my way into the life of the mind”.
By 1976 he had been accepted for training as a psychoanalyst and, during the latter stages of his career, was in analysis himself. “My last year of playing, in 1982, was a crazy time. I would have it five mornings a week before play, 6.15 in the morning sometimes if we were playing away; later, 8.30am, if we were playing in London. It was very good of my analyst to be so accommodating.”
For a long time, sport and academia battled for precedence. He played for Middlesex from 1961 to 1965, left the game to study and later went into a teaching post at Newcastle University, before eventually returning to cricket with the offer of the captaincy of Middlesex. I have always admired how easily these two aspects of his life have appeared to fit together, how he has never felt the need to wear his learning heavily around cricketers, nor felt the need to justify to his academic friends the notion that sport is a worthwhile pursuit.
“It is a worthwhile pursuit,” he says. “There’s not much point in doing it if it’s not. I write a bit in the book about the snobbery of academia and the denigration from the sporting hearty. For a while I, too, thought the study of philosophy more honourable and noble but I don’t really think I was an academic at heart and that was one of the reasons I came back to cricket, that and the captaincy of Middlesex, which I thought would be stimulating.”
In the book, he quotes the mountaineer Heinrich Harrer: “The glorious thing about mountains is that they will endure no lies.” There is courage required to play elite sport, too, and truth emerges more often than not on the field of play. It is fertile ground for character study.
But it is less easy for the modern England captain to come to the job well formed in these arts. “Modern England captains don’t really get to captain their counties any more and it was an apprenticeship back then,” he says. “A county captain would run the club, essentially, but there is not that same potential to learn now. It’s harder. You also have coaches, which can make it both easier and harder. They can get in the way, although a really good coach must be a fantastic asset.”
I have often been struck by how warmly former colleagues of all backgrounds and temperaments have greeted Brearley. City of London School for boys, Cambridge and now living among the intellectuals of north London, maybe, but Brearley is no snob. He does not give much away autobiographically but I was struck by snippets — he liked the game British Bulldog as a boy, worked on a building site after university — that suggested a more rough-and-tumble edge than the donnish egghead of popular notion.
“People thought I was an overeducated twit. Perhaps I was. But I come from a very ordinary background,” he says. “My dad was a schoolteacher. He was the first in our family to stay on after school or even go into sixth form. Most of the others were bringing money home by then. His father was an engine fitter from Yorkshire. Obviously a very skilled man. He played for Heckmondwike cricket club. If my father [Horace Brearley played a few first-class matches for Yorkshire and Middlesex] ever got runs, they would say to him, ‘Tha’ wouldn’t have got hundred if tha’ father’d been bowling!’ Very Yorkshire.”
The peculiarities of this Yorkshire ground, Headingley, are intriguing him as we chat and our conversation is peppered at my insistence about the Test in front of us: “That’s good, West Indies have looked more purposeful.” “Gabriel looks strong.”
“Why is there a reluctance to post more men in the slips? I suppose batsmen are more aggressive these days, pitches are flatter, but still …” “Shouldn’t first slip be a little wider? I don’t think enough thought is given to the position of the slips according to how a batsman plays … you could be standing in two very different positions for the same bowler to two different batsmen …”
It is clear that he believes captaincy to be a vital skill. “Leadership is so crucial, helping to make individualists into teams and stodgy groups into teams that permit, encourage and enhance individual brilliance.” But what if there is a mismatch, as there was in the first Test between England and West Indies at Edgbaston? Does captaincy matter at all? “Well, the answer is a captain can make it less of a mismatch,” he says. “Or more.”
He writes: “If individualists are too powerful, too divisive and too selfish, the team suffers. If they run riot, the notion of team scarcely exists. At the other extreme, some teams can become flat, conformist and dull. Far from running riot, individuality is suppressed.” These are tricky balances to find for any leader, but crucial in the formation of a happy, purposeful and successful team. There may be many different ways to handle such situations, just as there are many different ways to go about winning a cricket match. Occasionally, though, it all comes together and a captain can be on form.
Brearley gives an example in his book of one match where the combination of intuition, experience and downright luck produced a wicket. He says that he imagined his way into an opposition batsman’s (Clive Rice of Nottinghamshire) body, and felt or imagined the shape of the shot to come. Moments later, he posted an unorthodox fly slip and the catch followed. “It doesn’t happen very often, but it’s nice when it does,” Brearley says.
What, then, does he think of the latest England captain to take up the reins? Just as I ask the question, Joe Root creams a four through the covers and that sets Brearley off: “What a beautiful shot. You’d have to put that out of your mind as a fielding side. Fine player. As good as I’ve seen for England. Plays according to the situation. Terrific. Likes to take the right kind of risks. People talk about his conversion rate but that’s a dull way to look at the game. You have to take some risks.” And then, without thinking, a checklist, as if he were preparing to captain against him next week: “Likes to go at it early on. Got to have enough catchers in the slips. Thing is, that’s not necessarily over-attacking, it can stop runs, too. The good players — Boycott, Cook, Root, Williamson — play the ball late, behind square, sometimes off the face of the bat. Need to have point behind square, too. Two gullies probably. Leave cover open, you don’t mind him driving early on ... ” Form comes and goes, but once a captain, always a captain.
