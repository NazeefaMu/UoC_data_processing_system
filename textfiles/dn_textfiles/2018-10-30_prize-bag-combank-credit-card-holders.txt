Prize bag for ComBank Credit Card holders

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched a drive to increase its Credit Card base, and has announced that it will offer 10 pairs of air tickets to Singapore to 10 lucky Sri Lankans who obtain a Credit Card from the Bank before 31st December 2018.
Existing cardholders who obtain a new supplementary card during this period would also be eligible to participate in the draw for these tickets, the Bank said.
Commercial Bank has already achieved market leadership in terms of Debit and Credit Card point-of-sale usage in value terms, and new card issuance is growing at a faster rate than the market average.
The Bank has introduced many industry firsts in the Credit Card market over the past two years, including Max Loyalty Rewards, the first loyalty rewards scheme in the country to reward both Credit and Debit cards;Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled “TAP ’n’ GO”cards for both VISA and Mastercard branded cards, and the launch tokenised Mastercard Payment Gateway Services (MPGS) in Sri Lanka.
Considered the best-value cards in the market, Commercial Bank cards regularly offer attractive deals covering hotel accommodation, household white goods, dining, fashion retail, jewellery and travel throughout the year with promotions such as Dine and Smile, Easy Vacations and Seasonal Offers over a period of time, rather than for just a few days.
Commercial Bank also facilitates attractive discounts and offers regularly to its cardholders at popular super markets.
The Bank offers a variety of Credit Cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and Mastercard as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment. An important advantage is that Commercial Bank cards are backed by a strong 263 branch network and a network of 782 ATMs that are EMV compliant, assuring maximum security.
