Eight treasure hunters arrested

Eight persons who were planning a treasure hunt on the Aranayake Rahala Rock were arrested on November 24 by Aranayake police from a house in Rahala following a tip off they received on police hotline.
The suspects had said they got together for a party. But they had confessed later that they gathered to plan the venture. They were to be produced before the Mawanella Magistrate.
