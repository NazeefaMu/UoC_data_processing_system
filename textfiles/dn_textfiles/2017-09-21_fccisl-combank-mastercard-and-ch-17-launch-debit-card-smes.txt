FCCISL, COMBANK Mastercard and CH 17 launch debit card for SMEs

The Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL), Commercial Bank and Channel 17 (CH17) have launched a special Mastercard branded hybrid debit card exclusively for entrepreneurs in the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector, in a scheme to recognise the important economic contribution by such entrepreneurs.
This EMV chip embedded debit card will be issued by the FCCISL to its members, and its owners will be eligible for special benefits such as substantial discounts on services from Sri Lanka Telecom and attractive discounts from Hardware stores, hospitals, restaurants, and for vehicle maintenance services.
Commercial Bank, the single largest lender to the SME sector in Sri Lanka, will be the banking partner to issue this card. Apart from specially designed discounts for SME cardholders by the FCCISL, cardholders will also be eligible for the year-round special promotions offered to Commercial Bank debit cardholders as well as offers by Mastercard.
Commercial Bank, the market leader in debit card point of sale usage in Sri Lanka, has already issued sector-specific cards for employees of the apparel sector, for tea leaf suppliers and for recipients of remittances.
Set up in 1973, the FCCISL is the largest and most representative apex business organisation of Sri Lankan business. It is also the most widely spread business organisation with member bodies from all districts and provinces of Sri Lanka.
As an umbrella organization of the private sector, the FCCISL has been playing a key role in promoting business and industry in the country by providing the member bodies with a wide spectrum of services ranging from advisory, consultative, promotional, information sharing and representative services.
