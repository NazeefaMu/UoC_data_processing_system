Donkeys in chic trousers

When it comes to animal fashion, dogs tend to get all the attention. During the winter, every little pooch seems to have its own jacket. Owners spend thousands on outfits, make them Instagram famous and outfit them in headpieces, feather boas and badges.
But did you know that some donkeys also have their own special sartorial style?
It turns out that in certain parts of the world, donkeys are dressed in custom-made trousers in a bid to stop pesky flies from biting their legs.
There’s still the unanswerable question of what the ‘right’ way for four-legged animals to wear trousers but we’ll leave that one for now.
At the Donkey Sanctuary Of Canada, volunteer Sheila Zanyk made Ben a pair of trousers to stop the flies from bothering him. And it seems as though other animals are now getting something similar.
"It took a few tries but it’s working well now," she tells CTVNews.ca.
"The first time we put them on him, he was really proud of himself. He walked around the whole barnyard – just “look at me, look at me”."
After getting used to the sound of the velcro – which startled him at first – Ben now has two pairs of trousers and will be wearing them both until the winter season, when the flies finally buzz off. And no doubt, the trend will spread to donkeys in other countries in the near future.
