Sajith should be new UNP leader – Southern PC member

Ranil Wickremesinghe should hand over the leadership of the United National Party to Sajith Premadasa, Southern Provincial Council UNP member Sujith Muthukumarana said.
He said UNP supporters will take a decision if Wickremesinghe remains as leader. Muthukumarana held Wickremesinghe responsible for the instability in the country. Muthukumarana made these observations at a press conference held in Hambantota.
“Grassroots level UNP supporters are crestfallen. They brought this government into power dedicating their lives. But it has failed. UNP leadership must take responsibility for this failure. UNP supporters across the country are demanding a change in the party leadership. We are firm that the UNP leadership should change,” Muthukumarana pointed out.
Muthukumarana recalled that this is not the first time the UNP leadership has failed. He observed that Wickremesinghe was unable to stay in power in 2001 for more than two years. He said it is the same case in 2015.
It shows that there is a problem with the leadership, he added.
Muthukumarana said the present UNP leadership does not listen to the heartbeat of the grassroots level UNP supporters and is not interested in bringing development to the village. If we want to strengthen UNP, a change in leadership is a must, he stressed.
“In the coming election, legal matters aside, we should give UNP leadership to Sajith Premadasa. If we want to establish a UNP led government, we must change the party leader. All the UNP supporters will rise against Wickremesinghe. He is a man who did not allow even his close supporters to communicate with him, so what is there to talk about the village level UNP supporters. We will fight for this change, if not given,” Muthukumarana said.
