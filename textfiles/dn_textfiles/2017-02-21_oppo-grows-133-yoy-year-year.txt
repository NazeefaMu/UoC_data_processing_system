OPPO grows 133% YoY, year-on-year

OPPO had a strong finish to a momentous 2016 that saw 133 percent year-on-year growth for the global smartphone brand, according to the latest results from independent research firm IDC. A core product range that paired premium design with excellent photography helped OPPO maintain its position as the no. 4 smartphone brand globally by market share, and earn the no. 1 spot in China for the two most recent quarters.
IDC’s preliminarydata showed that OPPO accounted for 6.8 percent of the global smartphone market in 2016, and had four straight quarters of greater than 100 percent year-on-year growth.
“In 2016, our strategy was to stay simple and focused – putting out premium-quality products with phenomenal cameras,” said Sky Li, OPPO VP and Managing Director of International Mobile Business. “The success we saw is because of our commitment to listening to our users and bringing them devices tailor-made for their lifestyles. We’ll redouble that commitment as we continue our global expansion this year.”
OPPO focused on two main product lines last year – its “Selfie Expert” F series, and the stylish R series, whose industry-leading front and rear cameras embodied the OPPO Camera phone brand concept.
The F1s, sporting a 16 MP front camera, was a resounding success in South and Southeast Asia, two key regions for OPPO. It connected with a growing market of selfie-fanatic millenials, helping OPPO to hit a 10.9 percent sales unit share in India’s offline market in December, up from 1.2 percent at the same time in 2015, according to data from research firm Gfk.
2016 also saw continued expansion for OPPO around the globe, as it extended its business to 26 countries, including new markets in New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. In 2017, the company will leverage a recently established marketing center in Egypt to support accelerated expansion in the Middle East and North Africa region.
