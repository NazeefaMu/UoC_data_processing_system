Weerawila (Palatupana) Crab Curry
[Ingredients]
2 live Mud Crabs (about 1.2kg - 2lb 12 oz each) 400ml (14 fl oz) Coconut milk 1 Ball of Tamarind (golf ball size) 1 tblspn Jaffna Curry Powder 1 tblspn Chilli Powder 2 tspn Cumin Seeds 1/2 cup Fresh Grated Coconut 1 tspn Black Pepper 1 tspn Black Mustard Seeds 1/4 tspn Ground Turmeric 50g (1 3/4oz) Ghee 1 Spanish Onion (sliced) 1 Sprig Curry Leaves (leaves picked) 3 Small Green Chillies (finely chopped) 1/2 litre Water 1 Sprig of Drumstick Leaves Juice of 1/2 limes
Method:
Put the crabs in the freezer for 1 hour to immobilise them. Pull off the top shells, pull out the spongy grey gills and remove the guts. Chop the crab into 6 pieces, then crack the large claws but leave them attached.
Roast the cumin seeds, coconut and pepper till the coconut is golden brown. Grind to a smooth paste and put aside. Heat the ghee in a large heavy saucepan over high heat, add the mustard seeds till they start to pop, then add the fennel for a few minutes or until the onions are golden.
Add the curry powder, chilli powder and turmeric mix in and add the crab and cook for another 3 minutes. At this stage you need to stir it a lot so the spices don’t burn. Then add the coconut mixture, stir and add the water. If the curry is too dry add more water.
Cover and simmer 12 minutes or until crab is just cooked through and sauce has thickened. Stir in the drumstick leaves, lime juice and season to taste with salt.
