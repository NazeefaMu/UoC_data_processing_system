Dissolution of Parliament:
Asgiriya Chief Prelate praises President’s decision

President Maithripala Sirsiena has taken a wise decision in dissolving Parliament without allowing it to continue amidst a crisis situation, Most Ven.Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said.
“A set of national policy guidelines was required for a country to achieve progress and such a policy was greatly required in respect of agriculture,” he added.
The Asgiriya Chief Prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an Anusasana when Agriculture Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera called at his temple and received his blessings before briefing the Prelate about the current political situation in the country on November 10 morning. Earlier, Minister Amaraweera called on the Malwatte Chief Prelate Most. Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddharatha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera at his temple and briefed him too after receiving his blessings.
Minister Amaraweera told the Chief Prelates that the President never entertained an idea about dissolving Parliament earlier.
“However, the President was compelled to do so due to the arbitrary action and partisan attitude of the Speaker. If the crisis situation was allowed to continue, it would have even resulted in a bloodbath,” the Minister said. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their temples in Kandy and received their blessings on November 10.
