Buddhism and Western Psychotherapy

The early and mid-twentieth century saw a variety of renowned scholars, teachers, clinicians and writers in the West such as Rhys Davids, Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, Alan Watts, Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein have attempted to bridge and integrate psychology and Buddhism, from time to time.
Amongst them, British scholar Rhys Davids took a prominent role. He translated Abhidhamma Pitaka from Pali to English and subsequently wrote two other books titled Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics and “Buddhist psychology: An inquiry into the analysis and theory of mind”.
Buddhism and Western Psychology and sociology overlap in theory and in practice. Over the last century, experts have written on many commonalities between Buddhism and the various branches of modern western psychology.
For example, H.G. Wells, British historian, socialist and writer. wrote: “The fundamental teachings of Gautama, as it is now being made plain to us by study of original sources, is clear and simple and in the closest harmony with modern ideas. It is beyond all disputes the achievement of one of the most penetrating intelligence the world has ever known. Buddhism is the advance of world civilization and true culture than any other influence in the chronicles of mankind.
Noble truths
Buddha was commonly referred to as “the greatest physician” and like any therapist, made it his aim to identify, explain and end human suffering. His therapeutic methods helped millions of people throughout the centuries.
The Four Noble Truths which the Buddha discovered is a diagnostic format to explain human suffering and its cure; the first Noble Truth identifies the disease, the second provides cause of the disease, the third gives a prognosis, and the fourth suggests a remedy.
Psychotherapy
Today the Western world has realized the psychological essence of Buddhism. Many Psychotherapeutic systems in the West are derived from Buddha's teaching.
Buddha showed empathy and non-judgmental acceptance to everyone who came to him. He helped people to gain insight and helped in growth promotion while eliminating troubling and painful emotions. His therapeutic methods are exceptional and can be applied for all times.
Joseph Levine, the American philosopher, suggests a number of commonalities between Buddhism and Western psychology: Both are concerned with alleviating human suffering. Both focus on the human condition and interpret it in natural rather than religious terms. Both see humans as caught in a matrix of forces, including cravings and drives, based in biology and beliefs.
Both teach the appropriateness of compassion, concern, and unconditional positive regard toward all beings. Both share the ideal of maturing and growth. And both acknowledge that the mind functions at a superficial and deep level.
Psychoanalysis
Carl Jung, renowned a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, says, “In addition to being a religion, Buddhism gives voice to a philosophy, a psychology, and ethics as well. The primary concern of the Buddhism is to understand the nature of experience, and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious reality. For this reason, the philosophical enterprise of the Buddhism shades off into a phenomenological psychology.”
Many modern psychologists have found that the discoveries and explanations of the Buddhism coincide with their own recent discoveries and new ideas; as though the Buddhist principles, which was taught 2,500 years ago, had been redeveloped in the modern times.
Buddha said that life is suffering. Existential psychology speaks of ontological anxiety (dread, angst). Buddha said that suffering is due to attachment. Existential psychology also has some similar concepts. We cling to things in the hope that they will provide us with a certain benefit.
Buddha also said that suffering can be extinguished by attaining nirvana. The Buddhist concept of nirvana is quite similar to the existential psychologist’s concept of freedom. This concept has, in fact, been used in Buddhism in the context of freedom from rebirth or freedom from the effects of karma. For the existential psychologist, freedom is a fact of our being, one which we often ignore.
Finally, Buddha explained the path to attain nirvana in order to extinguish suffering.
For the existential psychologist, the therapist must take an assertive role in helping the subject (patient) become aware of the reality of his or her suffering and its roots. Likewise, the subject must take an assertive role in working towards improvement–even though it means facing the fears they’ve been working so hard to avoid.
Right Mindfulness
Right Mindfulness traditionally is the seventh part of the noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, but that doesn't mean it is seventh in importance. Each part of the path supports the other seven parts, and so they should be thought of as connected in a circle or woven into a web rather than stacked in an order of progression.
Some Buddhist teachers maintain that Right Mindfulness is at the heart of the Buddha's teaching.
The Pali word for mindfulness is sati which can mean "retention," "recollection," or "alertness." Mindfulness is a whole-body-and-mind awareness of the present moment. Being fully mindful means being fully attentive to everything as-it-is, not filtering everything through our subjective opinions.
Buddhistic mindfulness practices have been explicitly integrated into a variety of psychological treatments. More specifically psychotherapies dealing with cognitive restructuring share core principles with Buddhistic mindfulness practices to personal suffering.
Erich Fromm, German psychologist and psychoanalyst, distinguishes between two types of meditative techniques that have been used in psychotherapy: (i) auto-suggestion used to induce relaxation; and (ii) meditation “to achieve a higher degree of non-attachment, of non-greed, and of non-illusion; briefly, those that serve to reach a higher level of being”. Fromm attributes techniques associated with the latter to Buddhist mindfulness practices.
Meditative techniques
Another popular program that incorporates mindfulness to assist people with pain and a range of conditions and life issues is known as MBSR (Mindfulness-based stress reduction). It is meant for people who were initially difficult to treat in a hospital setting. Developed by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn of University of Massachusetts (USA) in 1970, MBSR uses a combination of Buddhist mindfulness meditation and body awareness, and also certain yogic exercises to help people become more mindful.
In recent years, mindfulness meditation has been the subject of controlled clinical research. This suggests it may have beneficial effects, including stress reduction, relaxation, and improvements to quality of life, but that it does not help prevent or cure disease.
Another prominent therapy that uses mindfulness is MBCT (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy developed by Zindel Segal. MBCT is designed to help people who suffer repeated bouts of depression and chronic unhappiness. It combines the ideas of cognitive therapy with meditative practices and attitudes based on the cultivation of mindfulness. The heart of this work lies in becoming acquainted with the modes of mind that often characterize mood disorders while simultaneously learning to develop a new relationship to them.
Kabat-Zinn, wrote: “Although at this time, mindfulness meditation is most commonly taught and practiced within the context of Buddhism, its essence is universal. Yet it is no accident that mindfulness comes out of Buddhism, which has as its overriding concerns the relief of suffering and the dispelling of illusions”.
Not surprisingly, in terms of clinical diagnoses, MBSR and MBCT have proven beneficial for people with depression and anxiety disorders; however, the program is meant to serve anyone experiencing significant stress.
Many of the principles like MBSR and MBCT incorporated in the theory of rational-emotive psychotherapy are not new.
They were used in Buddhist countries several thousands of years ago. To give one example, Buddhism identifies anger and ill-will as basic hindrances to spiritual development. A common Buddhistic antidote for anger is the use of active contemplation of loving thoughts (Metta). This is similar to using a MCBT technique known as “emotional training.”
