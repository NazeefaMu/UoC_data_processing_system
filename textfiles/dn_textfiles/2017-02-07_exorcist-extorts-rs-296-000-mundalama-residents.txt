Exorcist extorts Rs. 296, 000 from Mundalama residents

 
An exorcist who allegedly cheated a Mundalama family of Rs. 296, 000 was apprehended by Police yesterday.
The female exorcist who went by the name 'Maani' had charged the family a fee of Rs. 296, 000 to rid them of an evil omen.
The Mundalama family, who reported the incident to Police, said the exorcist had prophesied their ill luck was due to treasure buried on the property.
The 'treasure' - 6 Buddha statutes and 3 brass vessels had been discovered afterwards, but the family allege these items were buried by the exorcist herself.
Upon realising the deception, the family had lodged a complaint with the Police to arrest the exorcist and recover the Rs. 296, 000.
Mundalama Police who made the arrest is investigating the incident.
