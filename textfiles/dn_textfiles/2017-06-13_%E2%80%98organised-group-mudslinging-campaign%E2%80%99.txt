‘Organised group on mudslinging campaign’

An organised group of members numbering about 40 are conducting mudslinging campaigns using separate websites against government parliamentarians, said Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella.
They are led by a Joint Opposition MP, he said. The minister said: “We will conduct a formal investigation into this and take legal action against this group.
‘‘This is a well-organized attempt to tarnish the unity between the two major parties as well as to sabotage the process of providing long-term solutions for unresolved problems.”
The Minister stated these views attending an event held in Rajawatta, Peradeniya on Sunday.
“Even during the recent floods and landslides, mudslinging campaigns were conducted against government parliamentarians. A majority of the people are against such acts,” he added.
Provincial MPs and other invitees attended the event.
