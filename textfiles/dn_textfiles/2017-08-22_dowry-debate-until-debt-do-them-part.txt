Dowry debate: Until debt do them part

Down in this neck of the woods they call the subcontinent, securing financial stability through marriage is still seen as a matter of utmost importance for many a young man. Although there is a cultural precedent for precisely this sort of male ambition it would pain a lot of so called gold-digging Sri Lankan males to admit it.
Many would not publicly acknowledge pursuing wealthy women with such fervour, but it certainly does happen. A woman without a substantial dowry, no matter how upright and desirable, is viewed as being far more attractive if her parents are willing to part with a substantial chunk of the family wealth.
Those less alluring brides-elect in the looks department are usually at a significant disadvantage when it comes to the matrimonial stakes, although such ‘slight drawbacks’ can easily be varnished with thick layers of cold cream and wads of cold cash. You see, the extra ‘moolah’, property and wealth that come from these unions are a great boon to posterity, sometimes for many generations.
In our society, dowry which is given to the bride by her parents is an acceptable and an established practice. It is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. To be perfectly truthful when it comes to marriage certain people are always handing out or demanding a matrimonial prospectus. Just look at the matrimonial advertisements published in some of our leading local journals. Some even pronounce the word matrimony to sound as if it were ‘matter-of-money.’
Unfortunately, dowry is a very serious matter in India, not just because it is still widely practiced - despite laws against it - but because it precipitates far too much violence against women. Some fall victim to mysterious kitchen accidents, accidents that somehow never occur when the mother-in-law is cooking.” However, the practice is not as prevalent in Sri Lanka as among some of sub-continental neighbours. Fortunately in Sri Lanka the status of women is relatively high, especially in comparison to other South Asian nations. But we are all aware that the practice still exists here where it is expected among many groups for the bride’s family to give the groom a dowry.
The anti-dowry cynics may tell you that determined dowry hunters may as well follow the customary role with rude shamelessness asking affluent parents for their daughter’s hand with: “Your money and a wife allows me a life with no strife.” But the incurable romantics among us contend we should marry for love. They claim we should search for our soul-mate. Or at least that’s what the movies tell us.
But the school of thought that is considered mercenary when it comes to marriage does not share this idealistic outlook. They declare the reality is a bit more complicated as well as impractical. Many of them assert that there is an easier and less challenging way to tie the knot without tying yourself up in knots.
They insist that it is irrational to follow the romantic types to the altar or ‘poruwa’ by working hard, taking risks, maybe building your own business or developing your career. For the dignified male that has been the traditional route to financial success. Of course, there is another highly traditional path that another part of our community practices to acquiring wealth that isn’t talked about quite as much these days: Marrying money.
My good friend Marcellus, we call him Marcy for short, who married for love considers marrying for money quite repugnant. Nothing makes him more agitated and causes him to flip his lid more than the subject of dowry hunters and anyone bent on marrying for money. He is a vociferous anti-dowry lobbyist and contends that marrying for money is a repulsive idea.
Marcellus who is an incurable romantic can be quite merciless when it comes to lashing out at anyone who does not share his idealistic outlook. He claims that when he married nobody brought up the question of dowry. He elaborates: “Not my bride, not my in-laws, not my mother, and certainly not me.
If I had even hinted that I wanted a dowry, my bride would have immediately called off the wedding. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, she would have also refused to go on the honeymoon.”
He cites the example of another of our acquaintances named Prosper who he claims settled down for shekels. Marcy’s stand on the subject has always been in diametric contrast to that of the conformist-minded Prosper. Both the unconventional Marcy and the traditionalist Prosper have always been at loggerheads over the subject of dowry.
You will have realised by now that there had been no love lost between the two adversaries. In fact when the debate on the subject got a bit hot under their collars Marcy said he actually told Prosper that his parents should have been congratulated for christening him appropriately. He baited Prosper by telling him that his name must have been a shortened form for prospector. He told Prosper: “After all, they must have known you were a born gold-digger from the time you came squealing into the world.”
Marcy says: “He values money more than love, beauty or virtue. It’s that simple. Love, romance, or looks were never a priority. For the right amount he can love anybody! His wife provided a lifestyle and that’s what he loved. But then he did not bargain for the fact that with all the benefits money could buy he had to go along with a life time of bickering and suffering.”
Marcy quite uncharitably says that Prosper’s wife had an uncanny resemblance to her family pet, or was it the other way around? I say uncharitable because the family pet happened to be a bulldog. He swore that the likeness did not end with the same facial expressions and heavy physique of the family hound. He elaborated that when she spoke she rumbled and yelped and most of her dialogue was made up of biting sarcasm with bared incisors.
As if this was not bad enough Marcy claimed with defamatory temerity that Prosper’s 97-year-old-mother-in-law still calls the shots on the home front and reminds him constantly that she grubstaked him before he became a financial success. Says Marcy: “Imagine living with a geriatric in-law who is really an outlaw in petticoats! How’s that for choosing a family because of their fiscal fitness?”
The story goes that Prosper had decided to walk out of the dispute. But all in all, it had been an exciting ding-dong debate on the merits and demerits of matrimonial endowments, of whether to condone or divorce the dowry system. The bridle was finally reined in over the issue of Bride and Prejudice. And very likely to remain so, for Prosper and his wife at least, until debt do them part!
