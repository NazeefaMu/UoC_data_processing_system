Beyond the walls of division

With a dream to be an Entrepreneur, Head Boy of Nalanda College Colombo, Kavindu Wickramasinghe is a leader who has the drive to make his dreams come true. Perfect Prefects features Wickramasinghe who is ready to help restore peoples’ faith in humanity.
His message to young people has everything to do with following one’s heart. Passion for self- advancement and compassion for others. With today’s hectic lifestyles we have little time to enjoy life and enjoy the simple things in life.
Struggle to survive
“Follow your heart. Be passionate about contributing to society and always be ready to help another human being. I would like to see people happy. In today’s context, people are struggling to survive and they have forgotten how to be happy,” said Wickramasinghe.
Becoming an entrepreneur and starting his own business is his biggest dream and goal in life. Getting a team together to do this and achieving great heights in a way that is socially responsible is his ambition. And he intends to do all of this in an ethical manner, keeping in mind that values and morals are as important as becoming successful. For him a human life is important.
“In whatever field I choose to take after my school life, I want to make a difference in peoples’ lives and even in a small way make them happy,” pointed out Wickramasinghe.
To restore faith in humanity is something that Wickramasinghe regards as imperative. Because right now people are becoming extremely disheartened with society. Especially the youth need to be told that there is still hope and many people are good people. They need to be reminded of this. The hopes of an entire world and civilizations rest in the hands of the youth. Without thinking of our differences let us think about our similarities. We need to break down the walls of division.
Belief in the good
“In today’s context, we need a role model, who can inspire the youth to form strong opinions on how to eradicate poverty and believe that there is good in society. There are times that are dark and seem hopeless. But you still need to keep believing in others. Today’s leaders are fighting over various issues and forgetting the simple fact that we are all humans. There is such needless bloodshed,” explained Wickramasinghe.
When facing obstacles he keeps calm. There is no need to jump the gun. One must not be too hasty when confronted with a difficulty.
“I like to keep calm when I face an obstacle. It gives me time and peace of mind, to go to the bottom of the problem. Then I come with the best solution needed. Being calm and addressing the correct point, helps when handling pressure. The ability to speak to others in their preferred tone of voice would help to bring down the tension,” stated Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe credits his school for what he is today, citing that Nalanda has produced many great Sri Lankans in many fields in society.
“Nalanda College has done this by the education and exposure they give to the child making the child understand his true potential. I have been fortunate to explore many opportunities in terms of both educational and extra-curricular activities at Nalanda. I was able to finish my A/L education with good colours and I was also able to become the all-island national champion of Rifle shooting, age group under 16. This was because of the guidance that I received at school. I represented the senior debating team of Nalanda College for four years from 2014 – 2018. I was able to win many titles for the college. It was a huge privilege for me to become the head prefect of Nalanda College after entering the college as a grade five scholarship student,” added Wickramasinghe.
Inspiration to loyalty
Charismatic Justin Trudeau is a leader who Wickramasinghe admires. Trudeau’s dedication to Canada and its people is an inspiration to Wickramasinghe who also believes that the masses need to be loyal to their country and work in the best interests of the country. Patriotism is a priority for this young man. Wickramasinghe has that ‘feel’ for the people.
“I admire the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau because he is a young leader who has an immense love for his country and his people. He is a true gentleman both in his political and professional life. One difference I would like to make in my own way, is helping to eradicate poverty with the help of all the others in the world who want to make a change,” said Wickramasinghe.
Wickramasinghe has many interests in the outside world. Some of these interests are cricket, climate change and eradicating poverty. He also regards the world cup victories by the Sri Lankan side in 1996 and 2014 as events that are memorable to him.
Wickramasinghe feels that the key to success, happiness and peace is knowing that what you are doing is correct and know that what you are doing is making a positive difference in the life of someone else. In other words, seeing others happy should make you happy.
“I would like to thank the Ven. Maha Sanga, our principal sir, teachers and my friends and family. They have helped me a lot and inspired me in many ways. My family have always placed their trust in me and supported me right throughout my journey,” summed up Wickramasinghe.
