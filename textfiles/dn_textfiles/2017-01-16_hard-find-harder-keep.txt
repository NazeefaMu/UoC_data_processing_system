Hard to Find, Harder to Keep

Don't we all remember Pooh Bear's words (in the movie, not in the book?) He says it to his best friend, Christopher Robin, or was it Christopher Robin who says it to Pooh? Either way, no doubt, the sentiments are mutual. "If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you." If you ask your parents, they will say The Beatles sang about it too way back in 1967, "What would you think if I sang out of tune/ Would you stand up and walk out on me?" (Admit it, you have heard this song too, and secretly like it) There is no one around who would remember Aristotle saying it, but it appears he said something about this phenomenon too, and described it as a "single soul dwelling in two bodies."
We are talking about friends here. Through thick-and-thin friends. The ones you can call at four in the morning, sobbing. Or the ones you can dial at midnight jumping up and down with joy. They are the ones with whom laughter comes in loud hearty gales, because they have been there beside you in the darkest days of your life and they know, better than just about anyone else, the deepest, darkest corners of your heart.
FB friends?
Hold it there. Does this apply to the 21st century, though? Does this apply to the 2346 friends we have on Facebook? Does this species called the true friend still exist?
Probably not. Think Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. It is easy to see the definition of a friend has changed in unimaginable ways in today's technologically connected world. We all know, in the context of social media, the term "friend" is often used to describe contacts rather than relationships so much so that, even though we may think we have many "friends" (a wide variety of people, from classmates, to colleagues, to neighbours, and in most cases, to friends of friends) we really have none.
This is mainly because thanks to social media we have the ability to send our "friends" a message, but communicating through messages is not the same thing as having a relationship with a person one on one. As writer Pamela Paul says in a recent column in the New York Times, "The whole concept of what it is to make a friend has shifted," drastically. She writes that with Facebook, " to friend" has become a verb, "and yet to do so, in the social-media sense, is a fairly passive act." In other words, it is easy to become friends on Facebook and virtually effort free to end a friendship, whereas in real life making friends and breaking up are major events.
Moreover, as those of us unfortunate enough to have got addicted to it, know, Facebook places every type of social connection into a single "friend" basket even when the strength of the relationship can vary dramatically. An acquaintance versus a true friend, for example, signals different levels of trust and expectations which are ironed out on the Facebook wall. In all fairness it is true social media lets us enjoy the ability to be informed and to stay current with what is happening in the lives of many of our acquaintances as well as current and former friends and even people we have not met personally whom we call our friends. But, when you think about it, you realize friendship also requires the vulnerability of caring as well as revealing things about yourself that don't match the polished image in your Facebook profile or Instagram feed.
Who are true friends?
So, the all important question is: what differentiates a true, lasting friendship from the other, temporary social bonds? According to psychiatrist Robert Rowney, there are certain habits that genuine friends possess, which make them more like family. And it is these characteristics that create the indescribable bond called true friendship.
One of the qualities that sets real friends apart from everyone else we know of, is that they push us to be more accepting of ourselves. Whenever we are wallowing in negative self-criticism, true friends lift us up and drag us back onto the top of the world. Whether it is feeling inadequate in a job interview or just not liking what is staring back at us in the mirror, our closest friends are the ones who beg to differ when our self-opinion starts getting low. "Real friends naturally boost your self-esteem," says Prof Rowney. "And in turn, helping out a good friend [in this way] can help you feel better about yourself as well."
Mindful manner
True friends also call us out when we are in the wrong. We all have flaws. Real friends identify them in a mindful manner. "They're able to point out some of the negative things you are doing in addition to the positive," Prof. Rowney says. "They really support you on both sides."
This gentle honesty, is what really sets genuine friendships apart from the weaker ones. "If it's a superficial friend or a new friend, they are not going to say anything that may be off-putting," says the professor. "But if it's a real friend - someone you truly trust - they know they can tell you exactly what is on their mind. People who are open and straightforward are some of the most important types of friends to have."
But, the greatest gift any friend could ever give you is full attention and awareness - and true friends make their presence a priority. "A real friend is always there, paying attention to your needs along with theirs," he says.
Having said that, he also points out that, unlike when we were in school as we get older, as time goes on, our days start to become more jam-packed with work, marriage, kids, and by extension, we become more unavailable.
But real friends don't let life interrupt the relationship. Whether it is carving out some time for a catch-up call or planning a visit, genuine friends make each other a priority.
Capable of forgiving
Finally, true friends know how to help us battle with the storms that blow through our lives. As Randy Taran, author and producer of Project Happiness, writes, "When conflicts come up, real friends have the courage to reach out directly rather than gossiping and letting irritations grow. Real friends understand, and because they understand they are capable of forgiving."
So, if you happen to have a few friends who know you are a good egg, even though slightly cracked, hold on to them for life. They are the ones who know the song in your heart and will sing it to you when you are too tired to remember.
10 Things True Friends Don't Do
* 1. They don't gossip behind your back.
True friends distance themselves from unnecessary drama. If a close one spreads rumors or shares secrets that you asked to be kept private, then they aren't a true friend worthy of your trust.
* 2. They don't resort to personal attacks.
True friends aren't in the business of making you feel bad about yourself. They communicate with words of kindness, not cruelty. They focus on your similarities, not your differences. They speak of your qualities, not your shortcomings.
* 3. They don't start pointless arguments.
True friends know that there is nothing less productive than starting an argument you can't win. A true friend should be willing to accept a person as they are, whether they agree or not.
* 4. They don't interrupt your every word.
True friends aren't so obsessed with themselves that they aren't interested in how you feel. A fair and balanced friendship can't exist in a situation where one half does all the talking and none of the listening.
* 5. They don't discourage you from pursuing your goals.
True friends are willing to offer feedback without mincing words if they feel it is necessary for your personal development, but they don't do so in a condescending or hateful fashion.
* 6. They don't look down on you for your past.
True friends aren't concerned with your past, no matter how colorful it might be.
* 7. They don't abandon you in social situations.
* 8. They don't get jealous of your success.
True friends don't waste their time in a pit of jealousy when something good happens to another person.
* 9. They don't judge you or try to "fix" you.
True friends can admit that they themselves are far from perfect, so it's a bit absurd to expect anything more from another person.
*10. They don't take your friendship for granted.
True friends don't see a relationship as a short-term fling that can be tossed aside when it becomes inconvenient, but rather a long-term commitment of high importance.
