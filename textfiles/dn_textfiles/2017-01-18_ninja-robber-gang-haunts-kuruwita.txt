Ninja robber gang haunts Kuruwita

A Ninja type robber gang engaged in midnight robberies have posed a serious threat to the lives of residents in Kuruwita, the Kuruwita police said.
Members of this gang with masks fully covering their faces had entered several houses at night and committed robberies.
More recently they had entered a house in Ekneligoda by cutting window grills and robbed Rs. 9,000 by breaking open an almirah.
Two members of the gang had escaped after clubbing the house owner who was awakened and came to take them to task.
A police spokesman said they suspected drug addicts to be behind these robberies. Police investigations are continuing.
