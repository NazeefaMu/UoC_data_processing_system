President can work  with Mahinda: Isura

President and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leader Maithripala Sirisena can work with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa without any problem, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing the media at his office at the Western Provincial Council in Colombo yesterday, he said that it is President Sirisena who hated the UNP most. He works with the UNP without any problem now, he said.
President Sirisena worked with former President Rajapaksa for three or four decades. If the President can work with the UNP, he can easily work with the former President. When President Sirisena becomes the next Sri Lankan President in 2020, the country needs a Prime Minister.
The Chief Minister said President Sirisena was the common candidate for the 2015 Presidential Election, but he contested as the General Secretary of the SLFP. He is the leader of the SLFP and not the common candidate any more. He has no deals or agreements with the UNP or any one else.
He will never let down the people who voted for him. He can contest for the next Presidential Election as the SLFP Leader, Devapriya said.
