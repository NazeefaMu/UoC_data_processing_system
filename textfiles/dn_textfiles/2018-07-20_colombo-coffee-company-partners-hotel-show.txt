The Hotel Show and NBC 2108 which started today will be held until July 22 at the BMICH.
As the flag carrier of the world-renowned “Lavazza” brand in Sri Lanka, CCC has been recognized as being instrumental in the revival of the coffee industry in the country. The introduction of the Sri Lanka National Barista Championship which happens simultaneously to the Hotel Show was one of the first pioneering ventures carried out by CCC. The competition sees the most-talented baristas from hotels, restaurants and coffee houses battle it out creating signature coffee-based drinks in order to crown the Top Barista in the country. CCC has selected Lavazza as the Official Coffee Brand and La Cimbali Professional Espresso Machines as the Official Coffee Machine Brand for the competition. Participants therefore will be using one of the best brands of coffee and an advanced coffee machine to prepare their signature drinks.
This year too CCC will be flying down foreign judges and providing free coffee for young baristas to train and compete. The 2018 competition is larger than ever with six regional rounds and 200 participants competing in preliminary rounds spanning the entire island. This is the first time the competition will also see participation from outside of Colombo at a regional level. The winners will be sent to Singapore to take part in the “Asian Barista Championships” which brings together coffee enthusiasts and mixologists from the Asian continent. The 5th consecutive Sri Lankan National Barista Championship will be held today at BMICH and CCC invites café owners, coffee enthusiasts and the general public to come witness this grand event.
CCC will also have its own coffee corner and stall at the Hotel Show showcasing some of its signature coffee brands and equipment like La Cimbali, Gaggia, WMF, NuovaSimonelli and FETCO etc. Visitors can experience the process of coffee making through interactive displays and also purchase world-class coffee for home, office, restaurant or industrial use. The CCC team will also be at hand to provide valuable insight to those who are interested in the subject.
As industry leaders CCC also introduced a 100 per cent Sri Lankan premier coffee roasted to satisfy Sri Lankan taste-buds. “Toscana Ceylon” is a part of CCC’ corporate social responsibility initiatives where part of the profits go back to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of Sri Lankan coffee farmers. This brand will also be showcased at the Hotel Show.
In order to provide a one-stop-shop for coffee enthusiasts CCC also recently opened a dedicated coffee store down Ward Place that stocks all of its signature brands. Please visit Hall “A” at the Hotel Show to witness the life cycle of coffee at the CCC stall.
