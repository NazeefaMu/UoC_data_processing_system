Kanrich Finance initiates drinking  water project in Batticaloa

Kanrich Finance Limited launched a unique Corporate Social Responsibility program to provide drinking water facilities to rural school in Batticaloa.

The project was graced by Chief Executive Officer Kanrich Finance Limited, Shiran Weerasinghe, General Manager, Eranda Amal Godage, Deputy General Manager, Pradeep Basnayake, Head of CSR, Manoj Waariyagoda, Zone Head, Jagath Gamage, Public Health Inspector of Aithamale and the Principal of Aithamale Tamil Vidyalaya, B.P.Princely. Teachers, Students and the employees of the Kanrich Finance Limited also participated at this special occasion. Kanrich Finance Limited has won the people’s trust for over 45 years as a reliable and trusted financial institution in Sri Lanka.
