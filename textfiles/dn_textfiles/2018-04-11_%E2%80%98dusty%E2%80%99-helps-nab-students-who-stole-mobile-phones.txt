‘Dusty’ helps nab students who stole mobile phones

The Badulla Police had arrested five students who had broken into the office of Badulla Central College Vice Principal and stolen 10 mobile phones on April 5.
The suspects had been apprehended with the assistance of Police Sniffer dog ‘Dusty’, Badulla Police HQI Tennakoon told the Daily News.
He said while five students had been involved in the incident, three of them had stolen the mobile phones on April 4 night. However, the police dog had tracked the scent at the scene of the crime to the house of one of the suspects located some 2 km away from the school.
That student was interrogated and he had revealed information regarding the other students who were involved in the theft.
The stolen phones were recovered from their possession. Badulla Central College does not allow students to bring mobile phone to school and these phones had been confiscated by the school authorities.
HQI Tennakoon said that the five suspects were produced in court and released on bail.
The students were handed over to their parents and were ordered to appear in court on May 13.
