EFL expands global footprint to Malaysia

EFL (Expolanka Freight) a global freight-forwarding company headquartered in Sri Lanka is setting up its 18th overseas operations in the regional hub of Malaysia. The company is taking over an existing operation managed by its parent company SG Holdings Global and will officially open for business in Kuala Lampur on 1 September 2018.
“Malaysia is a natural addition to EFL’s global portfolio, largely to drive the intra-Asia growth, and to complement our USA expansion. Being a prominent economy in the region, we believe, it will be an important part of EFL’s footprint, to cement our place as a sought-after freight forwarder in the South East Asia region,” Chief Executive Officer S. Senthilnathan said.
With Asia contributing significantly to the logistics industry’s growth, analysts point out that growth in trade and domestic demand will in turn drive the growth of the transportation and logistics industry. Issuing a statement on the announcement, SG Holdings Global shared its strategy for further expansion. “This will be in line with our Group’s goal, as we build on EFL’s extensive global network and expertise to further expand our reach,” it said.
EFL is a member of Expolanka PLC – a leading conglomerate with interests in Logistics, Leisure and Investments.
