Anura Senanayake granted bail after one year

Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested in connection with his alleged role in the cover up of evidence and conspiring to committing the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
Former DIG Senanayake was ordered to be released on a cash bail of one million rupees with three sureties of Rs.5 million each. The High Court further barred the suspect from leaving the country and ordered him to be appear before CID every Sunday of each month. He was severely warned not to interfere with the witnesses in the case.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the CID did not object to release the suspect on bail under strict bail conditions.
It was revealed that the former DIG had been arrested by the CID on May 23, 2016. The defence maintained that in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person should be detained for more than twelve months in custody. Through his revision application, the former DIG sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution had maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeen’s death as a fatal road accident.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the CID. President’s Counsel Anil de Silva appeared on behalf of the suspect.
