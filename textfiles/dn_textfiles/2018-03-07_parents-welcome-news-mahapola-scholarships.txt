Parents welcome news of Mahapola scholarships

The Parents Union of State Medical Students welcomed the promise made by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama that all 50 installments of Mahapola scholarships would be paid to all medical students and the union sincerely hopes the promise will be kept, Parents Union of State Medical Students' Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that the promise had been made in writing and the union hopes all 50 installments of Mahapola Scholarship will be paid to the medical students as promised.
According to Alwis, the union also requests the Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim to intervene in the strike launched by the non-academic staff of state universities and solve their issues as soon as possible without wasting valuable time of undergraduates.
The union requests the officials of the Presidential Secretariat to inform the Government's official stand on SAITM to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the Supreme Court as soon as possible in order to avoid another conflict.
The President should be vigilant about state officials who deliberately do not carry out his orders and the orders of Cabinet Ministers because of their private ideologies and agendas. The best example for such officials is the University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman, he added.
