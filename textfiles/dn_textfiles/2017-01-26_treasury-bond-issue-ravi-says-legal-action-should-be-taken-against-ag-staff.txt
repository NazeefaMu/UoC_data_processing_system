Treasury Bond issue: Ravi says legal action should be taken against AG, staff for leaking sensitive report

Legal action should be taken against the Auditor General and his staff for leaking a sensitive report pertaining to the Treasury Bond issue to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake and not giving the same to the Finance Minister on his request, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament yesterday said.
He made this observation yesterday making a statement on the tabling of a report of Auditor General in Parliament by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake on Tuesday.
The Finance Minister said that the Auditor General had not provided him with the report and given it to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake thereby breaching his privileges.
He added that MP Ratnayake on Tuesday said in parliament that the auditor general had given him the report.
“It was a report that I had asked for,” Finance Minister Karunanayake said. The report is a sensitive one containing secret information. The report states it is only for the eyes of Prime Minister, Finance Minister and the President. Only they are permitted to access such sensitive information. The Auditor General has given the report to the MP. He has done so even without putting it in an envelope.”
The Finance Minister also said that the investigations with regard to this issue was still in progress. He added that this action tantamount to breaching his privileges. He also added that it was not upto the public servants to act in this manner.
“This information had been released to the COPE Chairman and the Central Bank Governor,” the Finance Minister said. “However I had been not informed. These are very sensitive information with regard to the financial market.”
He added that the Auditor General had acted in a manner which would lose secrecy of documents and their information. He added that such revealing of information would be detrimental to the Bond Market and the economy.
He also added that the Auditor General acted in an unprofessional manner.
“I propose an investigation should be held to find as to how Auditor General procured those information to Parliamentarians,” Finance Minister Karunanayake said.
“This had been done without my approval. No other Auditor General had acted in such a manner before. Action should be taken against all officials who involved in this act.”
Report tabled by me was not a copy given by AG: Rathnayake
The report tabled by him was not a copy that was given to him by the Auditor General but the same that was given to the COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti, JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said.
He also said that the report of the Auditor General on the Treasury Bond issuances since 2008 to 2015 had been forwarded to the COPE Chairman, the Speaker, Finance Minister and Central Bank Governor.
He made these observations yesterday in response to the statement made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on the Auditor General’s report tabled by Bimal Rathnayake on Tuesday.
“The report tabled by me was not a copy that was given to me by the Auditor General but the same that was given to the COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti” MP Bimal Rathnayake said.
“Sunil Handunnetti was abroad and came on Tuesday morning to join the debate,” MP Ratnayake said. “He instructed me to study them on behalf of him”.
He further said that he clearly stated in Parliament on Tuesday while tabling them that it was tabled on the instruction of MP Handunnetti. It is recorded in the unedited copy of the Hanzard too.
He also said that a letter by the Auditor General states that he was answerable to Parliament and not to the Finance Minister except on very specific matters that is mentioned in the Financial Act.
He added that the facts inquired by the Finance Minister do not come under the Finance Act.
He added that the Prime Minister has to look into the matter that several UNP MPs were in the habit of threatening the Auditor General continuously even during the COPE Committee.
However responding to MP Rathnayake, Minister Ravi Karunanayake demanded to know as to who had threatened the Auditor General.
He added the opposition had to reveal the members names who threatened the Auditor General without slinging mud.
