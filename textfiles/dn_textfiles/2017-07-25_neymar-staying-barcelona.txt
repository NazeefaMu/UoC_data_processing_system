Neymar staying at Barcelona

Washington: Brazilian superstar striker Neymar will stay with Barcelona, according to teammate Gerard Pique, who posted a Twitter message on the striker’s status Sunday.
Spanish international defender Pique indicated the South American maestro would continue at Camp Nou by tweeting a photo of Neymar with the caption “He’s staying.”
The message came hours after Neymar gave Barcelona fans a dazzling reminder of what he brings, the talisman scoring twice as the Spanish giants defeated Juventus 2-1 in a pre-season friendly Saturday in New Jersey.
The 25-year-old Brazilian superstar is at the centre of frenzied speculation linking him to a world record 222-million-euro ($256.8 million) transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. AFP
