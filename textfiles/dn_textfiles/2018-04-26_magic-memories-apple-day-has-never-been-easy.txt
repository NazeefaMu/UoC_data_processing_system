Magic memories: An apple a day has never been easy

I had the good fortune to pick an apple in a verdant orchard in the Granite Belt in Australia on my sojourn there a few days ago.
The literature written on apples is vast. In our early days of language acquisition, we as children were parroting ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ Now I often wonder, other than medicinal and curative powers of the apple whether our colonial masters were in an all-out attempt to establish the apple market in our tiny island in their usual subtle manner. Even though the very fruit has added much knowledge to our horizon in appealing proverbs like ‘’An apple never falls far from the tree.’’, to mean a child usually behaves in a similar way to his or her parents. ‘The apple of one’s eye. ’It means a person or thing that is loved more than any other. When we find two people or things are quite different from each other we say ‘’Apples and oranges.’’ Apple could be used to teach a very good idiom.’’ Upset the apple cart’’ is used to say in good English to describe a situation that causes problems for somebody or spoil their plans or arrangements. A well- versed teacher in a school classroom could always apply his or her knowledge of proverbs to arrest the downward trend of moral decay of the society in a very productive manner. The apple is a very delicious fruit that titillates the taste buds of the children. This round fruit with a shiny red or green skin with a firm white flesh is definitely a treat to our palates.’ ‘Adam’s apple’ seems to have dropped from our modern teachers because of their lackadaisical approach to English teaching in an innovative way. It refers to the lump at the front of the throat that sticks out, particularly in men, and moves up and down when you swallow. I had the good fortune to taste an apple pie on my recent sojourn in Australia where apple is grown in abundance. An apple pie is a very palatable sweet made by baking apple in a dish with pastry on the bottom, sides and top. Yet, it is used as an idiom to represent an idea of perfect home life and comfort. In a nutshell, the teachers of English could exploit the children’s interest in apples to create interest in learning Queen’s Lingo with renewed interest by bringing an apple to the English teaching classroom.Dear English teachers, why don’t you give a try?
A sign board in the wine country of the Granite Belt in Australia says ‘’an apple a day has never been easy’’
That sign board caught my eye because my love for apple stirred my mind a lot. The excitement made by the above sentence on mewas soon on my children’s radar. Our carnival vehicle was stopped by my son –in- law just behind a fruitful apple tree as you see in the picture. A red letter day in my life!
Apples fill the coffers in Australia and generate employment for the people there not in uncertain terms. The apple orchard that we stepped into was really a fruitful treat to the eye. I forgot everything as it stole my mind. In Australia one couldbuy a big boxful of very fresh apples just from the tree between 7-10 dollars.
Apple growers’ tale has not been rosy all the time. The climate changes, market behaviour, grave competition from the new competitors from other apple growing countries, dearth of labour, barrenness of the soil due to long term cultivation, diseases and other related problems have at times put them on the lurch. I met a badly affected apple grower in the WINE COUNTRY where apple is grown in abundance. His grievances were vey poignant. Unexpected rain had ruined his apple wealth. He had lost his bread and butter. He showed me a huge heap of rotten apples, a heart rendering scene. He was about to cry. Yet, the apple growing areas in Australia is a treat to the eye because of greenery and the huge fruit processing juice factories scattered in verdant cultivations. The mesmerizing sweetness of the fresh apples would make an everlasting impression in the visitor to an apple orchard, but the sweat of the apple grower is another diatribe to be listened to.
