Huge breakfast art gallery

Mind your step, someone’s spilled breakfast all over Gloucester Road.
No, not a croissant or cereal bar. It’s eggs, and they’re in every form you can imagine them in. Oh, and they’re not real.
If you alighted at or passed the station on your commute this morning, you might’ve noticed the massive new art installation. You can see large fried eggs, cut boiled eggs, and eggs still in their shells splattered all over the 80m platform at the London station.
It is the work of British artist Heather Phillipson who posed against her new work ‘My Name is Lettie Eggyscrub’, which is a part of a major commission for Art on the Underground. The 3D art was commended by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who said the bold work, the biggest public art gallery, was in a bid to support female artists.
Many commuters travelling on the District and Circle line were wowed by the huge installation and posed next to it.
One Tweeted the art, saying: ‘Someone was clearly in a rush to get on that tube at Gloucester Road – spilled breakfast all over the platform.’ TfL also got involved, replying to the tweet saying: ‘You can’t make good art without cracking a few eggs. Have a good day.’
