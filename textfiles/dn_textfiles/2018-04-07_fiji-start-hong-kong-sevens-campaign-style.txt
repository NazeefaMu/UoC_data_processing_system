Fiji start Hong Kong Sevens campaign in style

HONG KONG, China, Friday - Fiji got their campaign for a record fourth straight title at the Hong Kong Sevens underway with a 31-12 victory over Samoa on Friday night.
The win was –- as it always seems to be with the 2016 Rio gold medallists –- built on plenty of dash out wide and lots of strength through the middle of the park.
The Islanders were led by the impressive Amenoni Nasilasila who added two conversions to a second-half try that came via a cross-field dash, bringing the Hong Kong Stadium to its feet. – AFP
