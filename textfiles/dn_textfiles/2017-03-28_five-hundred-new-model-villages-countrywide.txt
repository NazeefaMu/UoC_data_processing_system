Five hundred new model villages countrywide

The Housing and Construction Ministry will build 500 new model villages throughout the country this year, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The minister was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the ‘Ethrajagama’ model village in Hambantota to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s 68th birthday recently.
Minister Premadasa said the village will consist of 68 houses and those will be handed over to 68 homeless families.
He also said that a certain people’s representative had opposed the setting up of the new model village, saying that it would dispose of valuable land in the region which could be put to more profitable use. This person was responsible for the clearing up of 20 acres of valuable forest land by using bulldozers. He would not be allowed to cause such destruction of land anymore, as they would take legal action against his operations.
The minister said, “During the previous regime, Sri Lankan representatives visited the UNHRC in Geneva, fearing its challenges and accusations. But once the Good Governance Government had established good friendship and relations with all countries, Sr Lankan representatives who visited Geneva this time were awarded a red carpet welcome by all nations. The President and Prime Minister were raking vast benefits to the country today by establishing good relations with all nations.”
“Although the previous regime protected our war heroes only by word, the present government has protected them by deed by announcing in no uncertain terms that foreign judges would be unwelcome to sit on any local panel investigating alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka during the war period,” he added.
He said, “The expenditure on the construction of the Hambantota port, airport, and cricket stadium, had far exceeded the real estimates. Question is: Whose pockets were filled with the excess money?”
