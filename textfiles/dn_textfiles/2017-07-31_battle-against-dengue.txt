In the battle against dengue

A nationwide campaign involving tens of thousands of volunteers, students, teachers, parents, health and education ministry officials and security forces personnel was launched last Friday placing the battle against dengue on a war-footing to destroy mosquito breeding grounds in schools.
Education minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam speaking about the campaign said “Protecting our children from the dengue epidemic is a responsibility of all of us. No other government has given such priority to tackle the dengue issue.
“The government has given the highest priority to battling the spread of dengue which has claimed some 290 lives so far this year and infected over 100,000 people, according to official figures,” he said.
The Health Ministry is assisting the unprecedented clean-up campaign in schools and asked principals to coordinate with local health authorities for arranging fumigation and other technical help.
Education Ministry officials said there was no teaching on Friday, but students had turned up in appropriate clothing to join the clean-up effort that was supervised and guided by health authorities.
According to the Health Ministry, there is a significant 20 percent rise in schoolchildren infected by the dengue epidemic.
