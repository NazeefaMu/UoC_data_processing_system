Fair & Lovely MEN / MCA 'B' Division 50-Over League from September 9

As the international cricket season draws to a close this month, it is time to prepare the pitch for MCA ‘B’ Division 50 Over League Tournament for 2018.
Conducted by the Mercantile Cricket Association, the tournament will commence on September 09 at the MCA grounds and continue at eight other selected venues.
Unilever Fair & Lovely MEN is the title sponsor for this tournament and seven teams will bat against their opponents for the Fair & Lovely MEN Challenge Trophy.
“Men in modern era are geared to set new standards on both on field and off the field. On field, they work hard to achieve their goals and do what it takes to get them there. This means they expose themselves more to sun, dust and pollution. Fair & Lovely MEN is a brand which comes in the men’s face care regime to take care of their faces from the aggressors such as sun, dust and pollution. With our affiliation to MCA B division league we would like to help emerging Sri Lankan cricketers to set new standards in the game and play the game to their true potential,” Senior Brand Manager Unilever Face Care – Daminda Perera noted.
The participating teams: John Keells 'B', Powertek Cement, Mobitel 'A', MAS Silueta 'A', Singer Sri Lanka 'A', Commercial Credit 'B' and Unilever Sri Lanka will face one another in 21 matches during the preliminaries from September 9 to October 4. The top four teams on the scoreboard will then qualify to play in the semi-finals which are scheduled to take place on October 8 and 11. The final match will take place on October 14 at the Mercantile Cricket Association grounds.
“The tournament returns after a two year hiatus and will be conducted in two stages – League and Knockout. MCA appointed Match Referees will supervise the 24 matches.
Besides the traditional special awards, Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Man of the Final Match, Man of the Series Unilever has added the ‘Fair & Lovely MEN Man of the Week’ award,” Chairman of the Tournament Committee Sujeewa de Silva commented.
