International French Travel Mart (IFTM) is the largest professional travel fair which was historically held in Deauville, France which was previously called as TOP RESA till it was renamed in 2009 and is held now at Paris Porte De Versailles.
This year the fair will be held from the 25th -28th September 2018 in Porte de Versailles, Paris, France, Pavilion 7.0. Sri Lanka Tourism is expected to attract 30 local travel agents to the fair this year thus by increasing space up to 154 sqm to accommodate them. The Sri Lanka stand will also feature Sri Lankan Air Lines booth and other attractions such as Tea Counter, Selfie Point, Tourism counter and Large LED Screen to project videos and a Sri Lankan dance troupe will do cultural performances at the stall daily.
More than a total number of 32,480 tourism and travel industry professionals attended the latest edition 2017 of IFTM Top Resa which featured offers from 1700 exhibiting brands. This is 5% increase in attendance clearly demonstrates the show’s importance as the industry’s flagship event and barometer.
Sri Lanka’s participation is aimed at creating greater visibility for the destination as well as promoting the country’s gastronomic delights, for which a food counter will be stationed at the stand throughout the fair. A dance troupe will also perform cultural dances at the stall on all days of the fair.
The fair also enables the possibility of increasing the travel agents who promote Sri Lanka in their tour packages and creating a high level of consumer involvement through the proposed consumer promotional activities of the IFTM.
