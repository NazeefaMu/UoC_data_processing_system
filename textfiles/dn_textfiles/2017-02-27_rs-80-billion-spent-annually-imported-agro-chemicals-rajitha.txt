Rs. 80 billion spent annually on imported agro chemicals: Rajitha

Sri Lanka spends Rs. 80 billion annually to import agro chemicals, The country can minimise this by cultivating organic fruits and vegetables and exporting them to Europe, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne added that some political parties brought farmers to the streets demanding artificial agro chemicals, but today farmers do not ask for them.
According to the minister, 5,000 acres are being cultivated now without using poisonous agro chemicals.
The previous Government imported cheap, agro chemicals and distributed them.
It destroyed fertile farming lands. The minister was addressing the gathering after the harvesting ceremony at the Bopitiya village, Yatadolawatta, Kalutara recently.
Now they cultivate organic fruits and vegetables without using poisonous agro chemicals imported from foreign countries. "When the tax on tobacco increased up to 90 percent, the tobacco company said 35,000 farmers will lose their livelihood, but it did not happen," the minister said.
"The WHO informed me that Sri Lanka can join the five countries with the best health services if we continue with the current projects and programmes. The queue for eye surgeries has grown long due to the availability of free eye lenses and this queue will be reduced within the next six months," the minister said.
