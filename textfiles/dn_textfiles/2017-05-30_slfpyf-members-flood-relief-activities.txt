SLFPYF members for flood relief activities

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) members are to be deployed within 24 or 48 hours to support flood disaster relief and recovery activities in the affected areas, SLFPYF Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterdy, MP Bandara said measures have already taken to deploy several teams of SLFPYF members from Batticaloa, Monaragala, Jaffna, Badulla districts for disaster relief and recovery activities in the Matara, Galle and Kalutara Districts.
“Though we cannot cover the whole district, our teams would engage in relief and recovery activities in some selected areas,” he said.
The MP stressed the necessity of paying attention to the possible damages to the environment before starting new development activities. He said short-sighted development plans have resulted in these disasters.
The MP urged the public to make their donations to the SLFP headquarters since they have already taken measures to distribute essential goods for flood affected people under the ‘Methsarana’ programme launched by the SLFPYF.
