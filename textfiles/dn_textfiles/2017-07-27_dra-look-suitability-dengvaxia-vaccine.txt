DRA to look into suitability of Dengvaxia vaccine

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the Drug Regulatory Authority(DRA) to look into the suitability of Dengue Prevention Vaccine call Dengvaxia introduced by France, since it has now accepted by number of countries.
Addressing the media at yesterday’s Cabinet briefing, Co-Cabinet Spokesman, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that the Drug Regulatory Authority has the authority to introduce this vaccine by conducting chemical and clinical analysis. Chemical analysis would be conducted in laboratories and the clinical analysis will be done by a professor.
The Minister said that the introduction of the vaccine is a very slow process and approval will be granted after conducting a series of tests and comparing tests results with the reports of other countries since the professor should be responsible for any complication.
“One year ago, the French Ambassador also discussed about this vaccine with me and then the vaccine was remained at research level in the Philippines with 52 percent success rate,” the Minister added.
He added that the vaccine was also most effective in those who already have baseline immunity due to a previous dengue infection. It is more effective for those who had dengue previously. But, the vaccine has been approved in over 10 Countries and even Singapore had accepted it two weeks ago.
