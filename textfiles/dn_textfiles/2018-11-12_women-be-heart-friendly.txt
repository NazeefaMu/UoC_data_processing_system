Women, be heart-friendly!

Unhealthy lifestyles increase the risk of a heart attack for women more than they do for men, researchers have warned.
For decades doctors and patients alike have considered heart disease as a problem that mainly affects middle-aged overweight men.
But while men remain more likely than women to suffer an attack, the incidence of heart attacks among women is on the rise.
A study by experts at Oxford University suggests women who have unhealthy lifestyles increase their risk more than men with the same habits.
Data from of 470,000 British people revealed women with high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes - both of which are linked to obesity, drinking and diet - see their heart attack risk rise more than men with the same conditions.
Women with type 2 diabetes, for example, are 96 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than women without. For men the risk rises 33 per cent.
For women with stage two hypertension - the medical term for severe high blood pressure - heart attack risk rises 152 per cent, compared to 71 per cent for men.
And women who smoke are 246 per cent more likely to have a heart attack, compared to 123 per cent for men.
The scientists, writing in the British Medical Journal, said that despite the increased risks, women receive worse care.
‘Women should, at least, receive the same access to guideline-based treatments for diabetes and hypertension, and to resources to help lose weight and stop smoking as do men,’ they wrote.
In the UK, women with diabetes are 15 per cent less likely than men with diabetes to receive all recommended care processes, and may be less likely to achieve target values when treated for cardiovascular risk factors.
Experts are also increasingly concerned that women do not take heart attacks among women are missed, with females in Britain 50 per cent more likely than men to have a heart attack initially misdiagnosed.
Some 69,000 women have a heart attack in Britain each year - nearly 20,000 more than are diagnosed with breast cancer. Yet women themselves view heart issues as a typically ‘male disease’, scientists think - so when they start noticing symptoms they often do not seek help.
Some 119,000 men have a heart attack annually, but women are also more likely to die as a result of the attack.
Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Regardless of your sex, risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes increase the risk of a heart attack.
‘These findings should not distract from a concerted effort to better detect and manage risk factors that can be changed.
‘It’s absolutely vital that everyone has equal access to the best advice and treatment regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status.
‘This is an important reminder that heart disease does not discriminate, so we must shift perceptions that it only affects men.’ -Daily Mail
