Komuthi Engineering continues CSR initiatives

Komuthi Engineering Services, which was established in 1991, provided stationery, lama saries and dresses to over 2,000 children and 65 teachers who attended an event organized by Sri Sugunutissa  Ayupala  Dhamma School Kataragama. The event was sponsored by Komuthi Engineering for over ten years and was conducted by Venerable Kapugama Saranatissa Thera.
Komuthi Engineering started off as a family business amongst three brothers, and hopes to continue this CSR program for a further period.
 Nimal C. Korale who joined the company as a high school graduate progressed to own one third share ownership and after gaining experience and built a good working relationship with the employees and elevated him as a Director and went onto acquire the company in 2014.
Under his guidance Komuthi Engineering became a major force in the field of construction and later became one of the first in the construction industry to obtain ISO 9001: 2008. Komuthi was also one of the few organizations that attained an ICTAD (Institute of Construction Training and Development) Grade C-1 in 2011.
 Komuthi realizes its obligation to its society and believes that social responsibilities (CSR) must not be ignored or dismissed by enterprises that aim to move forward in business.
As a result their main Corporate Social Responsibility Project was focused on the Southern part of the island, especially from the Kataragama area.
