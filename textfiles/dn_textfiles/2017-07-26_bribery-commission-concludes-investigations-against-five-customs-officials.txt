Bribery Commission concludes investigations against five Customs officials

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption yesterday informed Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara that it has concluded investigations against five Customs officials in connection with the largest ever recorded bribe nabbed by the Bribery Commission officials in 2015.
Customs Superintendent Sudeera Jinadasa, Deputy Customs Superintendent Jagath Gunatilleke and Assistant Customs Superintendent Upali Perera, Wimalasiri and Upali Wickremasinghe are currently out on bail.
The suspects had allegedly involved in soliciting a bribe of Rs.125 million to release a consignment of spare parts worth Rs.1,500 million, imported to be used by the SLTB, by evading duty.
