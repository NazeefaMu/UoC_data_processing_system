The lure of Treasure

Treasure. Are there any men (and women) who fail to be enticed by this very word ? People have paid dearly, sometimes with their own life, to get their hands on treasure. Yes, treasure can consume your life before you ever touch the mother lode. This week we focus on treasure.
Not surprisingly, treasure has been luring film makers since the 1920s. The quest for treasure us an ideal avenue for the film maker to show the extremelengthto which usually good people will go to acquire sudden wealth. This week, I have selected two films, one from the USA and the other from Sri Lanka, directed by two world famous directors, to show the filmmakers’ obsession with treasure.
The first one is the superb The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (John Huston, USA, 1948) and the other is, of course, the timeless Nidhanaya (Lester James Piries, Sri Lanka, 1972/73), which essentially means The Treasure. These are compulsory viewing for film buffs. Physical disc or online streaming (whatever floats your boat), grab a chair and watch these two masterpieces. Note that Nidhanaya was digitally restored recently, but we do not whether a consumer copy of that print exists. With Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Foundation (WCF) being involved in the restoration, we can hope that Nidhanaya will be released on blu-ray by WCF via The Criterion Collection, which has already released two WCF collections.

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
After the credits, a close-up of a lottery list shows the winning numbers drawn in the Mexican National Lottery, dated February 14, 1925. The camera pulls back to the hands of a man holding a lottery ticket and comparing his number with the posted winners. The scraggly-looking, unkempt, dirty, unshaven scrounger [later identified as Fred C. Dobbs "Dobbsie" (Humphrey Bogart)] who is betting on a fortune, tears his losing ticket to pieces and throws it away in disgust. That is how the quest for treasure begins.
In this classic adventure film, two rough-and-tumble wanderers, Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Curtin (Tim Holt), meet up with a veteran prospector, Howard (Walter Huston), in Mexico and head into the Sierra Madre mountains to find gold. Although they do discover treasure, they also find plenty of trouble, not only from ruthless bandits lurking in the dangerous Mexican wilderness but from their own insecurities and greed, which threaten to bring precipitate conflict at any moment.One of the film's posters clarified the theme: "The Nearer They Get to Their Treasure, the Farther They Get From the Law!."
To this day, this movie is known for its definitive portrayal of greed on screen. This movie is known for its exquisite cinematography by Ted McCord. Shot mostly on location in Mexico when location shooting was still a novelty, the movie has spectacular landscape shots.
If you have the old special edition two-disc DVD, keep it. If you are new to the film, Blu Ray is the way to go. Warner has done a very good job in restoring this black and white treasure (!) but you will be even more interested in the almost six hours of extras, headlined by the excellent Eric Lax (biographer of Humphrey Bogart) commentary. This is one of the best movie commentaries you are ever going to hear – every sentence, very word has a purpose here.
The other extras includeJohn Huston: The Man, The Movies, The Maverick, a two hour look at the man and the legend, hosted by none other than Robert Mitchum, and featuring interviews with a glut of people who worked with him; Discovering Treasure: The Story of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, another really interesting 50 minute feature on the background of the film, including the mysterious author of the original novel, B. Traven; Warner Night at the Movies, the recreation of what going to a theater in 1948 to see Sierra Madre might have been like. Here you get (after an optional Leonard Maltin introduction) a trailer for Key Largo, a Newsreel, a cartoon (Hot Cross Bunny, and a short entitled So You Want to Be a Detective.

Nidhanaya (Treasure)
In this groundbreaking movie, Willy Abeynayake (Gamini Fonseka) finds an oldmanuscript which states the location of an ancient treasure hidden by a king in a rock cave. According to the manuscript, he has to sacrifice a virgin woman who has four black birth marks in her neck to get the treasure.
One day he accidentally comes across a young woman (Malini Fonseka), who has four black birth marks in her neck. He gets to know her, spends time with her and finally decides to marry her. She notices that her husband always spends time thinking. One day she asks him about it andhe replies that he has to do a religious custom to appease a deity in a rock. His wife agrees with him and helps him with all the arrangements, not knowing what could be in store for her.
After going to the rock, the man starts to fulfill the custom and finally he kills his wife as a sacrifice. But, nothing happens and he could not access the treasure. He comes home and writes the complete story in his diary. He realises that he cannot go on any longer after what he did to his loving wife.
Nidhanaya (1972) is one of the best films made in Asia. Nidhanaya was also included in the global list of 100 best films to be ever made that was compiled by the Cinematheque Institute of France to mark the World Film Centenary. Nidhanaya was entered for the 1972 Venice International Film Festival where the film won the Silver Lion of St. Mark award. It also received a certificate as one of the outstanding films of the year at the London Film Festival.
Nidhanaya was based on a short story by G.B. Senanayake whose film rights Piries’ bought beforeitcould be snapped up by others. Music was by Premasiri Khemadasa while the screenplay was by Tissa Abeysekara.
Nidhanaya deserves to be seen by the younger generations and also preserved for posterity.
