India Women go one-up with facile win

India made short work of Sri Lanka in the first Women’s ODI played at the Galle International Stadium yesterday breezing to a comfortable nine-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
Choosing to bat first Sri Lanka Women were dismissed for a disappointing 98 in 35.1 overs falling to the pace of Jhulan Goswami and Mansi Joshi who between them took five wickets.
Skipper Chamari Atapattu stuck it out for 93 balls to make a top score of 33. Apart from her only Sripali Weerakkody made any worthwhile contribution with 26.
India Women buoyed by an opening stand of 96 by Punam Raut and Smriti Mandhana coasted home in the 20th over. Raut made 24 before falling to Inoka Ranaweera but Mandhana went onto remain 73 not out scored off 76 balls with the help of 11 fours and two sixes.
The second ODI will be played at the same venue on Thursday.

Sri Lanka Women 98 in 35.1 overs (Chamari Atapattu 33, Sripali Weerakkody 26, J Goswami 2/13, M Joshi 3/16, P Yadav 2/13)
