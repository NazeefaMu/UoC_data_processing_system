BIA strike called off after talks with authorities

 
The strike launched by Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) employees was called off temporarily after holding talks with airport authorities, a short while ago.
The airport employees launched the strike this morning demanding for a salary increase of Rs.10, 000.
However security surveillance was tightened at the BIA due to the tense situation created.
All functions of the airport were also reportedly hampered today.
