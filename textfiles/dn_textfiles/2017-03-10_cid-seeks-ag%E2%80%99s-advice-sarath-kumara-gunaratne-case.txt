CID seeks AG’s advice on Sarath Kumara Gunaratne case

 
The CID conducting investigations against former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project informed Court today that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against the suspects.
Six suspects including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) were arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to CFHC during the last Presidential election.
They are currently out on bail. In this case, the CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of Attorney General.
The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.
