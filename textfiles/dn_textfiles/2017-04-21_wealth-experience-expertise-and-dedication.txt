A wealth of experience, expertise and dedication

UNDP Executive Board welcomes appointment of Achim Steiner as new Administrator:
The President of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) yesterday welcomed the appointment of Achim Steiner as the Organisation’s new Administrator.
Steiner’s nomination for UNDP Administrator was forwarded by Secretary-General António Guterres to the General Assembly, which yesterday confirmed him as the Administrator of UNDP for a term of four years. UNDP supports countries around the world to eradicate extreme poverty, strengthen good governance and prevent and respond to crises.
President of the UNDP Executive Board, Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark to the UN, said: “I know that I am speaking on behalf of all members of the Executive Board and all UNDP staff in warmly welcoming Achim Steiner as UNDP’s new Administrator.
“Achim Steiner brings a wealth of experience, expertise and dedication to this hugely important role. I am certain he will make an enduring and positive impact on UNDP’s development work around the world,” he added.
Steiner said: “I am honoured by the Secretary-General’s decision to appoint me as the next Administrator of UNDP and grateful for the trust and confidence Member States have expressed in the General Assembly today. I am very much looking forward to working with all UNDP staff and Member States to continue the fight to end poverty, protect the planet and promote peace and justice around the world.”
Steiner has been a respected global leader on sustainable development, international cooperation and global diplomacy for nearly three decades. He is a vocal advocate for the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for unprecedented global cooperation to deliver on this ambitious agenda.
Prior to joining UNDP, Steiner served in roles across the UN, non-government organisations and high-level advisory bodies shaping public policy.
This included tenures as United Nations Under-Secretary General and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme; as Director-General of the UN Office at Nairobi and as Director General of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Mr Steiner is currently the Director of the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford and Professorial Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.
