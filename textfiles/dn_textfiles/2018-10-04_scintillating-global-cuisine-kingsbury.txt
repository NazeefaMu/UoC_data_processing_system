Scintillating Global  Cuisine at the Kingsbury

The Kingsbury Hotel, known for some of the best drinking and dining experiences in Colombo, celebrated Mexican National Day last week by hosting the “Viva Mexico” Mexican food festival at its restaurant the Grill. From September 21st through the 27th, the Grill served a special a la carte menu, curated by celebrity Chef Alondra Maldonado Rodriguera and Chef Marco Valdivia.
Chef Alondra is a Gourmand Award Winner in 2014, and a delegate of the Nayarit Gastronomy by the Conservatory of Mexican Gastronomic Culture. She said she was excited to cater to Sri Lankan palates, because, “I’ve come to realise that in this part of the world, the spice is really in the food, and you can feel the cumin, and you can feel the cardamom.”

Chef Marco, her collaborator, is the Executive Director of the restaurant Tepic, which is on the list of the top 120 restaurants in Mexico, endorsed by San Pelegrino and Culinaria Mexicana.
Together, they created a scintillating menu that felt both gourmet and comforting: “We thought about what you eat at a house, not what you eat at a restaurant,” explained Alondra. “My thing, she continued, “is to bring homemade food to restaurants.” The Daily News got a preview of their culinary expertise at a food tasting last week.
For starters, Alondra served up Scallop Aguachile, a piquant chilled soup with raw scallops, onions, cilantro, and lime base marinate. The soup was the perfect palate teaser to wet an appetite for Mexican food.
It was followed by Shrimp Empanadas: corn dough stuffed, folded and fried. Unfortunately, after the soup, the empanadas tasted a little bit bland, not quite spicy enough, but extremely well cooked.The empanada had pleasing garlic flavours, and a wonderful crunchy but soft texture.
The comfort food continued with a Bean Tarasca Soup: a comforting combination of kidney beans and chili peppers that sent warmth throughout the body. It was a perfect rainy-weather dish during monsoon season. Alondra’s next choice was a Chicken in Almond sauce. The chicken, combined with almonds, tomatoes, onions and peppers, was delicious bathed in a sauce that had a tantalising touch of cinnamon.

Hands down, the best savoury dish was the Pork Belly in Mustard sauce, a traditional preparation from the town Acaponeta, which Chef Marco had prepared. The sauce was creamy and pleasantly smokey, with tender pork on one side, and a cheese stuffed chili on the other. Even though stomachs were filling up fast, every plate of this dish was licked clean.
The gourmands wrapped up the food tasting with a very traditional choice for dessert: capirotada. Capirotada is served during the holy week season in Mexico. This gourmet version was a bread pudding hybrid, with walnuts, raisins, and prune pieces, that came with pumpkin and cream cheese ganache sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. The dessert was served with flare, decorated with traditional paper flags, which brought the meal full circle to true a celebration of Mexican National Day.
Along with the meal, the Grill lived up to Kingsbury’s reputation for fabulous drinks, with a smattering of tequila-based accompaniments, including Tequila Sunset, with Sauza Silver Tequila, pink grapefruit syrup, orange juice and grenadine syrup, and Mexican Elderflower Crush, with Sauza Silver Tequila, Cointreau, fresh lime juice, elderflower syrup and ginger ale.
With its “Viva Mexico” Mexican food festival, the Kingsbury’s Grill proved itself to be a new hot spot for scintillating global cuisine.
