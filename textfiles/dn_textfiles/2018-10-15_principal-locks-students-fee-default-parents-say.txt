Principal locks up students for fee default, parents say

A principal of an international school in Nugegoda had allegedly locked up nearly 60 students in a room in the school, due to non-payment of term fees, last Friday.
According to the police, the parents of the students had made a complaint regarding the incident to the Mirihana Police and the Police emergency number 119 and also to the Child Protection Bureau. The parents say they had agreed to bear the additional cost of 12.5 percent of the total term fees which arises every two years.
But the school’s management had decided to arbitrarily and unfairly increase the term fees. Also, the increased term fees differed from other schools within this group of schools.
According to the complaint made by the parents to the Mirihana Police, the school’s management had also hired a private security firm to harass and threaten the students who were unable to pay the increased amount of the term fee on time.
According to the parents, the school’s management had charged an excessive amount of money during the last four to five years, while violating the terms of the agreement between the school and the parents.
The parents had complained to the school’s management that they were not in a position to pay the arbitrarily increased fees. They had asked the management to give them a written explanation as to why they were charging the increased fees.
The school’s management is continuously threatening the students with the help the private security firm, the parents say. Police investigations into the incident are been conducted under the supervision of the officer in charge of Mirihana Police.
