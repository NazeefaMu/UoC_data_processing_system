Havelock Sports Club registered a hard fought win against the fighting new look Army SC outfit by 29 points (5 tries, 2 conversions) to 17 (3 tries, 1 conversion) victory in their second round Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby match played at Air Force grounds, Ratmalana yesterday. The winners led 17-7 at half time.
Havies found their act together and momentum midway into the first half and scored a total of five tries to which the Army had no answers.
Comparatively to their last outing, they could not make any headway in this game as they really looked like a different bunch of players who played in patches throughout the entire game. Army managed to score only three tries. For the Havelocks centre Nishone Perera and winger Chamara Dabare scored two tries each and co-winger Kevin Dixon one.
Full back Dulaj Perera who had an off day with the boot only converted two tries.
Hooker Asoka Jayalal (one), centre Dinushan Ariyapala (one) and flanker Chameera Silva (one) scored the tries for Army. Full back Gayan Salinda put over the solitary conversion. Referee: Rogan Fernando.
