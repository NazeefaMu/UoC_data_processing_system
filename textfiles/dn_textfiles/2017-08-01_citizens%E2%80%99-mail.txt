Citizens’ Mail

A signal to a derailed train to apply brake
STILL WANTED: PRAGMATIC LEADERS
Fr Augustine Fernando deserves the encomium of all the truth loving, rational minded, right thinking people and the intelligentsia for writing a timely article to Daily News which has been at the forefront in safeguarding the country as a watchdog of the nation since its inception.
In this thought-provoking and informative article, the writer has adroitly juxtaposed the nudity of the modern fraudulent generation of politicians and the genuine politicians who did not have a single cent in general parlance in their bank accounts at their demise. In addition to that they didn’t depend on people’s money to run their vehicles. They worked from their homes without getting any residence allowance. Therefore they didn’t want to waste their time at police stations or at this junction and at that junction to fast unto death munching lemon puff.
Fr Augustine has traced the history of other countries in the region who gained Independence with us and how they have surpassed us in economic development. Where have the advisers gone? Not only the past regime but also the present one is said to have an array of veteran advisers to preach the rulers on how to take decisions. Yet the country seems rudderless.
I think a Simple Simon at the village tea-kiosk could give some good advice to the government on these matters that the rulers go wrong. The general public have to pay them for the ill advice they give. The government is accountable to the voter. So, the government is duty-bound to publish the names of these advisers to the public. According to the writer the Dharmadweepa is getting politically, socially and culturally demoralized.
The oratory skills of the uneducated thuggish politicians have ruined the country. Religious harmony of the country is badly eroded by them. All the efforts of burning the racial flame is for mere political power. Unimaginable privileges and perks doled out to them have made them greedier for power. Avarice for money is their ruin. Swindling public property is the name of the game. Politicians have lackluster characters.
Their image before the public is grim. The writer cites the whole system as rotten. It is correct to the last syllable. The uncertain future on the horizon develops an apprehensive mood among the general public. The million dollar question is that why the government does not seem to seek advice from the veteran writers whose thinking is pragmatic.
I duly endorse the writer’s voice to reject vagabond capitalism, derelict totalitarian ideological regimentation and the crooked socialism of the old red brigade. Voice for freedom ought to be upheld at any cost.
