Citizens' Mail

Give back their land, not electric fences
So much has been written and so much is written today in a quest for a permanent solution to the burning issue of human/elephant conflict which started a little over ten years ago. One by one the encroachers started settling down until it blew out of proportion. I was also in the fray of writing on behalf of the confused elephant who suddenly found himself surrounded by encroachers. The then government should have seen the outcome of this and nipped it in the bud by stopping the inflow. There are thousands of families who have taken over elephant paths. It is a gigantic operation to evacuate each and every family and the longer the wait, more difficult the operation.
There is so much of untapped land that can come under small-time cultivation and if these encroachers are settled on small blocks, the elephants will have their land back and a new lease of environment will find its way.
Train accidents need to be addressed more seriously without holding post-mortems. Building bridges over strategic points where the elephants pass in one effective way and still better is the construction of a fly-over though it is a colossal project. The cost of which can be funded by a country like India with Meneka Gandhi negotiating who will do it gladly because of her involvement in this area. It is a matter of the President taking the initiative to do so. Deaths of elephants by train constitute five per cent which is alarming and deplorable. Most of the solutions evolved so far have been failures. How long are we going to watch this drama? Think over Wildlife Minister, you have to decide.
I know for a fact bridges as well as fly-overs are built in many countries especially in Africa to intercept the dwindling elephant population. Funds to do so will not be a problem for Wildlife Minister nor the authorities as they collect a colossal amount of income. The Minister only needs the will to do so. The exercise is available in our country, so is the workforce. Don’t we already have bridges over rivers in our country?
Alternately, a highway spanning these elephant passages is another option.
Give back their land: not electric fences.
That belonged to them not so long ago and take a cue from our neighbour, India and the rest of the world without responding to political and social pressure which is the bane of the issue. If the DWC stand up to them and do what is right by elephants and be firm in their administration like elsewhere in the world with pressure, they will buckle down on the face of the failure of construction of electric fences along with the administrative boundaries that never yielded the expected results. The battle goes on with elephants pushed back in their habitats and illegal encroachers increasing with political backing. These politicians never realize the colossal harm created around forest reserves, some of which are the better habitats of elephants that resort to breaking of fences who meet with death. The irony of this is that sympathy is not with the innocent animal but with the outrageous culprits who is the encroacher. If encroachers who claim to be farmers meet with such deaths, they deserve it with no reservation.
While our elephant habitats are declining fast and furiously, elsewhere in the world, national parks and natural habitats are racing beyond tremendous capacity making way beyond the required to contain any number of their precious jumbos and in the meantime our elephants die at the hands of irreverent and irresponsible politicians who ‘tie’ the hands of DWC officers.
Why is it that two thirds of elephants in our land who have home ranges go beyond areas controlled by the Department of Wildlife Conservation? Is it because of what is taking place in the Sinharaja forest is also happening over here?
What a sad state of affairs and the poor elephant is driven from pillar to post though born free.
