Muslims Council demands halt to vigilante action against Muslims

In a letter to Prime Minister:
The Muslims Council of Sri Lanka yesterday said that vigilante action against the Muslim community by extremist groups continues with impunity.
The Council in a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the mob attack and violence on September 26 against the 32 Rohingya refugees who are under the care of UNHRC housed in Ratmalana is evidence of impunity that is being offered to the racists.
The Council in a letter issued under the hands of its President N.M. Ameen called up the Prime Minister to immediately intervene and ensure that this type of vigilante action by extremists is censured and the perpetrators brought to Justice.
The letter: “Vigilante action against the Muslim community by Buddhist extremists continues with impunity with the tacit support of the Police and the Government. The absolute majority of Muslims in this country voted for a change in government in 2015 because of the impunity afforded to extremist Buddhist groups by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa administration. Yet, incitement and hate carried out against our community by the Bodu Bala Sena, Sinhala Ravaya and the Ravana Balakaya continue in the presence of senior police officials and calls for establishing the rule of law go unheeded by your Government.
“Complaints to the IGP, Minister Sagala Ratnayake, the President and yourself have been ignored. The racist organisations have been joined by a new set of mercenaries under the Sinhala National Front banner. Most of them are violating ball conditions set by various courts of law on charges of inciting hate and violence. None of them have been charged under ICCRP, while a 19-year-old Muslim boy from Danture, Kandy, was remanded for over three months for posting a picture against Buddhism on his instagram page.
“The mob attack and violence against the 32 Rohingya refugees who are under the care of UNHCR housed in Ratmalana is evidence of the impunity that is being offered to these racists who forced the Police to arrest these refugees. These refugees include 17 children and seven females and seven males. Most of these children are below the age of 5.
“In this attack led by Akmeemana Dayarathana Thera under the banner of the Sinhala National Front, they surrounded and held hostage the Rohingya Muslims who were under the protection UNHCR. They were demanding the immediate deportation of them back to Myanmar. The Police arrested the refugees claiming ignorance of their right to stay and were brought to the Mt. Lavinia Police Station for detention. They were subsequently released when it was proved that they were legitimate refugees under the care of UNHCR. Later in the afternoon, the extremists have once again surrounded and caused damages to their residence, forcing them to be evacuated once again. The police have moved them to the Boosa camp.
The mob threatened to kill all of them and also start a riot against the Muslims. This threat was made in the presence of senior police personnel and media. The videos of these threats are available on social media too. The police failed to take action against this hate crime by a violent mob. No Buddhist monk or civilian has been arrested for threatening the peace of people who are under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
This is an issue that needs to be settled between the Government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The Muslims have been targeted unnecessarily.
We call upon you, Honourable Sir, to immediately intervene and ensure that this type of vigilante action by Buddhist monks or extremists is censured and the perpetrators brought to justice immediately.
