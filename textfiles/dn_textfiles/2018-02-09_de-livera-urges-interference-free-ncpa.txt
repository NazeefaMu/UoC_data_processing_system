De Livera urges for interference-free NCPA

The National Child Protection Authority should be an independent body free of political interference, NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera said in a statement on Thursday.
“But at present, it has become evident that the NCPA’s independence is being challenged by certain parties,” she said.
NCPA sources told the Daily News that the Secretary of the Child Development and Women`s Affairs Ministry had allegedly called a board meeting without the Chairperson’s knowledge.
They said only the Chairperson has the power to call for a board meeting.
“When the National Child Protection Authority Act (of 1988) which established the NCPA was presented in Parliament, it was noted that it should function as an independent government body,” Chairperson de Livera said in her statement.
“Thus, I would like to state that I will not be participating in any illegal meeting held on the NCPA, and will undertake all activities in accordance with the law,” she said.
“I too commend highly President Maithripala Sirisena’s campaign against corruption and as the Chairman of the NCPA, I have instituted the same programme under my purview,” she added.
