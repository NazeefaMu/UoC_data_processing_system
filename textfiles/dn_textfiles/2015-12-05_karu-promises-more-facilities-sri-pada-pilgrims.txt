Karu promises more facilities for Sri Pada pilgrims

 
With the annual Sri Pada pilgrimage season starting from Unduwap Pura Pasalosvaka Poya Day this month, Provincial Councils, Local Government, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana visited the area surrounding the Sri Pada Sacred area recently on an inspection tour to ensure enhanced facilities to Sri Pada pilgrims visiting the sacred peak.
During the tour undertaken in association with Ratnapura district parliamentarian A.A.Wijetunga, Deputy Minister Paranavithana launched a project to renovate the Ratnapura Palebedda Rajamawatha and the Kuruwita Eratne access roads to Sri Pada to ensure better facilities to pilgrims. The deputy minister who saw the pilgrims rest, bus stand and other facilities in a dilapidated and neglected state, directed officials of the Ratnapaura Pradeshiya Sabha, Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabha and other state officials to renovate and spruce up the facilities in time to cater to the pilgrims visiting Sri Pada with funding provided by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Paranavithana said Sri Pada was a sacred place for Buddhists throughout the world.
He also said Palabedda would be developed as a scared city next year.
