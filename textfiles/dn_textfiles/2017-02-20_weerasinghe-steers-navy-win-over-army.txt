Weerasinghe steers Navy to win over Army

Navy SC full back Thilina Weerasinghe played a spectacular game scoring 20 points single-handedly with two tries and five conversions to take his team to the semi-finals of the Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club Clifford Cup knockout rugby tournament with a 35 points (5 tries, 5 conversions) to 25 (4 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) win over Army SC in the quarterfinal played at Race Course grounds, Reid Avenue yesterday, The winners led 28-3 at the breather.
Navy SC will meet Havelocks SC in the semi-final.
Red hot rugby was dished out by both teams and It was an awesome performance carried out by Navy and Army with a fabulous display of fast open rugby throughout the entire game where they totally dominated the set pieces through their heavy forwards who combined effectively with their entire three quarter line where Navy came out on top to emerge worthy winners.
For Navy the tries were scored by Thilina Weerasinghe (two), hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe (one), scrum half Richie Dharmapala (one) and winger Supun Dilshan (one). The five conversions were fired across by Weerasinghe.
Full back Gayan Salinda (one), fly half Ashan Bandara (one), penalty try (one) and winger Manoj Bandara (one) scored the tries for the losing Army. Full back Gayan Salinda put over one conversion and the solitary penalty.
