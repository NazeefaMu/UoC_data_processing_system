MAGIC ON STRINGS

The violin symbolizes Ananda Dabere, our own home-grown wizard on strings who has reached the dizzy heights over the last years. Directing The KRASHNA Chamber Ensemble, he was joined by Jude Pieris, a renowned classical guitarist as the soloist
Mozart’s works are identified by their K or KV number. He wrote enormous number of scores so difficult for one to keep track that made conductors a huge question to make a choice for a performance. The unlimited variety for the instrument and voice spin the head. Most sonatas, symphonies, and chamber music were written in accordance with basic structure of four movements; ie; fast, short and light. Without doubt the advancement of the sonatas and symphonic forms were at their best. It was Mozart who raised opera to new heights.
Therefore, we must understand that conductors like Ananda Dabere have to reach out within the format of such establishment. They must pick the best for orchestration.
Ananda Dabere did gloriously right in the contemporary space of the Lionel Wendt theatre though not the perfect venue for stretching out, for this 40+ the ensemble, rose shattering the silence.
What sets him apart from the rest of the violinists is the art of his handling melodies laden with emotion and the aspects such as counterpoints and orchestration without effort.
Electing to play symphony No. 40 in G Minor (K550), he exploited all the potential for strings that Mozart originally scored for the piano. With its wonderful elegiac fragility of tone, there were gasps of rapture, applauded with delight.
JOAQUIN RODRIGO - Spain has never been more famous in traditional romantism in the last century than when her talented son’s classic, CONCIERTO DE ARANJUEZ, 1939. He and his Turkish pianist wife, Victoria Kamhi moved from Paris to the little town of Aranjuez outside Madrid in 1939 after spending decades in Paris. The guitar concerto he named after this town become the favourite of the Spansih. It made him more that a great composer but a hero when they realised that Rodrigo was blind from the age of three but so in love with his country. All his works were notated and played through by his wife whose patience was his motivation and determination to get him where he is. Sangria was there and also the nostalgia and beautiful ADAGIO.
It is of great surprise that Rodrigo was not a guitarist though he composed one of the greatest scores for the guitar. He was a student of Paul Dukas known for his compositions on the French Horn and Piano and scored the famous THE SCORERER’S APPRENTICE that may have influenced Rodrigo,
In the vicinity of all these. Dabere opted to present Rodrigo to the Lankan audience who have never heard him on this soil.
It was homage to this classical guitarit from our virtuose conductor, Ananda Dabere
The evening programme had Jaaquin Rodrigo’s SE ARANJUEZ.

JUDE PEIRIS - Soloist - I was seeing and listening to him at the guitar for the first time and realized that guitar solo can stand up to any other instrument or even to a Symphony Orchestra. Such was his brilliance, this lecturer from the University of Performing Arts, Colombo. Caressing those strong strings gently and softly when it mattered, he rose to heights on a single guitar that is a weak-toned instrument as against an orchestra but marvelously strumming a score that was initially for four guitars. He was ably suppored by the Krashna Chamber Ensemble.
WOLGANG AMADEUS MOZART - Daughter, Parveen who sat next to me said she was sick of listening to Mazart at every orchestration and came only to listen to classical guitarist, Jude Pieris play Joaquin Rodrigo. I was in no mood to argue with her and let her through rest at that.
Tonight’s programme had Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 in G minor (k. 550) in four movements. All apart from ANDANTE, were noisome and boisterous without as much as a sigh in between while the gentle Ananande Dabere conducted with vigor.
Arguably the most gifted composer in history. He is played often, every where, every time and all the time but with such accepted eagerness that there is no classical music spirit like his. There was never a child prodigy in music history to rival Mozart when at four years of age, he was playing Bethoven’s violin Sonata. Wrote the first symphony when he was eight. That was a miracle his father could not comprehend. He wrote his last symphony when he was thirty two.
Among his essential works,he composed :27 piano concertos4 Horn concertos2concretos for bassoon2concretos for clarinet and orchestra200 plus among chamber works for strings16 plus settings of the mass41 SymphoniesRELIGIOUS :- MusicAve verum corpus K 616Exsultate, jubiate, K165Laudate dominum (a setting for Psalm 116)Mass No. 18 in C minor ‘great’ K 427Mass No 19 in D minor ‘Requiem’ K 626and unlimited Opera.
BEDRICH SMETANA - Mein vaterland No. 2 Moldau the composition played tonight is better known VATAVA his celebrated works in dedication to his homeland especially the bustling Moldau river that flows through Prague. It is the second of six tone-poems that are symphonic.
Played by a pair of swirling flutes the work is all about its sources, Springs of the Moldau, joined by energetic clarinets and played on strings in swirling harmonies, a faourite among tonights audiences,. Clearlya wonderful score.
