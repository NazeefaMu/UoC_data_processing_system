Dhawan hits 92 as India sweep T20 series

Chennai, Sunday: Opener Shikhar Dhawan smashed 92 as India completed a six-wicket Twenty20 international win on the last ball against West Indies on Sunday to sweep the three-match series.
Dhawan put on a crucial 130-run third wicket stand with Rishabh Pant, who hit 58, to bring India close to their target of 182 before West Indies hit back in Chennai.
Pant was out in the 19th over and Dhawan lost his wicket on the penultimate ball of the match, but Manish Pandey hit the winning run to deny West Indies any chance of a consolation victory. A tie would have taken the match into a super over.
The result caps off a complete domination by India, who had won the Tests 2-0 and then the one-day international series 3-1 against the visiting West Indians.
Paceman Keemo Paul took two wickets including the dangerous Pant in a penultimate over that yielded just three runs, leaving India needing five from the final six balls.
Nicholas Pooran stood out with the bat for West Indies in the final game of a tough tour, with a 25-ball 53 that guided the visitors to 181-3 after electing to bat first. But the left-handed pair of Dhawan and Pant put the hosts’ chase on track after they had lost two early wickets including their in-form skipper Rohit Sharma for four.
“We wanted to be ruthless and not take a backseat. This kind of performance gives a lot of confidence. We didn’t want to be complacent and wanted to come out and win,” said Sharma.
“As a team there is always scope for improvement.”
Dhawan registered his first fifty of the series across formats as he batted with assurance, hitting 10 fours and two sixes during his 62-ball knock.
Pant, 21, complimented his senior partner with some lusty hitting in his 38-ball stay at the crease.
Earlier Pooran put on a key 87-run unbeaten stand with Darren Bravo, who made 43, to give the tourists a competitive total. AFP
