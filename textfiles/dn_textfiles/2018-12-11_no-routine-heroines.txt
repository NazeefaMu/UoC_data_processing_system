No routine heroines

Vikram Prabhu’s new movie ‘Thuppaki Munai’ will release on December 14. Kalaipuli S Thanu, the producer of the movie under the banner of V Creations, took to Twitter today to announce the release date.
Dinesh Selvaraj, a former assistant of Mani Ratnam, is the director of the film. The trailer for Thuppaki Munai was released in September by director Gautham Menon. Velu Ramamoorthy and MS Bhaskar also featured in the trailer, which was dominated by high-speed car chases and action sequences.
Hansika Motwani plays the female lead in the movie. Before beginning shoot for the film, she reportedly told DC that her role was a different one. “I am doing a character which I have not tried so far.
It’s not the routine heroine that you see in every commercial film. It is something quirky and interesting,” she said.
According to a press release, Vikram Prabhu plays an encounter specialist in the movie. Thuppaki Munai’s tagline reads – ‘Each bullet has a story’, and producer Thanu had said that this best described the film. “The bullets that are fired from Vikram Prabhu’s gun have a purpose. Thuppakki Munai delves into this purpose and shows us why Vikram Prabhu has gotten himself into this situation. The screenplay is racy and will engage the audience,” he said.
