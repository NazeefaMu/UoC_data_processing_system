John says his aim is to provide land for landless

Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga who assumed duties at his additional Lands Ministry yesterday, said his first duty as Lands Minister is to provide land to the landless and offer legal title to people who lived on lands without clear titles. He said he would fulfill the requests of landless people as soon as the title of ownership draft bill was approved by Parliament. Earlier, the minister assumed duties after participating in religious ceremonies.
