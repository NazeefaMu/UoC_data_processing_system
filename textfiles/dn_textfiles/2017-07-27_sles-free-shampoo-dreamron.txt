SLES-free shampoo from Dreamron

Dreamron has recently come up with a health-friendly solution, SLES-free shampoo for healthy and beautiful hair.
Dreamron, a company which has been in the forefront when it comes to providing quality products which are tailor-made for Sri Lankan conditions, introduced the SLES-free shampoo that ensures perfect health of hair, stamping the trust that millions of users have vested on them during their 18-year-long journey.
SLES is a known skin irritant which causes dandruff, dermatitis, canker sores or other irritated tissues or skin. It has corrosive properties and this includes corrosion of the fats and protiens that make up skin and muscle. SLES causes long-term permeation of the body’s tissues and has the power to permeate the eyes, brain, heart and liver. In addition to that, it’s an eye irritant which can cause cataracts in adults, and is proven to inhibit the proper formation of eyes in small children. The substance is cheap, so low-quality product manufacturers tend to use this because of greed, slipping away from authorities, but causing damage to millions of people worldwide.
“Dreamron SLES-free shampoo gives the freedom to choose among a number of varieties, each based on different natural ingredients, so users can decide which one to use, according to their health benefits and preference,” states a press release issued by Dreamron.
Manufacturing process of Dreamron products ensures the use of high quality ingredients, involving a highly skilled and trained workforce at one of the largest cosmetics manufacturing plants in South Asia, respecting international guidelines. Dreamron has received SO 9001:2008 certification and their production process and plant meet GMP, TQM and 5S standards.
