‘Rajitha not involved in corruption’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne implemented Prof. Senaka Bibile's Drug Policy and abolished the drug market monopoly. He did not involve in corruption while purchasing the cancer drug, Trastuzumab, Health Services acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday, Dr. Bandara said in the past, one company had the monopoly of supplying the drug “Trastuzumab” used to treat early stages of breast cancer. But one vial cost Rs. 285,000. The new drug imported from Russia costs only Rs. 149,500. The government saved around Rs. 1,000 million by breaking the monopoly, he said.
According to Dr. Bandara, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) headed by Prof. Asitha de Silva who is an expert on the subject re-assured the status of the drug. It was approved by the Technical Committee. "The company which supplied the drug for Rs. 285,000 previously offered to supply the drug for Rs. 198,000, but we did not purchase the drug from them," he said. Dr. Bandara said there is no decision on the purchase of a Pet Scanner for the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. The Cabinet will take the decision after considering all reports, Bandara said.
