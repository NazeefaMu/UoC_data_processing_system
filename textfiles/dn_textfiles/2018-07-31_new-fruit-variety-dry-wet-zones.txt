New fruit variety for dry, wet zones

The Agriculture Department has introduced a new fruit crop which could be cultivated in both, the dry and wet zones of the country.
The said crop had already been cultivated at a farm in Eraminiyagala, Angunakolapelessa.
According to scientists, the newly-introduced fruit, called ‘gac fruit/sweet gourd’ (Momordica Cochinchinensis), is rich in beta-carotene, lycopene and Pro-Vitamin A.
The gac fruit is native to South East Asia and Australia, and it can be eaten either boiled, stir-fried, or in curries. The fruit is also used to prepare many culinary dishes.
During a field visit to the Eraminiyagala farm in Angunakolapelessa, Minister Amaraweera instructed authorities to take necessary measures to promote the gac fruit as a commercial fruit crop.
