[APPRECIATIONS - (27-03-2017)]

Rev Father Derrick Mendis
Geniar Legend
It’s four months since the demise of my very dear friend Rev Father Derrick Mendis.
My friendship with Father Derrick started in 1949, when I was admitted to St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, as a student in the Junior Form. I was an absolute stranger from Ratnapura boarded in a relative’s place in Moratuwa.
Derrick’s genial face attracted me and with his characteristic smile; he made me feel at home. We immediately got friendly and subsequently became best of friends. Sydney, another good friend, and I spent our evenings at Derrick’s residence. We played marbles or went catapulting, and sometimes during the weekends, we went river bathing.
We finished our SSC at St Sebastian’s in 1952, and Derrick, whom we fondly called Dicky, proceeded for further studies to St. Joseph’s College, Colombo. Our friendship did not end there.
During the holidays, we met and went on cycle trips to Wadduwa, where we had a quick drinks of toddy. By this time, Dicky had grown tall and had developed a personality and demeanor which spoke of strong leadership.
He planned cycle trips down South to Kataragama. Defying all the warnings of people who cautioned us not to go through jungle roads, we proceeded through Ratnapura and Embilipitiya, stopping for the nights at known places and then back to Moratuwa along the coast. We had challenging experiences, but with Dicky in the fore front we had nothing to fear, and we had an enjoyable time.
Dicky was a marvelous friend who liked to entertain and help people in difficulties at all times. During the holidays, Dicky used to visit me at Ratnapura with Sydney. He had an air gun, and we went bird-shooting. Dicky loved fishing, hunting and spear fishing. Rearing fish was a hobby of his.
After our school career, we met again at Peradeniya where I was at the school of Agriculture, and he, at the university. He used to visit me at my hostel at Gannoruwa and we had a little toddy and then dinner at my hostel. Egerton used to accompany him, and all the students joined in a sing song with Dicky at the piano.
After our academic career, I went my way, and Dicky, his, in our own fields. Dicky followed a course in Chartered Accountancy.
But we met very often and corresponded with each other regularly, although I was at Ratnapura and he in Colombo. One day, he sprang a surprise on us by saying that he was going to join the Jesuit Order.
Derrick showed his magnanimity to God by deciding to use all the gifts and talents that he had endowed him with in spreading his kingdom on earth.
That was characteristic of him. After a get-together of all his old friends, he was accompanied by them to Manresa Seminary in Batticaloa. Even during his seminary life in Batticaloa, and also in Pune he managed to get in touch with his friends. Later, we met at his ordination and soon after when my marriage took place; he was our celebrant.
His first appointment was to the remote town of Balapitiya where there was a small parish church with only four Catholic families. At the start, his parish life was rather tedious as all the people roundabout were non-Catholics.
He used to lose all his belongings too. But he was not perturbed, and tactfully managed to get round the non-Catholics who eventually became his great supporters. Some of them continued their friendship till the end of his life.
The Jesuit Society, making use of his knowledge and expertise and recognizing his rapport with the youth, made him the Director of their Technical College in Batticaloa, and later, in Badulla. He never failed to visit me whenever he came down to Moratuwa.
His birthday was an occasion when all his closest friends in Moratuwa met at Auberine his home, at my place or at Wilfred Cooray’s place.
He loved singing, and his stentorian voice, which he himself accompanied on the piano inviting others to join him, was much in evidence at his parties. He loved small children and got them to play the tambourines and the cymbals. He sometimes played the guitar too, making it a real musical evening.
He also spiced the occasion with his humorous anecdotes. He had a large circle of friends drawn from the rich and the poor all of whom he treated alike. He also joined Surol and worked for the welfare of the leprosy patients.
He loved his sister Rev Sister Charmaine very much and also his cousin Father Egerton Perera who was with him in the University and together joined the Jesuit Society. He not only officiated at our wedding, but also attended our 25th Wedding Anniversary and was the celebrant at my son’s wedding too. He rarely declined invitations to our special occasions.
Towards the latter part of his life, he was down with illness which finally incapacitated him. He was confined to a room at the Jesuit Residence at Akkara Panaha.
It was pathetic to see this mighty figure lying in bed having to depend on others which was not what he wanted, but had to accept with resignation. He never complained but managed a smile when we visited him saying “What to do Lucian, these things have to be faced.”
I must mention here that it was Lal and his family who were Buddhists he had met at Balapitiya who tended him with dedication coming all the way from Madampe every other day till the end of his life.
Rev Father Derrick Mendis was a legend, and the void which his demise has created can never be filled. The memories that he left behind will be evergreen in our hearts and minds.
May his soul rest in peace!

Andrew Silva
Silent philanthropist
Having had a successful career in business, former Managing Director of Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. Andrew Silva spent this retirement as a practicing Buddhist and social worker until he passed away, peacefully, at the ripe age of 96 years, recently.
Hailing from Kottagoda, Matara, as the son of a small businessman and fourth in a family of five children who lost their mother when they were very young, he had his early education in Matara. As most other youth from the South, he also moved to Colombo and joined the Government Technical College, and later the Polytechnic, where he followed the accounting and secretarial courses. Silva was one of the early products of these two institutions.
He started his career as an Audit Clerk with a monthly wage of Rs. 15/-. This was one of the basic professions during that era in the early part of the 20th century. Having worked in the tea sector for a short period, he joined United Tractors in the early 1950’s.
In the mid-1950s, he joined Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. in Colombo as an Accountant. The company subsequently became Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. was formed through the acquisition of Ceylon Fruit Drinks and Table water Co. in March 1955. The company was selling Lion Brand aerated waters such as Passionola, Portello, Ginger Beer, Lanka Lime, Orange Sharona, Dry Ginger Ale, Tonic, and Soda. They had 10 Distributors island-wide. In 1958, he was instrumental in introducing the ‘Kist’ range of fruit-based food products. In 1961, Pure Beverages became Sri Lanka’s bottler of the Coca-Cola Company following the Franchise Agreement signed with The Coca-Cola Export Corporation in 1960.
Many were the challenges faced by the company during this time, which included the Government’s adoption of an import restriction policy to enhance and protect local industries. As a result, there was a shortage of white glass bottles and insufficient stocks of sugar to produce Coca-Cola. Silva resolved this issue by successfully negotiating with Ceylon Glass Company in Ratmalana to produce clear bottles and by starting the Dheegavapi sugar plantations to produce sugar. Since refrigeration facilities were needed to maintain the flavour of Coca-Cola, unlike local beverages, he arranged for the Distributors to purchase locally manufactured Sisil Refrigerators/Bottle coolers.
As a practicing Buddhist and the Managing Director of Pure Beverages, he introduced mindfulness by getting the workforce to spend a few minutes meditating prior to starting work. While promoting meditation, he demonstrated to his multinational partners, the benefits of this practice in increasing the productivity of the workforce. Silva created history in Sri Lanka by building a Buddha Shrine within the premises of a multinational organization.
In summary, it could be said that at a time when the company was not doing well, he took the helm and turned the ship around. His multifaceted experience, ability, and good work ethics uplifted the company’s profile to international standards. He was an inspirational leader who guided Pure Beverages to become a leading beverage producer and distributor in Sri Lanka and a company that can be benchmarked against for best operational practices in the South Asian region.
Having come under the influence of the Most Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Mahanayaka Thera, he widened his knowledge of Buddhism and devoted his time to meditation. His silent service as a philanthropist saw a new building being constructed at the Siri Vajiranana Dharmayathanaya, Maharagama, for the benefit of those who observed ‘sil’ on Poya days as well as for Dhamma talks, discussions, and meetings. He donated his personal vehicle, a Peugeot 406, to Ven. Madihe Mahanayaka Thera. He also closely associated Ven. Ampitiye Sri Rahula Nayaka Thera.
Not many of us knew of his contribution to Sri Bodhiraja Foundation in Embilipitiya until Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera mentioned during his ‘anusasana’ at the funeral ceremony. The varied meritorious deeds he did in his lifespan ranged from developing places of worship to providing assistance to anyone through his Sang-HithaCharitable Trust. He was also a guide and mentor to those who he felt were in need of guidance.
When I joined Dharmavijaya Foundation (DVF) as a young Trustee in the early 1980’s, Silva was one of the Senior Trustees. He joined other trustees to visit and monitor the progress of Dhramavijaya Societies (DVSs) located in Mahaweli areas, namely Girandurukotte, Dehiattakandiya, Welikanda, and Thambuthegama. He trained me how to lead a spiritual life. When I used to travel with him to Mahaweli areas, I vividly remember that the first thing he did as he woke up early morning was to arrange his bed neatly and lay the pillow in the correct position.
He always led a simple life, and during the latter part of his life, he changed his dress to a simple white national attire. I met him last when I visited Sri Lanka in 2014. I experienced not only his knowledge of the Dhamma, but also observed his way of living.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

W.L. BOGTSTRA
Guiding beacon
I write these words in sincere appreciation, honour, gratitude, and love about my former boss and Managing Director of Malwatte Valley Plantations Limited W.L. Bogtstra, who passed away few months ago.
I first met him through my good friend Lalith Lenadora, who was in the top management of Malwatte Valley Plantations in 2003.
I joined Malwatte Valley Plantations in January, 2004, as the manager of Aislaby Estate, Bandarawela, and was promoted to Group Manager within three months.
Many of my colleagues asked me whether I was mad to join Malwatte Valley in light of adverse publicity that circulated about the company at that time.
It did not take me long to find that the policies on agriculture, manufacture, and finance were the best I had experienced during my planting career, up to that time in the trade.
Before I assumed duties, he gave me some advice. He said, “We all are managers and will have to deal with workers. Always act impartially and on facts. Think twice before you do something.”
The second piece of advice was to act with a sense of fairness and dignity. Yes, you are quite right, sir. Your advice has assisted me immensely in my day to day work, even up to now.
His experience and knowledge of the plantations, and his dedicated service to the industry was unparalleled. He was an old Josephian at the beginning, and thereafter, studied in India. He was a disciplinarian, voracious reader, fine friend, a loving husband, and a good father.
Although he was very strict, was straightforward when voicing honest opinions. He never flattered anybody to be popular and offered constructive criticism where necessary.
He was a beacon guiding many prominent personalities, including several planters, but never boasted about his achievements.
Those who experienced a close association with him would know how punctual and methodical he was. He is a man of principle, and never bowed to pressure, interference, or threats.
Bogtstra was a very simple person who led a simple life.
I am beholden to place on record that his benevolent attitude and sympathetic consideration helped me recover from my ailment completely.
I had to leave the company because my illness struck me down, making it necessary to undergo a surgery, for which I did not have adequate funds. My sickness caused anxiety to my family as well, and they too, joined me to thank Bogtstra for giving us all assistance and providing me a company vehicle for nearly four months with all the perks I enjoyed while in service.
That was a great consolation and assistance to us at a time most needed.
Should someone asks me now of the ‘ Madness’ in joining Malwtte Valley, I will say that it was absolutely madness not joining them earlier.
In 2011, he offered me the post of superintendent in a coconut property, but unfortunately I could not take up due to some other commitments.
Bogtstra’s success in managing the plantations and the company was mainly due to his son Lucas who was like a tower of strength behind him.
I thank God for giving me a such a good kind-hearted boss whom I badly miss and find it difficult to believe that he is no more.
May the good Lord Bless and keep you in his divine home in heaven.
Sir, till we meet again, I remain.
The one who died to save you will never be against you.
May your soul rest in peace!

Venetia Gamage
Lady who made others smile
“I slept, and dreamed that life was beauty;
I woke, and found that life was duty.” Echoing the words of American poet Ellen Sturgis Hooper (1812-1848), Venetia Gamage née Fernando wrote these 2 lines in my “autograph-book” 56 years ago, as a virtual testament to her life, lived in service to others.
Hence, it is indeed, a privilege to pen this very brief eulogy to one who was not only a renowned Girl Guides Commissioner, educationist, and social worker, but also a mentor, confidant, and
kalyana mithra to all! She stands, admirably, with those who have given so freely unto strangers, as much as unto loved-ones. Diligence, devotion and discipline personified her!
Our paths crossed for the first time in 1961, whilst I was a student at Devi Balika College, Colombo: Venetia Gamage was assigned to teach us general science. I vividly recall her very first lesson: shapes of leaves. The “gift of teaching,” was undoubtedly hers, along with immense patience and compassion she bore towards the weakest of learners.
Always smiling from the depths of her heart, unpretentiously and compassionately, she easily won over many an individual, including myself. Her kind ways were a great boon to the students (whether her direct-pupils or not) at Devi Balika.
She who was a second mother to all at school. Unfortunately, she lost her own mother quite unexpectedly. (I remember her late mother as a most eloquent and kind lady, whom I had the privilege of meeting by chance.) Despite having suffered this tragic personal loss, Gamage strenuously resolved to prevent her grief from impeding the duties owed to her students at Devi Balika. Such was her strength-in-service to all. Though tiny in stature, she always had a huge heart!
Looking back, I cannot think of any other who influenced my life more positively than she. Being always supportive of my undertakings, Gamage did so kindly patronize and mentor me on many an occasion.
I, particularly, recall how she personally intervened to facilitate a job interview for me at Brown’s Group, in 1965, after she got to know how arduous it had been for me to travel to my former workplace. Her said efforts not only served to facilitate my employment thereat, but also provided me with the opportunity of meeting my (late) husband; thereby, securing me for life!
When my mother had to undergo emergency surgery, for which we were wholly unprepared, Gamage took it upon herself to volunteer her services as an able seamstress, producing several bed-jackets in just a matter of hours. 12 years later, upon having to undergo surgery myself, she was there chanting pirith for my speedy recovery.
On my daughter’s birth in 1969, Gamage promptly sent me a beautiful bouquet of flowers followed by her own presence, with her husband, Nihal, at hospital.
Even during my stay abroad, Gamage made it a point to frequently write me. She and her husband Nihal insisted on providing us with accommodation, at her home, during one of our visits to Sri Lanka. She was always there to receive me at the airport with her beaming smile!
Gamage always had a sixth sense for knowing her pupils’ troubles. Although, I did, eventually, make it a point not to burden her with my personal issues, she would, more often than not, instinctively get to know about them. In 1999, when my daughter underwent major surgery, she was there with her husband, Nihal, at hospital, just 2 days after the operation.
In fact Nihal Gamage, whom she married in 1967, embraced his wife’s charitable disposition with much sincere enthusiasm. He did, without a doubt, prove himself to be her proverbial soul-mate.
Gamage’s commitment to the Girl Guides Movement saw her gracing the highest positions accessible to a Sri Lankan, in this regard. I was both, very proud and happy, to have her stay with us for a few days, in Singapore, when she was invited to a Girl Guides Conference held thereat in 1980.
Unsurprisingly, whatever the esteemed positions held by Gamage, her sincerely benevolent disposition never changed. Uptill her sudden demise on March 4, she remained the same humble and accommodating person I met 56 years ago.
I, truly, could write volumes about this unique and noble personality.
She adored her son, Daminda. She was a dutiful-daughter to her parents: the late Ethel and Arthur Fernando; and loving-sister to her siblings: the late Dudley, the late Ninette, and younger brother, Tilak.
Laying claim to a legacy of devoted-teaching, sincere-counseling, and compassionate-giving, Venetia Gamage, even in her terminal 81st year, strove to enrich all those whose lives she touched! Being a devout Buddhist, she led an exemplary life.
She was both, my trusted mentor and truest friend!
I am so thankful to have had her in my life!
May her journey in Samsra be short! May the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with her, always!

Prof. Upali Vidanapathirana
Intellect and Mentor
It was May 20, 2010; I had received a call from Vice Chancellor of the Open University of Sri Lanka(OUSL). I felt nervous and apprehensive. Nevertheless, I went to meet Prof. Vidanapathirana at his office.
“Nalin, we have to do research,” he said. “On what area, sir?” I asked. “On Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), at the Open University of Sri Lanka,” he replied. So, we started to work with problem formulation, conceptualization, data collection, and interpretation.
Despite his busy schedule, he always found time to guide me on this. Then, we submitted the paper to the Annual Academic Session at Open University, and it was accepted. I prepared a PowerPoint presentation and emailed him with the following remarks: “Dear Sir, I already prepared my PowerPoint presentation, but I feel this is your brainchild, and I will do injustice by doing that (presenting it by myself at the conference). So, your opinion please?” In response, I received a very short reply:
“Dear Nalin, I won’t gain anything by doing it. Please do it, and do a good job.
Upali V”
This is the kind of mentoring which I was very fortunate to receive from Prof. Vidanapathirana, Senior Professor in Economics, Department of Social Studies, Open University of Sri Lanka.
He is actually one of my role models, and this is same for many junior academics at OUSL. In our lives, especially as academics, we need mentoring. Prof. Vidanapathirana, with his capacity, helped us to develop our skills in research, and more importantly, he articulated empathy towards others.
Prof. Vidanapathirana, hailing from down south, Baddegama, is a graduate from University of Kelaniya, majored in Economics. He completed his Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, and his PhD, from JNU, India.
He joined the Open University after serving in a leading public bank in Sri Lanka. Professor has served as Vice Chancellor (OUSL), as well as Dean, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, with numerous publications and contributions for its existing domain of knowledge.
We extend our best wishes and blessing as he retires from his University career, leaving a rich legacy of many achievements during his tenure at the Open University.
Sri Lanka needs many intellectuals such as Prof. Vidanapathirana to convert this blessed country into a developed nation. Sri Lanka has a rich history of more than 30,000 years of civilization.
The water-cooling system of Sigiriya, built by Sigiriya Kasyapa, still continues to amaze engineers and intellectuals. We need to regain Sri Lanka’s lost glory by encouraging and appreciating academics of great intellect.
