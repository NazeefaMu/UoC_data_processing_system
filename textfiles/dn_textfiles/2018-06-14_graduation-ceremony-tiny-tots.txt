GRADUATION CEREMONY FOR TINY TOTS

Many children who completed five years were graduated in a Montessori the Abascus pre-school in Austin, Texas. Around 17 children in the Abascus pre-school were graduated on this day. In addition to American children, few others were the children of expatriates presently domiciled in the USA.
Five-year old Vandon Pierce Sivalingam’s grandparents are Sri Lankans. His father Samantha is married to an American citizen Hope Nickerson. Baby Vandon’s grandfather Sivalingam was educated at Wesly College, Colombo and graduated as an Engineer from the Preradeniya University. His grandmother Hemamali Wijeyekoon is also a Visakhian.
Abacus Pre-school Director, Steffani said most pre-schools in the USA conduct graduation ceremonies in order to mould the child’s life from the beginning. “Thereafter when they start their schooling career they have to produce their graduation received from the preschool,” she said.

The two class teachers of Abacus pre-school Christina and Judy said newly selected graduates are talented and have achieved many things during the years in preschool. When asked about the criteria that a preschooler should do to become a graduate, teacher Christina said pre- school children who are only five years old are eligible to become a ‘Diploma Holder’.
She said first the child should walk on to the stage where the panels of teachers are seated. While walking on to the stage in lines they have to sing together. Each child has to come forward and count numbers from one to twenty in Spanish and each child should recite the school song, class song etc. “Thereafter teachers ask few questions such as the capital of the USA, how many states are in USA, the name of the state that the child’s pre- school is located and few other questions,” Christina explained.
If the teachers are satisfied with the performances of children, the names of each child are called by the head of the teacher’s panel and each child has to accept the ‘Diploma’. The teachers then call them `Diploma Holders.
