SLITHM grads are country’s tourism ambassadors: Minister

“New graduates have a big responsibility to ensure that they protect the good name of the SLITHM and that of the country as their services will more often be directed towards foreigners, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said
“They will be the country’s tourism ambassadors and their actions, talents, knowledge and skills acquired through training at the SLITHM will define the success of the industry in the years to come,” he said.
He was addressing the 38th Graduation Ceremony of the institution held at the BMICH recently as its Chief Guest. A total of 77 students passed out as full-fledged graduates at the ceremony.
“I request the 77 graduates to first serve their motherland before seeking overseas exposure as Sri Lanka needs their services at this defining moment in its tourism industry,” the minister said.
“Sri Lanka is well known the world over as a very hospitable nation. In the recent past, we have seen some adverse media reports that tourists have been exploited. Today social media is a very powerful tool and one bad experience can instantly influence thousands of others,” he cautioned.
The SLITHM main campus in Colombo is South Asia’s first purpose designed training facility offering students a holistic education experience in the different aspects of tourism and hospitality. It has developed an extensive network of satellite schools across the country to attract and train youth in hospitality.
In addition to the satellite schools in Kandy, Anuradhapura, Koggala, Bandarawela, Ratnapura and Kurunegala, new schools have opened in Hambantota, Passikuda, Polonnaruwa and Negombo.
“Rather than waiting for students to come to us, we are going to their doorstep,” Minister Amaratunga said.
The industry requires thousands of new workers. Therefore, the SLITHM has doubled its output of trained students from 3,000 per year to nearly 7,000 per year.
“Today we have a serious issue with regard to manpower in the tourism and hospitality sectors. The demand is more than the supply. This is because of the continuing expansion of the hotel sector while the youth continue to focus on the more traditional career paths. The result is that many lucrative job opportunities go a begging,” Minister Amaratunga said.
He said females still hesitated to join the industry due to ill-conceived notions.
“There is a misconception among our youth especially among females that the hospitality trade is not suitable for them. This is a baseless, ill-informed and outdated theory. Today an entry level job in the hotel industry pays twice as much as any other field as a hotel employee is entitled to two monthly payments, namely the basic salary and service charge.
“When these two are combined and factored with other benefits such as free meals, accommodation, medical benefits so on, the income is much higher than other fields,” Minister Amaratunga said.
SLITHM Chairman Sunil Dissanayake said the SLITHM has a history of innovation, growth and change. Inaugurated in 1966.
“Today we have earned local and global recognition as the premier institute for hospitality and tourism management education in Sri Lanka and the region. We have been the backbone of the hospitality industry of Sri Lanka from its infancy, producing the required professional human resources for the hospitality industry,” he said.
“The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) may well be the only seat of higher educational learning in Sri Lanka with two significant milestones in its 50-year existence. It has not had to shut down a single day because of student unrest, and every individual passed out from it has found employment with the unemployment rate remaining frozen at zero,” the SLITHM Chairman said.
“With the industry estimating nearly 150,000 new direct employees by 2020 to serve Sri Lanka’s growing visitor base, last year alone 5,300 students passed out of the SLITHM, of them 88 were graduates. This year the planned output is 6,900. We aim to provide high quality, affordable and practically relevant education for the industry and in doing so we aim to achieve degree awarding status for an academic (Hons) Degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management whilst focusing on achieving National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) levels for our professional courses.With the facilitation of Chartered Management Accountants (CMA) ‘finance for hotel accounting’ courses were introduced, primarily catering to finance professionals in the hotel and catering industry and those aspiring for a career in hotel finance,” Dissanayake said. Chairman Dissanayake said he was happy to note that all of the 77 new graduates had already found employment.
He said the SLITHM was reviewing and amending its curricula to align it with current industry requirements by seeking the views and closely working with the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka.
