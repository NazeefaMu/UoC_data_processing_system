Many more restaurants, guide and transport services and other business that attract tourists can be set up in the area. Wanninayke said the number of people employed in the sector is vague since relevant statistics are unavailable.
The five-year plan mainly focuses on developing infrastructure facilities for tourism sector. roads, restaurants, lodges, and tourist attractions will be developed to gain more income from the sector, the GA said. He said many hotels charge high rates from tourists for poor-quality accommodation and such activities affect the industry. Land should be allocated to build modern tourist facilities and those who encroach on State lands should be discouraged, he said.
