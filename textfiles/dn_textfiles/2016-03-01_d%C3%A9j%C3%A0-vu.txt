Déjà vu!

 
Hollywood has given us talking toys, wooly mammoths, animals escaping from zoos and had reinvented fairytales so far. Therefore an animation based on a prehistoric family on the run from extinction does not come as a surprise.
However what does come across a shock is the dismal manner in which directors Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders have dealt with 'The Croods.'
The movie has nothing new to offer nor is it inspiring in any manner. Within 10 minutes into the film the story becomes highly predictable. Genuinely humorous moments are scarce and most of the time you are forced to watch scenes which seem to resemble a patchwork of incidents borrowed from previous animations.
'The Croods' revolves around a prehistoric family whose life is limited to the confined reality of their cave.
They spend their daytime hunting for food as a pack but when night falls Grug, the father and head of the family, rushes them off to the safety of their cave. The family shuns anything new and curiosity, which Eep, their teenage daughter has in abundance, is frowned down upon.
New world
When an earthquake strikes the area their cave is destroyed. The family meets Guy, a boy with new ideas and discoveries who convinces them that they have to leave their dwelling to prevent themselves from becoming extinct. Lead by him a new world opens before their eyes.

They encounter dangers which they have been hiding from in the past but soon learn that there is a brighter side to the story on their way to a distant sanctuary.
The Croods family reminds you of the Flintstones due to its prehistory setting but even the cartoon seems to be more attractively presented than this animation. The Crood family seems bizarre and grotesque rather than charming.
Unlikely pair
The robust and uncultured Eep, the heroine of the tale, makes us cringe. She is in stark contrast to the svelte and traditionally feminine princesses featured in Disney movies. Headstrong and spunky she is presented as a physically strong character.
However the fact that her love interest is slim and trim makes them an odd, mismatched and highly unlikely pair.
The story is too full of clichés to raise much interest.
For example we have the clash between the over protective father and the rebellious daughter which we witnessed in the last 'Ice Age' sequel. You cannot help wishing for time to pass quickly because at times 'The Croods' becomes a pain.
The only plus point about 'The Croods' lies in its 3D technology. The candy-coloured visuals and rollercoaster chase sequences lighten up the drab movie. Carnivorous flowers, turtles that can fly, flesh devouring birds and a vibrantly colourful sabre-toothed tiger project its creative angle but even those seem wasted as the movie itself does not have anything creatively new to offer. Some of the modern features in the movie backdrop seem to have been copied from successful productions like 'Avatar.'
Celebrity voices like Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds are part of the project. They do a commendable job in voicing the characters but even their star power cannot help the fate of 'The Croods.'
If you have nothing much to do with your time you might while away a few hours with the film. Otherwise 'The Croods' is just a waste of time and money.
It would be best if they let this one be buried in history.
