Embassy holds Sri Lankan food festival in Jordan

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Amman, Jordan, in collaboration with Hotel Grand Hyatt, Amman, organized a Sri Lankan food festival, ‘Unique Cuisines of Sri Lanka’, accompanied by elegant dance performances.
The centre of attraction of the food festival was the wide-ranging selection of Sri Lankan seafood varieties like mud crab, black tiger prawns, squids, tuna fish, crab meat and lobster, etc. In the vegetable section, koss (jackfruit), kehel muwa (banana flower), wattakka (pumpkin), gotukola, cashew, alukesel (ash banana), pathola, rathu hal (red rice), samba hal (samba rice), plain and egg hoppers and string hoppers were featured. Most ingredients were brought from Sri Lanka.
The prime objective of this food festival was to introduce the food and the food culture of Sri Lanka to Jordanians and to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination among Jordanians and other expatriates.
Ambassador of Sri Lanka, A.L.M. Lafeer stated that this food festival would help bring the citizens of the two countries closer. Events of this nature would also help enhance the people-to-people contact of the two countries, he said.
The Sri Lankan dishes were prepared by a prominent Sri Lankan Chef Nuwanga Siribaddanage who was flown in from Muscat, Oman, for the occasion.
A 12-member Channa–Upuli Dance Troupe from Sri Lanka entertained the guests throughout the festival.
Jordan Tourist Board Chairman/Director General Dr. Abdul Al Razaq Arabiyat was the chief guest and more than 50 ambassadors based in Amman also visited the food festival.
