Parliament

OMP has no power to hold criminal inquiries or file legal action: PM
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) does not have any power to hold criminal inquiries or file legal action, as its role is limited to finding the truth on missing persons and issuing Certificates of Absence where necessary, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was moving the OMP (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) (Amendment) Bill for debate in Parliament yesterday. The OMP Act was passed in August last year amidst chaos in Parliament.
The Bill was to incorporate an Amendment proposed by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake to remove a clause that enabled the OMP to enter into agreements with any entity in executing its functions.
The Premier initiating the debate, stressed the need to look at “healing the wounds of war” and “uniting as one nation,” adding that the Government did not intend to hunt behind the past and engage in lengthy legal procedures on them.
“We must put a closure to this and that closure is multi-faceted. It requires not only a Constitutional settlement and return of lands, but also addressing the issue of missing persons and taking remedial action,” Wickremesinghe said.
He also said a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) similar to that of South Africa would be set up if necessary, adding that any development on this would be informed to the House. He said the Steering Committee involved in Constitutional reforms has to a large extent reached an agreement on the national question.
Questioned by MP Dinesh Gunawardena as to whether the President has endorsed the legislation and made the necessary appointments, the Prime Minister said the President would do so after the House duly passes the Amendments.
Uma Oya project a monster causing damage to property and people: Dy Minister Jayaratne
The Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project has started producing unexpected ill-effects, Parliament was told yesterday.
Deputy Environment and Mahaweli Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said that there was an internal leak that releases around 1,070 litres of water per second and admitted that there was a risk of houses and other buildings in Bandarawela town caving in.
The Minister was responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, with regard to the imminent danger posed by this project.
“When the foundation stone was laid for the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project on April 29, 2008, various objectives and aims were listed to be achieved with the implementation of the project. However, now the project has turned out to be a monster causing immense environment destruction, property damage and inconvenience to thousands of people. As a result of the underground excavations meant for the construction of a tunnel, 4,625 houses had been damaged. Cracks have appeared in walls of houses, schools and religious places,” MP Dissanayake said.
“In the areas affected, wells, streams and canals had gone dry. It has been estimated that 2,333 natural streams have dried because of the tunnel project. Thousands of acres which had been cultivated, are now lying abandoned as the farmers lack water resources,” he added.
MP Dissanayake demanded to know whether an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) had been carried out before the commence of the project and if so, whether the study predicted the consequences being experienced at present. He asked as to why the government did not declare the affected area as a ‘high risk zone.’
The Deputy Minister said that an EIA had been done by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 2011, but the damages and destructions being experienced now had not been foreseen by the report.
“The government has already spent Rs 57 billion for this project and 77 percent of its work is complete. A reversal is not possible now,” he added.
“The President has appointed a new committee of experts to look into the first EIA report and the damages. We have been following the advices of the second committee to minimize the damages. In addition, the President had summoned the Ambassadors of Switzerland and Norway and sought their expert help from those countries. A team of engineers had arrived from Switzerland and are now working in the area in search of solutions. In the meantime, the government has taken action to pay compensation to the people affected,” he said.
Govt has taken steps to safeguard Sri Lankans working in Qatar: FM
There is no immediate risk to the jobs of Sri Lankan expatriates in Qatar, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake assured Parliament yesterday.
In a Ministerial statement Minister Karunanayake said the Government was closely monitoring the situation in the Gulf region and has taken steps for the safety of Sri Lankan nationals living Qater if any emergency situation arises.
He said about 150,000 Sri Lankan expatriates live in Qatar, while this number is 193,000 in Saudi Arabia, 125,000 in UAE and 18,000 in Bahrain.
“Qatar authorities have assured that the situation in Qatar was very calm and stable. It is not reported that any Sri Lankan or any Sri Lankan business had been affected due to the prevailing situation in Qatar. The authorities have assured us of continued support and every Sri Lankan had been advised to contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Qatar, if they require any assistance and advice on the current situation,” he said.
“However, in the case of any emergency situation which may arise, we have made arrangements for early repatriation of our nationals. Temporary travel documents will be issued and our Embassy in Qatar will take utmost care of all Sri Lankans there,” he said.
