Sports Ministry employees can’t hold posts in National sports bodies, says minister

Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha said that there is no room for anyone working at his ministry to hold a
position in National sports bodies.
He made his remarks at a meeting with members of the Professional Sports Journalist Association at his ministry yesterday.
“I’m not aware of our paid staffers holding positions at national sports federations. But if it is true I will take necessary action regarding that in the coming weeks. They will have to choose one job, ministry or sports association”, said Minister Mustapha
He warned that he will get tough with anyone irrespective of his or her position when dealing with fraudulent activity or corruption. “I have already suspended the Director General of Sports with immediate effect after his department failed to provide adequate hostel facilities for the athletes participating in the South Asian Junior Athletic Championships. It should have been his duty to monitor that situation”, the Minister said.
He further said that he will not dissolve or appoint Interim Committee unless there any financials frauds taking place.
“It is because I strongly believe that appointing interim committees without democratically elected officials is a bad precedent,” he said. “I have to carry out the work according to the instructions of the Attorney General”.
The Minister said he will not cave in or bow down to anything or anyone when tackling issues of malpractice and corruption.
