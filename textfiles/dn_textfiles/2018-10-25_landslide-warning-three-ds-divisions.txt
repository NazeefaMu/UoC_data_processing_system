Landslide warning  for three DS divisions

The National Building Reasearch Organization yesterday issued a level one landslide warning for three Divisional Secretariat divisions in Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Matale districts.
The NBRO identified the Walapone DS division in the Nuwaraelya district, the Ukuwewla DS division in the Matale district and Gangawata Korale DS division in Kandy as the vulnerable areas.
"Since the rainfall within the past 24 hours has exceeded 75mm, if the rain continues,
be watchful on the possibility of landslides, slope failures, rock falls,cutting
failures and ground subsidence," the NBRO warned.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department said the enhancement of showery conditions to some extent over the South-western part of the island is expected to continue tomorrow.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at most places over the island after 2.00 p.m.
Heavy falls about 100-150 mm can be expected at some places in Western, Central, Uva Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces.
Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places over the coastal areas around the island in the morning too.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
In the sea areas, showers or thundershowers will occur at sea areas extending from Kankasanthurei to Matara via Puttalam, Colombo and Galle. Heavy showers or thundershowers can expected at some places.
Showers or thundershowers may occur at several places in ther coastal areas around the island at evening or night.
Winds will be North-Easterly in the sea areas extending from Trincomalee to Mannar via Kankasanturei.
Winds will be variable in direction in the other sea areas around the island.
Wind speed will be 15-25 kmph in the sea areas around the island.
Temporarily strong gusty winds and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
Meanwhile, two spill gates of the Victoria Reservoir were opened last evening due to heavy showers and authorities warned people to be vigilant.
"Several spill gates of the Parakrama Samudraya were also opened due to rising water levels," sources said.
