UN Human Rights Chief will not seek second term

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, a staunch critic of United States President Donald Trump, had stated that he will not seek a second term.
“After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term,” the New York Times quoted Al-Hussein as saying in a statement emailed to his staff and shared with the paper. He penned down, “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice - which is your voice.”
His four-year term expires next September. A spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric confirmed Hussein’s plans to leave after his term expires.
According to the report, “The High Commissioner informed the Secretary General last week of his intentions not to seek another term,” Dujarric said in an email.
