Shortage of Dengue drug Dextran, alleges GMOA

The Government should take immediate measures to supply superior quality Dextran as soon as possible in order to treat dengue patients as there is a shortage of this essential drug, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Health Ministry has a stock of Dextran imported from India but consultant doctors had recommended not to prescribe this drug to patients because of its poor quality. “They have recommended good quality Dextran imported from Thailand,” Dr. de Zoysa said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the GMOA has received information on another order allegedly placed by the Health Ministry to import low quality Dextran from India again. This order should be immediately cancelled. The GMOA will be vigilant on this issue,” he said. “The GMOA will extend its fullest support to save the lives of dengue patients. The Health Ministry should take immediate action to control dengue because the disease can reach epidemic level in flood affected areas with receding waters. Other communicable diseases can also breakout in the flood affected areas. The GMOA has already conducted over 200 health camps in flood affected areas, Dr. de Zoysa added.
