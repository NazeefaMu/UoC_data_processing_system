Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 to discuss Belt and Road Initiative

The Sri Lanka Economic Summit to be held later this month will discuss how Sri Lanka can tap opportunities out of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Tuesday.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
The session titled "Belt and Road Initiative - Transformative Opportunity for Sri Lanka" will talk on the potential investment opportunities for Sri Lanka from the Belt and Road Initiative.
The Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 will be held in the capital Colombo on July 25 and 26 with the sole aim of discussing ways to strengthen the island's economy.
The two-day annual summit, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, will have over 40 top resource persons, such as sectoral experts, industry practitioners, government officials and ministers taking part.
