CWC pledges support to UPFA

The Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) will never leave the President or the UPFA irrespective of invitations received from other parties to join hands for forming the administration in local councils, CWC Senior Vice President and Central Provincial Council member P Shakthivel said.
He said even though the CWC had cooperated with other political parties to set up the administration in certain local councils in the Nuwara Eliya district, it will always remain with the President and the UPFA in future too.
He said CWC General Secretary Arumugam Thondaman and other senior party members who met President Maithripala Sirisena at the President’s House on February 14, later discussed the future actions of the party at length. UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera too had attended these talks.
Shakthivel said the CWC will cooperate with the UPFA and several other parties to set up the local administration in Kotagala, Agrapathana and Norwood Pradeshiya Sabhas while it will join the SLPP and several other parties to set up the administration in the Hatton-Dickoya UC, Maskeliya and Talawakelle-Lindula UCs and the Ambagamuwa, Kotmale and Hanguranketha Pradeshiya Sabhas.
