Mechanism to face disaster situations formulated

A mechanism is to be formulated to face disaster situations in future, Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.
He said the President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed to formulate the mechanism. He also said attention was drawn to such a proposal that was made in 1968 but did not materalise due to political reasons. He added that Disaster Management Act will also be amended to face such disaster situations.
Abeywardena said the President has instructed to grant dry rations for a period of one week and the Divisional Secretariats have been given powers to extend the period of dry rations if needed. He added that these decisions were reached at a meeting headed by the President Maithripala Sirisena with the participation of members at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
“The assessors already have been sent to assess the damage caused to the victims,” he said. “Each family whose house is completely damaged will be given a compensation of Rs 2.5 million and for the business institutions will be directed to banks for relief”. He added that the relevant ministers have already gone to those flood affected districts to attend to the electricity supply, water supply, road development and other needs. He also said that it was decided to acquire some lands of plantation companies to grant for the victims who are living in vulnerable areas by way of a cabinet paper.
