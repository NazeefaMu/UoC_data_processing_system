Fighting for life & striking for SAITM

Matters related to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) came to a head this week with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) launching a continuous strike that lasted three days. The strike inconvenienced tens of thousands of patients in government hospitals which are reeling from the impact of a dengue epidemic.
The GMOA agreed to call of the strike after three days following talks with President Maithripala Sirisena. Initially, the doctors’ trade union said it had reached agreement with the President on key issues related to SAITM but, following the Presidential Secretariat releasing a statement regarding the talks, the GMOA was again considering its next move, saying it was not satisfied with the outcome.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the government announced that Cabinet had approved the takeover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe, which is the main training centre for SAITM students, in the latest move by the authorities to resolve the crisis.
The SAITM crisis has been dragging on since January. Dozens of SAITM graduates, who have passed their examinations and obtained a MBBS degree, are in limbo as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has refused to register them and the matter is now before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, hundreds of medical students in state medical faculties have been boycotting lectures for many months now as part of the protest campaign against SAITM.
Government ministers
A constant complaint from the government ministers who have had to deal with SAITM- mostly, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, is that they have been lumbered with the SAITM issue because of the blunders committed by the previous government under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Presidency.
Indeed, SAITM was set up in 2008, during Rajapaksa’s first term as President. It is the brainchild of Dr. Neville Fernando, a doctor turned politician from Panadura. Fernando first entered Parliament in 1977, defeating Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) giant Leslie Goonewardena. However he had several differences of opinion with then President J R Jayewardene and eventually resigned when he was threatened with expulsion. Later, he was to join the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
It is no secret that SAITM had Rajapaksa’s blessings. Rajapaksa authorised the grant of a 600 million rupee loan for SAITM. He also facilitated the grant of scholarships to students who failed to gain entry to state medical schools by a few marks, so they could attend SAITM and obtain a medical degree. It was S B Dissanayake who, as Rajapaksa’s Higher Education Minister, presided over SAITM obtaining degree awarding status from the University Grants Commission (UGC), in August 2013.
To be fair by the GMOA, it had been raising concerns regarding SAITM even when Rajapaksa was President. However those were mere whimpers of protest, confined to media briefings and the occasional statement and a far cry from its current campaign of agitation. The GMOA’s critics say this was because it was running scared of Rajapaksa’s strong arm tactics against any dissent.
It is also a fact that the GMOA endorsed and actively supported Rajapaksa during the 2015 presidential election campaign. As it did so, it did not seek any assurances from Rajapaksa regarding SAITM, even as a quid pro quo. Hence its bona fides regarding SAITM are quite questionable.
The crunch came when the SLMC refused to recognise the SAITM degree. This was in July 2015. By this time, the government had changed and Rajapaksa had been voted out of office. That was also when the GMOA stepped up its agitation against SAITM, commencing an all-out publicity campaign against the medical school and launching token strikes.
As the issue dragged on, SAITM students canvassed their grievances before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, in a landmark decision on January 31 this year, directed the SLMC to register the MBBS degree and in fact castigated the Council for acting beyond its purview. That is when all hell broke loose and the SAITM controversy became part of the country’s political discourse.
Anti-SAITM campaign
The medical school too does have its share of blunders. Its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Sameera Senaratne complained that he was shot at by gunmen in early February, days after the Court of Appeal verdict. Later, Police was to declare that the shooting was staged. Senaratne was dismissed from SAITM. The incident didn’t help SAITM’s standing in the eyes of the public.
Since then, it has been the GMOA which has been at the forefront of the anti-SAITM campaign. However, political parties such as the Joint Opposition- which ironically set up SAITM- and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have joined the anti-SAITM chorus. So has the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF), popularly known as the ‘anthaery’. Thus there is a coalescence of anti-government forces over this issue which is therefore no longer only about medical education: it is now a political hot potato.
The government has offered significant concessions: it has agreed to broad base the ownership of SAITM which will be listed on the stock exchange.
Fernando has agreed to hand over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe to the government. SAITM itself is to be managed by a board of management. The government has also agreed to publish minimum standards for medical education and has directed that SAITM students should sit a qualifying examination conducted by the SLMC.
None of this appears to have appeased the GMOA. After its talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, the GMOA took umbrage at the press release issued by the Presidential Secretariat which said that students currently holding a degree from SAITM would be accommodated and that SAITM would transform into a public-private partnership. It is demanding that SAITM be nationalised and its present students not be recognised.
The GMOA’s current conduct, even if it was principled in its opposition to SAITM, has earned the wrath of the public in no uncertain terms. In the past it has been accused of staging strikes to win demands such as vehicle permits and even top schools for doctors’ children. Its latest actions, staging a continuous strike when the country is in the throes of a deadly dengue epidemic, is deplorable and makes a mockery of the Hippocratic Oath that its members are purported to subscribe to.
There have been other slip ups that have exposed the GMOA. Its President, Anurudhdha Padeniya, was exposed when he had listed himself on the internet for private practice on a day the doctors were on strike. Recently, it held its annual general meeting with much fanfare and jubilation, with female dancers called in for entertainment-while the continuous strike and the dengue epidemic was in full swing!
The government for its part, having compromised significantly thus far, has been determined to see SAITM established as a private medical school. This is because the state alone cannot simply meet the demand for medical education. The argument makes sense because over a thousand students travel overseas every year for private medical education. If private medical schools are established locally, it will meet that demand, save millions of rupees in foreign exchange- and the SLMC can closely monitor the conduct of these schools, much more than it can monitor overseas medical colleges.
However, the government is mindful that the SAITM crisis is now a political debate. During last week’s protests, university students stormed the Ministry of Health and damaged public property. In the ensuing melee, many students and officers of the armed forces were injured. There is concern that the anti-SAITM lobby wants to escalate its campaign, so that it would result in the death of a protestor. Then, that could be used to discredit the government further.
This happened in the ‘late 80s, when medical student Padmasiri Thrimavithana was killed during the campaign against the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) at Ragama. That led to the nationalisation of the NCMC. The anti-SAITM campaign is hoping for history to repeat itself.
The legal issues related to SAITM are now before the Supreme Court. When the Court delivers its final verdict, the government needs to see the issue through and do so expeditiously. To let it drag on further is to allow the controversy to fester- and the fallout can only be negative, not only for the government but also for the thousands of students both in SAITM and the state medical faculties who are now spending the best years of their lives, living in limbo and limping from one protest march to another.
