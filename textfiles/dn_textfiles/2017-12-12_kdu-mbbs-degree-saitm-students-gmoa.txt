KDU MBBS Degree to SAITM students - GMOA

Relevant authorities should pay their special attention towards offering the MBBS degree of Kothalawala Defence Academy (KDU) to SAITM medical students, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo recently he said that the majority have proposed to end the SAITM issue by offering MBBS degree of KDU to qualified SAITM medical students.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the KDU MBBS degree can be offered to the SAITM medical students after examining their qualifications. Qualified students of SAITM should be given a medical (MBBS) degree which is recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
At the moment private medical education is not a reality in Sri Lankan soil. The government should immediately stop changing the name of SAITM and creating a similar controversial institution. The gazette notification abolishing SAITM should be issued immediately. Pre-agreed minimum standards of medical education should be gazetted immediately without cutting down any existing powers of the SLMC, he added.
