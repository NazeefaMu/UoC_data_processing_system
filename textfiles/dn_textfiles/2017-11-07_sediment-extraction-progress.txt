Irrigation tank renovations in Anuradhapura
Sediment extraction in progress

The sediment extraction programme connected to the renovation work of minor irrigation tanks in the Anuradhapura district is currently in progress. Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Services Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that the sediment disposing exercise in another 100 rural tanks would continue amidst the intermittent rain until December.
In this programme, sediment extraction is being executed in a scientific and sophisticated manner, without causing any damage to tank bunds and the tank beds, minimizing the possibility of seepage.
