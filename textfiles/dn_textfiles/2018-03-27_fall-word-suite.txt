Fall of the word suite

Once much muscular, the library should be the second best L word we turned to when we wanted to know more about the best L word: love. Most among us are still fond of libraries. To see them closed down will be beyond our imagination. In reality, however, it is happening right now. Worse, most libraries constitutionally formulated are yet to be open. The much muscular libraries are now fast shrinking. Blame the smart devices for all that!
The notion that computers have made the library obsolete was much thicker than Google.

The library structure of Sri Lanka underwent a drastic change with the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment to the 1978 Constitution. The Amendment introduced nine provinces. As a result, controlling authority of the library hitherto vested with the central government was delegated to the nine provinces. The provincial councils had to shoulder the development of libraries and museums. The provincial library services boards and central libraries were introduced.
Assistant Director of National Library Services and Documentation Board, Vijaya Premadarshana has undertaken a research on the development of provincial central libraries for his postgraduate studies. The provincial library concept has been materialised in only four provinces so far with five provinces yet to witness the concept materialise.
“Although it seems like a novel concept, it was originally initiated towards the beginning of the 90 decade and is undergoing a slow growth. The public awareness of the library chain is quite meagre. Before studying about the provincial central libraries, we need to explore the history of Sri Lankan libraries. The Sri Lankan history of libraries could be traced as far back as 1 BC. The initiation was the printing of Buddhist teachings which were up to this point has come in oral form. There have been several pothgul as a result. Many pothguls were attached to Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiriya and Jetawanarama.”
Under the Amendment, the Chief Ministers were instructed to supervise these libraries. Accordingly the provinces of Uva, Central, Sabaragamuwa and North Central have provincial library services boards.
Traditional procedures
The traditional government procedures have made things difficult in implementing the concept. The relevant officials who were trained in implementing the concept have been transferred and their replacements remain clueless about the mission and the vision of the concept.
“Each of these provincial libraries should be maintained as a research hub. All the information you require should be available here. The officers should be qualified,” Premadarshana said.
The concept is introduced to streamline the research process. The provincial researchers are not compelled to reach Colombo to gather information. The tourists will also be benefitted with the easy access available in every province – if only the concept is implemented.
“A number of measures should be undertaken. Training the officials is one. Preserving ancient documents is another. These libraries can apply for foreign funds as well. Sadly none of that really happens. The relevant authorities have no idea on how to implement the concept,” he noted.
Despite the high level of Sri Lanka’s literacy, Premadarshana opines that the same is not visible in the library phenomenon. Literacy level is not a good measure of the education growth. Although a majority is capable of reading, whether the reading matter is serious or not remains questionable. Most small-scale libraries do not have serious reading matter owing to the lack of properly qualified officers.
Literacy level
“The academic publications have a little readership. When it comes to fiction, the people prefer silly novels to classic ones. The people utilise their literacy level only to browse the simple reading materials. These materials mostly include sentimental novels. That does not enhance their lifestyles.”
On the other hand, the English reading section of most libraries is vacant. The communities cannot be blamed, for that would be stepping out of the comfort zone. To encourage more readers to the English sections, Premadarshana recommends basic English courses which will be resourceful in inculcating the reading habit.
The physical libraries are slowly becoming a thing of the past. It is a shift from the traditional physical libraries to a technological involvement.
Traditional library
01. Emphasis on storage and preservation of physical items, particularly books and periodicals
02. Cataloguing at a high level rather than one of detail, e.g., author and subject indexes as opposed to full text
03. Browsing based on physical proximity of related materials, e.g., books on sociology are near one another on the shelves
04. Passivity; information is physically assembled in one place; users must travel to the library to learn what is there and make use of it
Digital library
01. Emphasis on access to digitized materials wherever they may be located, with digitization eliminating the need to own or store a physical item
02. Cataloguing down to individual words or glyphs
03. Browsing based on hyperlinks, keyword, or any defined measure of relatedness; materials on the same subject do not need to be near one another in any physical sense
04. Broadcast technology; users need not visit a digital library except electronically; for them, the library exists at any place they can access it,e.g., home, school, office, or in a car
05. Everything can be stored. The total number of different books produced since printing began does not exceed one billion. (The number of books now published annually is less than one million.) If an average book occupies 500 pages at 2,000 characters per page, then even without compression it can be stored comfortably in one megabyte. Therefore, one billion megabytes are sufficient to store all books. This is 1015 bytes or one petabyte.
