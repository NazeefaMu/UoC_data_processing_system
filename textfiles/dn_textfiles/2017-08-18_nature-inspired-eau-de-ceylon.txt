Nature inspired Eau De Ceylon

Spa Ceylon has just introduced ‘Eau De Ceylon’ - an innovative new range of nature inspired colognes to refresh and delight the senses. These aromatic blends are based on Spa Ceylon’s Aromaveda concept - combining the olfactory pleasures of natural plant oils with the Vedic benefits inherent in essential oils to promote natural wellbeing.   
Available in four uniquely refreshing unisex fragrances, Kaffir Lime and Lemon refreshes and clarifies, Lemongrass Citron soothes and refreshes, Mandarin Spice uplifts and refreshes while Grapefruit Blossom refreshes and awakens the senses.
