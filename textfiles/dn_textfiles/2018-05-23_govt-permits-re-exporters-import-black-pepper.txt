Govt permits re-exporters to import Black Pepper

 
The Union Government has permitted 78 companies to import duty free 2,500 tonnes of black Pepper under the Indo-Sri Lankan FTA. A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting held in New Delhi on May 9 when these 100% export oriented companies approached DGFT for permission to import a total quantity of 17,254 tonnes.
However, the Commerce Ministry has allowed only the yearly quota of 2,500 tonnes as per the FTA norms with a specific direction that imports should be carried out as per the MIP notification at prices not less than Rs 500/kg. These 78 companies which process and re-export will get 32 tonnes each. A single company has filed application to import 2,500 tonnes while three applicants for 1,000 tonnes each.
In the applications, these companies have to show an agreement clause with a Sri Lankan exporter against which only the DGFT will issue license, trade sources said. Smuggling in large quantities as well as official imports of 300 tonnes at below MIP in April had hit prices. Any improvement can happen only if illegal routes are plugged, trade sources said. However, spice exporters pointed out that MIP notification has not helped improve Pepper prices in the domestic market with the rates moving southwards and hovering at Rs 360-380/kg depending on the grades.
