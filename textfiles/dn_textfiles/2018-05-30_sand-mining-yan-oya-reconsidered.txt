Priority given to safeguard environment, reservoir project...
Sand mining in Yan Oya reconsidered

Mining sand at the Yan Oya sand deposit in the Anuradhapura Wahalkada Division will be recommenced only after getting the assurance that sand excavating will not pollute environment, damage the Yan Oya Reservoir and its main dam, the Wahalkada tank, its irrigation structures and the regional roads system, experts say.
They said they have submitted their proposals in this regard to the President.
A Senior Engineer at the Yan Oya Reservoir Project said the sand mining at the Yan Oya was suspended on the instructions of the President since the mining was carried out recklessly. Sand mining authorities carried out the mining following the instructions given by the sand mining contractors, he said.
Many miners did not adhere to three metre depth excavation limit and had not refilled and levelled the pits they made in the process. Several progress review forums had pointed out the destructive sand mining methods that these miners employed which would jeopardize the Yan Oya Reservoir and its structures.
The official said the rules and regulations in the Environmental Impacts Assessment Studies report No. 08/EIA/Water/01/2001 had been breached damaging the forest cover around 4,000 hectare.
Wahalkada and Omarakada residents pointed out that the project should be finished before recommencing the sand mining.
The Yan Oya Reservoir Project is yet to be completed. Compensation for the lands acquired for the project has not been settled yet and alternative muddy lands have not been demarcated for the residents for them to recommence their livelihoods.
