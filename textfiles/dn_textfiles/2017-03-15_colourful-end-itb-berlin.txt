Colourful end to ITB Berlin

Around 10,000 exhibitors from 187 countries and territories exhibited the latest products and trends of the global tourism industry on 1,069 stands at the ITB Berlin that ended last week.
Sri Lanka's first own travel fair,'Gateway to South Asia 2017' was launched at the ITB Berlin by the Minister of Tourism Development, Lands and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga.
In a ground breaking move, the Public Relations team of Sri Lanka Tourism launched a special programme at the Sri Lanka Pavilion to attract top journalists and bloggers to Sri Lanka.
Under the visiting journalists and bloggers programme of Sri Lanka Tourism, high profile journalists will be invited to Sri Lanka on fully sponsored familiarization tours in return for media coverage in international publications.
