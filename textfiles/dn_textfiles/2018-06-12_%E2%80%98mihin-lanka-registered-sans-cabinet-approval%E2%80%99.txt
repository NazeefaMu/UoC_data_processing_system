‘Mihin Lanka registered sans Cabinet approval’

Mihin Lanka had been registered in 2007 unapproved by the Cabinet or the Finance, Defence and Civil Aviation Ministries.
When Registrar of Companies Ranjan Siriwardena was questioned by Commission President retired Supreme Court Judge Anil Gooneratne and its member retired Court of Appeal Judge A, G, R, Amarasekera, they said that appointment of Mihin Linka first Board of Directors was illegal.
The Registrar of Companies giving evidence before the Commission said that establishing a company on behalf of the government without a Cabinet approval and appointing public servants to it is illegal.
Evidence was led by Additonal Solicitor General Neil Unambuwa.
