More UPFA MPs will join us soon – Kirella

Some more parliamentarians from the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) will join the government very soon and they will contest the next election with the UNP, Public Enteprise, Kandyan Heritage and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was speaking at the press briefing held in Kandy yesterday.
Those who joined the government from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) did not expect ministerial portfolios. They joined us for new political journey, the Minister said.
The Minister said that many thought that UNP will split when the Ranil Wickemesinghe was removed from the Prime Minister post. But UNP strengthened and produced some more new leaders for the future, he said.
The Minister said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the most likely presidential candidate from the party.
