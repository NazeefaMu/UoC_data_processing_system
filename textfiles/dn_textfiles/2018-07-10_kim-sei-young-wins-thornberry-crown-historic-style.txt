Kim Sei-young wins Thornberry crown in historic style

Los Angeles, Monday: South Korean Kim Sei-young smashed the LPGA 72-hole scoring record Sunday, winning the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic with a stunning 31-under par total.
Kim, 24-under to start the day, fired a final-round seven-under par 65 on the par-72 Thornberry course in Oneida, Wisconsin.
Her 31-under total of 257 broke the LPGA's 72-hole scoring record in relation to par of 27-under, first set by Swedish great Annika Sorenstam in 2001 and matched by Kim herself at the 2016 Founders Cup in Phoenix.
She also broke the record for fewest strokes over 72 holes of 258, achieved by Karen Stupples in 2004 and matched by Angela Stanford and Park Hee-Young in 2013.
"I really feel, like, unreal," Kim said. "I never thought about shooting, like, 31-under. I really feel incredible."
But the 25-year-old knew setting out on Sunday that she was within striking distance of the record, giving herself a goal of playing the final round without a bogey.
"I was feeling a little bit of different than the third round because a little bit of pressure," Kim admitted. "I thought about how do you handle nerves today. Then I set my goals, just kept relaxed -- except the last three holes I couldn't control the nerves because it was almost done, but I finished really good."
Kim's only blemish all week was a double bogey at the par-three 17th on Friday. – AFP
