President may reconvene Parliament before Nov 16 - PM

President Maithripala Sirisena may reconvene Parliament before November 16, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa announced yesterday.
Prime Minister Rajapaksa made this disclosure during a discussion held with university academics yesterday at the Prime Minister’s Office.
The President had originally prorogued Parliament for 11 days until November 16. The relevant Extraordinary Gazette Notification was published by the Presidential Secretariat on October 27.
“Providing relief needed for the people is the key priority of our Government. We are committed to provide all necessary facilities to uplift the living standards of ordinary people,” Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
Prime Minister Rajapaksa said people who have suffered a lot during the past three years due to heavy financial burdens, expect more relief from the present Government. Improper taxation had resulted in this situation.
The Prime Minister said the Stock Market indicates positive trends which means that both local and foreign investors remain confident in the measures taken by the new Government to reinstate economic stability.
“Soon after I made a statement regarding the current economic situation of the country after assuming duties as the Finance Minister, three wheeler charges were reduced. This is a good sign,” he added.
When the university lectures inquired about PM’s view on the estate workers’ salary hike, the Prime Minister said he had discussed with both estate owners and workers and pledged to take a fair decision.
“Those who depend on NGO funds are trying to give a wrong image of the current situation to the international community and now the time has come to make the international community aware about the real situation.”
The Premier stressed the importance of going for an election as soon as possible.
University academics pledged their fullest support to the Prime Minister to restore social, political and economic stability. Prof G.L. Peiris also spoke.
