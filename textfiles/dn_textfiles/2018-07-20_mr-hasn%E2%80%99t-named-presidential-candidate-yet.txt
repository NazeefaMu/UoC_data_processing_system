MR hasn’t named Presidential candidate yet

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday issued a media release to clarify a statement attributed to him, via a forged document, purporting to be a media release from his office.
He said that a forged document purporting to be a media release issued by his office was in circulation in the social media on Wednesday.
This forged media release stated that the former President has officially selected the former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to be the next Presidential candidate in 2020.
While refuting the allegation, he stated that he has not yet named the next Presidential candidate of the SLPP and it will only be done by him personally at a public gathering.
“We wish to inform the public that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has not yet named the next Presidential candidate of the SLPP. This forged media release has been planted in the social media after the former President left for Singapore. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa wishes to state that when he names the next presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and the Joint Opposition, it will not be through a media release but will be done personally by him at a public gathering,” the clarification said.
Meanwhile, former defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in statement posted on his official Facebook page said a fake media release circulating in social media, purported to be from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, claiming to have appointed him as the Presidential candidate for 2020, is totally inaccurate and is an attempt by certain parties to mislead and confuse the people and political stakeholders.
