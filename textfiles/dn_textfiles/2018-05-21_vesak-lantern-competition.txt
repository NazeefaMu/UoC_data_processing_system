Vesak Lantern Competition

In a bid to celebrate Vesak, encourage creativity and comradery, Cinnamon Grand held its annual Inter-department Vesak Lantern Competition recently, calling all departments to put forward their best ideas in designing colourful and meaningful lanterns.
Twelve departments took part in this competition, which saw innovative and creative lanterns on display. Team Banquets was declared winners, while team F&B received second place. Third place was shared by two teams, Laundry and Kitchen Stewarding. Many of the creations werebrought to life using old decorations and other items in a bid to reduce and recycle waste.The winning entry from team Banquests used materials from their own operations such as used bottle caps, corks and other items that would otherwise have been thrown away. Banquets is one of the busiest departments in the Hotel, and the team took the extra effort amongst their daily duties to create their magnificent lantern.
All teams were also awarded prizes in recognition of their participation and hard work, which took place amidst the day-to-day activities of the Hotel.
The competition was judged by the Sector team, which comprised of Sector Head, City Sector and General Manager, Rohan Karr, Head of Human Resources City Sector, Sujeeva Cooray, Manager Compliance, Health and Safety City Sector, Rajitha Amarasinghe and Head of Finance, City Sector, Shanaka Silva. All the creations are currently on display at the Hotel’s Courtyard lobby.
