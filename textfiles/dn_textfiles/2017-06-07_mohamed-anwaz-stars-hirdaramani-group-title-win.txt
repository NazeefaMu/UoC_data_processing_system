The 23rd over was bowled by Stafford’s, most experienced all rounder, Asantha Singappuli. Zahran, who took over from Villegoda, hit the day lights out of Singappuli hitting him for 03 massive sixes in the 3rd, 4th & 05th deliveries and a sizzling 04 in the final ball, thus propelling the total from 120 for 4 to 147 for 4, now needing only 05 runs in 12 balls.
The never say die, Amila Mendis bowled the 24th over as 02 wickets fell rapidly with just 01 run added to the score – 148 for 6.

In the process, Zahran managed to scramble through to the strikers end. Shanaka Sampath sent down a full toss in his 3rd delivery and Zahran sent the ball packing to the fence as he leveled the scores at 152 each. The 4th delivery was a dot ball. Zahran drove the 5th ball through mid off to give Hirdaramani a historic 02 wickets win as he remained unbeaten on 28 in 08 balls, inclusive of 03 sixes and equal number of fours.
