Pollution by pilgrims drastically reduced in Sri Pada this season

Bringing non degradable items such as plastics, polythene wrappings, bags and other material by pilgrims visiting Sri Pada has decreased by almost 40 percent this pilgrim season, according to the OIC of the Nallathanniya Police station Inspector Anil Prasanna Jayasinghe and Nuwara Eliya district Administrative PHI Gamini Perera.
They said even those bringing these non degradable items dispose properly into the garbage bins placed along the path as a result of the successful awareness programmes conducted by the police and other authorities and media publicity programmes.
He said very few pilgrims bring along liquor or visit under the influence of liquor this season. They had received very constructive support in this programme of keeping the environs of Sri Pada clean from the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha.
