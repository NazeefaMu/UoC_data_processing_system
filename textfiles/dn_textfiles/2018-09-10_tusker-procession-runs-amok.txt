Tusker in procession runs amok

The tusker taking the casket in the annual procession of the Bambawa Raja Maha Viharaya in Matale had run amok and attempted to attack its mahout on Saturday (8) night .
The people who gathered there to view the procession had run away injuring 10 spectators including a monk. They were admitted to the Galewela Divisional Hospital and three were transferred to the Dambulla Base Hospital later. The eye-witnesses said the mahout was drunk and the tusker attempted to attack him.
Then a man taking a firebrand ran leaving it beside the tusker. It had stepped on it and rampaged. It was controlled by other mahouts. The temple authority stoped the procession after the incident. Galewela police are investigating.
