Wrungness in translation

Ursula Andkjær Olsen is one of Denmark’s most important contemporary poets. A poets’ poet and a critics’ darling, she won the prestigious literary award Montanaprisen in 2013 for her 214-page poem Det 3. årtusindes hjerte (Third-Millennium Heart), from a judging committee who hailed Olsen as “one of the wildest and sharpest intellects in Danish contemporary poetry.”
In 2015 Olsen’s sequel to Third-Millennium Heart, a book-length “mirror poem” titled Udgående Fartøj (Outgoing Vessel), received the Danish Critics’ Prize from a committee who described the poetic work as “an eruption of anger and a philosophical manifesto, a wail and a hymn, an interrogation of metaphysics, a critique of our age, and a future utopia.”
Voice and form
Last year, my translation of Third-Millennium Heart was co-published by Broken Dimanche Press and Action Books in the US. Continuing from where Third-Millennium Heart left off, Outgoing Vessel is written in the same voice and form, and with a similar structure: a series of poetic suites that all make up one large poem, with a ritualistic repetition of certain lines and images.
One literary critic noted in the Danish broadsheet Politiken that “while Third-Millennium Heart was about grief and capitalism, Outgoing Vessel is about grief and science fiction. The grieving over multiple abortions, which gave Third-Millennium Heart its wild depth, is still there; however, in Outgoing Vessel, grief has become a hard orb, hidden far inside the speaker’s ‘distant interior.’ In there, utopian hopes of change loom.” When offered to translate Olsen’s poetry into English three years ago, I was both excited and terrified. In addition to experiments with puns, syntax, and neologisms, her work contained a multitude of subtle cultural, scientific, and mythological references—and had largely been deemed untranslatable for these very reasons. As I launched—or rather fell—into translating Olsen’s poetry, I first discovered how difficult it was to render her use of voice.
Icy and cynical
The speaker in both collections is an ambiguous character: abusive yet a victim; fiercely emotional yet icy and cynical.
In order to find this narrative voice in translation, I picked ten poems from completely different parts—or should I say temperaments—of Third-Millennium Heart and tried to find a sort of median tone. I went through at least fifteen drafts of those ten initial poems before finding a voice I was satisfied with.
Compared to Third-Millennium Heart, the pleasures and perils of translating Outgoing Vessel are exactly the same. For instance, I chose to transform and (mis)translate many of Third-Millennium Heart’s capitalism-neologisms in order to make them more impactful (or just more fun) in English.
A neologism such as væksthund (direct translation: growth-dog) became a “charging bulldog” in my version, replacing “growth” with Wall Street’s Charging Bull, an American symbol of aggressive financial optimism and prosperity. In another case, I seized an opportunity to translate matriarkatet (the matriarchy) to “the matriarchate,” which denotes matriarchy and connotes the (free) market as well as Mother Market, a concept/character introduced in the same poem.
Similar neologisms and opportunities for wordplay in translation populate the pages of Outgoing Vessel, excerpted in this issue of WLT.
