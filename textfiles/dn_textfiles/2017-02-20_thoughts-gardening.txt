Thoughts on gardening

Earth laughs in flowers.
-Ralph Waldo Emerson
No ray of sunlight is ever lost, but the green it wakes into existence needs time to sprout, and it is not always granted to the sower to live to see the harvest.
All work that is worth anything is done in faith.
-Albert Schweitzer
The greatest fine art of the future will be the making of a comfortable living from a small piece of land.
-Abraham Lincoln
When the world wearies and society fails to satisfy, there is always the garden.
-Minnie Aumonier
The love of gardening is a seed once sown that never dies.
-Gertrude Jekyll
It didn’t occur to me that… that gardening, like music, could demand practice, patience, a willingness to make mistakes.
-Amy Stewart
The garden, historically, is the place where all the senses are exploited. Not just the eye, but the ear – with water, with birds. And there is texture, too, in plants you long to touch.
-William Howard Adams
Gardening simply does not allow one to be mentally old, because too many hopes and dreams are yet to be realized.
-Allan Armitage
Gardening is akin to writing stories. No experience could have taught me more about grief or flowers, about achieving survival by going, your fingers in the ground, the limit of physical exhaustion.
-Eudora Welty
All gardeners know better than other gardeners.
-Chinese Proverb
