No plans to change school uniform - President

President Maithripala Sirisena says the government has not taken any decision to make any changes to the school uniform.
He was participating in the annual prize giving ceremony of the Sri Chandrananda Buddhist College, Asgiriya.
“The education system centered on the Pirivena and temples nourished the then Sri Lankan society with human values and rich moral habits,” the President said. He said all the religious leaders should commit themselves to build a society which closely associates with religious places.
President Sirisena said the social media websites and Facebook are degenerating moral values of the children in today’s society. He said the discipline of the children should be built along with their education. The President said various attempts are being made through the internet and some media institutions to spread disharmony among communities and to instigate unrest.
When he asked Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith regarding a statement made by a person during an interview with a private news channel that 166 Catholic churches were attacked during the past few months, the Archbishop said such incidents were not reported, the President said.
The President said he vehemently reject such statements made by some persons misleading society.
He presented certificates and awards for the students who performed outstandingly at the school.
The Maha Sangha including Mahanayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana, Anu Nayaka of Malwathu Chapter Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera, Principal of the School Ven. Dr. Godagama Mangala Thera, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, S. B. Dissanayake, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and many others participated.
