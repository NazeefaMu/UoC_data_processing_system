Sri Lanka smash Kenya by record margin of 311 runs:
Boyagoda makes highest-ever U19 ODI score

CHRISTCHURCH, Tuesday: A dominant batting performance from Sri Lanka, built around a staggering 191 from Hasitha Boyagoda, saw them record the highest U19 ODI score in their history, and the fourth-highest for all teams, to help them crush Kenya by 311 runs, the joint-second biggest winning margin in Under 19 ODI history
It would be remiss to start anywhere else than with Boyagoda, whose innings broke Jakob Bhula’s record for the highest score in an Under 19 ODI, made just six days previously against the same opposition.
From a ‘proper cricket’ point of view, it was as close to a perfect innings as you’ll see. The pacing was sublime, Boyagoda first taking advantage of the PowerPlay restrictions, racing away to his half-century in just 39 balls, then taking stock in the middle overs, before accelerating towards the end, and the technique too was up there with the best we’ve seen this tournament; despite the strike-rate, this was no mad dash or slog-fest – indeed, he struck just two sixes – with Boyagoda instead relying on the virtues of timing and placement, his off-side front-foot strokeplay catching the eye in particular.
Support wasn’t in short supply either, with all of Sri Lanka’s top six making at least 29 and striking at above 100. Nishan Madushka’s 60 was the next top score, but the most attention-grabbing period came after Boyagoda was dismissed as captain Kamindu Mendis and Nawanidu Fernando added 80 runs in just under six overs. Mendis especially was exceptional, bringing up his fifty from just 21 balls on the last ball of the innings, his knock containing one absolutely enormous six which flew miles over midwicket.
For Kenya, this was a fourth chastening stint in the field in succession. They have been on the receiving end of five centuries, two of them world record innings, two 400-plus scores, a 40-ball 90, and a 21-ball 53. They could have been forgiven for throwing away their wickets in a bid for an early finish and in the face of an impossible target, and it is to their credit that, for the fourth time in a row, they didn't choose to.
There was never any pretence of trying to chase the runs as Kenya chose the deadbat route, but Sri Lanka stuck at their task manfully, eventually dismissing their opposition for 108 after 36 overs of toil, securing victory and passage to the Plate Semi-Final to face Zimbabwe.
 
 
 
 Sri Lanka, Australia smash U19 World Cup records
The best figures and the highest individual score in U19 CWC history we're taken yesterday. Here are the key stats from a record-breaking day.
* 8/35 - Lloyd Pope's figures against England, the best-ever in an U19 CWC, surpassing Jason Ralston's 7/15 against Papua New Guinea, remarkably taken in Australia's last game in the tournament just four days ago. They are the second best figures in all U19 ODIs, behind Irfan Pathan's 9/16 against Bangladesh in Lahore in 2003.
* 127 - The second lowest total Australia have successfully defended in an U19 ODI; they successfully defended 122 against New Zealand in the 2000 U19 CWC. It is seventh on the list overall.
* 191 - Hashitha Boyagoda's innings against Kenya, the best in all U19 ODIs, surpassing Jakob Bhula's 180, made just six days ago against the same opposition for New Zealand.
* 30 - Boundaries in Boyagoda's innings (28 fours, two sixes), the most in any U19 ODI innings.
* 252.38 - Kamindu Mendis' strike rate during his unbeaten innings of 53 from 21 balls, the third-highest in an U19 ODI for a score of fifty or more. Top of the list is Rishabh Pant's 24-ball 78 against Nepal during the 2016 U19 CWC.
* 419/4 - Sri Lanka's team score against Kenya, their highest, and the fourth highest in all U19 ODIs.
* 311 - Sri Lanka's margin of victory against Kenya, the joint-second highest of all time, along with Australia's victory over PNG just four days ago. The highest is Australia's 430 run victory over Kenya during the 2002 ICC U19 CWC.
* 10.83 - Jasraj Kundi's economy rate against Sri Lanka, the third-worst in a spell of six or more overs in the U19 CWC. Sachin Bhudia's economy rate of 10.50 puts him seventh on the list.
* 279 - The target chased by West Indies, their second-highest successful chase in an U19 ODI, behind their pursuit of 292 against Sri Lanka in New Zealand in 2010.
