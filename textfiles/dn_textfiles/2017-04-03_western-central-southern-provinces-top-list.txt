Western, Central, Southern provinces top the list

Schools in the Western, Central and Southern Provinces top the list with regard to human rights violation complaints received on Grade One admissions, said Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission Chairman Dr Deepika Udugama. She said repeated complaints are received against some of these schools every year. Addressing a press conference at the Keppetipola hall, Kandy Dr Udugama said 80 complaints had been received against schools in the Central Province this year.
A report had been submitted to the Education Ministry after conducting investigations into them. Separate investigations are being held in respect of each school and principals are informed about them.
Dr Udugama said most human rights complaints are received against the police, education sector and against the administration.
Referring to parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa’s question, she said it cannot be considered as a subject for a human rights violation case. A human rights case could be filed if it was concerning an executive or administrative injustice.
Granting of bail was a decision of court and the Human Rights Commission had no powers to act on judicial decisions.
