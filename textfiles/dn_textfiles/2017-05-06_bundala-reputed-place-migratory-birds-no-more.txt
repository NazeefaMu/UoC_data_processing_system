Bundala, the reputed place for migratory birds no more

Bundala which was a haven for migratory and resident birds is now being frequented by wild elephants and as such nature lovers and bird enthusiasts do not consider Bundala as a bird watching location, the residents of the area said. They said that they derived a sound income from the bird watchers in the past but now only a few bird watchers arrive here as such their income has decreased.
When queried about this situation the Assistant Director of Wild Life Southern region Prasanna Wimaladasa said, Bundala is a wetland that has gained wide reputation around the globe, and a haven for resident and migratory birds, but today as a result of flowing of excess water of the Malala Aaara into the Bundala lagoon. A scarcity of food for the migratory and resident birds has been created and as such the resident and migratory birds keep away from the Bundala lagoon. The Assistant Director further said that as a result of wild elephants in large numbers, the birds are scared to roam about in the Bundala bird sanctuary.
