Parents up in arms as SLTA fires foreign tennis coach

The bosses of Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) have been at loggerheads with the parents of tennis players after they announced the firing of the Association’s foreign head coach Eric Peterson.
With the SLTA higher-ups giving notice of early contract termination to coach Peterson, who was hired from Netherlands on a two-year contract to take charge of tennis players in Sri Lanka, the parents of tennis players training under Peterson, have openly expressed their anger and frustration to SLTA bosses about it.
“We have been unnerved by the decision of the SLTA managers. Over and above, the children too are upset about it,” a parent said.
“The players have been making tremendous progress under coach Peterson when they handed the termination letter to him,” a parent said. (Most parents talked to us on conditions of anonymity).
Meanwhile, coach Peterson has more than a year left on his contract.
Since Peterson’s ascent as SLTA head coach, the local players have won more than 20 Asian Tennis Federation Cups. The players have won Asian Tennis Federation championships in under 12, 14, 10 and 16 categories in less than eight months. Lankan players became runners up in the women’s doubles at the Asian Games training along with him.
Tennis parent Suchitra Alexander, former Sri Lankan cricketer who captained the Sri Lankan Under 19 side during the tour of England, said SLTA’s sudden decision to forfeit its own tennis program involving an international tennis coach of the caliber of Peterson, a man who loves the labour of his trade is still unclear to him.
“The decision came out of the blue without a conversation or meeting being held with any of the stakeholders,” he said.
Another parent blamed SLTA for firing the head coach at a time he has shown tremendous progress with the players. “He has made such a big difference to the players. He was so close to bringing the players to the top of the game,” she said.
SLTA secretary Pradeep Gunasekera when questioned about this decision to terminate the coaching program involving Peterson said, “We are unable to sustain the program.”
“The Association has been incurring a loss of about Rs 200,000 per month over the program,” he explained.
On being pointed out that it was they who brought Peterson to SLTA on a two-year contract, Gunasekera said, “There are performance issues as well. We have observed that some players were dropping, and they were dropping one by one.”
Most tennis parents blamed SLTA officials for not discussing the matters with them. Asked if SLTA must communicate its administrative decisions to them, a parent said, “We pay 60 percent of the cost of the program. They should have made us aware.”
Parents said they once saw head coach Peterson was denied entry into SLTA premises on the orders of SLTA officials. The security guards locked the gate preventing his entry. After all he is a tennis coach of international fame. This is no way to treat foreign coaches, they said.
When we met SLTA officials to discuss matters they were giving various evasive answers about the future of the game.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera had participated in one such meeting. After listening to both SLTA officials and the parents, the Minister is said to have agreed to extend a sum of Rs. 200,000 from his ministry’s monthly to sustain the program for six more months.
However, SLTA bosses are keen on carrying out their decision of ousting Peterson. He continues to conduct tennis lessons while SLTA officials have reportedly appointed a new tennis head coach who, according to parents, is not qualified to handle that job. He is not even a full-time coach.
Sources close to SLTA said many tennis gear and equipment, including tennis balls, string reels, sporting apparels such as T-shirts supplied to SLTA by international organizations such as the Asian Tennis Federation and countries, such as France have gone to waste lying idle at the SLTA.
Some on this equipment are being sold fraudulently to outsiders, they said.
SLTA president Iqbal Bin Ishak categorically denied that there have been such instances.
“Some parents are canvassing to retain Eric Peterson as the head coach of the SLTA. Our decision to terminate him as the head coach of the association is one reason for it. But there have never been problems of the sort,” he said.
Meanwhile former tennis players and observers of the game pointed out, the main problem of the SLTA is that it does not have a player pool. There are no key gauges for player evaluation in the SLTA hence some players get undue passage to play some games while others get none.
They went onto suggest that a proper audit should be conducted into the SLTA.
