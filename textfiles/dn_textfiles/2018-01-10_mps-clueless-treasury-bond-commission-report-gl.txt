MPs clueless on Treasury Bond Commission report : GL

SLPP leader Prof. G.L.Peiris asked the government how Parliamentarians can debate the Central Bank Treasury Bond Commission report as they have not received the report yet.
“If Parliament is summoned to debate the Treasury Commission report, the MPs should receive the commission report before hand”, Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday Peiris said the Prime Minister has asked for a debate in Parliament, but parliamentarians have not received the report.Nobody knows what the report contains, he said.
He further said UNP MPs and SLFP MPs criticise each other without abdicating their collective responsibility.
