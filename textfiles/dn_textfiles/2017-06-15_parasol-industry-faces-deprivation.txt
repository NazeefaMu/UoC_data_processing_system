Parasol industry faces deprivation

Parasol (sesath) industry in Matale District, a traditional industry in the country, is currently in a deplorable state owing to the lack of raw materials.
Unweruwa village located in Yatawatta area of Matale District is the only parasol-manufacturing village in the country. More than 70 families are engaged in this business at the moment.
Mica is the main raw material for this purpose, but authorities are not providing them permits for transportating this material. At present, mica is available in Rattota. Under the existing situation, the craftsmen have to transport the mica through illegal means It is a setback to this industry.
The parasols are needed for state and national ceremonies, while it is used for some special occasions as well.
There is a considerable demand for parasols, however, under the prevailing situation, people are unable to produce the sufficient stocks due to lack of materials.
