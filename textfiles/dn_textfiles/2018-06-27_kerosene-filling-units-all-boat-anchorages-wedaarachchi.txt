Kerosene filling units for all boat anchorages: Wedaarachchi

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, addressing a gathering of state officials, said that every boat anchorage in the island would be installed with kerosene filling units for the benefit of low-income fisherfolk.
He said that ornamental fish-breeding as well as lobster and prawn-breeding would be boosted as there was a big demand for them in the international market.
Minor tanks in every district would be renovated to boost the fresh water fish industry, the minister said, adding that industries connected to the fishing industry would also be provided assistance and incentives. Newly-appointed District Secretary Bandula Harischandra was also present.
