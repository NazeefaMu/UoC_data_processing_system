DHL Express offers innovative delivery options in Sri Lanka

DHL Express, the world’s leading international express services provider, today announced the launch of a new innovative DHL Locker. This is part of its global On Demand Delivery service offering, providing customers with an innovative and convenient option to pick up their online shopping packages.
With On Demand Delivery, shippers can choose to activate specific delivery options and have DHL Express proactively notify their customers via email or SMS about a shipment’s progress. Receivers can then select the delivery option that best suits their requirements via the On Demand Delivery mobile-optimized website. The service offers flexibility and convenience and caters to the demands of international online shoppers who do not want to miss a delivery when away from home by enabling shipments to be sent to an alternate address or stored temporarily at a designated collection point.
Recognized as the pioneer in the Express industry, DHL Express Sri Lanka is the only international express company in the country to offer DHL Lockers as a complementary service to online shoppers.
“With the ever-increasing growth of e-commerce in Sri Lanka, the DHL Locker will become a recognizable and important part of the online shopping experience. Restating our commitment to the Sri Lankan market via maintaining DHL’s strong reputation and customer service levels, this new convenient delivery option enables receiving online packages quickly and simply with the value addition of easy collection access,” said Dimithri Perera, Country Manager, DHL Express Sri Lanka.
Customers can now pick up their package at any time, even beyond normal operating hours from the DHL Locker, which is located at the Link Way between Cinnamon Grand Hotel and the Crescat Boulevard.
