New Commission to increase public sector salaries

The Government will appoint a Special Salaries Commission to make recommendations to increase salaries of the public sector. The Commission will also do away with salary anomalies reported in certain public sector institutions including the Railways Department.
The Cabinet gave its approval to appoint this Salaries Commission on a recommendation made by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday. The Salaries Commission will pay attention and make an in-depth study on the provisions of the existing circulars dealing with payment of salaries and other allowances paid to public sector employees and will make recommendations to the government within the next two months.
