Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana selects lucky winners

Unilever’s iconic beauty brand Lux, who catapulted themselves into the new year with yet another innovative promotion guaranteed to ignite the Lux spark in the hearts and minds of its consumers.
‘Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana’, saw 25 lucky winners being the recipient of an iconic piece of jewellery which was specially designed for the Suwadaka Siwu Abarana’promotion by jewellery designer Harshini.
A former Miss Sri Lanka and no novice to the allures of beauty and femininity that Lux embodies, Harshini succeeded in creating a truly unique piece of jewellery that can be worn as it is, or as a pendant, a pair of earrings as well as a ring, and what’s more it contains a signature fragrance co-created by the winner! What more could a girl want? All these lucky winners were given a choice of the fragrance that went into their pendants from the lux fragrance collection.
In addition the winners were given the opportunity to join the team at Unilever for a fragrance testing session where they experienced the finest of fragrances that are brought to the consumer, only from Lux.
The fragrances were co-created exclusively by Lux’s Master perfumers, who took great pains to ensure that each fragrance was unique.
According to Lux Brand Manager Inura Jayasuriya, the current ‘Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana’ promotion is merely a foretaste of what is in store for Lux users.
“ Lux is now preparing for ground breaking innovations in fine fragrance skin cleansing products, to delight Sri Lankan consumers and we promise you a fine fragrance extravaganza hitherto not experienced here”.
The ‘Lux Suwadaka Siwu Abarana’ promotion which was launched in December 31, saw the night sky being lit not with stars but with giant French Roses in a magical display which was viewed in many cities across the country.
