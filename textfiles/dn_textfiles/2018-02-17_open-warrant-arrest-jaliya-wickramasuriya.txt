Open warrant to arrest Jaliya Wickramasuriya

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday re-issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrate’s Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the suspect was not present in Court. At a previous occasion the Court was informed through his counsel that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before the due date. The defence counsel said his client is still receiving treatment at a US hospital.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate yesterday issued open warrants for the arrest of two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya for failure to appear before court.
They had been warned that sureties would be liable for confiscation of bail amount if they failed to appear in court.
Two sureties including wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya were not present in court yesterday as well.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
