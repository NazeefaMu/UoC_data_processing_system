OVER 30 INJURED IN PANALIYA TRAIN COLLISION

Over 30 passengers were injured when the Rambukkana bound train rammed into the Colombo-Kandy train which was halted at Panaliya near the Polgahawela station yesterday evening.
The injured were rushed to the Polgahawela and Rambukkana hospitals and several passengers were in a critical condition.
Several of the critically injured commuters were transferred to the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.
According to a Sri Lanka Railways Spokesman, a technical fault may have caused the accident.
He added that a train plying from Colombo to Kandy had developed a technical fault and stopped at Panaliya near the Polgahawela Railway Station at around 4.30 p.m.
“The Rambukkana bound train which was travelling at high speed on the same track, had rammed into the Colombo bound train resulting in severe damage to the guard room compartment,” the Spokesman said.
Sri Lanka Railways General Manager S. M. Abeywickrema last night appointed a Committee comprising senior officials to conduct a full scale investigation into this accident. Anjali Ranasinghe who was on board the train told the Daily News that several passengers who were on the foot board were thrown out of the train.
“Even though the train did apply its brakes, it was only after the crash that it came to a halt,” it was reported.
