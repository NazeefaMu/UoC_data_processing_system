SLFP’s 66th anniversary at Campbell Park on Sept 2

The 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be held at Campbell Park on September 2 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, Minister Dissanayake said the SLFP is a powerful left wing political party which ruled the country for a long period.
“Though there is a crisis situation within the party, the SLFP has the strength to protect its supporters as well as the country,” he said.
The SLFP will take social, cultural and political decisions at the anniversary celebrations. The future vision of the party will also be put forward, he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist who asked whether the Joint Opposition has been invited for the anniversary, Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshaman Yapa Abeywardane said all the SLFP MPs can join the SLFP anniversary celebrations.
No invitation is required for SLFP Parliamentarians to participate at the anniversary celebrations, Minister Dissanayake said.
