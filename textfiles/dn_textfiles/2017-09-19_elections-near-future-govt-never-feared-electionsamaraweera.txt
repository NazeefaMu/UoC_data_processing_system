Elections in the near future: Govt never feared elections:Amaraweera

A series of elections will be held in the near future to enable people to exercise their votes at will. The government never feared to face elections despite contrary claims made by its opponents and detractors, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Amaraweera said what the government actually desired was to prevent the rivalry to gain preferential votes among candidates.
The government anxiously waited until such a system of elections was formulated in order to call for elections. Local government elections and several other elections will be held in the near future. Now people will get an opportunity to elect a representative for their own area, he said.
The minister was addressing a meeting at the Kalutara Assistant Fisheries Directors' office to mark the distribution of E-log books to owners of 55 multi-day boats, and housing and sanitation assistance to fisher families in the area on September 16.
Minister Amaraweera said the credit should go to President Maithripala Sirisena for ending the fight for preferential votes.
The Minister said although people expressed various views about the ‘Sil’ cloth case, the two public officials were found fault with not for distributing ‘Sil' cloths but for timing the distribution on the eve of an election to benefit a particular candidate.
Western Provincial Council’s Education Minister Ranjith Somawansa was also present on the occasion.
