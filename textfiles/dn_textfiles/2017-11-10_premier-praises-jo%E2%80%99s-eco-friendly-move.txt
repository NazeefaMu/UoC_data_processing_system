The Prime Minister was responding to a privilege issue raised by UPFA Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena that they were barred from entering the parliamentary complex by security officials. Gunawardena said they were obstructed by officials when they arrived in parliament on pushbikes. The MPs came to the parliamentary complex on bicycles and a bullock cart. Police officials on duty at the parliament entrance prevented them from entering.
Senior Parliament police officers who rushed to the scene allowed them to enter. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that he will look into the incident to ascertain whether the parliamentarians faced any obstructions at the entrance.
