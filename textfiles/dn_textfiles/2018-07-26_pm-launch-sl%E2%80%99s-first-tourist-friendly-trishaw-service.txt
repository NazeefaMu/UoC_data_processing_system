PM to launch SL’s first tourist-friendly trishaw service

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) will launch Sri Lanka’s first-ever tourist-friendly trishaw service on Monday, July 30, at Galle Face Green, under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The ‘tourist-friendly’ logo is a mark to distinguish high-quality tourism-related service providers in Sri Lanka. The initial rollout of this mark of high-quality service will be for trishaws in the Colombo district. Subsequently, it will also cover the rest of the island, including other major tourist cities.
Trishaw drivers who successfully completed the training programme will receive the logo and their certificates from the Prime Minister at the event. The logo and the branding will allow tourists to easily identify the tourist-friendly trishaws and obtain their services.
Over 750 trishaw drivers have so far been trained by the SLTDA, in several districts, under its tourist-friendly training programmes. All drivers who successfully complete the programme will get a special ID from the SLTDA, in addition to the tourist-friendly logo and the certification. The project is implemented under the 2018 budget proposals presented by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
The SLTDA said tourist-friendly programme will also cover eateries and homestays in the future, uplifting the quality and standards of the Sri Lankan tourism industry.
The event on July 30 will be the launch of the tourist-friendly logo and will also be attended by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
