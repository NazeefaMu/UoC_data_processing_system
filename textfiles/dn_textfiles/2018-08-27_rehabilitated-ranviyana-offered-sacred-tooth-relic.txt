Rehabilitated Ranviyana offered to Sacred Tooth Relic

The rehabilitated Ranviyana (Golden Canopy) of the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy was offered to the Sacred Tooth Relic by President Maithripala Sirisena at a ceremony held yesterday.
Rs. 45 million was used from the President’s Fund to rehabilitate the canopy. The Ranviyana was first built by the Late President, R. Premadasa, in 1987 as an offering to the Sacred Tooth Relic.
It was rehabilitated in 2002, too. Diyawadana Nimalame Pradeep Nilanga Dela requested the government to rehabilitate it about eight months ago since its golden covers got disfigured and the government responded to the request and rehabilitated it under the patronage of the Chief Prelates of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters.
Yesterday’s ceremony was attended by Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera and Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Provincial Ministers Ediriweera Weerawardena and Tilina Bandara Tennakoon and Kandy Mayor Kesara Senanayake.
