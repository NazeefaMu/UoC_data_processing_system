UK Minister Mark Field here on fact finding tour

UK’s State Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field has welcomed the Sri Lankan government’s commitment to reconciliation and strengthening democracy.
Field on the eve of his journey said that he was looking forward to talking with the government and affected communities about the additional steps that are needed to deliver long-term peace and stability for all Sri Lankans, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office statement said.
“The UK and Sri Lanka are longstanding friends, and we are committed to supporting Sri Lanka achieve its commitments on reconciliation and human rights,” Field said.
Field had also noted that having hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2013, Sri Lanka is an obvious partner in defining and driving a shared vision of the Commonwealth, to ensure it is fitted to deliver for all its member states into the future.
While commending the authorities and all those in Sri Lanka working hard to combat the Illegal Wildlife Trade Field had said he hope to encourage plans to conserve Sri Lanka’s unique and beautiful environment.
During his two day visit Field will meet Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran.
He will also meet with families affected by enforced disappearances from both the north and south of the country, and hear of their concerns and their hopes for the Office of Missing Persons.
In addition he will meet UK and Sri Lankan education institutions at the British Council to discuss education, and the UK’s world-leading role in transnational learning.
In north, the Minister will visit a UK-funded demining operation and meet families living on land cleared of mines. He will speak with British demining charity the Halo Trust and hear how UK support for demining has enabled displaced families to return home.
He will also visit the British Council teaching centre in Jaffna where he will talk with young people about their aspirations for the future and the importance of education.
