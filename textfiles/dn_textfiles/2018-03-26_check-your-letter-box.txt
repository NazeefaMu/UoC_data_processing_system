Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have finally sent out the 600 invitations to their eagerly anticipated May wedding after months of fevered anticipation.
Some 600 guests will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding service at St. George's Chapel before they all make their way to a lunchtime reception at St. George's Hall, which is being given by the Queen.
Later that evening, 200 guests are invited to the private reception at Frogmore House given by The Prince of Wales. The invitation stipulates a strict dress code with men asked to don military uniform - likely to be worn by Harry, a former soldier who is now Captain General of Royal Marines - or a morning coat and lounge hat, with women asked to wear a day dress and hat.
The invitations, posted this week, have been produced by company Barnard & Westwood, which has held a royal warrant for printing and bookbinding by appointment to the Queen since 1985.
Using American ink on English card, the invites feature printed italic writing and are issued under Charles's name and bear his heraldic feathers embossed in gold at the top. Each invitation was printed by Lottie Small, who recently completed her apprenticeship on a machine from the 1930s that she affectionately nicknamed 'Maude'.
The invitations are similar to the ones sent out for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011 - although these were in a different font and were issued with the Queen's royal cypher.
The invitations read: 'His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales KG KT requests the pleasure of the company of....... at the marriage of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales with Ms Meghan Markle at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday 19th May, 2018 at 12 Noon followed by a reception at Windsor Castle.'
The royal couple will marry at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19, with millions of people expected to watch around the world. They will then embark on a carriage procession around the Berkshire town, cheered by residents and visitors, before a reception at St. George's Hall. A smaller number of guests will join them at the evening receptions hosted by Prince Charles. The Queen will attend, as will the rest of the royal family, along with Markle's parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland.
Prince George and Princess Charlotte are likely to take on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid. The royal family is paying for the wedding, including the church service, the music, the flowers and the reception. But the security costs for the high-profile event are being covered by the state.
Harry proposed to Suits star Markle during a cosy night in over a roast chicken dinner after a 16-month whirlwind romance. In his engagement interview he told of how 'the stars were aligned' when he fell for his future wife, whom he met on a blind date.
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple and the Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service at the Castle's 15th century chapel.
