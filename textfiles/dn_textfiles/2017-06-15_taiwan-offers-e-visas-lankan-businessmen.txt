Taiwan offers e-visas for Lankan businessmen

In an effort to further deepen economic ties between Taiwan and Sri Lanka, Taiwan has streamlined the visa process for Sri Lankan travelers under its New Southbound Policy, the centerpiece of Taiwan’s international trade strategy.
Accordingly, e-visa applications have been made available for business travelers recommended by Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), branch offices starting from June. Tourist visas will also be open for applications, TAITRA President and CEO Walter Yeh said.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka –Taiwan Business Forum, held in Colombo yesterday. TAITRA organized a trade mission to Sri Lanka and held business events to promote partnerships in the IT, machinery, energy, textile, construction and many other sectors.
Yeh further noted that Taiwan is eyeing to further develop cooperation in information technology, agriculture, Smart city, green industries and tourism sectors in Sri Lanka.
In addition, TAITRA inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) in Taipei in April, 2017 to take the existing partnership between the two organizations into a new era and enable both parties to explore new ways to strengthen their trade promoting work and further Sri Lanka-Taiwan trade.
“FCCISL plays a leading role in promoting and enhancing the businesses and industries of Sri Lanka. TAITRA and FCCISL first signed a MoU back in 1995.”
According to Yeh, Sri Lanka is on the right path to higher growth and there is great potential for Sri Lanka-Taiwan business and industrial cooperation. He further added that improving Sri Lankan business environment and sound legal system will support greater foreign investments in the future.
