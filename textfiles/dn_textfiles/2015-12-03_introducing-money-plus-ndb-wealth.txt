Introducing 'Money Plus,' from NDB Wealth

Expert financial planner NDB Wealth introduces its innovative "Money Plus" account, an attractive alternative to savings accounts, as part of its all-new wealth planning solutions range.
The "Money Plus" account offers customers much higher rates in comparison to regular savings accounts, with an added unique feature of this innovative new product from NDB Wealth being that income is credited daily so one can see their savings grow day-by-day.
Additionally, "Money Plus" allows a customer the flexibility of depositing and withdrawing cash at any time, with no penalties. Also, the income earned from the "Money Plus" account is tax-free in the hands of the customers. NDB Wealth offers even more convenience for "Money Plus" customers via its 'at your doorstep' service and new, state-of-the-art, fully-secure website.
"'Money Plus' is simply more than banking," opines NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera.
However, most important of all, what is truly remarkable about NDB Wealth's "Money Plus" account is its earnings potential, with the current yield at 7%, which is much higher than savings accounts.
Commenting further, Samarasekera adds, "Most clients start with a basic savings product like the "Money Plus" and later go on to build more sophisticated plans, with the expertise and advice of the NDB Wealth team of relationship managers. These plans can include building a fund to educate your kids or provide for retirement savings."
