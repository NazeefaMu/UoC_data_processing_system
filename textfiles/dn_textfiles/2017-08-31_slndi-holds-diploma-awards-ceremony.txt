SLNDI holds diploma awards ceremony

The Sri Lanka National Design Institute (SLNDI), which is the education wing of the National Design Centre of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, held its Diploma Awards 2017 at the BMICH on August 30, under the patronage of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and State Minister Champika Premadasa.
The SLNDI which was set up in 1997 conducts two courses, National Diploma in Interior Design and Higher National Diploma in Interior Design, with the objective of producing professionals in the field of design.
The SLNDI provides opportunities for youth who have passed the GCE O Level and A Level to pursue a professional career. Thus far, the Institute had produced approximately 500 diploma holders. Ninety six students received their diplomas this year.
The Institute particularly provides a career path for youth who have missed the opportunity to enter university.
