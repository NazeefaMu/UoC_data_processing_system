Cornerstone laid for China-SL Water Technology Research Centre
'Integrated management, key to effective use of water'

The cornerstone ceremony for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology, which is to be built at a cost of Rs.2.83 billion at the University of Peradeniya, was held recently.
Yang Zuoyuan, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, said that the Chinese Government would provide a grant for the purpose, in order to help improve the health of Sri Lankan people as well as to ensure the quality of drinking water.
“We are convinced that in future, we will see a modern, high-quality water technology research and demonstration centre in Kandy, which will play a vital role in improving the expertise of water technology research in Sri Lanka,” Zuoyuan said.
He said that the construction of the project would be carried out by the China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group (CTCE), which was the flagship subsidiary of the China Railway Group: the world's second largest construction contractor.
“The CTCE developed its business in 20 countries around the world. I believe that it will complete the mission with success and make due contribution to the friendship between China and Sri Lanka,” he added.
He said that at present, the relations between China and the Sri Lanka had shown a sound momentum.
“The two sides maintain frequent and high-level exchanges and political mutual trust has been strengthened, while cooperation in various fields has been deepened. Sri Lanka is actively involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, which promotes the sustainable development of the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership,” Zuoyuan added.
City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary D.G.M.V. Hapuarachchi said that the issue of water and health was not limited to a country or a region; rather, it was a global concern and hence, was the responsibility of the world.
“Integrated water resource-management is the key to effective and optimum utilisation and preservation of this threatened and precious resource. Innovative solutions and appropriate technologies should be adopted to overcome funding constraints. Widely accepted water safety plans which could reach more people should be implemented in order to achieve more health benefits,” he said.
The City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board had taken steps to expand the water supply coverage in Sri Lanka to achieve a 60-percent target by 2020, the Secretary added.
He said that one of the key areas to be focused on with regard to coverage-expansion, was to address the drinking water issues of the people suffering from chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka was a burning issue as many cases were of unknown etiology. The disease had spread throughout 11 districts in Sri Lanka, mainly due to changes in various human activities, as well as environmental factors, Hapuarachchi said.
Over the past 30 years, it had become a major health issue. The disease was seen among farmers in the 40 to 60 age group. The impact it had on farmers affected the social and economic development of the country, and majority of researchers believed that the cause of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) was the consumption of contaminated water, he added.
The project called ‘China–Sri Lanka Collaborative Grant Research Project on CKDu’ was launched following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem and Chinese Academy of Sciences President Prof. Chunli Bai on March 26, 2015. That was the cornerstone of the China-Sri Lanka Research grant, he said.
