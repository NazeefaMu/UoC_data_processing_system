Lanka's total trade with Japan up threefold

Sri Lanka's robust economic growth and development policy provides enormous potential for further enhancement of economic relations between the two countries, especially in trade, investment and tourism, said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
Sri Lanka's total trade turnover with Japan has shown a threefold increase during the period of 2009-2014.
Keeping in line with the Economic Policy of the new Government, Sri Lanka offers a conducive, safe and stable environment to attract investment. This is, therefore, a high time for Japanese entrepreneurs to look at Sri Lanka, not only as an attractive business destination but also as a gateway to the entire South Asian region.
"Under the framework of the Memorandum of Cooperation on Vitalization of Inter-Governmental Economic Policy Dialogue signed between the two countries during the visit of Japanese Prime Minster Abe in September last year, we look forward to the convening of the first intergovernmental Economic Policy Dialogue between the two countries.
This is with a view to further expand bilateral trade, investment and economic engagement, Amunugama said addressing the gathering on the Japanese National day celebrated recently.
