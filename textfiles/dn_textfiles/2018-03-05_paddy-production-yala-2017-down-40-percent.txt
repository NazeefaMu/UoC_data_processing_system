Paddy production in Yala 2017 down 40 percent

An extensive decline in the total paddy production yielded for Yala season 2017 is shown in comparison to the same production in the previous Yala season, Department of Census and Statistics Director General Dr. A.J. Satharasinghe said in a press release.
The estimated value of total paddy production in Sri Lanka during Yala 2017 was 909,321 metric tons. The highest paddy production of 186,647 metric tons is reported from the Ampara district (21 percent of total paddy production). Polonnaruwa district reports a paddy production of 173,595 metric tons (19 percent) and Hambantota district 97,050 metric tons (11 percent).
However, when compared to paddy production in the prvious Yala season, the total paddy production in Yala season 2017 shows a substantial downward trend by 608,071 metric tons (40 percent). Drought is the possible reason for lower paddy production, which also led to paddy cultivation on a limited extent, lower average paddy yield than expected, and harvest losses in some districts.
Total extent of paddy cultivation for Yala season 2017 in Sri Lanka is estimated at 249,123 hectares, out of which 176,965 hectares (71 percent) was reported under major schemes, 42,537 hectares (17 percent) under minor schemes and 29,621 hectares under rain-fed schemes. The largest extent of paddy cultivated for this season is reported in the Ampara district (46,302 hectares), which is 19 percent of the total extent of paddy cultivation in the country.
Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa districts reported paddy cultivation of 40,882 hectares and 24,211 hectares respectively which is 16 percent and 10 percent of the total sown extent in Sri Lanka during this season. The gross extent harvested during Yala season 2017 in Sri Lanka is 236,479 hectares, which is 95 percent of the sown extent. Nuwara Eliya district, Udawalawa agricultural zone and Mannar district were identified as the districts which had harvested nearly the gross extent sown. These districts do not report any harvest losses. The minimum extent harvested from the gross extent sown is reported from the Puttalam district (40 percent).
The drought accounted for relatively high amount of harvest loss. The average paddy yield reported for Yala season 2017 is 4,291 kg per hectare and the highest average yield is reported from Udawalawa agricultural zone (5,770 kg per hectare).
