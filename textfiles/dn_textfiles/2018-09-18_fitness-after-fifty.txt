Fitness after fifty

“Proper exercising of the body by the middle-aged and the elderly can turn the ageing clock back by as many as 10 to 25 years. No matter at what age a person starts exercising, changes and improvements will occur. Even moderate exercises can retard the negative effects of ageing, and can also reverse them. They will improve heart and respiratory functions, increase muscle and bone strength, promote quicker reaction times and reduce susceptibility to stress and depression.” Such are the findings of a survey conducted by a research team in the University of Toronto, Canada, led by Professor Roy J. Shephard, an expert on Exercise and Ageing.
“Exercise is a fountain of youth. You do not have to run marathons to reap the benefits. Rapid walking for about 30 minutes at a time, three or four times a week can help you to become younger, feel younger and enjoy life as youth, once more,” says Professor Shephard inviting the senior citizens of the world to try the methodology. Thus the findings of the learned Professor and his expert team have contradicted, beyond doubt, the widespread belief that the elders can never improve physiologically, but show their decline instead.
Routine exercises
In another study by Dr. Herbert A de Vries, a pioneer in the use of exercise physiology to explore the process of ageing, conducted through over 300 men and women of 56 to 87 year age group, found after six weeks of routine exercises, that their blood pressure had dropped, body fat decreased, maximum oxygen transport increased and nervous tension diminished. In his research book “Fitness After Fifty” de Vries noted “men and women of 60 and 70 became as fit and energetic as those 20 to 30 years younger.”
Besides the aforesaid, even more recent studies have indicated that exercise can help delay most of the age-associated declines. It is because exercise lowers the resting heart rate and increases the amount of blood pumped with each beat in older people. Stress on bones through exercises sends the calcium levels high, which eventually helps to improve resistance to fractures. Nevertheless, exercising by the elderly is not without risk. According to Dr. Charles Godfrey, another Canadian specialist in Rehabilitation Medicine, jumping, jogging, rigorous running or brisk walking for longer hours for those over 50 years, may expose them to the possibility of causing self-inflicted injuries, even though exercise is the only way out so long as it is done methodically and scientifically.
Scientifically, there are three major types of exercises that help to achieve highest possible quality of life. First comes the Endurance type of exercise activities. The ideal activities in this type for most older people are brisk walking, swimming, cycling on a stationary bicycle or using a rowing machine. It is best to pursue one of more of them continuously for 30 minutes, three or four times a week. Any of them will help conditioning the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, thus fighting the occurrence of physical weaknesses due to ageing.
Strengthening exercises
Body and limb Strengthening exercises are the second type. Here, lightweights, hand and leg weights are used, beginning with very light weights and progressively increasing the weight used, as the exercise is continued three to four times a week.
While weight machines could also be used, exercises like single leg lifts, finger presses and bent-leg curl-ups could also be carried out. Within 7 to 10 months, increase in muscle strength from about 40 to 75 percent could be observed with such Strengthening exercises.
Third is the Flexibility type exercise, which has to be pursued on a daily basis for best results.
Here the single most important rule is stretching the muscles, ligaments and the tendons of the body. But one should be cautious each time it is being done to be slow and be mindful of the stretching act.
It is also necessary to remain in the stretched position for at least a count of ten and then relax for a moment before repeating the exercise again.
For safe pursuance of any exercise by older persons, Dr. de Vries suggests six steps to be followed, viz., seeing the Doctor for a medical check-up prior to start, making a slow start and increasing exertion gradually, knowing the limit not to over-do, exercising regularly avoiding times of ill-health, warming up before the start and cooling down after finishing.
“Today billions of people are walking, running, jogging, cycling and swimming their way to good health and fulfillment of life. Why not you join the fun?” asks Dr. de Vries addressing the older community of the world.
