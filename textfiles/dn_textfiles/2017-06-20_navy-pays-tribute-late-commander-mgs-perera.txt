Navy pays tribute to late Commander M.G.S. Perera

A memorial oration as a tribute to the late Instructor Commander M. G. S. Perera, on his birth centenary, entitled ‘Instructor Extraordinary,’ was delivered by Instructor Lieutenant Commander (Rtd.) Somasiri Devendra on June 2 at Admiral Somathilake Dissanayake Auditorium, Naval Headquarters, Colombo.
This was followed by the launch of the book ‘Teacher to the Navy,’ compiled by his son Dr. Ajith C.S. Perera and also its electronic version [goo.gl/qcduyX] by the Commander of the Navy.
It was organised by the Naval & Maritime Academy in Trincomalee (NMA) as a part of its golden jubilee anniversary.
The timely event was arranged in recognition and sincere appreciation of the dedicated outstanding contributions made and the untiring efforts put in over 23 years to the Navy by the late Commander Perera—NMA’s founding father and first Commandant—firstly in the establishment of formal Naval & Maritime training in the then Ceylon Navy (in June, 1952), thereafter, in turning an almost dying Navy (in the mid-60s) into the bold and victorious Navy as it stands today and thereafter, until the end of his life, to the country.
It was held in the presence of a distinguished gathering of elite personnel, most of the retired senior Naval Officers who had been nurtured and trained by Commander M.G.S. Perera over the period (1950 – 1970), starting with Admiral Basil Goonasekera and included the first two Commanders of the Navy produced by the NMA from its very first batch of officer cadets, Admiral Cecil Tissera (1997) and Admiral DayaSanadagiri (2001).
Also present on this occasion were Admiral (Rtd.) Mohan R. Samarasekera,the 20th Commander of the Army- General (Rtd.) Daya Rathnayaka, the Chief of Staff of Sri Lanka Navy Rear Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, Deputy Chief of Staff of Sri Lanka Navy Rear Admiral Neil Rosayro and flag rank officers of the Navy.
Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, the 8th consecutive Commander of the Navy produced by the NMA, was the Chief Guest.
