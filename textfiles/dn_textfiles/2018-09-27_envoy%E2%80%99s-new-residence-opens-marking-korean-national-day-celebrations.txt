Envoy’s new residence opens marking Korean National Day celebrations

The Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka will open the new residence of the Korean Ambassador and host the 2018 National Day reception on September 28.
The embassy will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Korean government, against the backdrop of the 3rd Inter-Korean Summit in Pyeongyang, the Korean Embassy stated in a release.
It is the first National Day reception since Ambassador Lee, Heon began his new post in January. Ambassador Lee, whose first post abroad was in Sri Lanka in the 1990s, came back as the Chief of Mission.
He will open the new residence at Horton Place.
In celebration of the Korean National Day, the embassy invites team ‘Meraki’, the winner of the fourth K-pop Festival organised by the embassy in July, to perform, the release stated.
The embassy has also organised other cultural events such as K-pop Festival, Quiz on Korea, Korean Film Festival, and the Taekwondo competition.
Korean and Sri Lankan companies will also participate in the ceremony to showcase their products in promotion booths. In November 2017, when President Maithripala Sirisena visited Korea, the two sides signed an agreement on economic cooperation. As a follow-up measure, Korea-Sri Lanka Joint Economic Commission was launched in Colombo in June. Bilateral ties are expected to deepen in the future with such initiatives, the release stated.
