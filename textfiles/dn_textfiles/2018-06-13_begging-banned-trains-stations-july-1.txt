Begging banned in trains, stations from July 1

Transport Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe told the Daily News that the Railways Department has decided to ban begging at railway stations and inside train compartments countrywide, with effect from July 1.
Many tourists and other commuters have made complaints to the transport ministry that they are being harassed by beggars who beg inside trains regularly.
Some beggars have stolen valuables from passengers while begging, it is reported. Some thieves also get into trains in the guise of beggars and have stolen valuables from commuters.
“Taking these problems into account, the Railways Department has decided to ban begging inside trains,” said Railway Department Additional General Manager Vijaya Samarasinghe.
