Navy assists to stop Ingiriya fuel spill

Naval personnel attached to the Sri Lanka Coast Guard prevented the fuel spill from a toppled fuel bowser belonging to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation at Madala in Ingiriya last Friday.
Timely measures were taken by the Navy personnel to block the drain which had led the spilled fuel to seep into the Kalu Ganga. Round-the-clock clean-up operations were carried out by SLCG personnel comprising two officers and 28 sailors. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board disconnected water supply to several areas following the accident.
The NWSDB said the situation was brought under control.
