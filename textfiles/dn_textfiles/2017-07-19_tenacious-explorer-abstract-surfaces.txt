A Tenacious Explorer of Abstract Surfaces

As a child growing up in Tehran, Mirzakhani had no intention of becoming a mathematician. Her chief goal was simply to read every book she could find:
As an 8-year-old, Maryam Mirzakhani used to tell herself stories about the exploits of a remarkable girl. Every night at bedtime, her heroine would become mayor, travel the world or fulfill some other grand destiny.
Today, Mirzakhani a 37-year-old mathematics professor at Stanford University, still writes elaborate stories in her mind. The high ambitions haven’t changed, but the protagonists have: They are hyperbolic surfaces, moduli spaces and dynamical systems. In a way, she said, mathematics research feels like writing a novel. “There are different characters, and you are getting to know them better,” she said. “Things evolve, and then you look back at a character, and it’s completely different from your first impression.”
The Iranian mathematician follows her characters wherever they take her, along story lines that often take years to unfold. Petite but indomitable, Mirzakhani has a reputation among mathematicians for tackling the most difficult questions in her field with dogged persistence. “She has a fearless ambition when it comes to mathematics,” said Curtis McMullen of Harvard University, who was Mirzakhani’s doctoral adviser.
With her low voice and steady, gray-blue eyes, Mirzakhani projects an unwavering self-confidence. She has an equal tendency, however, toward humility. Asked to describe her contribution to a particular research problem, she laughed, hesitated and finally said: “To be honest, I don’t think I’ve had a very huge contribution.” And when an email arrived in February saying that she would receive what is widely regarded as the highest honor in mathematics — the Fields Medal, which will be awarded today at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul, South Korea, she assumed that the account from which the email was sent had been hacked.
Other mathematicians, however, describe Mirzakhani’s work in glowing terms. Her doctoral dissertation about counting loops on surfaces that have “hyperbolic” geometry, was “truly spectacular,” said Alex Eskin, a mathematician at the University of Chicago who has collaborated with Mirzakhani. “It’s the kind of mathematics you immediately recognize belongs in a textbook.”
And one of Mirzakhani’s more recent contributions, a monumental collaboration with Eskin about the dynamics of abstract surfaces connected to billiard tables is “probably the theorem of the decade” in Mirzakhani’s highly competitive field, said Benson Farb, also a University of Chicago mathematician.
Tehran
As a child growing up in Tehran, Mirzakhani had no intention of becoming a mathematician. Her chief goal was simply to read every book she could find. She also watched television biographies of famous women such as Marie Curie and Helen Keller, and later read “Lust for Life,” a novel about Vincent van Gogh. These stories instilled in her an undefined ambition to do something great with her life, become a writer, perhaps.
Mirzakhani finished elementary school just as the Iran-Iraq war was drawing to a close and opportunities were opening up for motivated students. She took a placement test that secured her a spot at the Farzanegan middle school for girls in Tehran, which is administered by Iran’s National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents. “I think I was the lucky generation,” she said. “I was a teenager when things got more stable.”
In her first week at the new school, she made a lifelong friend, Roya Beheshti, who is now a mathematics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. As children, the two explored the book stores that lined the crowded commercial street near their school. Browsing was discouraged, so they randomly chose books to buy. “Now, it sounds very strange,” Mirzakhani said. “But books were very cheap, so we would just buy them.”
To her dismay, Mirzakhani did poorly in her mathematics class that year. Her math teacher didn’t think she was particularly talented, which undermined her confidence. At that age, “it’s so important what others see in you,” Mirzakhani said. “I lost my interest in math.”
The following year, Mirzakhani had a more encouraging teacher, however, and her performance improved enormously. “Starting from the second year, she was a star,” Beheshti said.
Mirzakhani went on to the Farzanegan high school for girls. There, she and Beheshti got hold of the questions from that year’s national competition to determine which high school students would go to the International Olympiad in Informatics, an annual programming competition for high school students. Mirzakhani and Beheshti worked on the problems for several days and managed to solve three out of six. Even though students at the competition must complete the exam in three hours, Mirzakhani was excited to be able to do any problems at all.
Eager to discover what they were capable of in similar competitions, Mirzakhani and Beheshti went to the principal of their school and demanded that she arrange for math problem-solving classes like the ones being taught at the comparable high school for boys. “The principal of the school was a very strong character,” Mirzakhani recalled. “If we really wanted something, she would make it happen.”
The principal was undeterred by the fact that Iran’s International Mathematical Olympiad team had never fielded a girl, Mirzakhani said. “Her mindset was very positive and upbeat that ‘you can do it, even though you’ll be the first one,’ ” Mirzakhani said. “I think that has influenced my life quite a lot.”
In 1994, when Mirzakhani was 17, she and Beheshti made the Iranian math Olympiad team. Mirzakhani’s score on the Olympiad test earned her a gold medal. The following year, she returned and achieved a perfect score. Having entered the competitions to discover what she could do, Mirzakhani emerged with a deep love of mathematics. “You have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math,” she said.
Even today, said Anton Zorich of the Université Paris Diderot-Paris 7 in France, Mirzakhani gives “the impression of a 17-year-old girl who is absolutely excited by all the mathematics that happens around her.” Harvard
Gold medals at the mathematical Olympiad don’t always translate into success in mathematics research, McMullen observed. “In these contests, someone has carefully crafted a problem with a clever solution, but in research, maybe the problem doesn’t have a solution at all.” Unlike many Olympiad high-scorers, he said, Mirzakhani “has the ability to generate her own vision.”
After completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Sharif University in Tehran in 1999, Mirzakhani went to graduate school at Harvard University, where she started attending McMullen’s seminar. At first, she didn’t understand much of what he was talking about but was captivated by the beauty of the subject, hyperbolic geometry. She started going to McMullen’s office and peppering him with questions, scribbling down notes in Farsi.
“She had a sort of daring imagination,” recalled McMullen, a 1998 Fields medallist. “She would formulate in her mind an imaginary picture of what must be going on, then come to my office and describe it. At the end, she would turn to me and say, ‘Is it right?’ I was always very flattered that she thought I would know.”
Mirzakhani likes to describe herself as slow. Unlike some mathematicians who solve problems with quicksilver brilliance, she gravitates toward deep problems that she can chew on for years. “Months or years later, you see very different aspects” of a problem, she said. There are problems she has been thinking about for more than a decade. “And still there’s not much I can do about them,” she said.
Mirzakhani doesn’t feel intimidated by mathematicians who knock down one problem after another. “I don’t get easily disappointed,” she said. “I’m quite confident, in some sense.”
Her slow and steady approach also applies to other areas of her life. One day while she was a graduate student at Harvard, her future husband, then a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, learned this lesson about Mirzakhani when the two went for a run. “She’s very petite, and I was in good shape, so I thought I’d do well, and at first, I was ahead,” recalled Jan Vondrak, who is now a theoretical computer scientist at IBM Almaden Research Centre in San Jose, Califonia. “But she never slows down. After half an hour, I was done, but she was still running at the same pace.”
As she thinks about mathematics, Mirzakhani constantly doodles, drawing surfaces and other images related to her research. “She has these huge pieces of paper on the floor and spends hours and hours drawing what look to me like the same picture over and over,” Vondrak said, adding that papers and books are scattered haphazardly about her home office. “I have no idea how she can work like this, but it works out in the end,” he said. Perhaps, he speculates, that is because “the problems she is working on are so abstract and complicated, she can’t afford to make logical steps one by one but has to make big jumps.”
Doodling helps her focus, Mirzakhani said. When thinking about a difficult math problem, “you don’t want to write down all the details,” she said. “But the process of drawing something helps you somehow to stay connected.” Mirzakhani said that her 3-year-old daughter, Anahita, often exclaims, “Oh, Mommy is painting again!” when she sees the mathematician drawing. “Maybe she thinks I’m a painter,” Mirzakhani said.
Next Chapter
Mirzakhani is the first woman to win a Fields Medal. The gender imbalance in mathematics is long-standing and pervasive, and the Fields Medal, in particular, is ill-suited to the career arcs of many female mathematicians. It is restricted to mathematicians younger than 40, focusing on the very years during which many women dial back their careers to raise children.
Mirzakhani feels certain, however, that there will be many more female Fields medallists in the future. “There are really many great female mathematicians doing great things,” she said.
In the meantime, while she feels greatly honoured to have been awarded a Fields Medal, she has no desire to be the face of women in mathematics, she said. Her ambitious teenage self would have been overjoyed by the award, she said, but today, she is eager to deflect attention from her achievements so she can focus on research.
Mirzakhani has big plans for the next chapters of her mathematical story. She has started working with Wright to try to develop a complete list of the kinds of sets that translation surface orbits can fill up. Such a classification would be a “magic wand” for understanding billiards and translation surfaces, Zorich has written.
It’s no small task, but Mirzakhani has learned over the years to think big. “You have to ignore low-hanging fruit, which is a little tricky,” she said. “I’m not sure if it’s the best way of doing things, actually, you’re torturing yourself along the way.” But she enjoys it, she said. “Life isn’t supposed to be easy.” Quanta Magazine
