City Net Congress inaugurated
Embrace change, urges Speaker

A council which recognizes the need to change and adapts to change quickly, will be successful, said former Colombo Mayor and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
He was addressing the 8th City Net Congress inaugural session at the Hilton, yesterday.
Recounting his experiences as the Colombo Mayor between 1997 and 1999, he said, “People elected me so convincingly because they needed a change. The search for change is seen in many countries. The change they wanted was from the traditional bureaucratic structure to one that was performance-oriented,” he said.
Jayasuriya further explained that politics should be confined only to the time of election and not spill over to local administration.
“We see that once there is unity in a city’s administration, those cities prospered despite the political or ideological differences. As Mayor, I invited opposition parties to chair statutory bodies, and there was dialogue though we had ideological differences. It was effective power sharing and it contributed to our success,” he added.
Local government, the Speaker explained, was a body which closely associated with the public from their birth to death and thus “citizen participation in affairs of the city was not only the way to meet the needs of the city but also means to gain the confidence and acceptance of the community.”
During his tenure as the Mayor, Jayasuriya and his team had initiated many programmes such as the famed ‘Public Day’, advisory committees with leading citizens for the Council to consult with, partnerships with the private sector, NGOs, and the international community to improve services, such as health, roads etc., a poster buster machine to remove posters, partial privatization of garbage clearance to improve cleanliness, the establishment of the Unauthorized Construction Demolition Unit, information desk, strengthening housing development units to improve housing for slum dwellers and keeping the public informed of all programmes through a regular newsletter.
