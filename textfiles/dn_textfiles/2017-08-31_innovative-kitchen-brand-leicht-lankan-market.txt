Innovative kitchen brand LEICHT in Lankan market

Centrepoint, a subsidiary of Fairway Holdings, has raised the bar for the entire local industry by partnering with Germany’s leading kitchen brand LEICHT and introducing it to Sri Lanka.
LEICHT products can now be found at Centrepoint’s showroom at Nawala Road, Nawala, where customers can see for themselves, the quality and unique designs produced by Germany’s most innovative kitchen brand.
German born and globally renowned, LEICHT serves as the very epitome of innovation in the Kitchen Industry. In fact the company has established its very own Innovation Center made up of experts solely dedicated to the task of producing new ideas and innovations to bring out creative, unprecedented, one-of-a-kind kitchens to the market.
The EVO Series, LEICHT’s most recent invention secured the brand’s second Plus X Award for the ‘Most Innovative Brand’ in 2017. LEICHT first won the much-coveted award in 2015 in recognition of the brand’s intrinsic commitment to innovation.
LEICHT is also the first and only kitchen manufacturer to feature Les Couleurs Le Corbusier in its portfolio. Swiss-French architect, designer, painter, urban planner and writer, Charles Edouard Jeanneret aka Le Corbusier was one of the founding fathers of modern architecture.
Having begun as a family business over 80 years ago, LEICHT has evolved into a business that boasts a turnover of over 120 million Euros a year in its native country. As one of Germany’s premier brands, LEICHT caters to the niche market and enjoys the highest market share in Germany’s premium kitchen sector.
“Year after year we’ve experienced the growing demands of consumers when it comes to the quality and finer details of kitchen finishes,” said Hemaka De Alwis, the Chairman of Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.
Following LEICHT’s arrival in Sri Lanka, the brand has become a partner in Fairway Holding’s Elements project, which is a series of luxury condominiums in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte.
All apartments of the Elements will feature kitchens produced exclusively by LEICHT, thus offering homeowners an excellent value proposition. Such is the standard of the brand’s exclusivity and quality that every aspect of LEICHT kitchens are produced solely in Germany and then shipped over to Sri Lanka.
