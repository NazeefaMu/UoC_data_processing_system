Fake gold dealer arrested

A man who tried to sell coloured lead balls to a resident of Kandy as genuine gold nuggets unearthed from a treasure trove was arrested by the Dambulla police on April 1.
He was trying to sell the fake nuggets at Rs. 1 million when the arrest was made.
The prospective buyer had placed a newspaper ad recently to sell a house. The suspect had called him on the pretext of buying the house and visited him several times. Thereafter, the suspect had shown him a genuine gold nugget as a sample and told him that he had a collection of nuggets for sale and asked if he wanted to buy them. after speaking about the terms and conditions, the suspect had asked the Kandy resident to come to the Dambulla town to make the transaction.
Suspecting the dealmaker, the Kandy resident first had gone to the Dambulla police to lodge a complaint.
While the prospective buyer was having a rendezvous with the suspect near the Dambulla hospital, police officers lying in wait had pounced on the man and arrested him along with the fake gold nuggets.
Investigations had revealed that the suspect had deceived several people in the past as well in this way.
