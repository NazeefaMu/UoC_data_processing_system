Alma mater, the sacred seat

The alma mater is defined in the OXFORD ADVANCED LEARNER’S DICTIONARY as ‘the university, school or college that somebody attended’. In the highly literate modern society everyone has his own alma mater to be proud of. As illiteracy is a thing of the past and the schoolmaster is abroad, alma mater is synonymous with everyone’s life. In other words, if anyone has a sacred bond to be honoured and respected that is his or her alma mater. Alumni is another word in the same family and it denotes male or female former stu dents, as a whole, of an institution. Alumnus means a male former student of a school, college or university while his female counterpart is alumna. The few words given above envelope the whole human world and they make the people inescapable from their sacred obligations towards them. The alma mater is a sacred cow, in a nutshell.
It is very great that some alumni hold their alma mater in high esteem. They remember OXFORD, CAMBRIDGE , HARWARD ,SOBOURNE, MONASH, and some other higher seats of learning with utmost respect . In our own soil, great gentlemen and sterling ladies of yesteryear spoke high of their places of study such as ROYAL,ANANDA ,NALANDA,RICHMOND ,MAHINDA, RAHULA ,TRINITY ,MALIYADEWA, HINDU COLLEGE and also a lot of other reputed schools, the list could go to several pages.
For all of them their alma mater was a sacred cow. In this day and age, it seems nothing is sacred. The bounden duty of the past pupils towards their place of study has been eroded and this piece f writing is a clarion call to the nation to nip it in the bud. We are duty-bound to arrest this downward trend.
As the world in general and Sri Lanka in particular are passing through an unprecedented period of moral paralysis , these institutions are threatened with an insurmountable threat in their existence. The very same institutions that did the icing of the gentlemen in the calibre of the late S.W.R.D.Bandaranayake, Rajan kadiragarmer , Lalith Athulathmudali , Karaka of India of ‘I GO WEST’ fame at the international level are also confronted with the latest syndrome of ill decorum of some alumnus. Politics and international liberal trade together with war crimes and cyber attacks are
Connected with other global phenomenon have brought these sacred institutions irreparable damage.
The writer’s concern here is to focus the attention of the rational minded general public how the past students of the institutions are bringing disgrace to their sacred cows. The decorum of the parliamentarians of the yesteryear deserves our encomium not in uncertain terms. The HANSARD is their history.
The HANSARD was our resource book for learning refined English during our school career. Our great teachers respectfully recommended the Hansard for us to learn English.
In today’s context if by misfortune a teacher recommends todays Hansard it would be a hazard. The irony is that the modern English teacher might not know whether such a document is available. Ignorance is bliss.
The million dollar question is that why on earth these parliamentarians don’t think of their alma mater when they open their foul mouths to sling mud on their colleagues at the very precincts of the sacred portals. They spoil the sanctity of the august assembly and the sacred well and fill their stomaches at the parliament canteen together showing their back to the taxpayer who maintain them. If my memory serves me correct , honourable prime minister who is regarded as a voracious reader reminded them to use the library to improve their knowledge.
They themselves passed a huge slice of the annual budget for the parliamentary library. Their alma mater might have not inculcated the reading habit in them. They have become merely dried pumpkins.
