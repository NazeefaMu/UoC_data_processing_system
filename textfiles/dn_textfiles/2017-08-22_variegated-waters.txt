Variegated waters

The exhibition showcased the artists’ intellect, imagination, experiments, professional experience and consciousness, who indulge in creative work for their own independent and honest goals solely and collectively. That is not an unconscious copying by pouring some matter into a block. It is a broad, complicated and sensitive process. And it is not an artificial and impatient or a strained product.
The artists believe that the art is a social process of digesting of touching existing, social and cultural mechanisms in a most authentic way by a community with a broad appreciation.
Beyond the Water Margin is a creative effort of four watercolour artists who were united for the necessity of a collective creative approach, professionalism and self-satisfaction for the broadness of mutual understanding, the maturity of attitudes, collectiveness and the unity of diversity. It stands as a visual communication of satisfied self-expression as well.
Leaning in close to the paintings, the connoisseurs attempt to understand the hidden meanings. On another corner, the youngsters would capture these works of art on their smartphones. In the meanwhile, another crowd wants the artists to pose for a selfie.
There is more to a painting than gathering a collection for an exhibition. ‘Beyond the Water Margin’ held at the Lionel Wendt for the past few days constituted four watercolour virtuosos with different themes and styles albeit roaming one path. The four artists include Gunasiri Kolambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Seneviratne and Nilusha Weerakkody.
Gunasiri Kolamge, the eldest of them all, needs no introduction since he has been in the industry for a lengthy period. He executed various experiments during the initial stages of watercolour in Sri Lanka. Educated at the then Government College of Arts, Kolambage naturally chose water colour as his perennial medium. He toys with this medium to combine European and Indian traditions. Kolambage represents the generation that follows the influential figures such as Stanley Abeysinghe, H B Perera, G S Fernando and Susil Premaratne, the fraternity of Sri Lankan watercolour tradition. With his experience at both home and abroad, Kolombage finally settled down with abstract paintings. Most of his paintings are woven around the disciplined lifestyle celebrated in Buddhist philosophy.
Unique style
Next to Kolambage is Basil Cooray who has earned repute for his professional accuracy in the visual medium. His could be considered a unique style with more emphasis on humanistic aspects like folk lifestyle. At the Lionel Wendt, he chose to paint several works on the similar theme. He banks on human figures and landscapes to drive his point home. Cooray’s three similar paintings (with slight differences), which symbolize the religious faith prevalent in the village lifestyle, are a classic example.
Sanjeewee and Nilusha represent the much younger generation. Sanjeewee has been inspired by the modern watercolour trends in the European and Asian regions. Keeping the urban society as his forte, Sanjeewee has bagged several awards at international contests. To an untrained eye, Sanjeewee’s paintings may not hold much water. But his paintings bear long-cultivated academic discipline as well as the fixed use of the watercolour medium. He uses tones generously to convey his expression. This enables the connoisseurs and enthusiasts understand the depth of his works.
The watercolour medium, according to Sanjeewee, is an ancient artistic tradition.
“In Europe we come across Watercolour Artists’ Associations which are over 100 years old. These associations have annual activities such as contests and exhibitions to encourage watercolour as a medium,” Seneviratne explained.
Apparently the Sri Lankan phenomenon is quite the opposite.
Nilusha Weerakkody makes an entry into watercolour as a fashion designer. His works carry a different perspective therefor. He finds immense inspiration in local cultures. In fact, Nilusha goes to a dramatic extent with reflective lighting to bring up the crux of the environmental, material and humane structure of the society. He notices the slightest things such as dew drops, glass surfaces, the visual motion of glazed metal, upside down reflections drawn on rained earth and lights of moving vehicles at night overlapping with street lights.
Different interpretations
“We work on a similar platform, though our themes and styles are different. We see the light through one medium, watercolour. That medium harmonises our different interpretations,” artist Sanjeewee Seneviratne said.
In Sri Lanka, this precious medium suffers according to Seneviratne.
“We do not study watercolour in academies. The academies, of course, teach oil and acrylics. That’s why it’s difficult for a novice to come to the fore. Then you hardly see them engaged in watercolour art professionally.”
This exhibition will be an opportunity for anyone to study watercolour medium utilized in different varieties.
