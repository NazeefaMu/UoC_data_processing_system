Daddy’s Home 2
Shockingly tolerable!

Double the Dads have been added to the ‘Daddy’s Home’ series as its Christmas installment ‘Daddy’s Home 2’ hits cinemas. The movie picks off from its prequel. Since Brad and Dusty have finally learnt to get along the next step is for them to deal with their Dads. The arrival of Christmas is the family event of the year and family means bonding, relatives and more. Brad and Dusty decide to give their children a good “One-family-Christmas”. Enter Mel Gibson and John Lithgow and the action turns hilarious. While Brad and his Dad Don get along very well Dusty and his Dad Kurt cannot see eye to eye.
Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson steal the show. WWE champ John Cean makes a surprising but significant cameo and this heightens the interest towards the movie.
Those who might have watched ‘Bad Mom’s Christmas’ might get some familiar sense of déjà vu when they watch this movie. For instance in both cases the protagonists have to deal with their parents of the same sex. Put them in the same house together for the holidays and sparks start flying on their own. This could very well be considered as the male version of ‘Bad Mom’s Christmas’. It is the male version of the tale told by men in a male point of view. The female characters are mostly thrown into the background and half the time ignored.
Ferrell and Wahlberg make an odd kind of comic team, since they rarely seem to be acting on the same level. For instance Ferrell can hardly bring himself to be sincere, while Wahlberg can hardly be anything but. However the combination works surprisingly well in the movie. Though Gibson plays the badass in the story he still finds space to become loveable.
Like all family comedies, the message is pro-family and the jokes are to see how the family, despite its obvious differences, manages to reconcile. Themes like Dads trying to teach their adolescent children about the birds and the bees and trying to form a link with their stepchildren run in this movie too in a rather chiched manner.
The plot could have been a bit better. The ending is especially cheesy since the musical number seems to unite all. It also has an overdose of over the top physical comedy.
The plus side of the project is that it is full of fun. However there are a few awkward moments when the fun seems to stoop almost into silliness.
A loosely structured farce that satirises modern concepts of fatherhood and masculinity, ‘Daddy’s Home 2’ is a flighty comedy just like its predecessor.
‘Daddy’s Home 2’ is screening at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm, Empire Cineplex at 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.15 am.
