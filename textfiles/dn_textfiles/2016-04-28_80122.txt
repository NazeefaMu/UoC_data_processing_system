Using term “Joint Opposition” unethical ?

The Media Secretary of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media through a press release today notified the media that it was unlawful and unethical to use the term “Joint Opposition” to describe a certain number of parliamentarians from the government, working with other opposition parliamentarians.
Issuing a press release, the secretary further added that this had been informed due to the misuse of media freedom and unethical behaviour by certain parties in the media for personal gain.
