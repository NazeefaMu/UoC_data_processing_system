SLT e-Bill promo winner awarded an iPhone8

A special award ceremony was organized by SLT, the national telecommunication service provider to reward the winners of the company’s e-bill promotion which went underway recently, that allowed customers the facility of registering for e-bills online, through a self-registration portal.
The e-bill promotion was initiated to encourage more customers to switch over to the option of registering to receive e-bills as opposed to receiving the traditional paper bills through the post.
During the three months promotional period, a total of 50,000 customers registered for SLT’s e-bill service. Out of these customers, the winners of the promotion include, H.M.S. Chandrika, D.N. Dandeniyaarachchige, D.M.S. Harshana Senawirathne, Rev. Viharadhipathy - Buddha Rashmi Temple, W.R.M. Wasana Wiramunda and P.R. Kulanga De Silva.
H.M.S. Chandrika was the lucky winner of an iPhone8, which was collected on her behalf by her son Pasan Sadakalum, at the award ceremony. Other winners walked away with power banks.
The introduction of the self-registration portal facilitated easy self-subscription by customers, greatly increasing their convenience. SLT’s e-bill facility offers easy access to bills to customers where bills are received monthly to their email addresses.
Additionally, the customer also has the facility to request for the previous six months bills online as well as change the customer contact details via the e-bill portal. This is another green initiative of the company, and SLT encourages all customers to register for the e-bill facility, thus helping to contribute towards making a positive impact on the environment by reducing the need to print paper bills.
