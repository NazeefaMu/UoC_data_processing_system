Ten treasure hunters nabbed

Nawagattegama Police had arrested 10 suspects, including a retired Police sergeant, who were excavating an ancient place of worship to unearth a valuable treasure in the Kohombayaya Forest Reserve in the Rachchiragama area.
Iron bars, joss sticks, flowers, pooja baskets, hoes and other tools belonging to the suspects were taken into custody.
A Police team led by Nawagattegama Police OIC IP Naveen Indrajith Dayananda had arrested the suspects on August 27.
However, Police sources in Kurunegala revealed that 53 suspects had been arrested for treasure hunting during the past two months from the NWP alone.
