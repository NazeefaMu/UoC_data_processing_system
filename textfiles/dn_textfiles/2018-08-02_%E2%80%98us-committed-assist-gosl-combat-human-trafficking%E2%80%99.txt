‘US committed to assist GOSL combat human-trafficking’

The US is committed to working with civil society, international organisations, and the Government of Sri Lankan, to combat human-trafficking in the country, US Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Robert Hilton said.
He was addressing an event organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Office in Colombo, in view of World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.
Hilton said the US State Department funded three grants in Sri Lanka valued at approximately $2.5 million.
“These grants engage on a wide variety of activities including, for example, helping to strengthen the judiciary to investigate and prosecute traffickers, building an effective trafficking data collection and reporting system, and improving services and protections for trafficking victims, ” he said.
