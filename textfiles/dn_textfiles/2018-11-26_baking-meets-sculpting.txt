Baking meets sculpting

Culinary sculptors combined their talents with some holiday cheer for the 26th annual National Gingerbread House Competition in North Carolina.
The gingerbread creations on display at the Omni Grove Park Inn in Asheville included ships, dragons, gnome scenes, mansions and miniature bakeries.
Judges picked winners for four categories: child, youth, teen and adult. The adult category was won by husband and wife team Michael and Julie Andreacola, whose sculpture, "Gearing Up for Christmas," featured working gears that were cut using lasers.
All entries in the contest were required to be at least 75 percent gingerbread and 100 percent edible.
