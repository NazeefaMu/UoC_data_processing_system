Govt.did not bring NCM against Wijeyadasa for fear of its defeat in House :Dilum Amunugama

The Government did not bring a No-Confidence Motion(NCM) against Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as they fear for its defeat in Parliament,Kandy District Parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said.
Addressing a press conference at the Dr.N.M.Perera Memorial Center in Borella, Amunugama said the government asked the President to remove him instead of briing a No-Confidence Motion against him as the Government knew that it would be defeated in Parliament.
He also said that former Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigned from his Ministerial portfolio since Joint Opposition succeeded in bringing a No-Confidence Motion against him.
