Be there at Pretty N’Pink

The Ikebana international Sri Lanka Chapter 262 will celebrate its 10th anniversary Pretty N’Pink on May 20 from 6.30pm onwards at the Galle Face Hotel.
The main highlight of the event will be an Ikebana demonstration by Christopher Lim [RIJI], a world-renowned Floral Artist from Singapore. He is the Consultant to the Sri Lanka Chapter and is no stranger to Sri Lanka, having had several demonstrations before. Members of the overseas chapters will also display at the exhibition together with Members of the Sri Lanka Chapter. Oriental dance, song and drum recitals will be the other segment of entertainment. The evening will conclude with a scrumptious buffet and a raffle draw with many prizes and return airline tickets to Bangkok, Chennai and Singapore. The Chief Guest will be the Ambassador for Japan in Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan Chapter of Ikebana International was founded in 2008 and has thirty seven members, including professionals in the field of floral art as well as enthusiasts and students of Ikebana. The Society has two objectives, the promotion of the art of Ikebana in Sri Lanka and organizing fundraisers for children with cancer and breast cancer patients. During these ten years there have been many demonstrations and workshops in order to raise funds for the cause of cancer and the development of Ikebana.
Pretty N’Pink is organized for a dual purpose, where part of the proceeds would be utilized for donations to Jaffna Hospital and part of it to Karapitiya Hospital. Mainly these funds will be allocated to the breast cancer survivors who are in a dire situation unable to buy medication, inner clothes such as prosthesis bra, wigs etc. The Members will also be helping the patients in the respective wards with medication and other necessities and will be working with the Oncology departments of the respective hospitals and personally hand over the donations and monitor the progress. This fundraiser tiled Pretty N’ Pink will no doubt create an impact and be an ‘eye opener’ for all those who attend this event.
