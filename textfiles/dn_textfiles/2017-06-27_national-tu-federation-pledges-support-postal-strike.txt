National TU Federation pledges support to postal strike

Says ready to discuss
The National Trade Union Federation yesterday announced that it will extend its support to the strike declared by postal workers from yesterday midnight.
The federation’s General Secretary, Udeni Dissanayaka said they will give their strength and support to postal workers’ trade union action. The government attend to the problems at the Postal Department with urgency, he said.
Stating that the government must immediately attend to the people’s pension issue, Dissanayaka said if it did not, the issue would develop into a dire crisis.
“If the authorities did not come forward with urgency to address problems facing the Postal Department, the matters could get worse and trade unions will be forced to take action,” he said.
The National Trade Union Federation comprises 18 trade unions, which Dissanayaka said had decided to join the postal workers’ professed indefinite strike action.
“We are prepared to discuss issues affecting the country,” he said.
The Federation’s Co-organizer, Lal Hamuwage, said some have made attempts to sabotage the strike by offering different jobs to their members.
The Federation’s Deputy Secretary, F B R Athula, said they cannot approve of actions that are contemplative of selling state institutions.
“The former President went on to disregard the working class.
The Rathupaswala incident has not gone out of our minds. We remember how people have been put to death,” he said.
 
” As people who took a stand against the Rajapaksa rule, we will take steps to point out the failures of the present government,” he said.
