Army Sports Club - a blend of youth and experience

Sri Lanka Army Sports Club is a Division ‘A’ rugby union team that plays in the Dialog Rugby League in Sri Lanka. It is the rugby union team of the Sri Lanka Army Sports Club and was founded in 1961.
In 1961 Army SC together with Division ‘B’ teams from Air Force, Navy, Police SC and University were permitted to play alongside the Division ‘A’ clubs, Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club, Colombo Hockey and Football Club, Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbula Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition.
The expanded competition, allowed all thirteen clubs to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup. In 1973 Army SC, captained by S.P. de Silva, shared the Clifford Cup with Police SC following a 19 all draw. It wasn’t until 1975, under Saliya Udugama, that Army SC won the Clifford Cup outright for the first time by beating Air Force SC 4–3 with the match winning try scored by nippy winger N.P.Amaradasa.
In 1978 the Clifford Cup was awarded to the League Champions and the knockout competition was played for SLRFU President’s Trophy. In 1979 Army SC won the President’s Trophy at Longden Place, led by Daya Ratnayake, beating a strong Havelock Sports Club 18 Nil with S.P. De Silva contributing 14 points by putting over four penalties and adding the extra points to the only try scored by winger Reginald Fernando. In 1982 Army won the President’s Trophy again under the captaincy of John Senaweera with a stunning 13-3 win over league champions CH and FC.
Army SC this year will be captained by St. Luke’s College product and speedy wing three quarter Thusith Bandara Senanayake for the upcoming 2017/18 rugby season. Former Vidyartha College Kandy and experienced Sri Lanka national poolist centre Imanka Ariyapala will continue to play as centre for Army this season as well.
This year’s Army team is a blend of youth and experience which is likely to perform very well in this upcoming rugby season. Their aim this season will be to at least be placed among the top three in the league and to reach the semi final stage in the Clifford cup knock out tournament. Look forward for the Army team this season and they will give their very best.
In this upcoming season they have retained almost the entire squad of players who did yeomen services to them last year. Vastly experienced former schools/clubs and Sri Lanka national sevens coach Nilfer Ibrahim will take over as the head coach of the Army rugby team this season and experienced ex Isipathana college and Sri Lanka hooker Anuranga Walpola will be his assistant, taking care of the forwards.
