Court temporally releases Mahindananda’s passport to obtain US visa

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to temporally release former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage’s passport for him to obtain United States visa.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage sought Court’s permission to travel to the United States from July 15.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne made the order following a request by defence counsel.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in connection with an indictment filed against him by the Attorney General for alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs.3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union, Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa and Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appearing for the accused raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the case over a jurisdiction issue. Defence counsel argued that the trade union, Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress, was located in Nawalapitiya and bank transaction pertaining to the incident had been taken place through a state bank in that area.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing for the Attorney General told Court that the concerned money pertaining to the transaction had been deported in a bank account in Colombo, belonging to a security officer of Mahindananda Aluthgamage. He maintained that there is no jurisdiction issue pertaining to the case since money had been deposited in a bank account in Colombo.
The High Court Judge ordered the both parties to file their written submissions regarding preliminary objections on July 25.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs.1,000,000, misappropriated Rs.1,900,000 and misappropriated another Rs.1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress in October, 2012 till April 2013. The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code. The Attorney General has listed 13 persons as the witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items of the case.
