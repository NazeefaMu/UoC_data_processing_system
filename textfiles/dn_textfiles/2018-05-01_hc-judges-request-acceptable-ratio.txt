Appeals Court appointments
HC Judges request acceptable ratio

The High Court Judges have complained to the Constitutional Council (CC) to consider their appeal of an acceptable ratio in appointing persons to the Appeals Court.
The High Court Judges have been victimised by the ratio adopted by the Constitutional Council in appointing judges to the Appeals Court, it was unanimously decided at the General Meeting of the High Court Judges recently.
Speaking to the Daily News, a member of the legal fraternity who did not want to be named said, in the past when appointing persons to the Appeals Court, most of them were those who were not judges. “This affected the promotions of the judges,” he said. However, he added that despite their appeal to appoint members to the Appeal Court based on a ratio that is fair to all, for some reason it is not done.
However, appointing persons to the Appeals Court had been taking place on a 1:1 ratio of one High Court Judge to one member from another field, the High Court Judges have appealed to the Constitutional Council to implement the 3:1 ratio instead, which had been the customary procedure.
