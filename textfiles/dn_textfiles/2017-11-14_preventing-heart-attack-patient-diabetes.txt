Preventing a heart attack in a patient with diabetes

Novemeber 14th has been designated as World Diabetes Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sir Fredrick Banting, the discoverer of the life saving anti-diabetic agent insulin.
This topic has been selected since most deaths from diabetes occur due to heart disease and in a country such as ours it appears as though its incidence is increasing. This is in spite of the presence of very capable medical consultants and availability of modern technology. The increasing trend could be attributed partly due to the indifference of some medical officers as well as the patients. The term “C linical Inertia” has been attributed to this condition. However, in the case of more developed countries such as the United States, inspite of an increasing incidence of diabetes and obesity (over-weightiness), the death rate from heart disease is in fact decreasing.
Let me start with a true incident. A 55 year old trader was admitted to the hospital with a severe heart disease. His life could not be saved and the postmortem showed evidence of a massive heart attack. It was found that in spite of the presence of diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol for several years, he has been not screened for coexistent heart disease. The purpose of this letter is mainly to educate concerned people to undertake sufficient measures to prevent such unfortunate deaths.
Diabetes could affect the heart mainly by clogging the blood vessels supplying the heart (called coronary arteries), or less frequently by affecting the heart muscle directly (cardiomyopathy), or the nerves which supply the heart. The following discussion would be confined to coronary artery disease which accounts for nearly 95% of diabetic patients with involvement of the heart. Clinically, diabetic heart disease could manifest as a heart attack, angina (pain in chest on exertion), palpitations or even heart failure.
In the prevention of heart disease, one should be aware of the contributory causes. This includes accompanying high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high sugar in the order of importance. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the blood sugar alone that causes heart attacks but the other two factors too mentioned above. In fact, it is observed that sometimes those with very high blood sugar values are spared of a heart attack since their blood pressure and cholesterol are normal. In contrast, sometimes those with marginally elevated blood sugar levels would sustain an attack since their blood pressure or cholesterol or both are high. There are other factors such as smoking, the presence of a family history of heart disease, protein in the urine and even infections for example of the gums in the mouth (periodontitis) too that could contribute. Thus, in the prevention of heart disease all these factors need to be addressed adequately. This is called ‘secondary prevention’ in contrast to ’tertiary prevention’ which means the steps that one should adopt in preventing the progress of heart disease in those who are already affected.
The next problem is how to recognize heart disease in who do not manifest typical symptoms such as chest pain. It could occur for example with a sudden onset of difficulty in breathing, a typical chest pain or unconsciousness. In fact, it could also occur without any symptoms except for a faint or uneasiness and is called a ‘silent heart attack’ which is supposed to account for nearly 30% of all the episodes.
How does one screen both these categories of patients: both with or without symptoms? There exists what are called risk calculators mainly for those in developed countries. Certain data are fed into the risk calculator. It then automatically calculates the 10 year risk of a heart attack or death. If it is less than 10%, further screening is not needed. However, the author has some reservations with the use of these calculators since in some of these risk calculators important criteria such as a family history, central obesity (high waist circumference) are not considered. He routinely screens diabetic patients with heart disease if it is more than 5 years of duration or even if it is less than 5 years with one or more risk factors which includes family history, presence of gum disease, protein in the urine and central obesity.
What are the investigations that are available? The basic tests are Echocardiography and a stress test that are mostly available in hospitals where there are cardiologists. These tests may provide some information to carry out more tests. The ”Gold Standard” for measuring the blood flow to the heart is Angiography where a dye is injected to visualize the patency of coronary vessels. This test too is not without risk and in those who are worried about it, more sophisticated tests which, even though not as sensitive as conventional angiography would be of some use. These include CT coronary angiography and radioactive scanning called “thallium scanning’’ (also called pharmacological stress test) meant for those who are unable to carry out the conventional stress test due to the presence of arthritis of the knees, obesity or bronchial asthma. If these tests are used judiciously so many lives could be saved. Unfortunately, most of these more sophisticated tests are confined to Colombo and it is a pity that they are not available even in the other major cities of the country. Those who could afford, somehow get them done in Colombo but what about the poor villagers where diabetes is spreading fairly rapidly?
