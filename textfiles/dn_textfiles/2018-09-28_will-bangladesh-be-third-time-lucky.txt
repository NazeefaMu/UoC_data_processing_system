Take on favourites India in today’s Asia Cup final:
Will Bangladesh be third time lucky ?

DUBAI, Thursday: Cricket they say is a game of uncertainties and it was proved on Wednesday when Bangladesh upset the odds to beat Pakistan and qualify for the Asia Cup final against India when the cricket crazy fans of India and Pakistan were getting ready to witness a high-voltage final between Asia’s two fiercest rivals.
Now, having done the hard work to get there Bangladesh will feel confident that they are only one step away from lifting the Asia Cup for the first time in their history. They of course have an uphill task having to battle for supremacy against India the most threatening side in the Asian cricket circuit. However, given their stunning performances thus far in the tournament, only a fool would think the final is as good as over and India has lifted the coveted trophy.
Bangladesh have previously reached the finals twice in 2012 and in 2016 only to be beaten by Pakistan by two runs and by India (when it was held in the T20 format) by eight wickets respectively. So will it be a case of being third time lucky for the Tigers?
Despite their top order without the reliable Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan (both injured) not firing they have incredible depth in their batting as they showed against Pakistan recovering from 12-3 to post a total of 236 and defend it successfully.
Their former captain Mushfiqur Rahim is in the form of his life. The wicket-keeper has scored 297 runs so far in this tournament at an astonishing average of over 70. Mahmudullah is their other key player having amassed over 150 runs while Mohammad Mithun has accumulated 135 runs.
Every match was a final in Super Four
“Every match we encountered anxious moments and from Afghanistan Super Four game, it was a virtual final for us. Hopefully the top order clicks in the final. If they don’t, then the middle and lower order needs to perform. No point thinking about technique and stuff at this juncture when we are playing a final,” said Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza at the pre-final press conference.
“When we were in the final in 2012 we rarely used to win matches against big teams and now we have competed regularly. Some of the players like Shakib, Mushfiq, Mustafiz and Tamim have contributed greatly in these victories. This year we are in final without our top two performers, and boys should feel proud about it,” he said.
Musfiqur who won the man of the match award for his fighting knock of 99 against Pakistan said, “You cannot take any team for granted, this was just another game against Pakistan and we treated it like that, all the guys were spirited with that, this is our third chance to go into the final, and hopefully we can make it number one time winning the final.”
In the bowling Bangladesh’s most prized asset is the fans’ favourite fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman who has overcome injuries and obstacles to make a grand comeback to spearhead Bangladesh’s Asia Cup campaign along with the cunning off-spin of Mehidy Hasan who has not picked up many wickets but have kept things in check with a magnificent economy rate of just over three runs an over.
The third factor in Bangladesh’s progress so far is the leadership qualities of Mashrafe Mortaza. With unparalleled dedication in fielding and with the ball Mortaza has impressed with his clever captaincy that has been another factor of Bangladesh’s success.
‘Moment Tamim entered the field my Asia Cup was won’
“Let me be honest, the moment Tamim entered the field against Sri Lanka as the last man to help Mushfiq score those runs, my Asia Cup was won,” said Mortaza.
“Every tournament has been a distinct journey whether 2012 final against Pakistan or 2016 against India. Everytime we encountered a few situations overcame and got into the finals. The journey in this tournament was a difficult one as we started losing players from the very first game (Tamim). There was also concern whether Mushfiq could play or not but then he played despite not being gully fit. We can learn from him,” he said.
“I think it’s a great lesson for the boys and young players to learn that it’s all about fighting till the last ball. It was difficult (road) to the final without performers like Shakib and Tamim not being available. The good thing is that the boys didn’t give up although we lost at the group stage against Afghanistan and India. The boys have done really well and with a match to go we can fight on. Let’s see.”
Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan the leading run-getter in the tournament with 327 runs (avg. 81,75) was very much aware of what his side is up against.
“I guess they’re balanced, know what their strengths are, they’ve improved a lot. They’re a competitive side. Hats off to them, the way they played and won against Pakistan. When you play all-round cricket, the results will follow,” said Dhawan ahead of the final.
“The plan we made against them in the previous game, we will try and stick to that. Conditions will remain the same, we’ll plan for individuals by looking at videos of their batsmen, revise and prepare accordingly.”
In the Super Four match India beat Bangladesh quite comfortably by seven wickets after bowling out their opponents for 173 runs. But since then Bangladesh has come back strongly with wins over Afghanistan (by 3 runs) and Pakistan (by 37 runs) to be in the final.
The Rohit Sharma led India are the only team in the competition who are unbeaten are expected to continue their winning streak and lift the trophy for a record sixth time (in 50-over format). They are currently on par with Sri Lanka with five wins each.
“Of course we’ll carry momentum and give it a best shot, all teams are competitive. Everyone thought it was India-Pakistan in the final, but Bangladesh won a great match. We can’t take them lightly just because Pakistan is a bigger team. Bangladesh is playing better cricket, there’s a difference between team on paper and who is doing good on the field, that’s how I see it,” said Dhawan, the vice-captain of the team.
So it all points out to be a blockbuster final provided Bangladesh live upto their form shown in the last two games.
