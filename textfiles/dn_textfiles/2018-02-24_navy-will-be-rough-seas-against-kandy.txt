KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Navy will be in rough seas against Kandy

Where others have failed this season, can the Sri Lanka Navy succeed In Sunday’s Clifford Cup final against Kandy? The Sailors would cherish to become the first team to conquer Kandy SC who are unbeaten this season in the league as well as the knockouts but it won’t be an easy task. The Kandy SC team who knows how to win matches will be at full throttle and will want to preserve the winning record which means so much to them. Kandy SC will play their usual hard game of rugby to pocket this title as well for another year. They’ve been through a kind of training that would not be out of place in the final tomorrow. The Sailors are likely to find most of their problems coming from up-front where Kandy SC has shown tremendous fire. The young, fit and willing Kandy SC’s pack can push the strong Sailors act to breaking point with their fierce loose play and possession of the ball. It had been this factor that has taken the wind out of most of the sails of clubs. And their halves combination is excellent, and the centers, wingers and the fullback are in top form.
For the Sailors their back division is going to have a hard evening. Aware the Sri Lanka Navy’s scoring strength lies in the back division, Kandy SC will undoubtedly throw a net round them. However, it will not be an easy tactic to see through. Kandy SC’s cover defense is the best seen this season. A marked characteristic is that there is a back-up-bridge of at least three forwards when their outsides are going up tackle their man.
As long as the ball is kept on the ground in straight forward rucks Kandy SC forwards can successfully initiate second phase attacks through their linkman. Tomorrow a mixed convoy of vans, jeeps, buses and cars will travel down to Colombo, carrying the fans, led by Kandy Faa. Kandy SC has won the Clifford Cup a record 21 times, including a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012.
In 2006 Kandy SC and Navy SC both withdrew from the tournament (Kandy due to a dispute over the ground allocation and Navy as their members were called up for national service duty).
CR & FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelock SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH & FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR & FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC and Air Force SC and Navy SC once each.
