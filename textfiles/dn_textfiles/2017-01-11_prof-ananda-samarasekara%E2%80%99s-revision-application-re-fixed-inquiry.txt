Prof. Ananda Samarasekara’s revision application re-fixed for inquiry

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for March 10 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the lawyers appearing for Prof. Samarasekara sought a further date for the inquiry citing that the prosecution was yet to receive the DNA report pertaining to the skeletal remains seized at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara cited the CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando with Counsel Thisya Weragoda and Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.
