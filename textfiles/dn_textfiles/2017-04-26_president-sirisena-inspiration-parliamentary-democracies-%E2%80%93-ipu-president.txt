President Sirisena is inspiration to Parliamentary democracies – IPU President

Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) President Saber Chowdhury said President Maithripala Sirisena has given an inspiration to those who work to strengthen Parliamentary democracies.
Chowdhury made this statement when he called on President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. He appreciated the anti-tobacco campaign of President Sirisena.
He said steps by President Sirisena to dilute executive powers of the Presidency and vest them with Parliament are important steps towards strengthening democracy.
Pointing out that in some countries, Parliaments have been marginalised by Executive Presidents and in some other countries, government terms have been extended through referendums, the IPU President said, “Sri Lanka is a beacon of hope for other parliamentary democracies.”
President Sirisena said he would extend fullest support to IPU programmes to promote youth and women participation in government and Parliament. He said steps have been initiated to introduce a women’s quota for local government elections.
Chowdhury said although 50 percent of the world population is below the age of 30, only 1.9 percent of the Parliamentarians in the world are below 30 years. President Sirisena said intelligent youths should take more governing and Parliamentary responsibilities.
Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake was also present.
