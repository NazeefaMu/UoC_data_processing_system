Lankan brands must breakthrough into global markets - Interbrand

Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India, recently in Colombo for the rebranding of HNB by global giant Interbrand and Sri Lankan brand consultancy MND, emphasized the need for Sri Lankan brands to breakthrough into global markets.
“It is necessary for Asian brands outside of Japan and South Korea to view the brand as a strategic and long-term investment rather than a cost,” said Mishra. “Brands are assets that require long-term management and planning. When organizations develop a brand platform and brand architecture that lays the foundation for all marketing activities, they shape perceptions in a coordinated and consistent manner, and create greater impact and operational efficiencies at the same time.”
Mishra also stated that with increasing globalization, Asia has many global brands as their primary competition in the domestic market. “If Sri Lankan or Indian brands have to do well, they must win against the global brands operating in their markets. That success then needs to be replicated in outside markets.”
Mishra’s comments came on the eve of the launch of Interbrand’s second Breakthrough Brands report in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Facebook and Ready Set Rocket which recognizes 40 next-generation, disruptive brands that define progress and the potential to grow. The report complements Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands report – the most prestigious ranking of the 100 most valuable brands globally – by putting a spotlight on emerging brands that are affecting change and embodying growth.
After analyzing over 350 submissions from global influencers and open public submissions, 40 brands were selected as this year’s Breakthrough Brands, amongst which India’s start-up poster-brand Flipkart and technology-enabled logistics start-up Rivigo have been featured. Non-carbonated and energy drinks brand Paperboat marketed by Hector Beverages has also been mentioned as one of the world’s most innovative brands, prioritizing craftsmanship and personalization with an authentic and differentiated story that is appealing to the rising middle class consumer in APAC countries.
