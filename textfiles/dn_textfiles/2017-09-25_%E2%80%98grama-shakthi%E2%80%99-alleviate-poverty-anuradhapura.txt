‘Grama Shakthi’ to alleviate poverty in Anuradhapura

A poverty alleviation scheme, “Grama Shakthi” is to be launched in selected 44 GS divisions in 22 DS divisions in the Anuradhapura district soon.
The Presidential Secretariat will sponsor the programme under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena. Around 25,000 low- income families including Samurdhi recipients in the 44 GS divisions will benefit from the programme.
It will provide rural infra structural facilities, self employments, drinking water schemes, electricity and housing schemes under a rural body called People’s Company established in each division. The company will comprise senior villagers in the respective areas. Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said the programme would establish 1,000 grama shakthi units initially and expand them to 5,000 villages by 2020. Each person in the programme will be granted Rs. 8,000 for development activities under the project as low interest loans.
“We have already trained 66 development officers and 22 assistant directors at DS divisions level. GS divisions in Anuradhapura will be expanded to 178 divisions by 2020. The dividends of the program will be granted without any discrimination, Anuradhapura District Planning Director Sugath Nayanananda said.
