Teldeniya incidents: sixteen further remanded, eight released

Teldeniya Magistrate N.M.Farikdeen yesterday, further remanded 16 persons arrested in connection with the recent incidents in Teldeniya and released another eight.
Twenty-four suspects were arrested in connection with the incidents in Teldeniya and were produced in court yesterday, while 16 of them were ordered to be remanded until April 2.
The other eight suspects were acquitted as there was insufficient evidence to suggest they had any involvement in the Theldeniya incidents. However, the Police objected to bail being granted for the other suspects on the grounds that investigations were still incomplete.
Attorneys Sarath Premakumara, Channa Galapaththi, Swarna Karaliyadda and Lahiru Galapaththi appeared on behalf of the defendants.
Theldeniya Police OIC Chief Inspector Pragatha Indunil and Sub-Inspector Upali Chandrasiri presented the evidence in court.
Stringent security measures were implemented in and around the Court premises when the suspects were brought to court.
