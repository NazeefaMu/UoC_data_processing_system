Free driving lessons for unemployed youths

Arrangements are made by the Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority to provide free driving lessons for unemployed youths.
The programme is carried out under the guidance of Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody.
Accordingly, youths will be provided with lessons on motorcycles, three-wheelers, and light and heavy vehicles. In addition, they would be provided with motor mechanic technology training free of charge, said Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake.
He was speaking at a youth conference held at the Youth Training Centre, Bingiriya, Kurunegala.
The first training centre was set up at Koggala recently. Several other training centres are to be set up in other provinces to facilitate youths to obtain free driving lessons.
This is to support them in obtaining local and foreign employment.
Rs. 500 million is invested at the outset and 15,000 unemployed youths are to be trained this year, said the Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary.
