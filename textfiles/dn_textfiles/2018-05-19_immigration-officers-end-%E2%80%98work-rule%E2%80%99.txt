Immigration officers end ‘work to rule’

Immigration and Emigration officers ended their work to rule campaign subsequent to a written assurance from Internal Affairs Minister S.B. Navinna yesterday.
Immigration and Emigration Officers’ Association President Anura Kanugala said the campaign was called off as the minister promised to submit their demands to Cabinet next Wednesday.
“Minister Navinna arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport this morning and held a discussion with the Immigration and Emigration officers”, he said.
