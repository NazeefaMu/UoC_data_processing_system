Politically bankrupt trying to divide SLFP - Fowzie

Senior President of SLFP and National Integration and Reforms State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie yesterday said that a group of persons who have been politically stranded are trying to divide the party by forming a new political party.
He said that these persons who do not have a popular base, are trying to create rifts within the SLFP using former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a cat's paw. "Such a new party will not last long," he said.
The minister was addressing the media after calling on Mahanayake Theras of Asgiriya and Malwatte chapters in Kandy yesterday.
Minister Fowzie said that he witnessed how politicians who had betrayed the SLFP and formed various other parties faced their destruction politically.
"Any political party involved with Bodu Bala Sena organisation are tend to lose at elections. The Sinhalese Buddhists are not chauvinistic. But a handful of persons are trying to do politics by fanning communalism," he said.
Fowzie said that the clash that took place between the police and a group of monks at Homagama court premises was an unfortunate incident and a balanced media coverage is needed.
