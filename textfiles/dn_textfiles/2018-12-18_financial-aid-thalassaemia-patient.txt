Financial aid for Thalassaemia patient

The ‘Drop a Coin in Aid of Thalassaemia Patients’ project organised by the Trinity College Social Service Union concluded recently. It was carried out under the patronage of Principal Andrew Fowler-Watt and Vice-Principal J.D. Shaw Wilson.
The project was initiated to aid a child patient called Tharindu Ishara Maldeniya who is expected to undergo a bone marrow transplant soon at the Asiri Central Hospital. The estimated cost of the procedure is Rs.4,500,000.
Donation of cosmetics to the Differently-abled Girls’ Organisation in Anuradhapura, as well as financial contributions to the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually-handicapped and for the well-being of cancer patients were among the contributions made in the last quarter of the year by the Trinity College Social Service Union.
