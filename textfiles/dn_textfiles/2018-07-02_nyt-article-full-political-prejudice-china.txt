NYT article is full of political prejudice: China

China responding to the New York Times’ article published on June 25 on the Hambantota Port said the article and the clarifications and responses by various parties from Sri Lanka are full of political prejudice and completely inconsistent with the fact.
A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Colombo in a statement said the Embassy stress that China has always been pursuing a friendly policy toward Sri Lanka, firmly supporting the latter’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and opposing any country’s interference in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
It is encouraging that all sectors of the Sri Lankan society highly appreciate China’s tremendous support and selfless assistance for ending the civil war and post-war reconstruction in the Island nation.
The statement went on to say that despite any interference from a third party, China would like to work together with Sri Lanka to actively implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and concentrate unwaveringly on fixed goals, continuously promote the pragmatic cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiatives following the “golden rule” of “extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits,” to better benefit the two countries and their people.
