Scenes from the Kandy Esala Perahera

The historic Esala Perahera in the hill capital of Kandy ended yesterday evening with the Diyawadana Nilame and Basnayake Nilames of four Devalayas officially informing the President Maithripala Sirisena about the successful culmination of this year’s Esela festival. The Kumbal Perahara paraded the streets for the first five days from August 16 and the Randoli Perahera paraded the streets for five days from August 21 to 25. The traditional water cutting ritual was held in the Mahaweli River at the Gatambe Thotupola yesterday morning. Pictures by Sulochona Gamage and Udesh Gunarathne
