‘Despite country’s difficult situation, govt. boasting of tax exempted commodities’
One does not need to go through piles of books and dig up numbers to get a feeling of the government’s failed economic policy, but it is amply visible if we look at the life of the ordinary citizen, if we look at the country’s crumbling industries, if we look at the uncertainty that is prevalent in the lives of farmers and the rate of unemployed youth.
“Yet, despite the pathetic situation the country’s economy is at, the government is still boasting about having exempted certain commodities from non-duty levies of around 1,200 imported items. The State Finance Minister confidently gloats that the government is ready to lift the levy from another 3,000 imported items within the next three years,” he added.
Noting that a certain Chinese manufactured phone which costs $7 to manufacture, is being imported to Sri Lanka for $ 6.50. “Why would they do this. It is because the government pays them a dollar for every phone that is imported, so they earn $ 50 cents per phone. Under these conditions, how could anyone else compete? This is the reason other countries impose certain levies in order to protect their domestic industries,” Dissanayake pointed out.
He noted that in Sri Lanka, the production cost is very high in comparison to other countries such as India. “This is why potatoes imported from India, in addition to shipping costs and other taxes, is still cheaper in the market in comparison to the local potatoes. Other countries have taken measures to protect their domestic market. Yet now what the government is proposing is to remove all levies on imported items, other than duty and make local manufacturers compete with the imported market. Yet although the government wants the domestic producer to compete on a global scale, what concessions have you provided the local producers? In fact, even electricity bills of our local industries is extremely high, which is almost the highest in the South Asian region. Yet the government is not paying any attention to these issues faced by the local manufacturers, but wants them to compete on the same level as international markets. This is the failed new liberal economic policies of this government,” he noted.
Dissanayake said that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had recently said during a speech that corruption should be eradicated from the State sector. “Yet they were the people who sold the Army headquarter’s lands to Chinese companies, while spending far more than what was gained in that transaction for the construction of a military headquarters in another location.
There were 14 islands that was under former minister Basil Rajapaks’s purview and all these islands were put up for sale during their tenure. These are the failed economic policies that were adopted by both these parties,” Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Govt. plans to reduce import duty on construction material:Eran
The Government is contemplating on a reduction of import duties on construction material including cement, steel billets and floor tiles, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne implied in Parliament yesterday.
Speaking at the Parliamentary debate on several Orders under the Appropriation Act, the State Minister said the Government has to strike a balance between protecting local industrialists and providing construction material at an affordable price for consumers, especially the low-income people.
He reminded that Finance and Mass Minister Mangala Samaraweera when presenting the previous Budget, said that the Government intends to gradually remove para-tariffs numbering to over 7,000 and as a first step, about 1,200 para-tariffs not coming under the Customs duties were removed under a budgetary proposal. “In the next two years, we intend to remove the rest of para-tariffs as much as possible, while taking measures to protect the local industrialists,” he said.
He observed that a 120-130 percent import duty applied to floor tiles and therefore, the prices of floor tiles are high in the market and ordinary people cannot afford them. “There are only three local companies making tiles and the total number of workers does not exceed 10,000. However, there are hundreds of thousands of consumers who wish to buy them. If we are to apply very high taxes simply to protect the producer, it could be unfair to the consumers,” he commented.
He pointed out 700,000 title deeds are ready to be presented under the Government’s policy to offer out-right ownership of the lands to two million people. “Those will be awarded in the near future. In order to build houses in those lands, the prices of construction material such as cement and steel billets must come down. About 91-103 percent import duty applies to steel billets. The Government intends to take several measures in the near future to strike a balance in this regard,” the State Minister said.
JO MP tables copy of Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA in Parliament
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena tabled a copy of the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement in Parliament yesterday.
MP Gunawardena, speaking at the Parliamentary debate over several Orders under the Appropriation Act, said the Government which signed the Agreement had so failed to table it in Parliament and therefore he tabled a copy of it for the future references of all MPs.
He added that the Agreement contained over thousand pages and weighed over 3 kgs. “Any MP could peruse the Agreement and understands the facts,” he said, while commenting on the detrimental impact of the FTA with Singapore to the local job market.
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, agreed to table the Agreement, adding that it is freely available on the website for anybody to peruse.
Speaker concerned over MP Nishantha’s remanding
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, told Parliament that he could not approve the way in which Joint Opposition MP Sanath Nishantha Perera was being remanded for three months.
The Speaker made this comment in response to MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena who brought the attention of the House that MP Perera was being remanded for more than three months because he had failed to appear before the Police.
“The Chillaw High Court remanded him again on Thursday, as the judge was absent. This is not fair. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and JO MPs met you about three times to discuss this matter,” MP Gunawardena said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, intervening at this point, said MP Gunawardena being a senior Parliamentarian should understand that the Speaker could not give bail. “He is trying to make you interfere into judicial affairs,” he told the Speaker, stating that it was even wrong to speak on this matter in Parliament, as it relates to an on-going case. “You represented Parliament since 1983. Don’t you know that the Speaker cannot bail out any person? The best thing for you to do is to consult a talented lawyer,” he told MP Gunawardena.
The Speaker said he spoke to Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale over the matter and she too agreed that it was not fair. “The arrest was due to an incident which happened 4 - 5 years back. I also spoke to MP Perera over the phone. I am also of the view that this arrest was very unfair. I am also concerned as he is one of our fellow MPs. I spoke to the Attorney General as well. It is not fair to postpone the case stating that the judge was absent. Let me take further steps in this regard,” he replied.
