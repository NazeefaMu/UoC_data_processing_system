Tamil prisoners on hunger strike
Viggy urges former President Kumaratunga to intervene

Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran has written to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appealing for assistance in transferring the cases of three Tamil prisoners on hunger strike, from the Anuradhapura High Court to the Vavuniya High Court.
Vigneswaran had asked the former President to intervene in favour of the prisoners who had been fasting for the last 37 days.
The three prisoners, Rajathurai Thiruvarul, Mathiarasan Sulakshan and Ganeshan Dharshan last week filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against the Attorney General and the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID).
The prisoners state that they were arrested by the TID and produced before the Magistrate before being committed to fiscal custody. They also revealed that they were remanded in various prisons and are at present being detained in the Anuradhapura Prison. In 2013, they were indicted by the Attorney General in the Vavuniya High Court and their case was called on 58 instances without a trial being initiated. In 2017 September, the Vavuniya High Court Judge fixed the case for trial for two days but thereafter, the AG had moved to transfer the case to the Anuradhapura High Court.
The prisoners complain that they do not have relatives or friends in Anuradhapura and that they speak only Tamil, making it hard for them to understand the proceedings in another language.
They pointed out that they would be thus denied a fair trial in Anuradhapura and drew attention to the fact that out of the 67 witnesses in the case, 64 were from the Police and Armed Forces.
