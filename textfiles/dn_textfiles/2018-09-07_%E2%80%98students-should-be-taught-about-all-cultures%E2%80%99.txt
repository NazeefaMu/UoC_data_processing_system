‘Students should be taught about all cultures’

Teaching Sinhala to Muslim students is essential for reconciliation, former Minister Imthiaz Bakeer Markar said.
He was addressing a ceremony to mark the commencement of teaching Sinhala at the the Kumbukkandura Al-Hikma Central College in Digana.
He said that only 10 percent of students at the school could speak Sinhala, adding that all students should learn about the different cultures and religions in the country. The former minister said that when he studied at Ananda College in Colombo, he was the only Muslim student at the time.
However, he was never discriminated, he added.
