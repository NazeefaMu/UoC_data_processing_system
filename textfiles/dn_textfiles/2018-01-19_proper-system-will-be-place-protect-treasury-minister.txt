Proper system will be in place to protect Treasury: Minister

United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a proper and systematic mechanism will be implemented to protect the Treasury while streamlining the process of the Central Bank under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Amaraweera was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Minister Amaraweera, referring to the Treasury Bond issue, added that a proper mechanism should be implemented to protect the Treasury. Accordingly, the Governor of the Central Bank will not be a political appointment hereafter, he said.
He added that the report on the Treasury Bond issue, indirectly signifies that there should be such a mechanism to protect the Treasury and not allow anyone to misuse the Treasury and public assets.
Minister Amaraweera praised the measures taken by President Sirisena to mitigate fraud and corruption, especially to end monetary irregularities by appointing the Special Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond issue. “People in the country may not place their trust in Commissions unless the President appointed the Presidential Commission. The appointing of the special Presidential Commission is a novel feature in the country’s political arena. Moreover, it can be considered as a forward and fruitful measure to end corruption,” he said.
“Both politicians and state officers will think not only twice but many times when committing illegal financial transactions,” he said.
When asked how long it would take to take action against the responsible parties of the Treasury Bond issue, he said legal action relating to the issue should be taken promptly.
“It is significant that people are not familiar with such a powerful and impartial Presidential Commission, which investigates into allegations without considering the positions of anyone. For the first time in the country’s history, the Commission has suggested that any losses be claimed from the responsible parties,” Minister Amaraweera said.
As per the directives of the Commission, further action will be taken by the relevant parties.
“Another Commission to inquire into Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines will be appointed by the President in future,” he noted.
The Minister, while refusing the allegations levelled by the Joint Opposition that the Government is selling state properties, said the government put an end to the trend of selling state properties. The last state property was sold during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to a Chinese company. It was the land belonged to the Army Headquarters, he said.
“After that, no state property was sold,” he said.
Speaking on a news report which appeared on a daily Sinhala newspaper, that salaries of Parliamentarians and provincial councillors will increase in the future, the Minister said parliamentarians have not received a salary increment for around 10 years. Responding to parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa that no rice was imported during the Rajapaksa regime as there was bumper harvest and the country had a self-sufficiency in rice, Minister Amaraweera said Yapa didn’t know that the former Trade Minister Johnston Fernando imported 250,000 MT of low-quality rice. Those loads of rice could not be sold even as animal food due to poor quality, he said.
“It is significant that Mahinda Yapa as the then Agriculture Minister, didn’t know that 250,000 MT of rice was imported by then Trade Minister Johnston Fernando,” he said.
Minister Amaraweera said there is a hidden conspiracy to dismantle the Government. This is observed in the behaviour of the JO and the UNP parliamentarians. “Both the JO and UNP members are asking SLFP parliamentarians to quit the Government. Considering this situation, it can be considered that both segments want to dismantle the Government,” he said.
Speaking on the price of rice, the Minister said it is up to the Consumer Affairs Authority to conduct raids against errant traders who sell rice at high prices as there is no rice scarcity now.
