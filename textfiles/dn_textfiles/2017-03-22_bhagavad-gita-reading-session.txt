Bhagavad Gita reading session

Kanasapathy Chetty Selvanathan Charitable Trust recently organised a Bhagavad Gita reading session. The session was hosted by Sunandaji, daughter-disciple of Swami Parthasarathy at the Buddhist Cultural Centre.
Living is an art, skill, technique that needs to be learnt and practiced. The Bhagavad Gita presents the eternal principles of life and living which transcend race or religion. The principles equip one with a strong intellect to meet the challenges of the world and achieve success and peace in all aspects of one’s life – official, social and domestic. Above all they usher one towards the ultimate perfection, the goal of spiritual enlightenment.
Sunandaji has been studying and researching Vedanta, the ancient philosophy of India for over three decades. Her clear and powerful presentation of the Bhagavad Gita in contemporary thought has been acclaimed in India and abroad. Sunandaji has also addressed prestigious corporate organizations and universities worldwide on the practical application of Vedanta in daily life.
