More chores plus more risks equals happy kids

Considering 2016 was the year Brits embraced the cosy Danish concept of hygge, then 2017 may be the year in which we tire of candles and adopt the rougher and readier Dutch version: gezelligheid.
For while hygge has been hijacked to flog cashmere blankets and luxury log burners, gezelligheid, according to Michele Hutchison, a British writer who moved to the Netherlands in 2004, is simply 'a biscuit tin on a table and a mug of coffee. It's hot chocolate or pea soup and the sound of lively chatter with anoraks drying in the hall'.
She also thinks it's the key to explaining why a 2013 Unicef study found that Dutch children are 'the happiest in the world'. British kids came a lowly 16th.
In this entertaining new book, co-written with another expat mum, Rina Mae Acosta, Hutchison says that: 'The Netherlands has a reputation for being a liberal country with a tolerance of sex, drugs and alcohol, yet beneath this lies a closely guarded secret: the Dutch are actually fairly conservative people. At the heart of Dutch culture is a society of home-loving people who place the child firmly at the centre.
'Parents have a healthy attitude towards their kids, seeing them as individuals rather than as extensions of themselves. They understand that achievement doesn't necessarily lead to happiness, but that happiness can cultivate achievement.'
The duo's book on the joys of going Dutch will be a relief to any parents who felt shamed by Pamela Druckerman's 2012 paean to formal Gallic childrearing, French Children Don't Throw Food. There's a very funny passage in which the authors cringe at the noisy, sprawling games their kids enjoy on a French beach while the local children all sit quietly on their towels. But they also pity those perfect French children raised as 'mini adults', who miss out on delights and empowering life lessons learned through free-range play.
