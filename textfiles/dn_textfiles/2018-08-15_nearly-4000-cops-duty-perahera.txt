Nearly 4,000 cops on duty for perahera

The Sri Lanka Police will deploy nearly 4,000 officers in Kandy on duty during the Esala Perahera.
They will be deployed under 16 zones under the supervision of 31 commissioned officers, a police spokesman said.
They have been drawn from the STF, police kennels unit, mounted police division, intelligence and life-saving units, he said.
The contingent included officers from the Kandy division as well as from other divisions in the country.
Kandy SSP N.M. Sisira Kumara said instructions would be issued to the contingent through supervisory officers to ensure maximum public security and render other duties efficiently during the perahera season.
He said special operations’ rooms have been set up under police public relations offices to provide security to people visiting Kandy to witness the perahera. These offices would come under appraisal and those rendering an efficient service would be rewarded.
All bars and liquor shops in Kandy would be closed until August 26, Kandy Excise Superintendent Shyeman Ratnayake said. Raids would be conducted to nab those flouting the ban on liquor sales during the perahera season.
All beef and meet stalls in Kandy will also remain closed during the perahera season, said Kandy’s Municipal Commissioner Chandana Tennakoon.
