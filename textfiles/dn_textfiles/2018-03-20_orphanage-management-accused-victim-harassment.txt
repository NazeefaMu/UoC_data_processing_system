Orphanage management accused of victim harassment

The Gangodawila Magistrate’s Court has ordered the National Child Protection Authority to open an investigation into whether the management of a Dehiwala orphanage intimidated victims in a sexual abuse case.
A former male employee of the Children’s Home in Dehiwala was recently charged with sexually harassing and abusing 18 young women who were living at the children’s institution.
However, the NCPA officials accuse the foundation that runs the orphanage of intimidating the victims and discouraging them from testifying.
NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera has appeared in court twice on the victims’ behalf.
Earlier this month, the Magistrate ordered the NCPA police division to open investigations relating to the violations of the provisions of the Victims of Crime and Witness Protection Act.
The NCPA sources say they believe that the Children’s Home management had engaged in slandering and blaming the victims.
