Alcazabar all the way

Alcazaba the cover girl of the Royal Turf Club conjured up yet another magical performance to win the plum of the Spring Racing Season - The Governor’s Cup on the 28th at Nuwara eliya horce race track.
The 8 year old chestnut mare owned by Ms. Deepthika Jayakody and Mrs. Purni Edwards stormed home to give jockey Kuldeep Singh an armchair ride to victory. Trainer S. D. Malesh who topped the championship honours has done a great job in keeping Alcazaba in the pink of condition right through her Spring campaign.
The Royal Turf Club In Nuwara Eliya has really done a remarkable job in staging a successful, competitive and entertaining Spring Racing Season which was punctuated with four race days and now that they have earned themselves a Ten Year Lease on what must surely be one of the most picturesque racecourses in the world they have got just the platform they need to take Racing in Lanka to the next level.
And what a curtain call was laid on by RTC for Turfites on this last Saturday of April, the last day of the Racing Season. The Mayor’s Cup, The Queen’s Cup and the Governor’s Cup provided an absolute mouthwatering Card and there were thrills and excitement all around.
Krabi owned by Mr. Dhanwardene Guruge set the ball rolling with Frenchman Charles Perkins riding her to a hard fought victory. He slowed the pace from the start and then after being passed came back with a second run to land the spoils.
Nuwara Eliya is one of the greenest hillstations you will ever see and the Honourable Mayor has worked very hard towards that. Hence it was only fitting that the mayor’s Cup should be won by mare named GO GREEN. Owned by Mr. David Anthony and ridden by Ramu Go Green was trained by S. Aloysious.
Hasanga Jayaratne meant business and bringing down the top Indian jockey A. Imran Khan for the day paid Rich dividends with His horse Another Ace acing the opposition the Queen’s Cup. Trained by Manishraj Sethi, Another Ace won well from Celestial Fire who was a gallant second.
The last race of the day and the season gave Mr. Hasinga Jayaratne a well earned double when his bay mare Waiting For Glory took over the running at the top of the straight and skated home in impressive fashion.
It was a beautiful sunny day at the Royal Turf Club I. Nuwara Eliya And it belonged to Alcazaba truly the champion of the Little England Turf.
