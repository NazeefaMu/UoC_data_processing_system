Tharanga century seals Super Four final for Galle

Sri Lanka batsman Upul Tharanga played a superb captain’s innings of 124 off 122 balls inclusive of 13 fours and 3 sixes to guide Galle to an emphatic 75 runs win over Colombo in the Super Four Provincial
limited over final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. Winning the toss and batting first Galle posted a challenging score of 320-7 in 50 overs with another Sri Lankan batsman Sadeera Samarawickrama contributing an attractive 62 off 71 balls and sharing a second wicket stand of 125 with Tharanga. Spinner Lakshan Sandakan was the pick of the Colombo bowlers ending up with four wickets although being on the expensive side conceding 66 runs off his 10 overs.
Colombo began on a positive note with opener Shehan Jayasuriya contributing an aggressive half century off 40 balls (9 fours) but could not sustain the required run rate as wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals. They were finally dismissed for 245 in the 45th over with left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara and off-spinner Nishan Peiris finishing with three wickets apiece.
Scores: Galle 320-7 in 50 overs (R Rambukwella 22, U Tharanga 124, S Samarawickrama 62, D Shanaka 31, C de Silva 26, B Rajapaksa 29 n.o., L Sandakan 4/66)
Colombo 245 in 44.2 overs (S Jayasuriya 51, Kamindu Mendis 41, Angelo Perera 40, Thisara Perera 26, W Hasaranga 31, N Peiris 3/57, M Pushpakumara 3/31, D Shanaka 2/24)
