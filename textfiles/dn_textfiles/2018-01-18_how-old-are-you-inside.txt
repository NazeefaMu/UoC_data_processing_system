How old are you, INSIDE?

It’s true. Three months a year I live in the green hills of Nuwara Eliya. It’s also true that I am often asked if the best of my work is written in the lush surroundings of the Pidurutalagala mountains. Alas, No. I write amidst the heat and dust of Colombo often late into the night with only the stars to keep me company. But apparently, I’m doing it wrong. For, Toni Morrison who won the Nobel Prize in 1993 does it the other way around. She writes at 4am.
Morrison who turns 87 this February has many literary laurels in her name including a Pulitzer in 1988 for Beloved, the Nobel in 1993, and, in 2012, the presidential medal of freedom, from her friend Barack Obama. Being America’s most venerated living writer does not, however, stop a person wanting to look good in pictures. As an interviewer from the Guardian describes her in an article written in 2015, “Of all the mantles that have been foisted on Toni Morrison’s shoulders, the heaviest has to be “the conscience of America”. It’s both absurd-sounding and true. For almost half a century her subject has been racial prejudice in the United States, a story that she has told and retold with a steadiness of rage and compassion. Her latest novel, God Help the Child, is her 11th and when I arrive at her apartment in Tribeca, Lower Manhattan, America’s Conscience is having her eyebrows drawn on. “For the photographer,” she explains with a chuckle.” Later, she tells the photographer: “We did makeup for you. I have eyebrows and everything,” then add: “You lose all that stuff … ” The implied second half of that sentence is “when you reach my age”.
And, it is natural that beauty and the concept of self-image are on her mind as at the centre of her new book is a striking, dark-skinned woman called Bride who tries to shield herself from her own past with surface beautification. A love story unfolds, precariously, between her and Booker, a scholarly young black man adrift in grief for a dead brother. He tells her: “scientifically there’s no such thing as race, Bride, so racism without race is a choice. Taught, of course, by those who need it, but still a choice. Folks who practice it would be nothing without it.”
It was a similar belief that began her publishing career 45 years ago. She has always talked about her first novel with disarming simplicity: it was the book she wanted to read and that did not exist. So, as a single working mother of two small sons, she rose at 4am every day and wrote it. Published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is the story of Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl who prays for blue eyes. Morrison wrote in a 2007 foreword that she wanted to focus “on how something as grotesque as the demonisation of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child; the most vulnerable member: a female”.
Describing her writing schedule which begins early in the morning she says writing before dawn began as a necessity. “I had small children when I first began to write and I needed to use the time before they said, Mama—and that was always around five in the morning… I always get up and make a cup of coffee while it is still dark—it must be dark—and then I drink the coffee and watch the light come. And I realized that for me this ritual comprises my preparation to enter a space that I can only call nonsecular . . . Writers all devise ways to approach that place where they expect to make the contact, where they become the conduit, or where they engage in this mysterious process. For me, light is the signal in the transition. It’s not being in the light, it’s being there before it arrives. It enables me, in some sense.”
She adds, “I tell my students one of the most important things they need to know is when they are their best, creatively. They need to ask themselves, What does the ideal room look like? Is there music? Is there silence? Is there chaos outside or is there serenity outside? What do I need in order to release my imagination?”
Most writers claim to abhor labels but Morrison has always welcomed the term “black writer”. “I’m writing for black people,” she says, “in the same way that Tolstoy was not writing for me, a 14-year-old coloured girl from Lorain, Ohio. I don’t have to apologise or consider myself limited because I don’t [write about white people] – which is not absolutely true, there are lots of white people in my books. The point is not having the white critic sit on your shoulder and approve it” – she refers to the writer James Baldwin talking about “a little white man deep inside of all of us” and denies she has one. “Well I never really had it. I just never did.”
She thinks this is because she grew up in Lorain, where the neighbourhood was racially mixed: Poles, Italians and Jews as well as African Americans. But others think its less to do with demographics and more to do with her own supreme self assurance. It was this that propelled her to Howard University and then on to Cornell, where she completed a master’s in literature. It was this self assurance, too, that gave her the courage to split from her husband when she was pregnant with her second child and, that made her such an iconoclastic force as an editor at Random House where she propelled works by black writers into the mainstream. Finally, of course, she herself became one of the publishing house’s most cherished names.
Some time ago, when Morrison was interviewed by her friend Hilton Als, the writer and critic, she told him that now she’s in her 80s, there are three things she gets to say. One is “No”. The other is “Shut up”. And the third is “Get out”. In other words, she has earned her right not to do what she doesn’t want to do. That includes writing a memoir, even though she signed a two book contract with Random House that included one. “But then I cancelled it,” she says. “My publisher asked me to do it, but there’s a point at which your life is not interesting, at least to me. I’d rather write fiction.”

“Some people just close when they get old,” she explains further. “But if you’re open, if you have been, you can rely on the lived wisdom of the elderly. It’s not the book learning, it’s the lived wisdom. I ask friends of mine, ‘How old are you, inside?’, and they always know. I know that I am 23. There’s a moment when you just arrive.” Or rather, to quote Alison Flood, “in Toni Morrisons’s case, there are many moments – at 84 going on 23, she continues to arrive.”
