MPs’ clash averted

Ministerial Security Division personnel yesterday averted a clash between Puttalam district Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and State Minister Palitha Range Bandara while an election was being held at Anamaduwa Multipurpose Cooperative Services Society to elect 92 members.
A heated argument broke out between them after State Minister Range Bandara leveled allegations at the Cooperative Inspector in charge of the election that many members have been deprived of their right to vote at the election and corruption and irregularities reigned the election process. The State Minister contacted the Commissioner of Cooperatives over the phone and informed him that many irregularities were taking place at the election.
