United Motors Lanka launches after Sales Mobile App

United Motors Lanka in another pioneering venture recently launched the first after sales mobile application for the vehicle industry in Sri Lanka.
In an attempt to further engage with its trusted customers this mobile app will enable customers to reserve appointments for servicing and mechanical repairs, call in for 24/7 breakdown assistance, order spare parts and reach the United Motors network at their convenience.
United Motors Lanka PLC is proud to introduce this innovative, easy-to-use mobile app to all its customers. The app was developed keeping in mind the needs of different vehicle owners and with maximum accessibility and convenience.
The mobile app which is available currently for all Android and iOS users has a secure login designated for each user. Once users have created a new account, basic details and vehicle specifications need to be added. Thereafter using any of the features is as simple as it gets.
Connected to Google maps, the app immediately identifies the user’s location and links it with nearest service station. In the event of a collision, the app takes customer convenience a step further with a one-touch dial to any insurance company. It also has the ability to upload images of the damage and send it directly to the insurance company.
The spare parts module of the app allows users to purchase a range of genuine parts or check stock availability and place orders. A comprehensive branch network directory will allow users to access the nearest branch with ease.
The app also keeps a detailed history of bookings, services and purchases for easy reference.
Making the app truly versatile, an inbuilt search engine also allows users to locate the nearest ATM, hospital, gas station or police station. Users can also get technical advice from motor experts and share their views and concerns on the app’s user forum. The app also provides up-to-date information on all the latest promotions and offers.
