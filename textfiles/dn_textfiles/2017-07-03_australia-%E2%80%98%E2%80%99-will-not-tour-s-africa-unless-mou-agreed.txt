Australia ‘A’ will not tour S. Africa unless MOU agreed

SYDNEY: Players will boycott an Australia A tour of South Africa this month in an escalation of their bitter dispute with Cricket Australia unless a new pay deal is agreed, the Australian Cricketers' Association said Sunday.
The players' union held an emergency meeting in Sydney where they decided to take action for the tour beginning on July 12 unless a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with CA by Friday.
ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said a “significant breakthrough” was needed for the South Africa tour to proceed.
The latest development in the stalled pay dispute comes after both parties failed to reach an agreement on a new MOU before Friday's deadline after months of protracted negotiations.
It leaves as many as 230 male and female players unemployed and threatens fixtures including this year's prestige home Ashes series. AFP
