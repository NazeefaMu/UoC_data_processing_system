Strength of togetherness

The destiny of Sri Lanka is being wrought by its households and school rooms even though insufficient attention is being paid to this important fact.
The Prime Minister has stated that the government is intent on providing a basket of goodies that could be covered by the family budget of working-class families. It is indeed laudable that a Family Budget Unit will be of help in the sphere of the home economy of families to ‘look into solving the economic issues faced by families in the country and look into a family’s expenditure, income and the ways in which the country’s economy impacts individual families’ as the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said speaking at the new Family Budget Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which would look into the family economy which held its inaugural meeting at Temple Trees some time ago.
As the Prime Minister pertinently observed “the cost of living, while needing to emphasize on essential food items, today, home expenditure includes not only essential foods, it includes many other expenses: transport, clothes, tuition fees, telephone bills, rent, pre-school fees, etc… And some families spend more money on these than food. The Prime Minister had further said, “We have prepared a developing economy for the people so that they can live. We have given them many concessions and we will take a look at these once again and the government will adjust these subsidies according to the available finances. This will be important for the new unit”. (Daily News, Friday, February 9, 2018).
Sense of family responsibility
Yet, it needs to be understood that a seemingly solid economic base to ensure ‘solving the economic issues faced by families’ will only lend itself to the possibility of solving some issues faced by families. That means that the financial cover alone will not ensure a secure, socially viable and civically and physically healthy family. While the financial cover needs to be provided, the person/s handling the finances should be able to see to its proper expenditure on the various objects and matters for which the finances are meant.
Many families that have financial and economic security yet break down because of other factors, relationships breaking down and illicit, immoral, selfish intrusions creeping into stable marriages. The rotten fringes of the decadent middle and upper classes and the rich blindly accept these illicit alliances and approve of them.
There are also not only familied couples with children but also widows and widowers who earn three hundred thousand rupees and more a month who are so miserly that they do not even spend for the clothes needed by the children. They are worshippers of mammon who do not know their parental duties nor the values of life to live by. Such people are also least concerned about a poor relative or a neighbour in dire need. These have to be brought to their senses that they may live humanly.
It is very vital that there be a solid sense of family and moral responsibility on the part of the husband and wife, for the initial, young and growing family so that the available finances will be properly apportioned and spent while a portion is systematically set apart for an unexpected and unavoidable contingent expenditure and for the inevitable rainy day. As the children grow, some of them even in childhood reach a sense of responsibility.
There was a very poor widow with two girls of eleven and nine years of age. When the children who were in a Convent’s small orphanage of fifteen girls managed by nuns went back home for the holidays, they found that thieves had robbed the meagre belongings of kitchen utensils they had. The two poor children saw that their mother was in a dilemma; even the iron disc on which the ‘roti’ was roasted had been robbed. The two children went out of the small hut, huddled together for a while and came back and told the mother, “Amma, don’t be sad about not being able to give us a roti to eat. We will be satisfied with a cup of plain tea without sugar”. The children had imbibed some values of life from their poor mother and from the nuns of the orphanage.
Many mess-up marriage
Not all getting married are inwardly equipped, psychologically, emotionally, morally, spiritually and economically, and ready to responsibly handle the varied situations and eventualities that crop up in married and family life. While many consider the breakdown of a marriage and family life as a sad event which could have even been avoided, some highly educated people in the highest echelons of their professions and highly placed politicians who have been abysmally unprepared for married and family life, go to endless lengths to justify their irrational and despicable actions.
Among these are also ‘legal luminaries’ to whom self-evident values need further proof. They make a mess of their own marriage and family and destroy that of others. Funnily and tragically they become socially insensitive and irresponsible that their indifference to moral values is appalling.
Those getting married should be helped to find meaning in a loving partnership in life with a spouse and in raising a family through procreating and the upbringing of children. In finding meaning one gets energized and motivated in that forward flow of inner energy to achieve goals that one sets with great sobriety for oneself.
Indifferent agencies of state
The situations of life with children add burdens on the married couple. The enfeeblement or death of one’s spouse, when the children are young, could even turn out into a problematic situation to be handled alone without any help. If the State would intervene to help in such situations, the lives of children will not only be saved from many a trauma, they could positively flourish and benefit society. The agencies of the State and those at their helm have thus far remained indifferent and not yet matured enough in their social conscience to positively intervene to nurture the lives of children fallen into an unexpected tragic situation.
Therefore it is here that the State could insist that those intending to enter married life undergo a compulsory pre-marital preparation and come to an awareness of the responsibilities incumbent on initiating a life in partnership and be ready to face the challenges of blooming into a new family, society’s basic nuclear community. Such a preparation should also include among other things, the wise and economic handling of finances and avoidance of wasteful expenditure.
Failures due to unpreparedness
Due to lack of proper preparation, including the inability to responsibly handle the family income, many marriages fail. The government could take steps to prevent that. Presently, it is easier to get a license to marry than to get a license to drive a three-wheeler!
In 1981 at an International Seminar on Family Services convened by the late Fr. Mervyn Fernando, recommendations were made to the government to institute a compulsory pre-nuptial instructions programme of at least 12 to 15 hours along with a six month paid leave of absence to those who give birth to children as such care of infants was of utmost importance. Nissanka Wijeratne, a very knowledgeable minister, was the chief guest at the concluding sessions. Subsequently, three months paid leave came to be granted to child-bearing mothers who were working. However, the equally important pre-nuptial instruction programme has not got off the ground. Perhaps governments do not know how to go about it.
In any case, the Catholic Church and a couple of other Christian Churches are preparing their faithful before they enter into a life partnership in marriage. Christians intending to get married know that they are obliged to undergo this pre-nuptial preparation. If the others too get to understand the many benefits that could be gained from such a preparation, they would willingly participate in such a preparatory programme.
Let the government see that those who handle the family budget are indeed in every possible way equipped to do so and that money intended for family welfare is not squandered in other ways by people unprepared to handle family finances. Those who have more than enough need to be educated about values, in other ways.
