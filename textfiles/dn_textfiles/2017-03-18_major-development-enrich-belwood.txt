Major development to enrich Belwood

The government is to develop the Belwood as a leading fine arts centre in the country.
Initially, Rs. 199 million will be spent on the development project, Central Province NYSC Director Kumuduni Rajapakshe said.
She was addressing a press conference at the Devon Hotel in Kandy.
New classrooms and practical training centres would be added to the centre under the programme, she said.
Hostel facilities would also be added for 200 students of both sexes. A new three-storey building would also be added. The Belwood Fine Arts School on a 20-acre picturesque land in Hewaheta was pioneered by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when he was Youth Affairs Minister in the 1970s.
