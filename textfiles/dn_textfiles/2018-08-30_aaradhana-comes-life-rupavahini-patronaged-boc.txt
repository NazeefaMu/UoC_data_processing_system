Aaradhana comes to life on Rupavahini patronaged by BOC

“Aaradhana”, a Musical program produced by Sri Lanka Broadcasting Co-operation (SLBC) which is dedicated to Sri Lankan classical music, came to life on the Rupavahini channel with the patronage of Banker’s to the Nation, Bank of Ceylon.
“Aaradhana”- “an invitation to enjoy Sri Lankan classics” is a musical program which was aired on SLBC, which has been paying tribute to Sri Lankan classical music for forty years and the Bank of Ceylon has been the sole sponsor for the program ever since. Taking the program to a whole new level, the Bank of Ceylon then sponsored to telecast the program through Sri Lanka Rupavahini Co-operation beginning from March 2018, engaging classical music enthusiasts across the country.
The very first program to take to the stage live was the one staged at the Bank of Ceylon Auditorium with the participation of maestros of music Victor Rathnayake, Dayarathna Ranathunga, Sunil Edirisinghe and Neela Wickramasinghe. The second live performance took place at “Nelum Pokuna” auditorium on August 10, in line with the Bank’s 79th Anniversary celebrations.
The second “Aaradhana” was presented by maestro T.M. Jayarathna, Somathilake Jayamaha, Amarasiri Peiris and Deepika Priyadarshani Peiris. It was evident from the feedback received by the organizers that both programs were warmly received by classical music enthusiasts opening a new platform for true Sri Lankan classics to re-emerge and restore its proper place. The first episode of the latest live program will be aired on August 31 and will continue to telecast the other episodes on September 21, October 19 and November 30, on Rupavahini from 10.30pm on wards. The Bank together with SLBC and Rupavahini Corporation invite enthusiasts of Sri Lankan classical music to stay on course and enjoy.
