EU, FAO conduct seminar on nutrition improvement

A two-day seminar under the theme A recipe for change – Improving nutrition through agriculture and food systems in Sri Lanka, hosted by the European Union (EU) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), was held recently in Colombo.
The seminar focused on creating wider awareness on the current nutrition conditions in Sri Lanka. It provided a platform for mutual exchange of critical knowledge on the relationship between nutrition, agriculture and food systems.
In addition, the seminar highlighted the need to re-evaluate how nutrition is addressed, both in terms of planning and implementing activities, while emphasising the key role of agriculture and trade.
The seminar also highlighted the expertise of certain key participants such as the Agriculture Ministry and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, to assimilate data on the best methods to address nutritional challenges in Sri Lanka. Recent data from Sri Lanka, state that improvements in the nutrition status of the population do not reflect the economic growth experienced over the past decade.
The prevalence of obesity and non-communicable diseases are on the rise, while malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies persist. By focussing on food systems and improving methods of food production; collected, stored, transported, transformed and distributed; greater results on improving diets and health, could be achieved.
Nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems is an approach that seeks to maximise agriculture’s contribution to nutrition.
Speaking on the occasion, Head of Cooperation of the Delegation to the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Libuse Soukupova said, “The seminar is just one example of the efforts of the FAO and the EU in Sri Lanka, to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems. We will continue to foster linkages, create partnerships and develop capacity to support Sri Lanka in overcoming the challenges it faces in this regard.”
The importance of nutrition in human development was also highlighted by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 2; end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
“Nutrition is unfinished business from the Millennium Development Goals and must be addressed if Sri Lanka is to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and reap the full benefits of its economic development,” said FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Nina Brandstrup. “Agriculture and well-performing food systems are key components of the solutions to Sri Lanka’s nutrition challenges," she added.
The Seminar was a part of the Food and Nutrition Security Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) programme, which is a policy assistance facility by the European Union and the FAO.
FIRST Policy Officer for Sri Lanka Itziar Gonzalez, highlighted the importance of finding integrated solutions to combat malnutrition, emphasising that the food and agriculture sectors are uniquely positioned to provide solutions that are based on an understanding of the multi-sectorial causes of malnutrition.
