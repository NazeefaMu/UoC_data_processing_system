FCID completes 12 cases, 89 forwarded to Attorney General

Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has received 335 complaints so far and 12 cases have been filed in the High Court, Police media spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Gunasekara said 89 cases have been forwarded to the Attorney General’s Department, 115 cases have been either closed or directed to another institution and 131 cases are under investigation. He further said the reasons for the delay in prosecution was because they also need the support of some foreign countries to complete the investigations.
“We have sent 86 requests to 25 countries and we have received responses to around 36 requests so far”, he said. When questioned about the Nallur shooting and that Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan had contradicted the statement made by the police that the shooting was neither planned nor aimed at the Judge, SP Gunasekara said as the investigations are under way, he cannot make a statement regarding the incident. When asked whether complaints filed by Joint Opposition were not investigated by the FCID, SP Gunasekara said the 131 cases that are under investigation include complaints that the JO filed.
Responding to a question about Police arresting the protesters against Trinco Oil Tank deal and not the thugs who were present, SP Gunasekara said he received no complaints that the protesters were assaulted either by police or by some others who were present.
“If police assaulted a protester, he can complain to a higher ranking police official.And if he was assaulted by some other people, he can file a complaint to the police station.
We cannot do anything without a complaint and so far we have not received any such complaint”, he said.
