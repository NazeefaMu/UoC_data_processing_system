Rasa to tantalize your senses

It was the great Freddie Mercury who sang the lyrics of ‘Radio Ga Ga’
“I'd sit alone and watch your
light
My only friend through teenage
nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio…..
You gave them all those old time stars,
Through wars of worlds - invaded
by mars
You made 'em laugh - you made
'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly….
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio….”
Indeed in Sri Lanka these lyrics are true. Radio, in this island is still one of the most popular sources of information and entertainment. Daily News recently attended the Launch of ‘Rasa’ the newest Radio Channel in Sri Lanka.
This radio channel promises to be a Sinhala Radio Channel with a difference. Rasa can be tuned into on 99.5FM and 99.7FM. “On June 30, Rasa will be broadcasted. Rasa will be added to Sky Media Networks FM channels, bringing the total up to three – Rasa FM, Sith FM and Red FM (English Radio Channel). In addition to this I must also say that we have a news channel also called NEWS 24. The other channels Sith and Red FM I must say have become immensely successful in a short period of time and for this we at Sky Networks are immensely proud,” said Chairman/ Managing Director of Sky Media Networks Niranga Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi is convince that Rasa FM will become a success as it is aimed for the entertainment of the masses. He guaranteed that Rasa FM will attract a loyal and devoted audience.
“A lot of research has been done and there was a favorable response, and we firmly believe that Rasa FM will really make an impact on the FM Channels,” added Hettiarachchi. Chief Executive Officer of Sky Media Networks Chaminda Wickramasinghe said that the main intention of Rasa FM is to rekindle the taste of the audiences. “There have been radio channels in the past that have appealed to audiences and that is a truth. But with Rasa FM what we want to do is to make a difference. However I feel that they have gone off track. They have not kept up with the youth of this country. When it comes to the youth, they have lost that appeal. And they have kept up modernism or with the changing times and have not upgraded themselves creating a chasm between them and the audiences,” said Wickramasinghe Wickramasinghe went on to say that Rasa FM has address these issues and will be a channel that the young crowd will take great pleasure in.
“Sith FM and Red FM, is in the top 10 radio channels in Sri Lanka. These channels have a devoted following. I feel the Rasa FM will even be more successful than both these channels. I also feel that Rasa FM will be a great strength to Sky Networks. It is our ambition to make all three radio channels great. These three channels – Sith, Rasa and Red will really change how radio is viewed,” explained Wickramasinghe.
Program Manager at Sky Media Networks, Chathuranga Thenuwara, said that over the years’ perceptions have been changed when it comes to FM channels. In way what we want to do is to bring back the prestige and glamor back to FM channels. Our success lies with the discerning crowd. We want a revival.
"And we do feel that we have a loyal following and I am not trying to boast here,” said Thenuwara.
