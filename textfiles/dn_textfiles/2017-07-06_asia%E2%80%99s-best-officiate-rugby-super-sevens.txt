Asia’s best to officiate in Rugby Super Sevens

Two of Asia’s best referees are expected to officiate in the Rugby Super Sevens franchise team’s first leg in Kandy on July 8 and 9. The two overseas referees are Just Wang (Singapore), a qualified referee who has blown at many international games and has good experience. Matt Rodden of New Zealand is the other. He became the first Hong Kong-based referee to officiate the series on a permanent basis. The New Zealander was chosen as one of 21 members in the refereeing panel and was in charge of four legs – Wellington, Sydney, Hong Kong and Singapore.
But according to sources he is doubtful as he has informed late last evening that while refereeing a game he had pulled a muscle. If he fails to recover he will be replaced by another overseas referee.
The two Sri Lanka referees who are tipped to handle the whistle are Irshad Cader with good experience in refereeing and Priyantha Gunaratne another senior referee.
Dinka Peries and Roshan Fernando can also be roped in. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka rugby officials are running round to clock to make things comfortable for the players and fans at Nittawela.
