Legal action against those with dual citizenship: Gammanpila

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said he means to take legal action against those parliamentarians with dual citizenships, on the basis they had provided false information to the Election Commission.
His announcement comes in the wake of a RTI request filed with the Department of Immigration and Emigration seeking information on the number of those enjoying the privileges of dual citizenship, while functioning as parliamentarians.
On May 3, the Court of Appeal ruled that United People’s Freedom Alliance Galle district MP Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from holding seat in parliament, on account of holding dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
Kumarasinghe has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court seeking to set aside the order made by the Court of Appeal, which removes her from her seat at Galle district MP. Piyasena Gamage is set to replace Geetha as Galle district UPFA MP. 
However, the Election Commission has decided to wait until the Supreme Court makes a judgment on the appeal filed by Kumarasinghe, before appointing anyone to the seat left vacant.
