Tribute to Dr Lester James Peries: Long-lived revival

As the curtain falls in years and decades, the living episodes become history. And history evolves too. The Ceylonese Independence will gradually become a distant history in three decades when it reaches the centennial milepost.
Dr Lester James Peries epitomises that distant history. In a few years – or maybe decades – he might become an obscure historical figure confined to the chronicles of cinema. The Sri Lankan cinema has gone far ahead and would be even farthest ahead in the next century. The cinema chronicles of this country will be updated with many episodes rewritten and revised. Yet the Lester James Peries episode will remain as a bulwark. For he is among the pioneers who syringed originality into the local cinema tainted with the South Indian influence.
Less than one month ago, we penned a tribute to Dr Lester James Peries on April 5 on the occasion of his 99th birthday. The sight of him in public was a luxury on the birthday as his wife, Sumitra Peries, premiered her latest film Vaishnavee. The birthday cake was cut in absentia. The legend was not to move about on medical advice.
Dr Peries enjoyed the ideal lifespan in comparison to many other artistes who had to depart the life at young ages. Although the well-wishers had not made it a habit to visit him at his Dickman's Road (later named after him) residence, Dr Peries would oftentimes share his life events. Mostly personal memoirs, but brimming with insights for any creative artiste, Lester was such an inspiration. As you enter the premises, you naturally push yourself into a hibernate mode owing to the No Horn signboard erected in front of his residence.
Quality vs quantity
Media will wallow in obituaries and tributes on Dr Peries in the next few days. What has he done to deserve such admiration? What makes him a cut above the rest? Dr Peries’ filmography includes 20 feature films and five documentaries. There are his juniors who could be accredited with a larger number of films.
It is the quality, not the quantity, that matters in the assessment of the Lester James Peries legacy. It is Dr Peries’ unconventional approach that shot him to the legend-dom. The revolutions that took place in 1956 had a great effect on the subsequent decades. Freeing from the reins of the colonial masters, Sri Lanka began its search for its own identity. The Bandaranaike policies (the Sinhala-only for instance) entered the scene in such a backdrop.
Bandaranaike cannot be considered the high priest of that cultural renaissance. He was one of them. Chitrasena, Sunil Santha, Amaradeva, Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Lester James Peries and Martin Wickramasinghe came to the forefront to capsize the cultural capsule, while Bandaranaike continued to plough the land. He did not last long though his mission did. All masters of that revolution, but one, are long gone. And the master who was on the verge of a century just left us!
Technically speaking, Rekawa (Line of Destiny), Dr Peries’ first feature film, could probably be the least sophisticated film. But it was the turning point of the Ceylonese cinema industry in its long sprint to its own identity. It was the line of destiny that bordered the country’s cinema on the plain of originality from the mere imitationism.
Breaking grounds
Rekava, officially premiered in 1956 incidentally coinciding with the Bandaranaike revolution, broke the prevailing grounds. The film was shot out of the studio premises and was confined to Ceylon. The dialogues were more natural. The storyline provoked more emotional nuances. Ultimately it went on to be the first feature-length film down the local cinema annals. It gained entry into the Cannes Film Festival in 1957 – an international honour denied for the films hitherto produced. Disappointments must have come his way, but he glommed on to his ideals. Yet, this was not consummation. Dr Peries was still experimenting with the subject.
The second feature film, Sandeshaya, was one step ahead, handling a more intricate plot outline: history. That was 1960. Three years later, Peries took over a new trial: a film based on a novel. Gamperaliya was a few steps ahead with Tissa Abeysekara (known for his natural dialogues, and a revered scriptwriter whose posthumous films continue to emerge), and Reggie Siriwardana entering the scene as writers to the screen. That was a more groundbreaking work with a number of performers such as Tony Ranasinghe, Henry Jayasena and Trilicia Gunawardane later earning a brand name in their own right. It received a widely acclaimed appreciation from the critics such as Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Reviewed Professor Sarachchandra: “At last a Sinhalese film has been made which we could show the world without having to hide our heads in shame. I want to say a great film has been made of a great novel.”
Film by film, Dr Peries planted a fresh seed in the industry. Film by film, Dr Peries introduced a new wavelength. He did not deliver art. He delivered a whole generation. That whole generation did not think outside the box. They formed a box for the industry. The likes of Gamini Fonseka, Tissa Abeysekara, Titus Totawatta and Sumitra Peries saw the light of the industry in Dr Lester James Peries’ cubicle. And that created the tunnel for emerging contemporary filmmakers such as Prasanna Vithanage, Ashoka Handagama and Vimukthi Jayasundara.
Dr Lester James Peries was the first filmmaker who led the Ceylonese cinema into an international platform. That acclaim made things easier for the subsequent Sri Lankan cinema. Film after film, Dr Peries offered lessons on how indigenousness could be employed in filmmaking. That was a gradual, yet steady, path. Regi Siriwardana cannot be more accurate when he defined ‘Rekawa’ as an ‘event of tremendous importance’. Though it may not be a masterpiece, it ushered in the tradition Dr Peries wanted to be instilled. With Rekava, the Ceylonese audience was done with the unoriginality.
We do not miss him anymore because he has contributed more than enough to the cinema industry and his legacy is still alive. Yet we miss him for he would have made it through to that coveted century in a twelvemonth.
