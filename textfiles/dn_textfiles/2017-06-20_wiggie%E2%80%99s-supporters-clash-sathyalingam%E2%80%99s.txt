Wiggie’s supporters clash with Sathyalingam’s

A tense situation prevailed in Vavuniya yesterday as two groups of demonstrators one supporting Northern Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran and the other supporting Northern Health Minister P.Sathyalingam who is in the spotlight over alleged corruption, clashed near the district secretariat.
Sathyalingam’s supporters were holding a demonstration near the Vavuniya district secretariat, protesting against the action taken by Wigneswaran against Sathyalingam during the corruption scandal.
A group of people supporting Wigneswaran came to the same location and held a demonstration prompting heated arguments between the two groups.
Police too had been called in as several persons exchanged blows following the arguments.
