Four-day endocrine conference begins today

 
The 15th endocrine conference of South Asian Federation of Endocrinologists will begin in India today.
Thirty-two globally renowned doctors/researchers from Canada, the US, UK, India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Maldives and Nepal would share their research/experience at the four-day conference. 
This was disclosed at a press briefing by Ali Jawa, President of the Pakistan Endocrine Society.
He said that the endocrine experts from SAARC region would try to formulate a joint strategy to cope with the malfunction of endocrine glands as the region has similar culture and eating habits besides similar physical appearance. 
He said the highlight of the conference would be the unveiling of the largest research study on prevalence of diabetes ever conducted in Pakistan on Saturday. 
The study has been done by collecting data of more than 19,000 subjects from across the country, interior Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Fata.
 He said the study was done by the Pakistan Endocrine Society in collaboration with the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Hyatabad Medical Complex Peshawar, University of Manchester, University of Glasgow and Khyber Medical College University. 
On the concluding day, he added, diabetes and pregnancy guidelines will be launched for guiding the doctors.
The guidelines have jointly been developed by the endocrine societies from all South Asian countries. 
Dr Jawa said another feature of the conference is that an international diabetes excellence academy conference is being organised in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar. 
A postgraduate diabetes certification course will also be organised. It will be attended by more than 70 medical consultants from across the country.  The course will be followed by pre-summit training workshops for doctors in osteoporosis, medical nutritional therapy (Carbs Counting/DAFNE), women health panacea, research methodology and medical writing, and value of wellbeing and goal setting in a doctor’s life. 
The Pakistan Endocrine Society (PES) president said the PES is a non-profit organisation and has actively been involved in promoting educational and research activities in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism by giving research and travel grants to young fellows to pursue their career in endocrinology since its formation in 2001. 
PES, he added, is the only body of medical professionals in the country that has 495 members with specialised training in adult and paediatric endocrinology. 
President, SAFES, Dr S Abbas Raza said: “Our vision for SAFES is to keep our focus and support on region-specific issues to help elevate the care standards to the level of developed world. There is a dire need to accelerate the pace of our work because of rising prevalence, complexity and severity of diabetes and metabolic disorders.”
