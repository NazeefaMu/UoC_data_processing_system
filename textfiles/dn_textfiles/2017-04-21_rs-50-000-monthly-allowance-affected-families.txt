Rs. 50, 000 monthly allowance for affected families

The Government today decided to pay a monthly allowance of Rs 50,000 to each family that has been evacuated from the high-risk area around Meethotamulla garbage dump, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S. S. Miyanawala said.
He said about 150-160 families would receive the monthly allowance for a period of three months. The allowance is provided for the evacuated families to rent a house until permanent houses are provided.
The families who were given permanent houses in the housing complexes coming under the Urban Development Authority would not be entitled to this payment.  
Houses were handed over to members of sixty families whose houses were completely damaged at the Meethotamulla tragedy earlier today based on a decision taken at a Progress Review Meeting held on provision for relief to the victims.
The decision was reached under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a Progress Review Meeting held this morning.
