Arjun Aloysius arrives before PCoI again

 
Former Perpetual Treasuries (PTL) Director Arjun Aloysius arrived before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) for the second day, a short while ago.
The Treasury Bond Commission summoned Arjun Aloysius to record a statement on the recovered call recordings which were presented before the PCoI on September 6.
The recovered call recordings revealed that Arjun Aloysius had passed sensitive inside information on the February 27, 2015 Treasury bond auction to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
