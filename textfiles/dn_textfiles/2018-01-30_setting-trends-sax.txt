Setting trends on the sax

Kumar Molligoda is an excellent Saxophonist. He is also a trendsetter when it come to the guitar and the Saxophone. Melodies features Molligoda whose success is all about hard work, dedicated practice and love for playing the Saxophone.
“I did not start my musical career with the Saxophone. I started my career on a chromatic harmonica. I started my career with my own little jazz band in 1958. I did my first radio program with the chromatic harmonica. Then from that I got into singing rock and roll. Even when I started playing guitar I started a different trend. There were other guitarists in this country, and I started playing rock and roll guitar with a different style altogether. I was the first to start that.
I was playing the guitar and singing rock and roll, and then I was asked to join a big dance band, the Manhattans dance band as their guitarist. The band was then playing at the Galle Face Hotel for weddings,” said Molligoda.
However it was the Saxophone that would really make his name. And he devoted his time to the perfection of playing the Saxophone.
“While I was playing in the band, I had this liking to play a blowing instrument. A trombone or a Saxophone. So I thought I would settle on a Saxophone. I bought an old disused Saxophone for Rs. 50 which was lying under a bed.
I then started playing and practicing on that. Later in 1963, I bought another Saxophone for Rs. 830 and within one month of playing the Saxophone, I was good enough to play for a radio program. It was in July 1958. At that time to get a radio program was very rare. That was Radio Ceylon,” stated Molligoda.
It was then that he joined a group called the Fireflies (1964). Mr. Earl Arnolda the manager of this band had heard about him playing the Saxophone and asked Molligoda to come and meet him.
“I went and met him and then he asked me to join the band. At that time there were groups known as beat groups such as the Jetliners, Cosmonauts, Red Dragons and Hellions etc. Then everybody in Colombo heard a new sound. A guitar group with a Saxophone. I started playing what was popular in America at that time. I started playing that music with this band,” said Molligoda.
Molligoda became famous for his particular sound and style of playing. On a Saxophone not everyone can get the same sound. It all depends on individual ability. You need a very good sound and a very good style to be a professional Sax player at international level.
“I was the first Saxophonist on the pop music scene and other beat groups began to copy this trend and added a Saxophonist to their line- up such as Ivan Jayaratne, Randy Peiris and Derrick Stewart.
When you listen to me playing you can’t make out the difference between me and a foreign Saxophonist, I would say very modestly. Before I entered the music scene no one cared much about the Saxophone. But when I started playing producing the sound produced by international players, then everyone started taking notice of this instrument the Saxophone,” explained Molligoda.
Before him the dance bands had Saxophonists. In dance bands there were plenty of Saxophonists. But their tone and style were old fashioned and not exciting. Therefore people began to hear a different tone and style when Molligoda started playing the Saxophone.
“With the first dance band I played I used to play guitar and not Saxophone. But I had to give up playing guitar when I started on Saxophone. After Fireflies I joined the Spitfires and then I started my own band in 1967, and later played at the Galle Face Hotel, Mascarilla night club. We were the youngest band in a night club in Sri Lanka in 1969. Our music was of a very high standard and some of the musicians in my band are now internationally famous such as drummer Junior Weerasinghe and guitarist Raja Jalaldeen,” added Molligoda.
Passion for music started at an early age for Molligoda. It ran in the family.
“My mother was a good singer of Sinhalese songs. So there was always music in our house. We always had a gramaphone in our house. And we always had a radio. That was very rare those days. That background made me passionate about music. I used to listen to the radio. My father liked Western Music and my mother liked Oriental music. We had a lot of Western records at home. I listened to the radio and they had all these jazz programs,” said Molligoda.
Molligoda firmly believes that to be a successful musician you need to be above average. When he started playing the guitar in time he made a name for himself as a rock and roll singer, appearing on Malcolm Andree’s stage shows.
“So when I started playing the Saxophone I was already well known. But the biggest hurdle for me was when I got into the Western Music Scene, the majority of the musicians were from Colombo schools and they lived in Colombo while I was from Kotte having studied in Christian College, the second oldest school in the island. I felt a bit like an outsider because I came in to a field with veteran musicians with several decades of experience.
As a saxophonist I was only a beginner compared to the musicians in the dance bands of that time. I overcame that challenge by sheer perseverance and came to the top beating many of the established musicians,” pointed out Molligoda.
Among his many tastes in music, Jazz takes pride of place. It is a way of expressing himself. He needs the freedom to express himself because jazz is all about improvisation.
“If you don’t have good taste and you are not an expert on your instrument you can’t play Jazz. Then what you play will not be acceptable.
In America there was a racial problem. The black musicians were not allowed to come up for many years. But after some time with the emancipation Jazz played by the blacks became popular and ultimately the whites had to give them a place. Today black musicians are accepted around the world as the best jazz musicians,” stated Molligoda.
However he still asserts that the bias is still there. Foreigners think he is miming.
“They think that a Sri Lankan cannot play Saxophone the way I do and they come up to me and place their ears, to the bell of my saxophone to see whether I was really playing. My message to them is that though we are Sri Lankans we are equal to them! Today we have several outstanding musicians performing in the international arena such as pianist Mahesh Balasuriya, Dinuk Wijeratne, bass guitarist Jiffry Hussein and drummer Junior Weerasinghe,” argues Molligoda.
Molligoda has made many sacrifices in his life. His devotion to the Saxophone has been physically and mentally demanding. Yet he still loves it.
“I am a self- taught Saxophonist. To be a really good Saxophonist you need to be an expert on your instrument. You need to make a lot of sacrifices. I for one lost a lot of family time. I was hardly at home and I have also missed a lot of sleep. There is a lot of physical exertion when playing Sax, because the instrument is very heavy. You also need to blow powerfully with your lungs. I blow very hard because I have to produce a good tone. After 15 minutes you are spent, and you need to play for another three hours at least. Though I am tired I keep on playing as I am used to it. You lips also get cut,” summed up Molligoda.
“This year I will be completing 60 consecutive years of active performance in the music field with 59 consecutive New Years’ Eve performances which is a record for a Sri Lankan musician. I believe that record may never be equaled or broken by any other Sri Lanka musician.”
