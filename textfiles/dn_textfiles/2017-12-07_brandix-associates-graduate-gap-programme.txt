A group of 181 Brandix associates recently completed Gap Inc.'s Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement (P.A.C.E.) programme for female workers in the apparel industry.
The programme provides workers with foundational skills, technical training and support to help them advance in the workplace and in their personal lives. Three separate graduation ceremonies have been organised to recognise the achievement.

Significantly, the P.A.C.E. programme for these associates was conducted by Brandix's own internal trainers, some of who had previously graduated from the same course.
"Gap Inc.'s P.A.C.E. programme is designed to inspire and help female employees gain the skills and confidence they need to advance at work and in life," Anusha Alles, Head of CSR & Corporate Communications at Brandix said. "P.A.C.E. graduates have progressed well in their careers and contributed more to their workplaces, their peers and their families."
Three P.A.C.E. graduates have been promoted to Group Leader and two as Technicians at Brandix Essentials; while two have been promoted as Trainee Mechanics, two as Technicians, and another two have received staff promotions at Brandix Fast Fashion, Alles disclosed.

Dilhani and Niluka Priyadarshani from Brandix Essentials, Koggala who began the P.A.C.E. course as Team Leaders and were promoted as Group Leaders ten months later; W.G.J.K. Ranwala and W.M.D.S. Wickramasinghe from Brandix Essentials, Rambukkana who began the course as Team Leaders and were promoted to Group Leader and Trainee Mechanic respectively eleven months later; S.D.
