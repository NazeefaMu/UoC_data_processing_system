The declining trend in tea production was reflected in the cumulative tea production figures from the period January to October periods between the two years 2018 and 2017 as well.
Sri Lanka Tea Board data showed that the nation tea production was 247.1 million kilos of tea in the first ten months of this year Vis a vis the 258.8 million kilos of tea in the corresponding period of 2017. This reflects a decline of 117 million kilos or a marginal 4.5% dip in the total tea production in the first ten months of this year Vis a Vis the corresponding period of a year ago. It is estimated that the year end tea crop would be in the region of 300-310 million kilos, the Sri Lanka Tea Board said.
The decline in the tea crop has been reported in all three elevations and also in orthodox and green tea categories as well.
Only the production of CTC teas has seen an increase in the period under review which is 13 million kilos or by 7.4 %
Elevation wise, the high grown teas have produced 48,993 tonnes, Medium Growns 37,448 tonnes, Low Growns, 158,517 tonnes, Green Teas 2,153 tonnes in a total of 247,111 tonnes, statistics showed.
Of the exports, in the month of October 2018, was 23.3 million kilos, which was a marginal decrease from the 25.5 million kilos for the corresponding period last year. The cumulative tea exports for the ten month period between January and October 2018 was 235.6 million kilos marginally less than the 241.3 million kilos in the corresponding period last year.
The decrease in the tea crop in this country and the unfavourable conditions prevailing in the export markets has led to this situation.
The declining trend has been observed and reflected in the bulk teas, packeted teas and tea bag- categories while there have been increases in exports reported in the instant teas and the black teas.
The export revenues have also come down with the decline in export quantities. The total revenue realized during the first ten months of this year was Rs. 192.4 billion vis a vis the Rs. 194.3 billion, a marginal drop of 1.9 billion, over the corresponding period a year ago.
