Lanka pays dearly for missed opportunities

Eliminated in group stage of ICC Champions Trophy:
Almost two years ago in September 2015, Jerome Jayaratne who was then interim head coach branded the Sri Lanka team as the worst fielding side in Asia.
At the time Jayaratane said, “We are now the worst fielding side in Asia, we were never behind Pakistan but now we have gone behind them. India proved that they were better than us and even Bangladesh are fielding better than us."
A lot of water has passed under the bridge since that remark was made and yet today the Sri Lanka team finds itself in almost the same position as we were two years ago.
Who is to blame for this malady? Sri Lanka fielding has never lowered itself to such despairing depths, not since they won the 1996 Cricket World Cup.
Prior to the ICC Champions Trophy, a lot of emphasis was placed on Sri Lanka’s fielding and fitness with several training sessions and camps held and foreign expertise got down at very great cost to Sri Lanka Cricket to iron out the deficiencies displayed on the field, but yet the problem continues to persist.
There was a lot of hype prior to the departure of the team to England that they would perform outstandingly well and even bring back the Champions Trophy. That confidence came on the back of the preparations that the team underwent at home as well as in England where they went weeks ahead to get the players acclimatized to the English weather and pitches which they would encounter in early June.
Despite all the training and fitness regimes the players were put under Sri Lanka still went into their tournament opener against South Africa without their captain Angelo Mathews who suffered a calf injury. Mathews is the most experienced batsman in the Sri Lankan middle order and his absence was sorely felt when Sri Lanka failed to chase down a target of 300 folding up from 94-1 to 203.
To add insult to injury stand-in captain Upul Tharanga despite several warnings from the two onfield umpires simply couldn’t ‘up’ the Sri Lankan over rate and paid the penalty when the ICC slapped him with a two-match ban that affectively ended his participation in the tournament unless the team made it to the semi-finals.
Tharanga’s absence was another loss to Sri Lanka because he was one of the few batsmen who showed early form by scoring a half-century against South Africa. Thankfully for Sri Lanka their next match against India was five days after and that period allowed Mathews to recover from his injury and return to the team as captain. However Sri Lanka suffered another injury to a key player when Chamara Kapugedera was ruled out of the tournament with an injured knee he suffered while training.
Mathews’ return and his experience as a leader was clearly on show when Sri Lanka stunned the defending champions India by chasing down a competitive target of 322 to win by six wickets with eight balls to spare in their second match of the tournament from Group B.
India with their solid bowling attack looked home and dry after they posted 321-6, but Sri Lanka defied all odds to reach that total thanks largely to two young batters Kusal Mendis who once again rose to the big occasion to make a fluent 89 and Danushka Gunathilaka, the surprise packet as replacement for Kapugedera who forged a 159-run stand for the second wicket with Mendis to lay the foundation for Sri Lanka’s successful run chase. Left-hander Gunathilaka played some extraordinary strokes some of them reminiscent of the great Kumar Sangakkara to score a fine 76 off 72 balls. The irony of this pair was that they were both run out when they had the Indian bowling by the scruff of their neck and a century within their sights.
Nevertheless their contributions didn’t go waste as Kusal Perera, Mathews and Asela Gunaratne carried Sri Lanka to a memorable win, much to the chagrin of the Indian players and their horde of supporters who were stunned into silence. However the win came at a cost for Sri Lanka. Kusal Perera suffered a hamstring injury while batting and had to retire hurt at 47 and later was ruled out of the tournament, thus forcing Sri Lanka to bring in a second replacement Dhananjaya de Silva for the crucial match against Pakistan. With all four teams in the group going into their final qualifying match with one win and one loss the contest virtually became a quarterfinal knockout with the winner going through to the semi-finals.
Having won and lost at the Oval in London, Sri Lanka travelled to Wales for their match against Pakistan at Cardiff. Put into bat first under overcast conditions Sri Lanka managed only 236, failing to last their full quota of overs by four balls. The odds were heavily on Pakistan to win chasing down such a moderate total and the result looked more assured when openers Azhar Ali and Fakhar Zaman posted 74 off 68 balls. At 92-1 Pakistan seemed well on course for a comfortable win and a place in the semi-finals. But a couple of bowling changes brought about by Mathews saw Sri Lanka come back strongly to capture five wickets for 45 and reduce Pakistan to 137-6. They were soon 162-7 when debutant Fahim Ashraf was run out. It was from this point onwards that things started to go awry for Sri Lanka. Within the next half hour they let the match slip out of their grasp as they put up a shoddy piece of fielding that anyone watching would have been ashamed to say that they were Sri Lankans.
Sarfraz Ahmed the Pakistan captain escaped two chances of being run out when the fielder failed to find the target after which he was put down twice – one, a dolly catch to mid-on and the other a difficult chance at deep square leg which the diving fielder lost control of. But these are catches that had to be taken at this level of cricket if you are vying for a semi-final berth in a tournament of this magnitude.
Seizing the opportunity with both hands and riding his luck Sarfraz with the help of Mohammad Amir who stuck it out for 43 balls to score a valuable 28 not out steered Pakistan to an unlikely victory from the jaws of defeat. Sarfraz who scored an unbeaten half century let out a roar as he made the winning hit - the roar could easily have come from the Lankan lion, but it was not to be their day.
Unable to hide the disappointment of Sri Lanka failing to make it to the semi-finals one irate fan wrote on Facebook, “Winning against India was as good as winning the Champions Trophy”.
One has to sympathise with Lasith Malinga who probably has played his last ICC tournament. He bowled his heart out for his country but was let down by poor fielding. Three catches were put down during the Pakistan innings all of Malinga. The veteran fast bowler couldn’t hide his disappointment when Thisara Perera dropped a sitter at mid-on off Sarfraz. Had that catch been taken Malinga had only the Pakistan tail to deal with and he is quite good at finishing off an innings.
Apart from Malinga, the most improved Lankan bowler was Nuwan Pradeep who bowled with accuracy and movement and was the pick of the Lankan bowlers in the tournament. Suranga Lakmal another bowler who has improved over the years bowled exceptionally well but without luck.
Dinesh Chandimal had a rather lousy series not living upto his talent and failing once again to deliver. One hopes that he doesn’t end up as Lahiru Thirimanne of whom there was a lot of expectations but one who has simply faded away for reasons best known to him. They were the two batsmen who were touted as the successors to Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara at one time, but have failed to live upto that belief.
In Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera, Sri Lanka has a young band of precocious batsmen to carry them through to the next decade or so with Mathews at the helm and Tharanga and Chandimal providing the experience to blend with the youth.
Everything is not lost for Sri Lanka with their exit from the Champions Trophy. The great thing is to learn from the mistakes and prepare themselves for the biggest event – the 2019 World Cup which will also be held in England. But before all that the most crucial area Sri Lanka has to concentrate on is making vast improvements in their fielding. Catches win matches is a familiar idiom connected to cricket. Sri Lanka found the true meaning of it at Cardiff.
