Kandy SC AGM on June 30

Kandy Sports Club has a record as the most successful rugby club in the country in the last two and a half decades with the most number of wins in the league and knockouts. They are the defending league knockouts, sevens 1st leg rugby champions, and are doubtful starters for the 2nd leg. However their AGM will take place on June 30 at the Lt. General Denzil Kobbekkaduwa Club house. The reputation that this club has achieved wherever the game is played has been earned as a result of the consistent success of Kandy SC team spanning over several decades right throughout the ranks from school leavers to senior players. Many famous rugby players have grown to great heights from this club not only to represent the National team, but also playing for overseas grade one teams.
Founded in 1874 Kandy SC has been the most successful Sri Lankan club after the resurgence in 1992 winning all titles offered by the parent body such as the league, knockouts and the rugby sevens on most number of times. This is one of the oldest clubs in the country with a history of 144 years.
Today, this club is an international venue with all facilities, thanks to Malik Samarawickrema. The club is gifted with all what they need with a modern club house, dressing room, tiers, restaurant, gymnasium and everything that a club requires. The game of rugby has become very popular, with the largest spectator attendance at all matches where Kandy SC is in action, since 1992, they have been dominating the game at all levels of sevens, league and knockout.
All the good work by Kandy SC has been due to Malik’s solid backing. He is a disciplinarian and a man who knows the game well having given his best for rugby at school, club, province and national levels. As in the past, he will be standing by his favorite Kandy SC team in ensuring another wonderful season. He joined the club in the early 1990s, and from the day he stepped in, Kandy SC has gone from strength to strength both in the rugby field and administration. It was he who advised and helped the officials to do up the grounds, and today it is probably the best rugby ground in the country. He was instrumental in adding the tiers right round the grounds, and the modern pavilion built by him was named after 1969 Kandy SC captain late Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa.
When Malik joined Kandy SC they had not won a single championship, though they entered the cup finals in 1954, when the tournament was only five years old and lost to CR & FC. They first won the Clifford Cup in 1992, from there onwards they have been winning championships after championships, and today this club is known as the champion rugby club home to the country’s best players. When the history of rugby is recorded at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will stand as one of the greatest administrators of this sport.
The club has won the league on 18 occasions, knockouts 22 occasions, Presidents trophy 12, and are the current League knockouts and first round sevens champions. What the club needs today is a good president.
