Anuradhapura undergoes major water crisis

Many of the tanks in Anuradhapura district have dried up. The water level of 14 major tanks including the Kalawewa reservoir is rapidly decreasing.
Irrigation and Agrarian Services Development Officials said most areas of the district received rains during last week, but it was inadequate to fill tanks.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.W. Wanninayake said the people in the district would face major crisis without drinking water if the drought conditions prevailed further. He said the Disaster Management Ministry and the WSDB (NCP) are to provide drinking water via bowsers in such situations. Large crowds are expected in Anuradhapura during Vesak and Poson.
Even though drinking water is provided via the Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks, available water at present is inadequate for large crowds arriving during the season.
