There is no shortage of the drug ‘Tamiflu’ in the country, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara, the drug ‘Tamiflu’ used to treat Influenza A (H1N1) patients is freely available in all State hospitals.
Dr. Bandara pointed out that ‘Tamiflu’ is only used for Influenza A (H1N1) patients and it is used only under the directions of Consultants. The drug is given only for patients who need it.
It is distributed among hospitals under the monitoring of the Epidemiology Unit.
The drug is supplied to State hospitals on demand without any issue under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. When State hospitals use the drug, more stocks are supplied to fill the storage in the hospital making sure that the drug is available in the hospital at all times, he added.
