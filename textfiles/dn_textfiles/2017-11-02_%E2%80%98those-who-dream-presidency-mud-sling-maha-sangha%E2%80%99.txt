‘Those who dream of Presidency, mud-sling at Maha Sangha’

Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said that those who are dreaming to become president of Sri Lanka are slinging mud at the Maha Sangha.
The minister said so addressing a gathering at the distribution of Visiri loans to low-income families at Debarawewa, Tissamaharama.
The minster said that these loans are disbursed at the lowest interest rate of five percent. He said that there was a problem in the supply and distribuition of water to the residents of Gemunupura, Ekamuthugama and Sadungama.
A sum of Rs. 4 million will be allocated for the development of this purpose. This sum of money will be obtained from the Housing and Constructions Ministry. He said that a sum of Rs. 1.83 million was given for the development of the Anjaleegala water supply project, Minister Premadasa added.
The minister further said that the resources in the country belonged to the people and not the poiticians and rulers of the country. We as politicians are only custodians of those resources and as such, it is our duty to protect them. He said that during the previous regime, rulers used them as their own resources
He added, “They have to appear for an examination after five years and that examination is the presidential and general elections. If we excel in those examinations, we would be awarded ministerial portfolios. If we fail, we would have either to go home or occupy the opposition.” “As the son of a father who donated a ran viyana to the Dalada Maligawa, I will always give due place to Buddhism,” Minister Premadasa said.
