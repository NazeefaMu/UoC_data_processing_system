‘JO, SLPP supporters still hold SLFP memberships’

Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarians or Provincial Council Members canvassing for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP, Pohottuwa) have not obtained membership in that party, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said.
The Chief Minister was addressing an SLFP rally held at Vilegoda, Ambalangoda recently.
He said political leaders requesting people to join the SLPP were still holding SLFP membership. They had abandoned President Maithripala Sirisena and embraced Mahinda Rajapaksa since they could not join the former due to their tarnished political image.
He said President Sirisena acted democratically in decision-making in his capacity as the President of the SLFP “Any political leader cannot match him. The President always makes decisions to benefit the party and the country,” he said.
