CH determined to remain in local rugby arena

In 1892 the Colombo Hockey and Football Club (CH & FC) was mooted. Its headquarters was at the Racecourse and catered to rugby with ample playing area and with well kept grounds. It pretty soon attracted some of the best exponents of the game. Before long ‘The Club’ gathered a reputation for fielding outstanding players in rugby. Many went on to play nationally and represent Ceylon (Sri Lanka). In 1962 when the Army acquired the Grandstand and the Racecourse, CH & FC moved to Maitland Crescent.
In 1959, for various reasons that prevailed at that time there clubs came together and decided to call themselves “The Gymkhana Club”.. The first chairman elect was FC Rowan. At that time the membership of the club was almost totally made up of expatriates. With the passage of time the Europeans left the shores of Sri Lanka. However, the “spirit and soul” of Gymkhana never did. Ideals and values that made it outstanding remained stronger than ever. By 1964 Sri Lankans with the same vision took the reins. The first Sri Lankan chairman was P S C Fernando in 1969. The first rugby captain in 1971 was Brian Baptist.
The CH & FC rugby team has been among the top five rugby in the island. During the stellar years of 1990-1994 they won almost all the titles and accolades for rugby.
The Colombo Hockey and Football Club as one of the oldest rugby playing clubs in the country will give out their best in this upcoming 2016/17 rugby season to stay in the local rugby arena. Due to financial crisis they had to withdraw from last year’s local rugby season.
They have last won the coveted league title in 2000 under the leadership of former Science College captain cum national third row forward Nazeem Mohamad.
CH will be strengthened by the inclusion of their vastly experienced and talented school rugby players this year around.
According to reliable sources, with rugby losing its facilities to practice and play matches on the ground due to the SLRFU changing the local rugby season which clashes now with the cricket and the professionalism coming into the game due to lot of money involvement most of their experienced players have left the club to join other clubs CH have got a very inexperienced and immature rugby squad as most of the players are schoolboys who are playing club rugby for the first time this season. They have to start all over again from zero and are in the process of team rebuilding stage. The players as a team can put up a reasonable show this season. CH players and officials don’t want any scenario to happen where they have to stop playing half way through the season like last year. CH will want to prove a point to Sri Lanka rugby lovers and club supporters that they are a strong club hence they will not give up rugby at any cost. They expect discipline to be at its best among their club players and this must be the last chance for them, so if players don’t take this year’s season seriously, then it will be a sorry scenario for CH rugby.
This year the club will be captained by one of their most experienced players in centre three quarter Chanaka Fonseka, an ex Isipathana College ruggerite.
The coaching staff comprises vastly experienced head coach in the caliber of former national captain Namal Rajapaksa and another vastly experienced former CH rugby player Anwar Jayah will function as the manager for this upcoming rugby season.
