‘Megapolis, new challenge for Lankan engineers’

Projects such as the Megapolis, of which the implementation is about to start are great openings for Sri Lankan engineers to contribute, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen at the 15th annual INCO 2017 Industrial Exhibition and Trade Fair concluded at BMICH last week.
“Projects such as the Megapolis, Colombo Port expansion, development of the region around the Hambanthota port and the Colombo financial city supported by China are great openings for Sri Lankan engineers to contribute for development,” Minister Bathiudeen said.
“Many Sri Lankan engineers have come up with innovative designs and construction plans for these projects.
Marine engineers have greatly contributed to Colombo port expansion designs,” he said. The Megapolis project which consists of a Tech City, a Logistics Area and a Marine Development Zone is one of the biggest challenges for Sri Lankan engineers.
Megapolis is expected to greatly modernize the Western province to attract large scale international investors as it is planned similar to Singapore but five times larger.
Even though the government wants to see more infrastructure development, it cannot always continue to fund large scale projects on its own. “We need to enlist private sector as well and are planning to use Public Private Partnerships (PPP).”
“For PPP, to be successful, they need to be supported by skills and technologies. In fact enhancing technological and engineering skills in Sri Lanka is important for us to ensure success of PPPs that we will be using in future,” he added.
