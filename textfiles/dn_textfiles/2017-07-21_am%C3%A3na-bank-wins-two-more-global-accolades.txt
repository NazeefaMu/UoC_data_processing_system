Amãna Bank wins two more global accolades

Amãna Bank has strengthened its market leadership position as the Best Islamic Banking and Finance Institution in Sri Lanka when it was recently bestowed with two separate international accolades by The Banker and Global Finance magazines respectively in their coveted award rankings dedicated for Islamic Banking and Finance.
This is the 4th consecutive year Amãna Bank has been recognized by Global Finance as the Best Islamic Finance Institution in Sri Lanka, while The Banker Magazine award for Best Islamic Bank in Sri Lanka, is the Bank’s second, having won it for the first time in 2016.
Both awarding institutions carry out an independent process of picking the winners which is through a rigorous process of extensive consultations with bankers, corporate finance executives and analysts throughout the world. By winning these accolades Amãna Bank has been ranked alongside other country winners who have pioneered the non-interest banking model in their respective countries such as MayBank (Malaysia & Singapore), Qatar Islamic Bank (Qatar), Al Rajhi Bank (Saudi Arabia), Meezan Bank (Pakistan), Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (UAE) and Al Baraka Bank (South Africa)
Commenting on receiving the two awards, the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said “We are extremely happy to have been recognized by these two prestigious international awarding bodies that have become trusted standards of excellence. These awards reflect our commitment to showcase both Islamic Finance and its immense potential for growth in Sri Lanka, while also placing Sri Lanka in the international map.”
