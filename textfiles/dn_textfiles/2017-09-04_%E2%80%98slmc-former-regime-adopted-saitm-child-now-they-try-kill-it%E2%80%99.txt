‘SLMC, former regime adopted SAITM child, now they try to kill it’

"The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is a child adopted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the former regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is a crime to see them now attempting to kill the child, Parents' Association Secretary of Private Medical Colleges Anura Dhanarane said addressing a press conference at its Battaramulla office yesterday.
He said the SAITM was set up after the SLMC agreed that a private institute could be set up under the provisions of the UGC Act. Those opposing it today were seeking political mileage by inconveniencing the Government.
Dhanaratna said university students, the GMOA, SLMC, Joint Opposition, left parties and trade unions had today teamed up to oppose the SAITM to topple the Government.
Dharmaratne said the Government should strengthen the SAITM by contributing towards its management and setting up standards for promote medical education.
