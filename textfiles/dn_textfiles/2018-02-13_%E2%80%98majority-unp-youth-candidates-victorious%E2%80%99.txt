‘Majority of UNP youth candidates victorious’

The majority of UNP youth candidates who contested the local government election won their their wards, President of the UNP’s youth wing Jathika Yowun Peramuna and Gampaha District Parliamentarian Dr. Kavinda Jayawardena said.
This was the outcome of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s vision to bring youth into the political forefront. Dr. Jayawardena said more than 550 youth of both sexes had contested the election on the UNP ticket.
The victory of a majority of these youth had caused a re-awakening among members of the Jathika Yowun Peramuna.
He said more and more youth would be given opportunities to contest the Provincial Council and General elections in future.
He said the country was forging on the correct path of development under Yahapalana policies and the UNP would march forward from strength to strength under the able leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He also denied rumours about any division within the UNP and said the Party would march forward boldly after identifying and correcting its mistakes.
