Health Ministry Secretary writes to Foreign Ministry Secretary on Qatar travel ban

A (H1N1) situation in Sri Lanka:
Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama had sent a letter to Foreign Ministry Secretary Esala Weerakoon in connection with the travel ban imposed by Qatar for their citizens in connection with Influenza A(H1N1) situation in Sri Lanka, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the letter explains the current condition of Influenza AH1N1 in Sri Lanka and the inappropriate travel ban imposed on Sri Lanka. The letter states that in Sri Lanka only 570 found positive for Influenza A virus from the period of January 01st to March 31 this year (2017) and only 58 positive cases found for Influenza B virus.
“Under the International Health Regulations 2005, the WHO does not advocate implementation of travel and trade restrictions against any other member states. Even the peak of Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic affecting the whole world in 2009, the WHO had not recommended travel restrictions against any other member country, the letter had pointed out.
In this background, considering the seasonal increase of Influenza activity due to Influenza A(H1N1) on par with the regional situation it does not warrant issue of travel re4strictions to Sri Lanka,” the letter stated.
Earlier Qatar Foreign Ministry urged its nationals not to travel to Sri Lanka due to health concerns. A Qatari Foreign Ministry statement stated that the Sri Lankan official authorities confirmed the spread of Swine Flu (H1N1) in Sri Lanka, and reported that a nuber of people were infected of a number of people with the disease and the death of some of them.
