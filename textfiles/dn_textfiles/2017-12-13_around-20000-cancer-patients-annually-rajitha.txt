Around 20,000 cancer patients annually - Rajitha

Annually about 20,000 new cancer patients are reported from Sri Lanka.There are about 50 oncologists in the country and it is required to double this number, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the Annual Academic Sessions 2017 of the Sri Lanka Collage of Oncologists held in Colombo recently, he said that the Sri Lankan men suffer from oral, lung and oesophagus cancers while Sri Lankan women suffer from breast, cervical and ovarian cancers. Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) is a major challenge faced by the Sri Lankan health sector.
Smoking is the leading cause for oral and lung cancer in men and therefore the tax on tobacco was increased by 90 percent. Pictorial warning of 80 percent for cigarette packets was also implemented with the same intention. Cancer treatment has been modernized and expanded, he said.
The Rs. 1.5 million limit for cancer drugs for the treatment expenses of patients was lifted, and now there is no limit for the expenses for cancer patient's drugs. Cancer screening should be done from house to house. All Asian countries should fight against cancer together, he added.
