DWC to construct more electrified fences island-wide

Human-elephant conflict:
The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is to construct 2,000 km of additional electrified fences island-wide to resolve the increasing human-elephant conflict. The island now has 3,500 km of electrified fences.
Surveying and demarcating lands for erecting fences in the Anuradhapura district is now in progress. All 22 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the district have submitted proposals in this regard. The total distance to be taken for fencing was 800 km and it will cost the government Rs. 500 m. Anuradhapura Wildlife Conservation Assistant Director Weragama said that number of proposals received on erecting fences were not practically possible since some proposed fences will cross, close or block elephant corridors and habitats. Under the Upper Elahara Canal Project, a new fence around 80 km long would be erected connecting the Ritigala and Huruluwewa reservations. It will protect the traditional elephant corridors that elephants lost due to unwarranted Chena cultivations and jungle clearing.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature is funding the project.
