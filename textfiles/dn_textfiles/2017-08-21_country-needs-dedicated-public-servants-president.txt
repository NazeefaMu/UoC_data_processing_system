Country needs dedicated public servants: President

The government will always stand by public servants who render a sincere and dedicated service according to their conscience. If any section or unit of the public service comes in for criticism, the head of the section should bear responsibility for it, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing a meeting at the Diagana Central Province Sports Complex premises to mark the presentation of land title deeds to farmer families in the Victoria and Kotmale Zones held under the National programme to award 100,000 title deeds to settlers on the Mahaweli Development Region on August 18 afternoon.
President Sirisena said for a long time the people had been disenchanted with the working of the Lands Section of the public service.
“All officials should try to learn from such unpleasant experiences and dedicate themselves towards rendering a proper public service in the present and the future land ownership was a question relating to a persons life and heritage. Enhancing of that ownership was a duty owned to the citizens of the country,” the President said.
He said the government had to contend with allegations and protests in carrying out its duties because it was a common feature in a democracy. Such allegations and protests would not occur if there was no freedom and democracy in the country.
“A period when people feared to demand their rights and politicians feared to express their point of view had been ended in the country,” President Sirisena said. “It was the duty and responsibility of all to enjoy and safeguard the democratic rights by resolving the outstanding problems of Mahaweli settlers,” the President said.
These land title deeds are presented to Mahaweli settlers on the directives of President Maitrhipala Sirisena. Almost 85 percent of the land title deed grants programme had been completed so far and the government hoped to complete this soon.
A batch of 1,300 farmers in the Victoria and Kotmale Mahaweli Zones received title deeds at this ceremony with the President making a symbolic presentation to 100 farmers. Land title deeds were also presented in respect of six places of worship.
The Maha Sangha led by Ven.Niyangoda Vijithasiri Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven.Wendaruwe Upali, Senior Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter,Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya chapter and Ven.
