Oatmeal - Combine one cup of oatmeal, 2.5 cups of water, and a pinch of salt in a microwave-safe bowl that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Bake it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes. Give it a stir midway through. When taken out of the oven, stir in about a teaspoon of butter, then let the kids add their own toppings.
Muffins - Muffins can be made ahead and frozen to use whenever you need them. Whether they are the focal point of the breakfast or you serve a mini muffin as a side, muffins can definitely be packed with great nutrition for your family.
Toast - The opportunities for creating a healthy breakfast starting with a slice of whole wheat toast are practically endless.
