Janashakthi bags inter-insurance cricket title

Team Janashakthi Insurance PLC emerged champions at the ‘Hema Wijeratne’ Challenge Trophy 2017 cricket tournament concluded at the Colombo Colts Cricket ground recently. 19 teams, including a joint team from the Sri Lanka Insurance Brokers’ Association, took part in this annual inter-insurance company six-a-side cricket tournament organized by the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute (SLII).
The victorious Janashakthi team scored 67 for no loss against Softlogic Life in the finals, which is the highest total scored by a team in the tournament. They restricted their opponents to 21/2 and sealed the victory.
Sameera Fernando from Janashakthi was adjudged the ‘Best Batsman of the Tournament’ and the ‘Man of the Final’ while the team’s Ranga Dias was crowned ‘Player of the Tournament’. Organized as part of the SLII’s vision to create a social forum for its members, this year’s event was a great success with the active involvement of senior representatives from the industry. True to the spirit of sportsmanship, the athletes used this unique opportunity to fraternize and forge bonds with one another, despite being rivals in the business world.
