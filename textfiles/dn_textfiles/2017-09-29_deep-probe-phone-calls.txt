DEEP PROBE INTO PHONE CALLS

Thajudeen murder case:
From Presidential Secretariat Office to Narahenpita Police :
The Attorney General yesterday informed Court that the CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen has initiated a comprehensive investigation into the telephone calls received by Narahenpita Police from the phones belonging to the Presidential Secretariat Office on the night of May 17, 2012.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General made this observation when the magisterial inquiry into the murder of Wasim Thajudeen was taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky, the two suspects, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera, were present in court.
They were arrested earlier over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
The CID sought a further date to submit the progress of the investigation into the incident. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for November 8.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
