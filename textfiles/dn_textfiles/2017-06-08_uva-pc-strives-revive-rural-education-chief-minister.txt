Uva PC strives to revive rural education: Chief Minister

Education in rural areas deteriorates due to the dearth of teachers. The Uva Provincial Council along with the government strives to address the issue by constructing new buildings, providing equipment and other infrastructure facilities to schools, Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake said.
The Chief Minister made these observations after opening a new laboratory at Moneragala, Thabana Primary School in the Bibile Education Zone on Tuesday.
Teachers are living Gods who develop knowledge, attitudes and skills in children, he said. The Chief Minister said the provincial council pays more attention to develop rural schools as children in rural areas find it difficult to travel to towns to obtain higher education.
The provincial council recruited 2,000 teachers recently. The council held an examination to recruit 500 primary teachers, but their appointments were withheld on a court order,” he said.
The Chief Minister admired teachers' commitment and dedication to render their service amidst lots of constraints at rural schools.
