World Cup and Ashes in 2019 :
A fantastic summer for English cricket in all forms

It is both glorious and bonkers, the cricketing summer to end all summers that will end either with unprecedented English success or crushing disappointment. Next year will see not only another Ashes series, but also a home World Cup that England are hot favourites to win.
What a feast of top quality cricket — in both Test and limited-overs formats — to look forward to, but what a concern it is too that the international calendar is now so crammed. The good news is that English cricket, without a big football tournament or Olympics to get in the way, should command maximum attention next summer. The bad is that elite cricketers are being pushed like never before, with the demands placed on them now at saturation point as the game’s greedy
administrators refuse to yield an inch in their relentless pursuit of as much money as they can muster.
The 2019 summer will not only see the domestic season beginning in April — earlier than ever — but also finds England in action as early as May 3 when they play a one-day international against Ireland in Dublin. From there it is straight to Cardiff for a Twenty20 international followed
by five 50-over games against Pakistan — England’s last chance for practice ahead of the World Cup they kick off on May 30 against South Africa at the Oval. Cricket has always made the mistake of making the World Cup too long and this one is no exception, even though the ICC have upset associate world nations by restricting it to just 10 teams.
If England get to the final they will play in what should be the game’s biggest showpiece occasion at Lord’s on July 14. There will barely be time for the open top bus parade before Joe Root and company will be donning whites and facing Ireland in a four-day Test starting just 10 days later.
Then comes the big one — with the first Ashes Test against Australia, probably including Steve Smith and David Warner returning after their bans, on August 1. The Ashes are not due to end until September 16 at the Oval.
Do not think there will then be a break either because England have not one, not two but three tours next winter to New Zealand, South Africa and Sri Lanka - and so it goes on.
Something has to give but you can be sure it will not be any of the lucrative T20 and T10 events that are springing up all over the world or even — most depressingly — the ECB’s ill-considered new format The Hundred. The best players will not give up their extra money-making opportunities so governing bodies simply have to reduce the amount of international cricket. Sadly, they won’t. However, it’s Christmas so let’s be cheery. Cricket so often gives the impression it is doomed and desperate for a ‘new’ audience, but it still has much to commend it. Next summer will show why it is still such a great game. I expect Eoin Morgan to lift the World Cup and Root to hold the urn before coach Trevor Bayliss rides off into a Sydney sunset with all the plaudits. Then we can all go and have a lie down. – Daily Mail
