There will be five Vesak zones and 11 Vesak pandals exhibited during the Vesak Week in Colombo city and strict security will be provided around them. Overcrowded vehicles, olubakkan puppet shows, loud tooting of vehicle horns, drunken driving and breach of traffic laws will be strictly prohibited during this period.

Liquor shops and bars will remain closed during the entire Vesak Week. Any liquor shop or bar involved in the sale of liquor breaching this prohibition will have their licences cancelled by the Excise Department.
