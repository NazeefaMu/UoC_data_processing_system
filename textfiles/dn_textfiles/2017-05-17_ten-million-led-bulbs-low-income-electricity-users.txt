Ten million LED bulbs for low income electricity users

The government will provide 10 million LED bulbs to 3.9 million low income electricity users in a bid to reduce their electricity costs.
Over 40 percent of electricity users in the country use less than 90 units of electricity. These households mostly use incandescent light bulbs which consume 70 percent more power than an LED bulb.
“We found that from 6.30pm- 10.30pm, electricity consumption rises significantly. We have to spend a lot to manage this demand. This high consumption is mainly due to the use of incandescent bulbs among this group,” Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday.
The minister addressing the media at the ministry said the new programme would allow those in low income groups to voluntarily switch to LED bulbs in a more cost effective manner.
“The bulbs would be ordered through an international tender process. We will assure that users are given a five year warranty period for the bulbs,” he said.
The cost of the bulb will be recovered from the users through the energy savings made in their bill within two years, the minister said.
Electricity meter readers would monitor the cost savings and make deductions, he said.
Siyambalapitiya said the new scheme would help reduce the costs of electricity to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) in four months.
The drought in many parts of the country despite the recent respite in the rains, has affected the cost of electricity. The minister said in the first four months of this year, the CEB had to bear an additional cost of Rs. 27.5 billion to meet a continuous supply of electricity.
“Our reservoirs are at 28 percent capacity. If the drought continues, by the end of June, we would have to spend at least Rs. 50 billion on oil to generate electricity,” Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister had requested the President to either cut down the tax on fuel supplied to the CEB or to cover the additional costs through the Treasury.
“The Cabinet agreed to cover some of the costs and has approved Rs. 5 billion to cover costs,” Siyambalapitiya said.
The ministry has asked farmers to use their water pumps for agricultural purposes from 10pm-5am to be eligible for a 50 percent reduction in their electricity bills.
The ministry is promoting a ‘smart metering’ system where users can voluntarily opt for a new smart meter at a cost. They will be charged according to a ‘time of the day tariff’. These users would be charged Rs. 13 per unit between 10.30pm-5.30am, Rs 25 per unit from 5.30am-6.30pm and Rs 54 unit from 6.30pm to 10.30pm.
