AMAZING RECALL

Unknown to the rest of the world, maybe in Samaria, Nazareth, Judea, Galilee, Mt. Carmel, Bethlehem etc. where the Lord preached the Word of God I was later to learn, I lived with my peasant parents who tilled their land filled with corn, wheat barley etc. from the good earth. While my mother tended to the poultry, and the few dairy cows we had, father did the heavy work and together, they put bread and butter on our table. There was nothing we lacked in our simple lives. Between their loves, I spent a happy childhood filled with joy.
I seldom saw people except for the few who crossed across amongst our land to other pastures. They were the ones who reared sheep and cattle. Many a time these animals would stray across our land and was a pleasure for me to run chase them back to their folds much to the glee of their owners who had come to recognize me as the carefree girl in the meadows who loved to cuddle their straying lamb.
Through the meadows
Life was serene and beautiful as God had created which I was to learn later from my parents as I grew up. The wonder of nature fascinated me as I wandered through the meadows and woods and heard the birds sing their lilting songs on trees. When everything was quiet I sat under a spreading tree for hours on end and daydream. Waited until I heard my father’s call reverberating across the woods and knew it was mealtime.
One summer day I saw a shepherd leading his sheep. They were big in numbers I had never seen before collectively.
I guess as he led them he never saw me. I saw him regularly and with each journey, one hundred summers passed. Unaware, a miracle was unfolding before my eyes.
Amazing in his stride and gait,
Tall and striking the shepherd’s grace
The glow in his eyes greet the morn
After the dew has settled down
For you to gently tread upon.
And wait to see thy lovely face.
You walk the day,
When sun commences his rise.
How I adore your wondrous sight
Like the meek and mild flock
You lead on,
The gentle shepherd in my heart.
The summers slipped by to time immemorial. I did not know how old my parents were. They were simple folk who believed in God I never knew.
I jerked to reality and asked myself, ‘Who is God’ my parents talked about with reverence. I had to find out. I yearned for the truth. I contemplated under a tree in solitude. I heard faint but magnificent voices rising from above. Maybe it was the answer but I was too dumb to realize that God was watching over me.
After two thousand summers, I waited to see his face with patience. I was stirred by the mystery.
Who was this shepherd?
Then I saw him coming again. My heart was filled with new found joy. With excitement ran to meet him face to face.
He stopped and stretched his hand as the sheep parted and made way for me to come in contact with him.
The shepherd had been waiting for me. He had the most beautiful kind face.
Cold breeze
I stood motionless struck by his awesome smile. His eyes were pools of diamonds and felt its rays on me. For the first time, I had tears well in my eyes as they started dripping down my face. I wanted to touch and embrace him but knew I should not. By now I had come to realize this shepherd was not a mortal. I heard the same chanting voices from afar and knew he had to move on. I made room for his pathway as he moved. A cold breeze touched my face. I had fallen deeply in love with him.
He was my saviour, my creator, Lord Jesus Christ.
It had been another long day when I saw him lead his sheep for the last time. His figure became smaller and smaller into oblivion. There was an unusual calm. I stood watching him disappear as agony ripped my heart. Already I was yearning for him.
Living for 2018 years I found imagination to be a formative genre that slots the world as viewed to eternity. There is a tragedy of going back to seek the truth. I find the summer of 2018 scattered with remnants of war that saw his sheep dying all over the world, especially in the Middle East, tossing on high seas with their loved ones lost.
The ravage of war has reduced the beautiful earth to an inferno much to the anguish of Jesus who redeemed it from sin. Air crashes, snow and bush-fire, natural and unnatural disaster, flood and drought caused by leaders in search of power. When will these atrocities stop? My parents have vanished but I go on in search of the TRUTH because I deeply love my Saviour.
