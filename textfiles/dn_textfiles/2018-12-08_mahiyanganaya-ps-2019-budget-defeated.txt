Mahiyanganaya PS 2019 budget defeated

The Mahiyanganaya Pradeshiya Sabha 2019 budget was defeated on Thursday.
Four Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members, three Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) members and seven United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members voted against the budget after the budget debate.
Six UNP members voted in favour.
The second vote will take place later.
Chairman Y. M. K. Weeraratna from the UNP said the budget 2019 was defeated in a coup.
SLFP leader K. P. Gunawardhana and Mahiyanganaya Chief SLFP Organizer told they voted against the budget since the Chairman betrayed their trust.
