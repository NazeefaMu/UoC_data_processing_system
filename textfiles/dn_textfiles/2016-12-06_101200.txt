Premier League Inter-Club Cricket  : NCC beat Bloomfield  Chandimal plays first game  after surgery

 
 NCC beat Bloomfield by nine wickets in the first round match of the Premier League Inter-Club cricket tournament match at Maitland Place yesterday but more than the win what was more satisfying from Sri Lanka’s point was that vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal declared himself fit and played his first match since undergoing surgery on his thumb.
Chandimal didn’t make any big contribution towards the win being dismissed for 3 and being 14 not out when NCC chased down a target of 104 in 10 overs.
Sandun Weerakkody led the run chase with a feisty 64 not out off 28 balls comprising six sixes and three fours.
Skipper Nipun Karunanayake scored 124 runs for Bloomfield in their second inning when they followed on 223 runs in arrears but failed to prevent his team from losing. Sri Lanka off-spinner Tharindu Kaushal took five wickets as Bloomfield were dismissed for 346 in their second innings.
Scores:
NCC: 443/9d and 104/1 in 9.3 overs (Sandun Weerakkody 64 n.o., Niroshan Dickwella 26, Dinesh Chandimal 14 n.o.)
Bloomfiled C & AC: 200 and 346 in 99.1 overs (Nipun Karunanayake 124, Lahiru Jayakody 89, Nisal Fransisco 36, Adheesha Nanayakkara 31, Thiran Danapala 31, Tharindu Kaushal 5/132, Farveez Maharoof 2/14) - YK
