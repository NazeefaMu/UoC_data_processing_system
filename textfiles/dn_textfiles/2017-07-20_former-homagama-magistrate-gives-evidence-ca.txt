Former Homagama Magistrate gives evidence in CA

Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera:
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday, gave evidence regarding a contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court on January 25 last year.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the first witness former Homagama Magistrate Ranaga Dissanayake informed that on January 25, 2016, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
“He began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept ‘White Man’s Law’ (Suddage Neethiya) and requested for the release of remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings but he continued to do so,” the Magistrate added.
“Ven. Gnanasara Thera also began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General,” he further said. Meanwhile, Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is currently serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday, identified Gnanasara Thera in open court as the person who was involved in the alleged offence which took place at the Homagama Magistrate’s court.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera. In this case, the Court of Appeal proceedings has listed eight persons including Homagama Magisitrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
Further inquiry into the matter was fixed for today (19).
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution. On a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeal’s President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Court’s jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Court’s jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
