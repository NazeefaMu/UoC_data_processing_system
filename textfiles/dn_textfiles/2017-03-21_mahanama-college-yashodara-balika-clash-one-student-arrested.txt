Mahanama College, Yashodara Balika Clash: One student arrested

An altercation between authorities at Yashodara Balika Vidyalaya and the students of Mahanama College occurred today when the students of Mahanama attempted to enter the school in lieu of the Big Match that begins this weekend.
Security officials said as many 50 students had tried to crowd into the all-girls school and their attempts to prevent the students from entering the school had resulted in melee that injured several.
School authorities said they dialled the Police emergency number when the students got increasingly violent in protest of the detention of one of their students by the Yashodara Balika security.
Police had arrived at the scene but had been unable to prevent the stampede that took place as students of Mahanama College fought to free their arrested schoolmate. 
The arrested student has been taken into Police custody and will be produced before Courts.
