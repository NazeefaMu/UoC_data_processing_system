Lanka Hospitals launches Male Wellness Center

Lanka Hospitals established a Male Wellness Centre for the first time in Sri Lanka in a bid to offer services to improve health and wellbeing of men.
Often men who play the role of breadwinner in a family, tends to neglect their own health by prioritizing the needs of the family. Thus Lanka Hospitals established a fully-fledged dedicated centre to uplift the health and wellbeing of men. The MWC caters to a host of services including Personnel fitness scheduling and programming, sport health and injury management, dietary and nutritional advices, pre-marital counseling and health screening, management of premature ejaculation, management of erectile dysfunction, cosmetic surgeries (Bariatric / Ocular / Dental). In addition to the general health screening, patients can obtain screening for liver, kidney, respiratory, cardiac, diabetic, endocrine-hormonal, cancer and sexually transmitted diseases in addition to substances and alcohol abuses. Furthermore, apart from leading physicians MWC offers the service of competent consultant specialists such as Cardiologist, Endocrinologist, Diabetologist, Venerologist, Urologist, Nephrologist, Oncologist, Surgeon, Vascular Surgeon, Psychiatrist as well as Counsellor.
Lanka Hospitals provides latest medical technology to detect and treat all types of health conditions. Through its precision screening tests, patients gain the advantage of early detection of any illness which requires medical attention.
Erectile Dysfunction (Impotence)is a common health issue suffered by men, defined by the difficulty in maintaining penile erection during sexual intercourse. In the Sri Lankan context, the issue is hardly brought into light especially by those who suffer and often show reluctance to seeking proper medical attention. Often, incorrect and misleading advice not only aggravates the issue, but also lead them to face unwanted complications. A special SWT unit was established within the Male Wellness Centre by the Lanka Hospitals for a cost of Rs. 8 million, to specifically treat impotence. The Centre conducts in-depth studies and comprehensive medical analysis to precisely identify the causes for impotence such as Physiological, Systemic, Vascular and Local – Capillary.
