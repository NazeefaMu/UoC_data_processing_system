Hilton Colombo celebrates 30th anniversary

The Hilton Hotel in Colombo celebrated its 30th anniversary yesterday (26) at the Moonstone Room, where the hotel's senior management felicitated long-serving staff members for their invaluable service to the hotel.
In addition, a commemorative stamp with the Colombo Hilton logo was also issued yesterday, by officials of the Postal Department at Hilton Colombo.
The General Manager of Hilton Colombo Mahesh Fernando stated that this event was just one part of a major initiative which Hilton hopes to launch throughout the next few years.
“Hilton is part of Sri Lanka’s culture and the brand is here to stay. There is no other hotel in Sri Lanka that has such an alumni as that of Hilton Colombo. The brand has stayed on during both good times as well as bad times.”
Fernando also praised the employees and said that they were a tower of strength. “They started to work with little or no experience at low rates in the beginning, but stayed with us and are now enjoying rich returns.”
“Due to their dedication, integrity, loyalty to the hotel and hard work they have earned themselves even managerial position and even become general managers, heads of departments, secretaries and some have even risen to be in the rank of director.”
'Their services to the Hilton chain are invaluable and we thought it was fitting to recognize and honour them during our 30th anniversary.”
“Our staff is one key pillar for the success of Hilton Colombo, ” the General Manager said.
