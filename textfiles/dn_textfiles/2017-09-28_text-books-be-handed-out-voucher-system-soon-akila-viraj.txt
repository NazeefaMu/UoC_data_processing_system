Text books to be handed out by voucher system soon: Akila Viraj

 
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that a voucher system would be introduced for schoolchildren to obtain text books in the future.
The Minister said this at a press briefing held yesterday in Colombo.
He said that the Education Ministry has decided to issue vouchers in order to minimise expenses incurred for printing.
