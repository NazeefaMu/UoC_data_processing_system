Adorable personalized cake toppers

If you want to forgo traditional cake toppers in favour of something more personal, Esther Mun (aka Lil’ Cake Toppers) creates custom wooden figurines based on real-life people.
Each charming design is like a little 3D portrait, perfect for wedding cakes, or even as your own mini-me decoration at home.
As Mun says, “After all, who wood-n’t want a selfie?”
The Lil’ Cake Toppers project began when Mun became fed up with giving impersonal wedding gifts.
“I started customizing wooden cake toppers I discovered at a designers’ fair and gifted them instead,” she reveals.
“People loved them, and the more I made, the more I experimented with different topper designs, looks, accessories, and occasions.”
Every hand-painted character is unique and designed according to information given by the buyer. When ordering a custom cake topper on Mun’s website, the customer is asked to fill in a simple form with the option to include a headshot of the subject, as well as pictures for referencing the desired outfit and accessories.
“Design is in the details and small things like hairline, ear shape, and eye placement make a big difference in ensuring your cake toppers are two-of-a-kind,” says Mun.
“After all, wedding toppers don’t have to be a gown and tux, there’s a whole world of outfits, accessories and expressions to choose from!”
So far, Mun has created over 900 toppers for clients all over the word. Her portfolio includes miniature brides and grooms representing a variety of cultures and styles. She’s even created entire families of wooden characters-including cats and dogs. And if you’re feeling crafty, you can order a DIY Topper Kit and create your own personalized cake toppers at home.
