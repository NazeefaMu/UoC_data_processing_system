President will form strong government joining hands with JO: Muthuhettigama

We believe that President Maithripala Sirisena will dedicate himself towards forming a strong and powerful government by joining hands with the Joint Opposition (JO), Ports and Shipping Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama said.
He was addressing a meeting after laying foundation stones for several proposed new bridges in Yakkalamulla, Galle on May 18.
Muthuhettigama said certain detractors were predicting a rift in the government due to the proposed Cabinet reshuffle. President Maithripala Sirisena was a seasoned and far-sighted leader, who would not make decision that would rattle the government, he said.
President Sirisena, who had been SLFP General Secretary for a long period, knows to make correct decisions at the right time, Muthuhettigama said.
“Our objective and request is to form a government of SLFP and the Joint Opposition in 2020 which could deliver and is capable of working for the common good of the country,” Muthuhettigama said.
