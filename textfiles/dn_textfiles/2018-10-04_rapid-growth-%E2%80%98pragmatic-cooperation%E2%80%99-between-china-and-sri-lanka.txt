Rapid growth in ‘Pragmatic cooperation’ between China and Sri Lanka

Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Cheng Xueyuan in Sri Lanka says that over the past year, pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has developed rapidly.
The reclamation of the Colombo Port City will complete soon and the second phase of development is about to start. The Port City could become the new driving force of Sri Lanka’s development and the new financial centre of South Asia,” he said.
The Ambassador was addressing the 69th Anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Republic of China in Colombo last week.
He said that subsequent to the China - Sri Lanka joint venture for Hambantota Port, the profits have almost doubled. “In future, the interactive development of port, industrial park and city could become the new engine of Sri Lanka’s economy.”
Comminuting on the infrastructure development under taken by China he said that the Moragahakanda Reservoir Headworks Project was completed and handed over successfully. “The extension of the Southern Railway and that of the Southern Expressway linking Colombo and Hambantota are drawing to a close.”
China has become Sri Lanka’s second largest source of tourists. “There were more than 260,000 Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka in 2017 and this number is estimated to exceed 300,000 in 2018.”
China has also become an important destination for overseas study and training for Sri Lanka people.
Highlighting the economic development in China he said that China’s GDP has increased from 360 billion Yuan to 82.7 trillion Yuan, growing at an annual average rate of 9.5%.
Today, China has become the world’s second largest economy, largest industrial country and largest trader of goods with the largest foreign exchange reserves.
“Around 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty, accounting for more than 70% of the global total over the same period.”
He said that 2018 marks the 5th anniversary of the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) and it developed from an initiative to a reality, from a vision to an important platform for building a community of shared future for mankind and has become a well-received public product internationally. “With the active participation of over 100 countries, regions and international organizations, a large number of cooperation projects have been settled.”
The value of trade in goods between China and countries along the Belt and Road has exceeded 5.5 trillion US dollars. China’s non-financial direct investment to these countries exceeded over 80 billion US dollars. “We have built 82 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in these countries with a total investment of 28.9 billion US dollars, which created 244,000 job opportunities for the local people.”
With its promotion and deepening all over the world, the BRI has also become the most important framework of consensus for the friendly and pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka.
China will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai and has officially invited President Maithripala Sirisena to attend the opening ceremony leading the Sri Lanka delegation.
