Milkfish hatchery to be set up in Arachchikattuwa

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to establish a milkfish hatchery in Arachchikattuwa in Bangadeniya, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The government has allocated Rs. 100 million for the first phase of the project, said the minister.
Minister Amaraweera added that the ministry has initiated a project to raise milkfish (Chanos Chanos), known in Sinhala as Wekkaya, as an alternative for fish imported from China to use as bait for longline fishing vessels.
According to the minister, the decision to raise milkfish had been taken as a solution for the price increase of cuttlefish variety imported from China to use as bait.
The minister said the price of one kilogram of cuttlefish imported from China to use as bait has been increased by US $ 3 to 5 during the past few months.
