Hotel mix-up leaves SLC in quandary
Second cricket Test to go ahead  at Pallekele

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are unlikely to move the second cricket Test between Sri Lanka and England from Pallekele despite a hotel mix-up that has left them looking for an alternate hotel to accommodate the two teams.
SLC had booked 78 of the 104 rooms available at the Earl’s Regency Hotel which is a short distance away from the Pallekele International Stadium for both teams and support staff for the second Test match that commences on November 14. However the hotel have since taken bookings from a large number of UK-based tour groups and are now unable to honour the original booking.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva told the ‘Daily News’: “We do have a problem issue there with the rooms but we are in the process of sorting it out. We should know by today (Thursday). There won’t be any change to the venue of the Test.”
“We are negotiating with the hotel to have the rooms released to us failing which we have to look at some alternate arrangement in Kandy itself,” said De Silva.
Speaking further De Silva said, “I think there has been some miscommunication. They claim that they didn’t receive the letter which was sent by Sri Lanka Cricket but we have sent a purchase order and they have shown us the rooms. We did a complete check in April. People from England also went there and they inspected and selected the rooms and all that.”
Asked why the hotel did not honour the booking De Silva stated: “That is what we expect but they have a problem right now. The travel agents are also putting a lot of pressure on them because they also have made the bookings. So there is a double booking. We are trying to sort it out without trying to find fault with each other, failing which we might have to look at some alternate arrangement.”
De Silva said that there are a few hotels around that SLC were looking at alternatively.
“Let’s see whether we can resolve it today (Thursday). We are looking at another hotel today we hope that it will be okay. Then we will go ahead with it.”
Attempts to contact a representative from the hotel or Aitken Spence Hotels proved futile.
