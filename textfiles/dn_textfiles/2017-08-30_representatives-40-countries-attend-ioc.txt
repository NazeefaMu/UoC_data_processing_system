Representatives from 40 countries to attend IOC

The Indian Ocean Conference (IOC) 2017 will be held on August 31 and September 1 at the Temple Trees under the theme of ‘Peace, Progress and Prosperity’.
Addressing a media briefing on the IOC Conference yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana said around 150 foreign representatives from around 40 countries are expected to participate in the event.
Around eight foreign ministers including Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan are also expected to participate in this conference.
The conference is being co-hosted by the India Foundation in collaboration with RSIS Singapore, and NIFS. This will be the second IOC conference and the first was held in Singapore in 2016. Addressing the occasion, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake said the conference will have speakers from 25 countries and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena are among key speakers.
The Minister said, "We are planning to discuss matters related to peace, progress and prosperity of countries of the Indian Ocean. We will also discuss matters related to the drug menace. Drugs are one of the main issues of the region."
"Sri Lanka has been a transit point for large scale drug dealers. Even the LTTE used to smuggle drugs and weapons to fund their organization. The war is over and the LTTE is no longer there. But, the world drug dealers are still operating. Sri Lanka is located strategically where it is a good place to transit drugs. So we are vulnerable to it," he said.
"We have a responsibility to the region and the world to fight this drug menace and also to ensure that there are no drugs in Sri Lanka. We are working very closely with countries in the region. We started a new police range and upgraded our capacity to fight this drug menace within the police," he added.
