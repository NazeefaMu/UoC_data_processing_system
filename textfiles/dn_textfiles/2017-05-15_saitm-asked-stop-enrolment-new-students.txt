SAITM asked to stop enrolment of new students

The government has requested the SAITM to suspend the enrolment of new students to the institute until the policy decisions taken by the government to streamline private medical education and the SAITM are implemented, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the request had been directed to the SAITM through the UGC and  the Ministry of Higher Education. Minister Kiriella said a positive response to this request is expected from the SAITM this week.
He said the policy decisions taken by the government in this regard included the listing of institutions investing in medical education, including the SAITM, on the Colombo stock market, appointing boards of administrations to conduct education and administration in such institutions according to a high standard, takeover of the Neville Fernando Hospital by the government and transforming it to a teaching hospital and the increase of scholarships granted to private medical colleges.
Time was needed to implement these policy decisions. Since the takeover of the Neville Fernando Hospital should be expedited, it was hoped to accomplish it within the next two months.
