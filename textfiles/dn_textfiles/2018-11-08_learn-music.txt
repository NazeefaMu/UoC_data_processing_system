LEARN MUSIC

Students are being enrolled for music classes for the year 2019, conducted by veteran songstress Visharadha Nanda Malini, the nightingale of Sri Lanka. She is a graduate of Bhatkhande University, India. The music classes conducted at her Aashram for the last 32 years have won the admiration of both students and parents.
The three fold courses comprise basic introductory classes, including voice training with basic vocal and breathing exercises for students between 8 - 12 years, while a music course of folk-songs and ‘Raghadari’ music covering the school syllabus is taught to students between 12-15 years.
The preparatory, initial and diploma courses of Bhatkhande Sangeeth Vidyapeeta, are also conducted for students in the higher grades. A self stamped envelope may be addressed to No.30, Vijayaba Mawatha, Nugegoda before November 30 to obtain applications for enrolment.
