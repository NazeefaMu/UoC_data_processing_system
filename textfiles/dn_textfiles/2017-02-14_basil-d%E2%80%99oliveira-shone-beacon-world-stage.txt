Basil D’Oliveira shone like a beacon on the world stage

At present our cricketers are doing battle with the South Africans in South Africa and I think it is appropriate to write about a coloured cricketer who emerged from the oblivion to shine like a beacon on the world stage. He is none other than Basil D'Oliveira who broke the shackles of colour bar.
In John Arlott's ‘Book of Cricketers’ he states that a letter from D.N. Bansda an Indian journalist in South Africa, enclosed some cuttings about the performance of a young Cape Town cricketer, named Basil D'Oliveira. He made 45 centuries, including 225 in 69 minutes (out of his team's total of 236); had scored 46 runs off an eight ball over, and as a leg-spin bowler taken 9 wickets for 2 runs in the segregated cricket called ‘Non White’ or Non -European to which he was confined. He had been chosen for Western Province at the age of sixteen. Mr. Banda's letter inquired whether there was any chance for the young man in English cricket.
The book states that, the question was what chance could there be for a coloured South African without the price of his passage; who had played only in minor cricket; had never faced anyone of known quality and who would have no backing - rather the reverse - from the cricket authority of his own country which was recognised by Lord's? A polite report indicated- but carefully, did not spell out - the insuperable problems: and promised --- if an opportunity should occur. Some months later the young man himself wrote in immaculate green ink. Was there any possibility of a coaching course in England? He has enjoyed his cricket so much and wanted to plough it back into the cricket of his own people, who needed teaching. The book also adds that a newspaper column and in broadcasts provoked no response. Direct questionings on the fringe of official circles - a grant or scholarship - produced only sad smiles; of course these people did not play real cricket. John Kay, every other cricketer's writer's pipe line to the Lancashire leagues, could hold out no hope of a professional's job there; the clubs needed men with names - and a convincing record against known opposition, states John Arlott in his book.
About once a year another letter would come: courteous, sincere, anxious, and still hoping: the oblong envelopes with the green handwriting became familiar. The same formula if something turned up, of course: knowing that there had ever been a time when a coloured South African could enter English cricket it was certainly not in the nineteen fifties yet miserably reluctant to snuff out hope by telling him that the impossible was possible. Then by a quite freakish series of coincidence it all became possible.
The book also states that in 1958 Basil D'Oliveira toured Kenya and East Africa with a representative South African non-European team and against known, near first class opposition, he had a batting average of 46 and for his 25 wickets, 11.92.In the next year, the tour of Sir Frank Worrell's West Indian team to play against non White South African sides became a political casualty. As consolation for disappointed home players, Peter Walker took a team of English professionals coaching over there to play them. Peter Sainsbury and Jimmy Gray, Lesley Lenham and Alan Oakman of Sussex, were among them. Questioned when they returned, they thought D'Oliveira was a naturally gifted forcing batsman, a steady bowler, keen fieldsman and as a personable young man as his letters had promised.
He could hardly have cut it finer; only one more such white vs coloured match was allowed in South Africa. In 1961 John Waite's white South Africans including six Test players were beaten by S.A. Haques non European XI in a three day match at Johannesburg. After that the Nationalist government stepped in and refused even to allow a return game. By then however, Basil D'Oliveira has established a bridgehead.
Back again with new evidence slight enough but something to John Kay. On 14th January long after the league clubs have generally completed their contracts for the ensuing season - he wrote, ‘There is no hope of a league post for D'Oliveira in 1960.’ The prospect of the final letter was painful; but it had to be faced. Before it could be written - within a week - John Kay's own club, Middleton, needed a professional.
Their protracted negotiations with Wesley Hall to replace Roy Gilchrist who had unexpectedly fallen through; and they were pressed for a player - and for time. Would the unknown Basil D'Oliviera become their professional for the 1960 season for 450 pounds? It was little enough; barely sufficient for his air ticket states the book. But the fund raising was actively organised by his underprivileged kith and kin and his dream was realised at the age of 28 years. For the first time in his life he was allowed to mix freely with white people!
