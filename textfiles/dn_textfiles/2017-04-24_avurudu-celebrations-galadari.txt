Avurudu Celebrations at Galadari

The Galadari Hotel had a spectacular Avurudu celebration in the Centre Lobby on April 14 for its in-house guests. Lighting of the traditional oil lamp and raban playing along with dances kept guests entertained.
Guests were invited to play raban and partake in a sensational Avurudu table laid with sweetmeats. This was a great experience for all in-house guests at the Galadari Hotel.
