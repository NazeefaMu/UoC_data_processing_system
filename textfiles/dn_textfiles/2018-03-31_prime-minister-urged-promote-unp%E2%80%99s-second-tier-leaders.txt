Prime Minister urged to promote UNP’s second tier leaders

Third tier UNPers, certain of party reforms in the near future, have asked UNP leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to promote second tier leaders to take forward the party.
“Today we only see Ranil Wickremesinghe as a leader in our party. Though people ask for leadership change, we do not have anyone else suitable to take on the mantle,” UNP Colombo District MP Hirunika Premachandra said.
During the Prime Minister’s time, there were five or six other leaders, people looked up to as well for the future of the party. Today our leader has to show who is next in line after him to the people, she said.
Addressing a media briefing at the party headquarters, she together with UNP Gampaha District MP and Chairman of the National Youth Fron, Kavinda Jayawardana stressed that it was necessary for second and third tier leadership to be restructured and promoted for the future of the party.
The UNP, which is the single largest party in the country, only managed to secure 29 percent of the vote base at the recently held local government elections.
Three committees have been appointed to look into the restructuring process, MP Jayawardana said. One headed by Minister Sajith Premadasa will look at reform within the Yahapalana government (also taking into account proposals put forward by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka), second headed by State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena to look into restructuring of the party (this nine-page report has been submitted to the PM) and the third committee headed by Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala will look into suggestions put forward by UNP MPs and organisers.
MP Jayawardana said all these reports would be studied from April 5 and a party convention would be called to finalise the reform process.
“Just because a leader changes, things won’t change in the party. We need to build the party with leaders and members who listen to the people. We hope that this recent election will provide the impetus to bring about the necessary changes,” MP Premachandra said.
Premachandra together with other UNP organisers have requested that the Prime Minister amend the new electoral system when applying it to the Provincial Council elections,
“It was a mess this time. Perhaps because it was so new and many did not understand how it worked. The PM agreed to our request. It is good that we have a member for each electorate, but now we have more pressure when it comes to deciding whom to nominate to each electorate,” she said.
