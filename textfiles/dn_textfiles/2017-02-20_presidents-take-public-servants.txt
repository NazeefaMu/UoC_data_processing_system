President's take on public servants

President Maithripala Sirisena addressing public servants in the Southern Province at a function in Weligama on Friday while praising the contribution of our public servants towards the country's progress nevertheless said that there were elements in the public service who were hellbent on sabotaging the government's programmes. The President's lament is not uncommon for all leaders. Following the change in government in 1994 after a 17 year long UNP vigil President Chandrika Kumaratunga railed at some of the leading figures in the public service, describing them as UNP stooges. Similarly after the decade long rule of Mahinda Rajapaksa we now see the same allegations being made, at least against a small coterie of public servants who in the eyes of regime was working to a hidden agenda at the instance of their former political masters.
Other than the President, there was Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who is virtually having a running battle with the Auditor General, although it must be said here that the present holder of that high office does not deserve the brickbats hurled against him. Karunanayake has also taken issue with certain high officials of the Central Bank, who according to the Minister, was not implementing government fiscal policy or was slow in doing so. These officials, it was said, were those close to the former Central Bank governor and was doing his bidding. There was also Minister Kabir Hashim who is on record stating that his instructions were not being carried out by the Chairman of the National Carrier though in this instance the appointment was made by the Yahapalanaya government.
Change in governments often bring about such allegations, sometimes though not without reason. Although, there are some who are adept at shifting allegiances or as the Sinhala saying goes tie eka maru karanawa there are others who find it difficult to shed loyalties and engage in sabotage. The recent power blackouts in the country was also attributed to such elements necessitating the deployment of the military at vital power generation plants. Not all leaders though considered political party colours when handing out important appointments. The case of Bradman Weerakoon who functioned as Secretary to two Prime Ministers of the UNP and SLFP is a good example. This, though, is an exception rather than the rule with important functionaries getting marching orders with a regime change. It must said though that certain public servants carry out their duties with a conscience whichever party comes to power and irrespective of which political party they owed their appointments.
Be that as it may, public servants are the fulcrum of the revolving wheel that ensures a smooth administration and executing government's programmes. Any defect in the fulcrum would cause a malfunctioning of the wheel leading to chaos and disorder. Hence it is incumbent on all public servants to pull in a single direction and execute their duties with a sense of patriotism. While they are well within their rights to follow whatever school of politics or ideology, this should not detract them from the main duty towards the country. In short when they leave for their work places they should leave their politics at home and function with a single purpose of mind to implement the policies and porgrammes of the government of the day.
President Sirisena may have had reasons to believe that at least some of our public servants are working to a political agenda when he expressed his sentiments. If that is the case, those indulging in politics at the expense of their duty towards the country should be identified and hounded out. The country cannot afford to tolerate saboteurs if it is to realise its development goals and ensure a smooth administration. The public service as a whole needs a shake up, with shirkers identified and dealt with.
Dilan's dream
Deputy Minister Dilan Perera who is yearning for a Sirisena-Rajapaksa political marriage these days, after ditching the UNP, says that the SLFP part of the government is on course to join hands with the Joint Opposition to contest all future elections. It is not clear if Perera is reflecting the thinking of President Maithripala Sirisena or if he is expressing his own views. In his enthusiasm, though, to merge with the JO, the Deputy Minister has obviously overlooked certain salient facts.
By ditching the UNP to contest a future general election, the SLFP will have to select its own Prime Ministerial candidate and it is difficult to comprehend the JO opting for any other choice other than Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha, the other day, stated in no uncertain terms that President Sirisena would continue in office for a full six year term by virtue of the 19th amendment only coming into being after President Sirisena had already been elected and that the general election will necessarily have to precede the next Presidential election.
It will therefore be President Sirisena, who will have THE say in who will be the Prime Ministerial candidate.
