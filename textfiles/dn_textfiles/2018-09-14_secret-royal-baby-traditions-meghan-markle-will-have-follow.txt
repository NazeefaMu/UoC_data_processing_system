Secret Royal baby traditions that Meghan Markle will have to follow

ROYAL BABY traditions are not widely known to the public, with many strange and age-old practices still existing. Despite being a modern royal, these traditions will have to be followed by Meghan Markle when she becomes pregnant.
Old and often outdated traditions are part of being a member of the Royal Family, with royal baby traditions being no exception.
They are something Meghan Markle will have to follow when, or if, she falls pregnant, being a high-ranking royal.
Despite being the symbol of a more modern Royal Family, it is no doubt the Duchess will have to follow the same traditions as Kate Middleton, Princess Diana and the Queen herself.
One thing that the Royal Family isn’t allowed to do is announce the sex of their baby ahead of the birth.
It is royal tradition to keep the gender private, with Prince William and Kate Middleton even deciding to keep the sex of George and Charlotte a secret from themselves.
When it comes to the delivery room, royal births used to take place behind palace walls, but now happen at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in London.
During the birth, lots of midwives and doctors are around, with a whopping team of 18 involved in the birth of Princess Charlotte in 2015.
One person that usually wasn’t involved in the birth was the father, a tradition long upheld until recent years.
Prince Philip was not present at the birth of any of his four children, but Prince Charles and Prince William bucked the trend by being in the delivery room for the birth of their kids.
Royal births also used to require a witness, with the home secretary usually present for all royal births to verify the event.
After the birth, royal babies are wrapped in special blankets, a tradition that goes back more than 100 years.
The fine woollen, knitted blankets are produced in Nottingham by G.H.Hurt & Son, who made the blankets for the Cambridge children and William himself.
One tradition that is still in place is that the Queen must be notified first, knowing all the details of the royal baby before any information goes public. Something the child of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also won’t have is a surname, taking on the surname “of Sussex”, just like William and Kate’s children.
Most recent royal births include Meghan and Harry’s nieces and nephews George Alexander Lois, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana and Louis Arthur Charles.
With so many royal traditions to follow, there is one American pregnancy tradition that Meghan Markle will not be able to follow now she’s the Duchess of Sussex - having a baby shower. Baby showers are a way to celebrate the expected or delivered birth of a child, by showering the mother with gifts.
However, baby showers are reported to be frowned upon and not celebrated in the royal family, as they could appear to be tasteless.
