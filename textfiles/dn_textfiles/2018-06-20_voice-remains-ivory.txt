Voice that remains  ivory

As soon as my ears felt the demise of veteran vocalist, composer, and teacher, Ivor Dennis, something echoed in my auricles. It is none other than the melancholic utterances ‘Sumihiri Suwandethi mal ai metharam hanikata parawanne’ (‘why do sweet-scented flowers wither so quickly’, composed and sung by late Sunil Santha subsequent to the demise of his friend Suryashankar Molligoda. Apparently, Sunil himself quoted saying it was the sudden impulse that brought in to him after his great comrade left the music arena for good. I wonder what would he be saying by now after seeing his pupil who entertained the music fans over many decades with some scintillating oral delights.
The Sri Lankan Sinhala music culture has been nourished by a handful of great musicians at a time when it was struggling to come out of age in the early part of the twentieth century under the British rule. During these colonial era veteran musicians such as Hubert Rajapaksha, Devar Suryasena(aka Herbert Charles Jacob Pieris), Sunil Santha turned a fresh leaf in bringing Sinhala words to new heights to promote a Sinhala music culture. They were influenced by Western and Raagas from Hindi tunes, yet they consist of the fresh taste of vocals. Sunil Santha emerged as a clear leader in creating a specific original style of music. These were influenced by a blend of church choir music and a touch of orientalism to suit the Sri Lankan Sinhala audience. They consist of both patriotism and romanticism. While Sunil Santha bade farewell in 1981, his legacy remained to continue with Ivor, a humble man with a clear distinctive voice with a plethora of talent and intellect to offer by any stretch of the imagination.
His use of Sinhala words in singing is immaculate and one could easily attribute him to the stratum of Kumaratunga Munidasa, Arisen Ahubudu and of course his guru Sunil Santha, although both Munidasa and Ahubudu did not sing.
Dennis sang plenty of rare finds in many platforms, be it cinema, theatre or on the radio Ceylon studios. One such rarity is ‘Api Sinhalayo’ a song sung for the movie ‘Veera Puran Appu’ in 1979, directed by late Dr Lester James Peiris based on the character of the former hero Puran appu who defied the British rule, scripted by late Dr Tissa Abeysekara. The song is rarely heard and aired over the radio these days. It was one of the songs that consist of many facets of a patriotic song. The song is sung by Ivor, TM Jayarathne and the chorus with the music composed by Premasiri Khemadasa. It plays on the way to the launching of the Puran Appu’s patriotic army defeat of the British. The vocal control of the singing by Dennis proves his prowess as par excellence with some great rippling effect – an oral delight!
Dennis would not sojourn there but would take the helm on to the theatre. Playwright Ranjith Dharmakeerthi’s 1970s drama based on a Russian creative art, ‘Angara Ganga Gala Basi’ garnered whole of fame. Dharmakeerthi had the privilege to extract the cream out of the crop in Khemadasa’s music backed up by Ajantha Ranasinghe’s lyrics blended with the vocals of Ivor, Edward Jayakody, TM Jayarathne and Sunila Abeysekara. Sunila Abeysekara was known to be of soprano genre that provided the ultimatum to the audience with Dennis’ oral glee.
I could fondly remember he was walking on the radio Ceylon corridors in the 1980s with a pile of files and some books in his hands aiming to enter the studios for a certain programme. He consistently sang songs related to ‘Sigiri frescoes’ known as ‘Sigiri kurutu gee’. They consisted of local tunes and styles. One key difference in Dennis’ singing is he would not dwell in one specific panache. He could open up his vocal chords to the likes of Frank Sinatra or become a traditional farmer who would recite ‘pal kawi’. This phenomenon is not something common Sri Lanka singers. Dennis’ had a good knowledge of comprehending the scenario to perform the work of art.
Some of his notable cinematic contributions can be mentioned as follows; Anuraapura Polonnaruwa (From ‘Rekhava’, 1956), Negena Watena (From ‘Kawda Hari, 1969), ‘Udumbara Hinehenawa’ (From ‘Bambaru Ewith’, 1982) andRan Devolin (from ‘Adara Hasuna’ 1987). In addition to this collection, he had sung some memorable songs such as ‘Andura Kutiya Thula’ and ‘Dakuna Nagenahira’ (with guru Sunil Santha). The experimental song ‘Poda daham sisile’ is yet another creation with guru Sunil Santha.
Lastly, it must be said that with the demise of Ivor Dennis, the last of the long list of true Sri Lankan musicians who contributed to the upliftment of Sinhala music culture since the colonial era chapter has gone and for sure his legacy will remain among us for the posterity.
