Moves to expedite lower Malwathu Oya reservoir work

The Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry will accelerate the construction work of the lower Malwathu Oya reservoir. The reservoir is being constructed in Boyagama close to historic Thanthrimale.
The capacity of the reservoir will be 16,440 acre feet. A landscape of 4,422 hectares gets submerged to the reservoir. The cost to be incurred is Rs. 12,000 million. The length of the main dam is 3 1/2 kilometres.
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayake said steps were being taken to conduct surveying. The Mahawilachchiya Divisional Secretary has submitted the surveying order to the Surveyor General Department. The reservoir project will provide irrigation water to around 50,000 acres throughout the year.
