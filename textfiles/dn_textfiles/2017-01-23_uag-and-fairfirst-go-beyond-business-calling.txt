UAG and Fairfirst go beyond a business calling

For years now, Union Assurance General Limited (UAG) has been at the forefront of working towards creating safer roads in Sri Lanka. They have been doing so by working with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters as the official insurance partner of the Road Safety Awareness Program.
As a leading insurance provider to officially partner with one of the main governing bodies that monitor road safety in Sri Lanka, UAG has continued to support this project since its inception in 2012.
Over the year 2016 alone, UAG successfully conducted over 50 road safety awareness programs for schools and the general public. They have covered a total of 150 schools islandwide and reached out to over 25,000 people and school children in the process.
“What we aim to accomplish through these programs is to safeguard our country’s future generations,” said Upul Chandana Director Traffic at the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters.
“These Road Safety programmes include a thorough training session for school traffic wardens. They are educated on Road Rules and Traffic Control and subsequently issued traffic warden vests and a certificate by us endorsing them as official school traffic wardens.”
As of today UAG together with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police have trained and endorsed a total of 1,600 traffic wardens.
Furthermore, Fairfirst Insurance also recently collaborated with the Traffic Police to create awareness on the islandwide Road Safety week. Now a part of the Fairfax Group, Fairfirst Insurance is expected to undertake initiatives promoting community welfare in the months to come.
Giving back to the community is a huge part of the Fairfax Group’s value system. In 2015 alone, the group had made donations amounting to USD 15.1 million. “We believe that business is a good thing. By doing well as a business, we are able to do some good for the people we work with, because investing in the well-being of communities is something we strongly believe in,” said Niranjan Nagendra, General Manager Sales & Marketing at UAG.
Union Assurance General is part of the Fairfax Group, one the largest general insurance groups in the world with operations across geographies. Most recently UAG acquired 100% shares of Asian Alliance General Insurance, now re-branded as Fairfirst Insurance.
