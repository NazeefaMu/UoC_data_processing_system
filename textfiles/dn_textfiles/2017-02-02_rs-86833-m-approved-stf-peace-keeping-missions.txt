Rs. 868.33 m. approved for STF Peace Keeping missions

A Police Special Task Force (STF) contingent scheduled to leave for Peace Keeping missions this week received Rs 868.33 million approved by Cabinet to purchase small arms/ammunition, military, medical and other equipment requirements.
Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Sagala Ratnayaka had submitted the proposal to Cabinet.
The STF which had pledged to the United Nations through the Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the United Nations (PRUN) to deploy close to 380 police officers to the UN Peace Keeping Operations. They would form the units of; Formed Police Unit (FPU), Police Guard Unit and the SWAT Team.
The United Nations had earlier informed that the STF would first have to deploy troops under the FPU before sending policemen to other units. This makes it necessary to purchase the equipment needed for the FPU as soon as possible.
The entire project had Rs 1.59 billion approved by Cabinet on 11 May 2016.
The costs were justified by Minister Ratnayaka who stated in the proposal that the “estimated cost would be reimbursed by the UN under the ‘Wet Lease Reimbursement System’ and 20 percent of the remuneration that would be paid to deployed troops is planned to be provided to the government of Sri Lanka”.
The deployment of officers to peace keeping mission has often been cited to help the country earn more foreign exchange, improve the morale of the troops, to help further enhance the international reputation of the Sri Lankan Police Force and to provide an opportunity to work with international police forces to gain experience and knowledge.
Cabinet on 24 January also approved the purchase of equipment required for Sri Lanka Army troops deployed in Peace Keeping Operations in Mali. The proposal put forward by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the time asked that that government enter into a loan agreement with the Russian
Bank SBERBANK, to fund the purchasing of equipment required for the said troops.
