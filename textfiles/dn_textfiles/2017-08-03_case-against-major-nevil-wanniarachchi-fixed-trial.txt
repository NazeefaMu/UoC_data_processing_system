Case against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi fixed for trial

Five corruption cases filed against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi, the ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO) of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
When the five corruption cases came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala, the cases were fixed for trial on October 24.
The accused, Wanniarachchi, was not present in court yesterday. The counsel who appeared on behalf of the accused submitted a medical report to justify his absence.
At a previous occasion, the Court had turned down the preliminary objection raised by Major Nevil Wanniarachchi.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed five corruption cases in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi over non-declaration of assets and liabilities. The Bribery Commission alleged that Major Wanniarachchi had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for five years since 2010 to 2014 while serving as an Army Commissioned Officer.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the Major in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975.
Defence counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the accused.
