Bhikkus stranded

A group of bhikkus from the Retiyala temple in Govinna who participated in a higher ordination ceremony in Kandy were stranded half way on their return trip due to unexpected floods and earthslips. The bhikkhus who had to spend the night in a temple in Bellapitiya, Horana were helped by residents in the area to return to their abode in Govinna in a lorry as the bus they were travelling could not pass through heavy floods.
