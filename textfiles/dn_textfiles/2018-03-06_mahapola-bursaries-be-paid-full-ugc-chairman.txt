Mahapola bursaries to be paid in full: UGC Chairman

University Grant Commission (UGC) Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva said the Mahapola bursary has not been curtailed. He said all students qualified to obtain the Mahapola Student Bursary will receive the full amount as usual.
He said the Mahapola Trust Fund (MTF) had sent allocations to all universities by now to pay the Mahapola bursaries to undergraduates who are entitled to receive it. The MTF has taken measures to send the allocations to new university entrants this month itself, he said.
Accordingly, new university entrants of the Moratuwa and Sri Jayawardenapura Universities have already been paid the advance payments of the Mahapola bursaries.
The new entrants of other universities will receive their advance payments from their universities within a month of the commencement of lectures, Prof. de Silva said.
