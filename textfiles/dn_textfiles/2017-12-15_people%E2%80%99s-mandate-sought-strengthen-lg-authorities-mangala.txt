“It was just over two years ago that the three of us submitted our nominations seeking the peoples mandate to form a government. On being elected to power we brought change by establishing democracy and bringing development to the nation.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka reiterated what Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that all measures would be taken to conduct a peaceful election.
“We took development to the villages but if we are given the mandate to govern the local authorities, we would be able to speed up the development process,”Minister Ratnayaka said.

“We need the Local Government bodies to work in line with our national agenda. That is the intention which we launch our election campaign,” the Minister added. He said people in the Matara disrict gave strength and momentum for the formation of the national unity government.
“We need to move forward with the same vigour and strength, at this election,” the Minister added.
“Some have now forgotten the track record of the defeated political elements. They have also forgotten how their cronies made money through government contracts. We request them not to forget the past. Also, we invite them to join hands with us, and embark on this victorious journey,” Ratnayaka said.
