Railway workers absent without leave will be sacked

 
The Railway Department said today that the service of railway workers who engage in the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) strike against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) without applying for leave, will be terminated.
The GMOA and thirty other trade unions, including locomotive drivers and railway guards have launched a 24-hour strike seeking the abolishment of SAITM.
