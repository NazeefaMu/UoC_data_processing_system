Models bedecked in styles bold and beautiful, bright and breezy, soft and sensuous, sophisticated and elegant, all turned out in flowers of a myriad colours with its intrinsic perfumes will walk the ramp at silver dazzle which is the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society of Sri Lanka on May 28 at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo, at 7 p.m.
The Shi-en Ikebana club was inaugurated in 1991 by Kamala Pillai, who trained in the art of Ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging together with her pupils and later drew in to its fold western flower arrangers as well. The combination of the two, became known as the Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Art Society of Sri Lanka (SIFAS) of which the patron is the Ambassador for Japan in Sri Lanka. The current membership is 74 ladies and the advisor to the association is Harijanto Setiawan of Singapore. The signature social project of SIFAS is the care of Thalassaemic patients and Galadari Hotel has generously agreed to be the Hospitality partner for this project. A large part of the proceeds from this show will be donated towards purchasing equipment/drugs for Thalassaemia patients at the Kurunegala Base Hospital.
Flowers will make a fashion statement in headgear, wristbands ,bouquets and even dresses, when masterpieces designed by internationally acclaimed floral designer and artist Harijanto Setiawan (who by profession is an architect) presents his collection for Sri Lanka at this trailblazer show.
Hari as he is fondly known, has won many international awards and accolades for floral art. At Silver Dazzle, the audience would be treated to the unique designs of a creative genius, executed with passion, precision and to perfection. Together with his team from Singapore, Hari will weave floral magic to adorn the models on the catwalk.
Whilst flowers take center stage, interludes of music by Friends In Harmony, duets by reputed singers, the throbbing of the drums of Sri Lanka will keep the audience toe tapping and clapping hands to popular songs and rhythms. Canapés would be served when the show is on and the finale would be the scrumptious buffet specially laid out for you. In Addition there would be an Entrance Ticket Draw and a Raffle Ticket Draw which has Air Tickets and other attractive prizes for the lucky winners.
