Railway workers have damaged train engines: Railway Department alleges

 
The Railway Department lodged  a complaint at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), alleging railway workers who were on strike to have had caused damages to  train engines and compartments, Additional General Manager (Operations) Vijaya Samarasinghe said today. 
The railway technical service launched a 48-hour token strike from 4.00 pm on Tuesday demanding for a pay hike and several other demands.
Chairman of the committee P. Sampath Rajitha said, “The wages of five grades had been increased by 12% and this has caused a salary anomaly within the entire railway employees. This discrepancy should be resolved and all railways workers should be given this 12% pay hike. This is our main demand and we have still not received a favorable response,” he said warning the administrators not to lay their hands on their salary increments, which could lead to a further extension of the strike.
However, although the Railway technical services committee claimed that the strike action was successful, according to several other unions, the strike action was a flop and train services had operated without any glitch. They said that all 27 train services on the main line from various parts of the country to the Colombo Fort railway station had operated on schedule today except for slight delays.
