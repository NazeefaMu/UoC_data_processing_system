INSEE Cement signs MoU with  Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council

INSEE Cement Sri Lanka signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, extending the Skills Development and Vocational Training program to the third of Sri Lanka’s nine provinces.
The MoU, realized under the counsel and direction of the Governor of Sabaragamuwa Province Niluka Ekanayake, was formalized by Herath P. Kularathne, Chief Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Province and Jan Kunigk Executive Vice President and Director Sales and Marketing of INSEE Cement Sri Lanka.
Commenting at the event Jan Kunigk said, “We are thrilled to see the enthusiasm of Technical Officers across the country and the encouragement from the authorities in rapidly implementing INSEE’s national level skills development and vocational training program. This is the third MoU we are signing for the year, further strengthening our commitment to empower local industry stakeholders through collaboration and knowledge sharing - revolutionizing Sri Lanka’s construction industry to be on par with international standards.”
The islandwide training program has been well accepted and rapidly adapted by the Central and Southern provinces since June this year. It has been identified as an industry-transforming up-skilling tool that serves in enhancing stakeholder contribution to the progress of the local construction industry. The program focuses on the up-skilling and knowledge enhancement of Technical Officers based on six modules covering areas of plumbing, electrical work, aluminium work, quantity surveying, surveying and levelling, cement and concrete solutions. With the signing of this agreement, INSEE Cement will conduct training programs for Technical Officers (TOs) in the region over a period of seven months in partnership with the Sabaragamuwa Province Chief Secretarial Office, in which over 200 Technical Officers will take part. INSEE Cement Lanka aims at heavily investing on the knowledge sharing initiatives with a number of Public-Private partnerships to up-skill Technical Officers, Masons and other industry stakeholders across the country.
