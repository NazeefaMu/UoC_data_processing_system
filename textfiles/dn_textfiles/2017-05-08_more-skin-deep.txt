More than skin deep

She is an undisputed legend in the beauty culture scene. With more than three decades of experience in the hair dressing industry Ramani Fernando has reached the pinnacle of the beauty scene through dedication, hard work and talent. Ex cricketer and cricket television commentator Ranjith Fernando, Ramani’s life partner, tells us how the glamorous lady became the trailblazer in the industry.
First impression
We saw each other at the Air Ceylon Dance where Ramani had come with friends who were neighbours. I saw her there for the first time but I was not introduced to her then. She looked simple and unsophisticated, dressed in sari and later I got to know that it was her 17th birthday.
Attraction
It’s hard to tell what really drew me to her but there is always a sixth sense that keeps telling you what is good for you. I had that feeling when I met her.
On Ramani’s achievements
National cricketers of my time could not even think of making a living out of cricket. Fortunately, I had a good, steady job, under a great employer which gave us opportunities of an all round training and also fashioned us to be the best we could be in all the talents we possessed. The virtues of hard work and loyalty were drilled into us and I am sure, some of it and my biz acumen rubbed off from me on Ramani too.
Ramani runs her business not on any formal business plan but more by intuition. When I read about some of the reputed business gurus, I find she does many things they talk about which comes naturally to her. So I suppose she does most right things and has the processes in place to be successful. When it comes to a big business decision nothing can shake her until she gets the ‘feel good feeling’ for her to even move a finger. That seems to work wonders for her.
Fashion tips from Ramani
She would love to and tries hard to make me fashionable but we have been married long enough for her to know that though she lays out my clothes most of the time, it’s hard to change my conventional dressing habits. Do you think that I have taken any tips from her when you see my style of dressing at any event? One thing she is passionate about is me wearing short hair and I get hounded even when it is half a centimeter long! She just keeps making appointments until the haircut is done.
In the limelight
During most of the events that we go to now, the invitation is addressed to her because of her connections and most guests have the same interests as hers. It does not bother me too much that she takes center stage and I think the same applies to her too when we go for events which are addressed to me.
Ramani, by nature, hates to turn down an invitation saying “how would you feel when people do the same to you” and I end up going to as many events as she does. I just tag along unless I find that there would hardly be anyone with whom I could make conversation. We tend to keep an eye on each other, just to make sure the other is comfortable - or needs help bailing out!
Cooking
Ramani cannot cook to save herself and we would have starved if we had not had our wonderful faithfuls at home! But ask her to plan a meal and like all things she would see that everything is in place
The wife and mother

Ranjith Fernando
In the early days, when the children were small, she had quite a task running a growing family and a thriving business. It was not easy trying to divide time between the two. However, the Sri Lankan culture came to her aid. Her mother and my parents were always there to look after the children and there was peace of mind. Ramani is a fine time manager and at the same time she wants to do everything. The way she juggles so many things at the same time is simply amazing! I think she has developed a simple system of writing down notes on what she has to do and delegating these chores among others. It is certainly an effective way of getting chores done although it is not rocket science.
She is the pivot of the family .Whenever she comes up with an idea it’s usually turned down by all at first, but later, everyone ends up agreeing wholeheartedly and doing exactly as she plans! She has really mastered the art of being a great mother and wife.
The family
We are the ‘R’ family: Ranjit, Ramani, Rashika, Rishen, Rehan and Rakhil and our dog, Rocky.
They all do their own thing. Rashika is a Nuclear Radiologist. Rishen is into Software Outsourcing. Rehan is involved in Graphic Designing and Rakhil is running a Startup in Singapore. None of them want to follow what we do. On the theory that ‘since it’s not broken, why mend it’, they wish not to get involved. However they are all great at professing advice and ideas. Ramani is at the receiving end, being the patient listener.
Greatest strength and greatest weakness
She is very caring and loving. When she takes on a task and believes in it, she would painstakingly take it to the finish. These are her greatest strengths. Her inability to say ‘no’ is her biggest weakness.
Other passions
Ramani is a great family person and loves to be with and pamper the four grandchildren. She was not a sportsperson in her young days but now, she is faithful to her fitness regimes. She tries to follow cricket and watches some of it particularly when I am involved. She even says a prayer for us to win because she is a religious person but her understanding and questions on the game can be funny at times. This is good because two cricket buffs in the family would have been stressful.
Fit and fab
In the early days, I had to push her towards maintaining a fitness regime. Now, she is the one who pushes me.
Animal lovers
Yes, we love animals. There was our first dog, Rudy. She was sadly knocked down and now we have Rocky who was rescued from a dustbin as a pup by some friends and given to us a short time after they left the country. She is Ramani’s shadow and truly adores and protects her although we all believe everyone else in the household does more for her. She is about eight years old but I am sad that I cannot pet her because of a fur allergy. We also have twin cats, Suzie and Ritchie, who are a menace but adorable and annoys Rocky loads at times.
Holidaying
We try to plan holidays with the whole family now and that includes our in-laws Tim, Sharika and Shaesta. The destination is usually agreed by consensus. However we always want to spend at least a short time each year in a small village called Lymm near Manchester where our daughter lives because we want to be with our other three grandchildren.
Him vs her
We do have disagreements but the heat settles down fast because Ramani is quick to say “sorry” even if she thinks she is right. The upside for Ramani is that in any event, her wishes are always carried out.
Three lesser known facts
Ramani makes great howlers while speaking about cricket.
She is a terrible back seat driver.
She becomes a wreck flying with turbulence where she keeps on praying throughout the event.
