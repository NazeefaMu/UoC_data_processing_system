Row over Malabe private medical college

Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof. Carlo Fonseka has expressed concern over the recent recruitment of over 40 medical students to the Malambe private medical college, South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITAM).
"All is not well there," he said.
The SAITAM was approved by the Higher Education Ministry and the University Grants Commission (UGC) during the Rajapaksa regime.
However, the SLMC recently informed the President, Prime Minister and the Health Minister in writing that it will not recognize the Medical Degree offered by the SAITAM.
The Council had taken this decision after considering several facts such as inadequate clinical training in all sections, non availability of relevant required facilities etc.
The decision had been made after an inspection of the institution by a 10-member team of scholars including professors, doctors etc. chaired by Prof. Rizvi Sheriff.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the report formulated by the SLMC special committee on the Malambe private medical collage has now been sent to the SAITAM.
The first batch is scheduled to pass out from the SAITAM in January 2016 but they will not be permitted to practice in Sri Lanka due to not having the six month clinical training at state hospitals.
From the beginning the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) called the government not to recognize the Medical Degree offered by the private medical collage as they alleged it does not maintain required standards.
"Since then we warned parents and children not to get caught to this trap and waste their hard-earned money," GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath told the 'Daily News'.
The SAITAM was established in 2009. At present, nearly 900 students study there.
The total cost of obtaining a Medical Degree from this institution is Rs. 8.5 million.
