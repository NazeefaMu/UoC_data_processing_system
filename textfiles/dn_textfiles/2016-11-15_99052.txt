Sinha and Abraham pay tribute to jawans at India Gate

Ever since the first look of the upcoming film ‘Force 2’ was released, the makers have been promoting it as a film that pays respect to those who give away their lives on the borders to save ours. Even the trailer has a slide that salutes the armed forces.
And now, as the film is on its way to get released at the theatres, the team has pulled up their socks to promote it as much as possible but have chosen a different way. Unlike other films, the leads of the film, John Abraham and Sonakshi Sinha, have flown to Delhi to pay tribute to the armed forces.
Both the actors tweeted a picture of themselves in which they can be seen wearing an Indian army attire with ‘Force 2’ written on their backs. Well, seems like the makers know how to grab headlines and excite the audience about their film, without uttering a word. While we already know John as an action hero, Sonakshi will pack some punches and throw some kicks in the film. After ‘Akira’, this is her consecutive second film where we can see her in such a dangerous yet impressive avatar.
