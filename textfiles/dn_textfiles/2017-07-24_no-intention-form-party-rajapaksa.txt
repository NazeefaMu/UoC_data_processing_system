No intention to form party - Rajapaksa

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said no political party will contest the upcoming elections under his leadership.
Speaking to journalists in Kandy, Rajapaksa said he had no intention of forming a separate party to face the polls but added that he will extend support on an individual basis for those whom he prefers, irrespective of which party they represent.
The former President said he was not sure when the local government polls will be held but going by the words of the Elections Commission Chairman, the elections to appoint members to provincial councils may be held on time.
Rajapaksa rubbished claims that there was an attempt to divide the Malwatte Chapter.
“No one can divide the Malwatte chapter. Don’t know whether these people are talking about the Peradeniya Malwatte,” Rajapaksa said.
Rajapaksa said plans to set up a missing persons office could lead to unnecessary issues. He also questioned the scope of powers vested with such an institution claiming that they seem to even violate the present constitution.
Rajapaksa spoke to the media after visiting the Dalada Maligawa for religious observances.
