SLT Rainbow Pages to provide  services through digital platforms

Taking its services to the next level and with the objective bringing together important telephone numbers out of more than 1.5 million SLT fixed line connections and mobile connections that have surpassed the entire Sri Lankan population which is 22 million in numbers.
The SLT Rainbow Pages is now providing its services through its latest digital platforms including mobile apps.
SLT Rainbow Pages, which is an affiliated institution of the SLT Group, is the leading communication entity that has enabled its customers to obtain information on goods and services conveniently by publishing Sri Lanka’s most organized telephone directory.  
Sri Lanka Telecom is the pioneer telecommunication solutions provider of the nation that has always been in the forefront when it comes to catering the telecommunication requirements of Sri Lanka.
The SLT Rainbow Pages will publish directories dedicated to various fields in order to gain the contribution of small and medium scale industries to the national service it is rendering, by publishing Sri Lanka’s only Business Directory, which has brought together various business entities and state institutions.
In addition, the SLT Rainbow Pages has planned a new project to embark an extensive national service by bringing together professionals who provide services on daily wages.
Main objective of this initiative is to help all the institutions that provide services throughout the country including the professionals who build their economy from work on daily basis to generate more income while supporting the Sri Lankan government’s policy on digitalizing all the institutions according to the e-government policy.
Under this project, information from primary professionals of the society including plumbers and electricians to institutions that provide large scale services will be collected.
As an example, if there is water leak in a home or in an institution, owner of that building can call the 24 hour hotline which is due to be introduced shortly.
Subsequently, a SMS with the contact numbers   of the plumbers close by will be sent to the party who requires the service. They will be able to obtain a trustworthy service by simply dialing those numbers.
“We need professionals and institutions that provide such services throughout the country to contact us. No fee will be charged for the data entry or the service opportunities they receive. Please follow the following measures to provide information,” an official from SLT Rainbow Pages said.
