ASP summoned in paddy land case

Panadura Chief Magistrate issued notice to the Panadura ASP to appear before court on April 25 to answer allegations made against the police by Lalith Siriwardena, the lawyer of the Commissioner General of the Agrarian Services Development Department.
On March 28, a case was called before court where three persons were charged with filling of a paddy field at Pinwatte, Panadura, without the permission of the Commissioner General of the Agrarian Services Development Department.
Siriwardena in his submissions to Court said a complaint had been made to the Panadura South Police in 2017 regarding the unauthrised filling of a paddy field at Pinwatte, Panadura. The police had not taken action against the people who were involved in filling the paddy field without the permission of the Agrarian Services Commissioner General.
Recently, three officials representing the Agrarian Services Commissioner General went to meet the Panadura SSP at Wellaboda Police Station to check what had happened to the complaint and to make a fresh complaint
The police officer on duty did not give any information and did not accept a fresh complaint. He told the officials to come again.
Three days later, they went to the police station and met the police officer, but he did not entertain the complaint. The officers reported the matter to the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services.
The Assistant Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, Kalutara, filed a plaint against the three persons who were allegedly filling the paddy field.
Siriwardena further informed court that he wished to obtain an interim injunction against the filling of the paddy land.
He also informed court that the attitude of the police officer caused much inconvenience to the Agrarian Services Department as well as the officers.
The Chief Magistrate issued an injunction against the respondents and issued notice to the Panadura ASP to appear before court.
