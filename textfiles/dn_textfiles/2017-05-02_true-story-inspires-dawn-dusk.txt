“Going to a Women’s Shelter changed my mind to switch my career from Finance to Social Work. My own people were struggling in a new country where they came for refuge. Even though Canada was a great country,
It was hard for the community to adjust with the new culture, weather, language, legal system etc.This caused many family disputes, Depression, Addiction, Financial struggles and many other. These factors made me change my career as A Social Worker. I volunteered and gained experience in many non profit organizations and went to School to study in the field. Also certified my self as a Crisis Counselor,” Kanchana says.
