Celebrating  culture and art

The faculty and students of Devi Balika have for many years celebrated the arts and the impact it has on the student body as a whole. The girls of Devi Balika show remarkable aptitude when it comes to drama, dance and public speaking. This was seen in their annual cultural show Manjari or known as Inflorescence 2018, is their way of appreciating the arts.
And through this appreciation of the arts, they have given themselves the opportunity of discovering themselves and their talents.

The morning kicked off at the J.D.A gallery with the art exhibition and then shifted to Devi Balika where the artists were honored with prizes. Of course the morning featured so many more aesthetic items such as beautiful dances, songs and public speaking. It was a morning of gaiety and vibrancy shown by the dances.
Devi Balika has always been a school that has placed much emphasis on the performing arts and aesthetics. And when these girls put on a show it is all due to their hard work, commitment and dedication. They have the brains no doubt. They just need the platform.
Head Girl of Devi Balika Theshani Weligamage who was the English compeer, chose her words carefully beautifully illustrating the importance of the morning –
“This event is as natural as sunshine and as vital as nourishment. Technically inflorescence means a cluster of flowers, with the budding and the unfolding of the blossoms. The Arts Circle of Devi Balika Vidyalaya together with the Peoples’ Republic of China, holds Inflorescence the art exhibition, providing the platform for a cluster of young artists to bloom in full color,’ said Weligamage.
The event is a unified amplification of the efforts of the teachers in charge, the panel of judges and the committee members of the Arts Circle.
“I wish to point out that an event of this caliber is done through the efforts of the faculty and the students. It is part of the culture at Devi Balika to encourage our students to be creative and bring out their talents. We are always behind them when it comes to realizing their potential. Our faculty have the desire to see our girls excel. An event like this is a unified approach. For any dream to come true what you need is desire, discipline and dedication. So we always push them to make use of these opportunities. We also wish to thank the parents for the sacrifices they make. They have supported our faculty and students. This event is a success. Our Art Circle is very active and praiseworthy. Events like this provide our students with various experiences,” said Principal of Devi Balika, W.D.P.K. Samarasinghe.
The principal pointed out that win or lose, what is important is the experience these students take out of this. Because this is something more than receiving a certificate. Taking part is what is important. She also pointed out that this experience will benefit these children when they leave the portals of Devi Balika and become responsible citizens of this world. The freedom they receive, the creativity they develop and the charisma they create within them, will certainly aid them in succeeding in life.
Kingsley Gunatillake is a painter, an installation artist and a book artist. His formal training includes a Bachelor in Fine Arts from the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo He is currently a lecturer on the faculty of Visual Arts of the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo.
“The paintings on display tackle profound and deep themes with great clarity. Today child art is regarded as one form of art which is in high demand. This is because every child is a creator. That is something I believe very strongly. Even Picasso has stated that every child is a creator,” said Gunatillake.
