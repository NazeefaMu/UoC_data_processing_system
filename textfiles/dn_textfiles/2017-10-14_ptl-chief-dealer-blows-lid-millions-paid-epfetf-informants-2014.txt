PTL Chief Dealer blows lid on millions paid to EPF,ETF informants since 2014

Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado was cross examined at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday. Salgado gave controversial evidence before the Commission last Thursday (12) with regards to certain payments done by PTL to several alleged informants.
According to Salgado, Perpetual Treasuries Limited was giving money to informants who supplied confidential information to them from the Employee’s Provident Fund and the Employee’s Trust Fund and other institutes in the Treasury bond market.
Salgado, a whistle-blower for PTL, gave evidence at several previous occasions against his employer.
Salgado also submitted a report on Thursday, which was allegedly on the said payments given by his company to informants.Salgado also said that these said informants were paid money by his company in millions even when former Central Bank Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal was in office.
According to the report submitted by Salgado, within the six months from July 17 to December 31, 2014, these informants were paid by the PTL monies totalling more than Rs. 94 million. According to Salgado PTL has been paying for its informants continuously from its commencement as a Primary Dealer in 2014.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena’s legal representative President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, yesterday questioned Salgado’s position. According to Indatissa PC, these transactions were not illegal. He pointed out that these transactions are included in the RTGS system maintained by the Central Bank.
It was evident that Salgado wavered from his position. However, at the re examination, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera pointed out that what Salgado said was that he ‘realised’ these payments to be “bribes” from the document he maintained on the said payments.
Salgado also gave evidence on Thursday with regard to certain informants of PTL in state institutes such as the EPF and the ETF.
According to Salgado, there were two informants for the PTL in the EPF, who were referred to as “Charlie”. Accordingly, from 2014 to 2015, the informant ‘Charlie’ for the PTL from EPF was a dealer name Udaya Seelan and from 2016 to 2017, ‘Charlie’ was Indika Saman Kumara, who was the Chief Dealer of the EPF.
Indatissa PC questioned as to how Salgado knew for exact that ‘Charlie’ was either of these people. Salgado said the EPF dealer was referred to as ‘Charlie’ in the dealing room. Indatissa PC was of the position that Salgado was not sure in his answers and has changed from his earlier position.
Salgado could not identify who are meant by the nicknames ‘Car’ and ‘Tango’, as he gave evidence on Thursday. Indatissa PC pointed out that the said ‘Car’ in fact, was not an informant as Salgado alleged but a purchase regarding a vehicle. Salgado said he did not know who or what meant by ‘Car.’
At the re examination of the witness, SASG de Livera questioned Salgado on his involvement in preparing the document he provided to the Commission on Thursday.
SASG Livera: Who provided information to you for this document?
Nuwan Salgado: Kasun Palisena.
SASG: How?
NS: Verbally.
SASG: So, Kasun Palisena knew about the existence of this document?
NS: Yes.
SASG: Has Kasun Palisena ever accessed this document?
NS: Yes. He looked at it in my computer where it was maintained.
SASG: So it was only you and Kasun Palisena who knew about this document?
NS: Yes.
SASG: Did you at any stage save this document in any other machine?
NS: It was only in my desktop computer. Since I have emailed it, it can be downloaded as well. I emailed this document’s updated version several times to Kasun Palisena in 2014 and 2015.
SASG: So there were identities mentioned in the document as Charlie, Car and Tango. You said these were persons who were supplying market and price sensitive information to the PTL?
NS: Yes.
SASG: You said Charlie was Udaya Seelan and Indika Saman Kumara?
NS: Yes. They were referred to as Charlie in the dealing room.
SASG: Did you know any other persons referred to as Charlie?
NS: No.
SASG: Who told you about ‘Car’ and ‘Tango’?
NS: Kasun Palisena
SASG: You said this money was paid for informants yesterday?
NS: Yes.
SASG: Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked you specifically yesterday whether this money was given as bribes. And you said that “it was the realisation I had.” Do you stand by that evidence?
NS: Yes.
SASG De Livera then questioned Salgado as to why he deleted this document from his desktop computer. The witness said that he did not want to have such a document in his computer. He also added that he “did not want anybody else to access the document through his computer” and it was the reason why he deleted the document.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked as to why Salgado named the persons mentioned in the document as “informants”. “Of all the words you could have used, you used the word informant. Why?” Justice Jayawardena questioned.
Salgado said that was the realisation he received. Justice Jayawardena also asked Salgado if Palisena had seen this word in the document. Salgado said in fact Palisena did.
“Did he not ask you to change the heading? Perhaps to Charitable Donations!” Justice Jayawardena quipped. Salgado said Palisena asked him to change it, but went on with the marking “informant” as it was the realisation he got.
The afternoon session started with PTL dealer Kaushitha Rathnaweera taking the witness box. He was questioned on several cheques he got from W.M. Mendis and Company. According to Rathnaweera, he got these cheques from Mendis and Company, encashed them and gave the money to Kasun Palisena, his CEO.
According to Rathnaweera, two office assistants of the company also encashed similar cheques and gave the money to Kasun Palisena.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned Rathnaweera on the cheques.
JJ: These cash cheques relate to money paid by the PTL to Perpetual Asset Management, Perpetual Capital Holdings, W.M. Mendis and other group companies, on account of treasury bond and bill transactions. From time to time they gave cash back to PTL.
Then you will encash those cheques and give money back to Kasun Palisena which apparently is kept in his office. Did not non-PTL persons come to his office from time to time ?
Rathnaweera: That I don’t know.
Justice Jayawardena while observing that all these cheques amounted to Rs. 6 million or more, asked Rathnaweera if he asked from his CEO about these large stacks of money. Rathnaweera said he did not make any inquiry from his boss. “There is something called human curiosity. Based on that, why did you not ask about the money?” The witness said he did not ask about the money since it was not “his business.”
Monetary Board member Nihal Fonseka is to appear before the Commission on Monday. The Attorney General’s Department informed the Commission that there would be more telephone call recordings which will be produced before the Commission on Monday as well.
