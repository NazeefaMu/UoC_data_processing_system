Lankan cricket in the doldrums as Zimbabwe wins series

HAMBANTOTA: Sri Lanka’s cricketing fortunes took a further dip when they slumped to another humiliating defeat at the hands of low ranked Zimbabwe who beat them by three wickets in the fifth and final One-Day International to win the five-match series 3-2 at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Sooriyawewa here yesterday.
It was Zimbabwe’s maiden series victory over Sri Lanka in the one-day format and it was achieved by a convincing performance by the visitors who outplayed the hosts in all departments.
Zimbabwe in fact did what Bangladesh failed to do – win a series against Sri Lanka in any format.
It seemed a day where nothing could go wrong for Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer when he won his team’s first toss of the series and having inserted Sri Lanka in first strangled them through his spinners to a moderate total of 203-8.
Then Zimbabwe’s openers Hamilton Masakadza (73 off 86 balls) and Solomon Mire (43 off 32 balls) made short work of that target by posting an impressive stand of 92 off 86 balls that set them on their way towards achieving their score. Sri Lanka fought back to capture four cheap wickets for 29 runs and reduce Zimbabwe to 175-7, but man of the day and the Hero of the Match Sikander Raza followed his magnificent spell of off-spin bowling (3/21) with a run-a-ball innings of 27 not out that included two sixes, one of which was the winning hit.
With his captain Graeme Cremer (11 n.o.), Raza added 29 runs in 21 balls to see Zimbabwe home to a historic series win, only their fourth overseas.
They had previously won in New Zealand (2-1) in 2001 under the captaincy of Heath Streak, the present Zimbabwe head coach, in Bangladesh (3-0) in 2001 and in Kenya (5-0) in 2009. Sri Lanka’s top order was jolted by Raza who snapped up two of the three early wickets to fall to have them on the defensive.
Zimbabwe came to this match having done their homework very well. They changed their strategy for this crucial game by opening the bowling with a spinner instead of their fast bowlers against whom openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka had scored back to back double century partnerships in the previous two matches.
However yesterday it was a totally different ball game with Raza proving more than a handful with a first spell of 6 overs for figures of 2/11 on a surface that was used for the third ODI and now started to offer more bite and turn.
Sri Lanka suddenly found themselves in deep trouble as the spinners Raza, Cremer and Sean Williams reduced them to 153-8 with only Danushka Gunathilaka (52 off 86 balls) of the top order batters playing with any assurance.
Only a face saving record half-century stand for the ninth wicket between Asela Gunaratne who top scored with 59 not out off 81 balls and Dushmantha Chameera (18 n.o.) saw them reach a respectable 203-8.
However to defend such a small total Sri Lanka needed an exceptional performance from their bowlers and even though they came back strongly the runs they had put on the board was insufficient to defend on the pitch as Zimbabwe after a few hiccups cantered home with 71 balls to spare.
The defeat coming after their disappointing exit from the Champions trophy in England is a bitter pill to swallow and things are certainly not looking all that bright for Sri Lanka cricket at the moment. Incidentally yesterday’s match happened to be the 300th ODI played in Sri Lanka. Hamilton Masakadza was named Man of the Series. - ST
