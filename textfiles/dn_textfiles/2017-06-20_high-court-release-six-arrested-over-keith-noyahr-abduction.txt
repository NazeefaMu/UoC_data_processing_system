High Court release six arrested over Keith Noyahr abduction

 
Six army intelligence officers arrested for allegedly being involved in the assault and abduction of journalist, Keith Noyahr were ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by Colombo High Court today.
 Accordingly, each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.35,000 and three sureties of Rs.1.5 million each.
They were barred from leaving the country and High Court observed that bail can be cancelled if they interfere with evidence and witnesses in the case. They were further ordered to appear before CID on every Sunday.
On March 20, the Mount Lavinia Magistrate issued an order to release the suspects on bail despite the strong objections of prosecution on which the CID was yet to conclude investigations.
 However, the CID filed a revision application in the High Court challenging the Magistrate's order to release the suspects on bail.
 Following the revision application filed by the CID, the High Court issued an order to suspend the Mount Lavinia Magistrate's order and further ordered to remand the suspects.
 Keeth Noyahr who was Deputy Editor of The Nation was abducted on May 22, 2008, was mercilessly beaten by an unidentified group and was held for over seven hours.
 The CID arrested six Sri Lankan army personnel attached to the Army Intelligence Directorate, in connection with the assault on Noyahr.
A Major of the Intelligence unit is also among the suspects.
