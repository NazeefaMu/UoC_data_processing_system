New regulations at Yala ensure sustainability: SLTDA

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), supporting the decision taken by authorities to limit the number of vehicles entering Yala National Park, said the regulations were needed to ensure sustainability, discipline and conservation.
A senior spokesperson from the SLTDA said the new regulation was needed to protect Yala National Park.
“Overcrowding was a serious issue at Yala and it posed a serious threat to the flora and fauna. There were times when traffic jams were reported in the park as a result of a large number of safari jeeps freely entering the venue,” he said.
Pointing out that the new regulation will help tourism, as it is aimed at conserving the park, the spokesperson added that the generations to come will have the opportunity to experience the beauty of Yala. “Giving safari jeeps unhindered access to the park will spoil the experience for everyone. The SLTDA strongly supports the new regulation in the name of sustainability and conservation,” he said. The Secretary to the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry R. M. D. B. Meegasmulla said 600 jeeps have been registered and the maximum number of vehicles entering the park is limited to 300 per day.
“The 600 jeeps will have access to the park every other day,” he said. Wildlife authorities have suggested three sessions per day with 100 jeeps each. Safari jeep owners at Yala National Park, meanwhile, launched a protest yesterday, opposing the decision taken by the authorities.
