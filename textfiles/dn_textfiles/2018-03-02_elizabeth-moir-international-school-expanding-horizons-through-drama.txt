Elizabeth Moir International School: Expanding horizons through drama

Endless horizons and limitless possibilities is what Elizabeth Moir International School is about. The school makes sure that their students have a wholesome education. Dramatic Moves interviews the members of English Drama Club of Elizabeth Moir who are equipped with skills needed to carry them into the future.

Personality development
Drama Teacher Anushka Senanayake, commented on the importance drama plays in the life of an adolescent. For some of us adolescence is a time we cherish and enjoy but for others it is a time that hold painful memories. However Drama can play a critical role in the life of an adolescent.
“At any stage in life, drama can play a huge role in your personality development. Especially in adolescence some students may feel insecurities because they are discovering what they believe in and what they stand for, what they might find funny or sad. Drama is a nice avenue through which they can explore those things. It is an easy way to make friends and learn how to collaborate. There are a lot of little lessons you can learn through taking part in a production,” said Senanayake.
She believes that one doesn’t necessarily have to act but being a part of the crew, the designing team or the production team can help one to develop.
“Drama gets people to come out of their shell. It builds up so much confidence, and for me it is wonderful to see students who are very shy or never speak up, break out of that. It helps them grow. They not only discover what they believe in and stand for, but also it teaches practical skills such as time management, organizational skills, respect each other and being able to hear other peoples’ ideas and learning how to share ideas. You even learn how to agree and disagree and work towards a common goal,” pointed out Senanayake.
Senanayake feels that doing drama will certainly help a student adjust to the different roles you will have to play in your life. It can help you develop a sense of identity and the type of person you will become.
“In addition to the subject matter, they learn in school and outside school, this is just one more tool that will help students discover things they enjoy or don’t enjoy. It involves a lot of practical skills. It touches on humanity, so playing these different roles and observing other actors playing other roles, and just by being engaged with theatre, it opens their eyes, to different cultures, and different ways of living and thinking, things that they might not be usually are exposed to,” explains Senanayake.
Theatre covers so many areas that your academic education may not cover. It pushes you to see things from different points of view. Thespians explore different stories, people from different backgrounds and culture – the different worlds they immerse themselves in, which will lead to a much more sensitive person.
Winning hearts
President of the drama club, Areeb Thassim feels that his journey in drama is something that makes him very proud. In the course of time he has widened his repertoire of skills.
“Drama brings out a lot of things in you that you didn’t know you already had. I never acted before until I came to Moir and now I am the Drama President. I have also discovered a lot of things about me as well,” said Thassim.
Thassim had the good fortune of playing Prince Charming in Cinderella, which is a much coveted role amongst actors. Not only does this role involve a chivalrous demeanor, but the actor needs to step into a role that needs to win the hearts of the female audience. Thassim pulled it off really well.
“My favourite character is Prince Charming in Cinderella which I did many years ago. A lot of people who have played the part have been charming, so the ‘charm’ part is something that I enjoyed tackling. Yes I think I definitely pulled it off. When you are an actor you have to get into different mindsets. You have to become a different person. And to be a good actor you have to get into it really well. Over time you learn things about new characters that you didn’t really know and you develop as a person. The most recent performance I went to see was ‘Sound of Music’. That was absolutely amazing. The whole production was amazing. Being part of the school English Drama club has been really fun and it has given me a sense of identity,” explained Thassim.
Unearth new talents
Nicole Haddon rates her role as Lina Lamont in ‘Singin in the Rain’ as one of her favourites. For her role as Lina Lamont, actress Jean Hagen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The film ‘Singin in the Rain’ was also nominated for Best Original Music Score for Lennie Hayton.
“From the characters I have done Lina Lamont in ‘Singin in the rain’ is my best mainly because that character was so different. It was definitely the most challenging and that was why I quite liked it. By doing drama you learn things about yourself you never even imagined. You have new experiences and you unearth new talents in yourself. You learn how to adapt to characterizations and improvise. Through every single different character you learn something different. Not only about that character but also about yourself and when you watch other people act, you see them adapt and overcome obstacles and you learn things by observing them,” said Haddon.
‘Shakespeare in the Park – Othello’ is her favourite play and Haddon added that drama helps you express yourself in different ways which you did not think possible.
“When I first joined Moir, I enrolled in the play ‘Whose Life Is it Anyway’ and that was the start of my friendships and I made an identity in school, and people recognized me and my passion has grown with it as well,” said Haddon.
Into spotlight

For Bjorn Paul his performance as Cosmo Brown really fascinated him. Paul, someone who was unheard at school, came into spotlight and drama transformed his life.
“As an actor you get to explore other aspects of life, and how other people view life. I think the part I played in ‘Singin in the Rain’, the character of Cosmo Brown really stands out for me. I really liked playing that part because he was such a narcissist. I liked playing that character and trying to bring out the narcissism and that indirectly in a way actually helped me deal with some of my insecurities,” said Paul
Paul pointed out that the chemistry in the group is definitely important if you want the play to work. “Some time ago I watched ‘My fair lady’ which up to today is one of my favourite plays. Their acting and characterization was really awesome and I still feel that it is the best play I have witnessed. Before I did drama at Moir I felt sort of invisible, so I think it has really helped me build up my identity,” said Paul.
Kaavya Gnanam like Haddon and Paul too was relatively unknown until she took up drama. She feels that it has made her more empathetic.
“Before I did drama I was really quiet and no one really knew who I was. But when I started doing drama more people got to know me and I felt confident in showing people who I really am. It has also helped me come out of my shell and discover myself,” said Gnanam.
She also pointed out that during rehearsals you enter into the wondrous process of understanding personalities.
“Especially when you play a character with a negative personality, you spend so much time working on that character, you start to understand who they are and the way they think. When I tap into a character that I am playing in any production, there are so many things I resonate with while figuring out things about me and my personality. The biggest thing is that acting gives you a sense of understanding and you get to a level of empathy.
We work as an ensemble cast, so we do a lot of different activities and make sure that everyone is comfortable with each other. I like the performance when my house did ‘Mind Your Language’ at the Inter-House competition, I really liked it because we did so much with it really expanding on it,” said Gnanama

Tienn Kapilasena, who played the ugly sister in Cinderella needed to portray a darker side of society - a spiteful spinster who has plenty to feel nasty about. For a young man his age his efforts are indeed praiseworthy, since it is a role that is a challenge for even an experienced actor.
“I have played some really weird characters that involved a lot of humor and these are some of the many things drama has helped me explore and allows me to discover new things through characters. One character I liked playing was the ugly sister in Cinderella because for me, when acting as a girl I am able to develop new skills,” said Kapilasena
“When you are acting you have to make yourself that character, and on stage you have to become that character, and you need to get into their shoes, so you definitely discover more about different people,” he asserts.
“My favourite play was the one we did recently – ‘Singin in the Rain’, because from Junior school to senior school there is such a big difference in the type of acting, so I got to explore the different types of genres. In real life when you say something to someone there is always the chance you will get a negative reaction, but in drama when you are on stage and you have those lines and you say it. And that helps you in real life because you’ve been exposed to responses that you would see in society,” added Kapilasena.
