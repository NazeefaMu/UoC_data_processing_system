Key IT Forum encourages women's involvement in ICT

 
"I am saddened that women in leadership do not surpass 10% in practically every sphere of life, whether it is the public sector, private sector or may it be in politics. We need to change this cultural mindset and fix this problem", the Deputy Head and spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office Rosy Senanayake said.
She was the guest of honor at the 'Women in IT Forum' held at the BMICH, Colombo recently.
The Forum began with an opening address by ICTA Chairperson, Chitranganee Mubarak, who emphasized on the role ICT plays in empowering women and the importance of harnessing that power, whether it is through a stay-at-home mother following her dream of baking cupcakes promoted through a Facebook page, or a young woman who wants to rise to the top of the field.
Ho Se Mun, Executive Director, Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation, sharing insights on Singapore's inclusiveness of women in IT, said: "What do you picture when you think of IT? Guys in slacks with keyboards looking very geeky. And it's up to us to change that and ensure the industry is made of more than just 'programmers'".
"Education is the key. I think it's important that we not only educate the students, but actually the parents as well," she noted, explaining the many instances that girls have told her that their parents have discouraged them from pursuing a career in the IT sector.
The speech was followed by a panel moderated by TechAdvisor.lk editor Mihiri Wikramanayake, an online tech website, which included women leaders from the local IT industry - Vidumini Ranasinghe (Project Director, MillenniumIT), Vishaka Nanayakkara (Senior Lecturer, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa), Yashinka Jayasinghe Alles (Education Programs Manager, Microsoft) and Shamini Wickremasekera (Chief Risk Officer at LOLC).
They shared their thoughts, career paths and how they manage to 'do it all'. The women urged the young students to reach for everything they aspire to be.
Event partners, MillenniumIT CEO, Mack Gill said, "We're extremely happy to have been a part of this event. Earlier this year, we held a similar event for university students, and the response was terrific. We hope to spread our empowerment message to more young women across the country and encourage them to develop a dynamic career in IT. "As a company, we create opportunities for women to balance their personal and professional lives, through flexible working hours, work-from-home options and the on-site crèche for the children of MillenniumIT employees''. "As an industry, ICT is the fourth largest contributor towards our country's GDP but very few women are involved in it. So it's essential that we do something to change this. Last year, Google became the first tech company to release its diversity statistics and many other big names such as Facebook, Yahoo, LinkedIn, etc., followed suit. With only one in three employees being women in most of these companies the lack of diversity in the IT has become a global issue", FITIS Chairman Chinthaka Wijewickrama said .
