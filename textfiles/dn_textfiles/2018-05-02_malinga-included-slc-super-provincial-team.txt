Malinga included in SLC Super Provincial team

Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga has been included to play in the SLC Super Provincial one-day tournament beginning today.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva speaking at a press conference stated that Malinga has to first prove his fitness and form by playing cricket either at home or in the IPL.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala also shared his views and said that in his opinion Malinga was good for T20 cricket but it is the selectors’ job to select him.
“If he is currently playing in the IPL the selectors will have an idea of his performance but being a bench player how can they consider him for selection,” said Sumathipala. - KR
