‘Rain in A’pura insufficient for Maha Seasonal cultivation’

Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayake emphasized that the monsoon rain so far received in the Anuradhapura district is not at all sufficient for launching a successful Maha Seasonal cultivation. He said so referring to the present situation of the 2017/2018 maha cultivation plants to the Daily News.
"In the Anuradhapura district, farmers have experienced heavy cultivation loses during consecutive cultivation seasons due to the drought. Our target for the 2017/2018 Maha Season is to cultivate paddy in 130,000 hectares. So far, 100 percent cultivation could be done only under Tisawewa tank. No paddy cultivation is currently possible under the 3,000 minor irrigation tanks. In this background, it is envisaged that around 35 percent out of the targetted landscape of 130,000 hectares could be cultivated during the Maha Season," he said.
Wanninayake said that under the current circumstances, the distribution of free dry food ration bags would continue for another round. So far, Rs. 1.388 million has been invested for this relief measure, involving 149,000 drought-affected farmer families in the district. In the meantime, for remedying the fertilizer shortage, mainly urea, the distribution of fertilizer is being done through the 43 agrarian services centers in the district. Wanninayake said that within a few days, the fertilizer shortage would be over.
He added that the Agriculture Department, jointly with agrarian services development authorities, are transporting fertilizer stocks directly to the agrarian services centers at the rate of Rs. 2,480 per bag. Farmers could buy the fertilizer at Rs. 2,500 per bag from the agrarian services development centers. Anuradhapura Agrarian Services Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said that so far, around 750 metric tonnes of urea have been sold to farmers from 25 agrarian services development centers, and stocks are currently arriving at the other centers.
