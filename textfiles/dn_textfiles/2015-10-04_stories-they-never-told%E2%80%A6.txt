The Stories they never told…

Why Darcy never did dive into that lake: 20 years after the BBC's Pride And Prejudice aired, cast and crew reveal their secrets from the set
Liz Hoggard for the Daily Mail
Can it really be 20 years since Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle gripped the nation as on-off lovers Elizabeth Bennet and Fitz-william Darcy in BBC1’s mega mini-series Pride And Prejudice?
The critically acclaimed six-parter was a huge success that made a sex symbol out of Colin, earned a Best Actress BAFTA for his co-star Jennifer and is credited with bringing period drama to a fresh generation of younger viewers. But when it first went out on BBC1 on 24 September 1995 no one guessed it would change the TV landscape.
It was the year of The Spice Girls and Robbie Williams. The battle of Britpop between Blur and Oasis even featured on News At Ten.
And yet an average of 10 million viewers sat on their sofas to watch a classic bonnet drama. ‘The streets were empty on a Sunday night,’ recalls David Bamber, who played creepy clergyman Mr Collins.
Jane Austen’s 1813 book centres on Lizzy Bennet, her four sisters, and their mother’s attempts to marry them off to well-to-do gentlemen, including Charles Bingley, who’s just moved into the local Netherfield estate, and his friend Mr Darcy.
Best remembered
It will always be best remembered for the famous scene in which Mr Darcy emerges from the lake at Pemberley, his Derbyshire estate, in a wet shirt, but the dramas that went on behind the scenes as the series was being filmed were almost as compelling as those on screen.
Colin Firth wasn’t actually allowed to dive into the lake himself for the wet shirt scene as the film’s insurers demanded a stuntman because of the fear he might contract Weil’s disease, spread by rats’ urine in the water and potentially fatal.
‘We made him look wet instead,’ director Simon Langton explains. ‘Colin poured a bucket of water over his head, much to the consternation of the make-up and costume departments – and the rest is history. Although any thoughts about the transparent effects on a white voile shirt were never mentioned at the time!’
Young and contemporary
The adaptation was the brainchild of producer Sue Birtwistle, who got screenwriter Andrew Davies on board by cleverly telling him the book was about sex, money and social climbing. Together they hatched a plot to make their version young and contemporary.
‘It was very innovative for its time,’ says Andrew, who wrote scenes set in the Bennet girls’ bedrooms or showing people getting dressed or taking a bath. ‘There was very much a kind of young, physical, funny, sexy vibe to it. And maybe that’s why people still love it.’
Jane Austen’s world is very female, but Andrew wanted to put men at the heart of the drama. Thus the series opened with horseback scenes. Later Darcy was seen fencing with Bingley and, of course, swimming in the lake at Pemberley. Andrew still regrets that Darcy didn’t dive in naked.
‘It was about Nature with a capital N. Darcy had been spending too much time being polite in London with a group of stuffy people. But at the centre of his essence he was just a man, almost like a wild creature, who saw his lake there and thought, “Let’s get into this different element where I don’t have to be polite or worry about my tenants. I can just be a man.”’
Much to the writer’s disappointment, a white shirt was produced to preserve Darcy’s modesty as he emerged from the lake to encounter Elizabeth Bennet. But actually this just made the scene hotter for many female viewers. Even Andrew was astonished. ‘What was intended to be a comic scene of social embarrassment – having to have a polite conversation while ignoring the fact that one of them was soaking wet – became something quite different.’ But Colin, then 33, brought something very special to the role. On set his fellow actors were mesmerised by the way he could convey so much by apparently doing so little.
Proposal scene
In fact the first scene Colin and Jennifer had to shoot was the proposal scene where Lizzy turns him down. They barely knew each other but Colin nailed it, says Adrian Lukis, who played dastardly Army officer Mr Wickham.
‘Even as a young man, Colin had a real strength to his personality, whereas most people in their youth are flying around like headless chickens trying to find out who they are, particularly actors.’
Colin himself later explained that the stress of shooting the proposal scene brought an unexpected chemistry between himself and Jennifer Ehle.
‘Because it’s so inappropriate to do that early and it’s so nerve-racking, we gave it a tremendous amount of attention and got a degree of adrenaline working up to it, so it was invested with something it would never have had if we’d done it later, when everyone had settled in. It was jumping in at the deep end,’ he said. Their subsequent real-life romance is testimony to that. With five Bennet girls to cast, director Simon Langton ended up seeing just about every actress between 15 and 28. It was quite a challenge to find people who had the wit and charisma to do the script justice, as well as the right period air.
‘Elizabeth Bennet had to have sex appeal because we’d be watching her for a total of six hours,’ says Simon. ‘It doesn’t mean she had to look like a goddess, quite the opposite sometimes, but I knew Jennifer definitely had it. Though I had to convince the producer, casting director and script editor, who were all women!’
A miraculous actress
Jennifer was only 24 but, says David Bamber, she was already ‘a miraculous actress’. ‘She was so composed. She hit the bull’s eye every time. I don’t mean she was complacent. She was just fully formed. I was mesmerised by her, everybody was. And Colin was a hoot, very funny and adorable.’
The drama enhanced the careers of a generation of young actresses, including Susannah Harker as Jane Bennet (her mother Polly Adams had played Jane in the 1967 BBC version), Julia Sawalha as Lydia, Jasper Carrott’s daughter Lucy Davis as Maria Lucas (she went on to star in The Office), Richard Briers’ daughter Lucy as Mary, and Emilia Fox as Georgiana Darcy in her first TV role at the age of 19.
‘One of my great pleasures is that most of the 19th-century novels have really young heroines so it’s a chance to get people at an early stage of their careers and watch them develop after that,’ says Andrew Davies.
Today he has a soft spot for Julia’s fun-loving, officer-mad Lydia but he wasn’t sure the actress known for playing straight-laced Saffy in Ab Fab could pull it off. ‘I said to Sue, “Isn’t she a bit low-key and sweet and demure for Lydia?” And Sue said, “You haven’t met her, have you?” And Julia was absolutely brilliant.’ In fact she was actually 25 playing 15. - Daily Mail
WE THOUGHT HE'D BROKEN HIS NOSE
Catastrophe occurred when Colin Firth had to shoot the underwater close-ups of him swimming in the lake in a large weed-filled tank at Ealing Studios some time after the outdoor scenes were filmed.
‘The tank was covered by four heavy, metal-reinforced wooden slabs,’ says director Simon Langton. ‘On the day Colin was due to dive in, the plan was to remove all the slabs by crane. When I arrived the last slab was still in place but I was told there was no need to move it. Colin overheard this and intervened, saying nobly that he would take special care to avoid surfacing too late and hitting the slab.’Against the director’s better instincts filming commenced, but ‘all too predictably the momentum of Colin’s initial dive took him further than he’d calculated, so he rose to the surface beneath the slab, hitting the metal support crossbar with a sickening thud – right on the bridge of his nose. I quietly died,’ Simon admits with understatement.
‘A series of scenarios flashed through my head – the producer Sue Birtwistle would give me the sack, shut down filming, recast Darcy and reshoot while Colin had his nose reconstructed.’ In fact, by some miracle, the collision wasn’t as bad as was feared. ‘The swelling on Colin’s nose wasn’t conspicuous enough to merit rescheduling. I was wary however of using any profile shots for some time,’ adds Simon dryly.
