Divisional Secretaries to select Samurdhi beneficiaries

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed to transfer the power of selecting of Samurdhi recipients to the Divisional Secretary through the District Secretary which is vested in Samurdhi Development Officers.
The government also has decided to scrutinize the qualifications of over 1.4 million Samurdhi recipients across the country. The government has reached this decision based on thousands of complaints stating that they are not being granted the Samurdhi benefits while many others who at least do not have basic qualifications are being granted the Samurdhi benefits.
