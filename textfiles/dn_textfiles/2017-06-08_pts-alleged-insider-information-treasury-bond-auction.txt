PT's alleged insider information on treasury bond auction

The former Bank of Ceylon Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala answered in affirmative when he was asked if it is possible to assume that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd had insider information regarding the treasury bond auction that took place on February 27, 2015.
Dharmapala said, after receiving the results of the said auction, he felt the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited CEO may have had insider information regarding the said auction.
Asked as to from whom he can presume that the CEO received such information, Dharmapala said the information could have come from either the General Treasury or the Central Bank, as these two institutes have the access to information regarding government debt requirements.
Dharmapala testified before the Presidential Commission that inquired into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday. Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera, leading evidence for the day, submitted a CD including several telephone conversations relating to the happenings of the questioned Treasury bond auction.A conversation in which Dharmapala was speaking with a dealer from the Ceylinco Life Insurance Company was a highlight at the proceeding yesterday. The relevant conversation revolves around indicative bid rates. The insurance company dealer said, they were going to bid at a 10% rate in the aforementioned auction, to which Dharmapala said, "Awoth Athek," which can be loosely translated as 'if they accept it at a 10%, it would be a tusker' (meaning it would be a big profit).
Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena then shifted in and said, if the accepted bid rate was to go beyond a 10%, ‘it would be a procession with many tuskers in it.’ (meaning a very large profit).
Dharmapala was requested to explain what he meant by the term. He said, it meant a big advantage from the part of the dealer and the magnitude of such a transaction. It was observed that the term is of common use.
In a conversation that Dharmapala had with a Central Bank Front Office’s officer about the Treasury bond auction, he has said, "to give a vial of poison." The Commissioners requested him to explain what he meant by the expression.
Dharmapala said the expression was to imply the deep-felt anguish as a government officer regarding the auction. “I wanted to suggest as to ‘why you (meaning the Central Bank) did this (meaning accepted the bids at a very high rate) to us." Dharmapala further said he never thought the Central Bank would accept bids at high rates at the questioned Treasury bond auction.
