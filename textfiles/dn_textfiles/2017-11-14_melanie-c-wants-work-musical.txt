Melanie C wants to work in a musical

Melanie C said she would like to work in more musicals after successful stints in 'Blood Brothers' and 'Jesus Christ Superstar'.
Reportedly, the 43-year-old singer said she is busy with her music at the moment, but would like to get back on stage at some point.
'I released an album a year ago so we did some live shows. And I am just about to start work on another (record).
'(Would I do theater again?) Quite possibly yeah. Musical theater is a big love of mine. Hope there is some more in the future but I am concentrating on my music at the moment,' she said. PTI
