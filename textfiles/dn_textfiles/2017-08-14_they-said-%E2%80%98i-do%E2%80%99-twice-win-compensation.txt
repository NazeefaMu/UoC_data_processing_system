They said ‘I do’ twice to win compensation

Twenty couples are alleged to have said ‘I do’ twice over to defraud the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority and obtain compensation payments due to those who surrendered their lands to the Moragahakanda Resource project.
Police have launched investigations into this matter following a complaint made by the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority Matale S.P.T.B. Sugahtapala.
The Mahaweli Authority had complained that 20 couples had obtained compensation due to such families who lost their lands to the project by submitting pre-dated marriage certificates when they have been already married.
They had obtained these fraudulent marriage certificates with the connivance of certain marriage registrars.
Several marriage registrars who had aided and abetted this malpractice have been already identified and several police teams have been deployed to record statements from them.
