Most modern maternity hospital to complete within two years in Galle

The new Maternity Hospital which is under construction with a loan of Rs. 18 billion plus a grant of Rs. 500 million of German financial assistance, will be completed within two years.
It will be the most modern maternity hospital in Sri Lanka, Petroleum and Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
Minister said: “The new Maternity Hospital is a prime need for the Southern Province as the 2004 tsunami damaged the Maternity Hospital at Mahamodara, Galle. It was later renovated for temporary use.”
The aim of the government is to provide better healthcare for needy patients who seek treatment from state hospitals with the completion of the new hospital. The government wants to ensure that there won’t be pregnant mothers sleeping on the corridors of hospital,” Minister Weerakkody said
Health Ministry Deputy Project Director and Chief Civil Engineer Gayan Ranaweera said: “The new Maternity Hospital at Karapitiya, Galle will consist of 600 beds for indoor patients along with clinical facilities to treat another 200 outdoor patients daily.”
The hospital will also consist of an Incentive Care unit, Premature Baby Care Unit, six Modular Theaters, radiology unit, hematology unit blood bank and physiotherapy unit.
