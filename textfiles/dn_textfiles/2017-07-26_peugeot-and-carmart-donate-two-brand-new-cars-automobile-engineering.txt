Peugeot and Carmart donate two brand new cars for automobile engineering students

Two brand new Peugeot 508 diesel cars were handed over to Chandima Weerakkody, Minister of Skills Development & Vocational Training recently by Yasendra Amerasinghe, CEO of Carmart, along with their principals, Automobiles Peugeot.
This was as a result of social welfare project initiated during the tenure of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and former Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe on the invitation of Amerasinghe.
The vehicles will be provided by the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to the Ceylon German Technical Institute, Moratuwa and Automobile Engineering Training Institute, Wellampitiya. This marks the first time that brand new, high-technology, European vehicles have been donated to these institutes.
Valued at approximately Rs. 40 million, these two cars are to be used as technical learning platforms by students who can be familiarised in a practical environment to understand the underlying engineering. The vehicles were imported on special approval from Exchange Control to be used for technical training only and hence cannot be registered or used on the road, but used only as test cars in their respective automobile engineering schools.
Chairman of Carmart Senake Amerasinghe and CEO Yasendra Amerasinghe handed over the keys to Hon. Chandima Weerakkody at the Ministry of Skills Development & Vocational Training.
Also present were Thilak Kariyawasam Private Secretary to the Minister, the two Principals of the Institutes, Mrs. Rukmani Amerasinghe of Carmart and DGM-Marketing, Carmart, Uditha Obeysekere.
