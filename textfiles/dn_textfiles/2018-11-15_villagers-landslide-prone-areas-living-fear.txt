Villagers in landslide-prone areas living in fear

The villagers of Pallepola in Matale are living in fear as they were issued red notice several years ago to evacuate from their residences as the Rusigama hill is a landslide-prone area.
Twenty five houses below the hill were issued red notices by the Disaster Management Centre and the Divisional Secretariat. However, they were not granted alternative land to settle in, compensation or any other facility.
Villagers said they had been living in the area for over 20 years. They said over the past few years, they had to move to the temple during the rainy season and return to their houses in the dry season.
They said every year trees and boulders fall along mountain slopes but no officer comes to solve their issue. They added that only the Gramaseva Niladari visits them during the rainy season to instruct them to evacuate from their houses.
