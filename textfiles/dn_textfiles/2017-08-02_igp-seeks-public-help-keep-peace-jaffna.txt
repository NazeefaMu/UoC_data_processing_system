IGP seeks public help to keep peace in Jaffna

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujitha Jayasundera yesterday said that Police need the cooperation of the public to bring those who disrupted peace in the Jaffna peninsular to book.
He said those who were involved in attacking police officials and disrupting peace in the peninsular will be dealt with according to the law. “Remnants of terrorism remain though we eradicated the menace. Several incidents took place in the district recently. This type of incidents should not happen again,” he said.
The IGP was speaking at a meeting to make the civil society and religious leaders in Jaffna aware of the situation in Jaffna yesterday.
“We will prosecute the suspects involved in violent activities in Jaffna,” he said.
Four teams have been deployed to arrest the suspects involved in the attack on two policemen attached to Kopai Police.
