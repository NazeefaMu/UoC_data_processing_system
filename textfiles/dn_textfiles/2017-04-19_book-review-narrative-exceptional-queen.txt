Book Review: Narrative of an exceptional queen

Title : Rejina
Author : Mohan Raj Madawala
I pen these words in the first flush of the impression I got from reading the novel ‘Regina’.-To be exact in translation ,the queen. Longinus , an ancient Roman critic had said that a good piece of writing could be recognized when the reader feels elated on reading the creation. He would retain the feeling and it would serve as reflection for further thought in future. Prior to the beginning of his creation Madawala quotes from historical sources ,what one could find on the chief character of his novel – Queen Anula, from Sri Lankan historiography. Anula, the queen who reigned Sri Lanka , in history famously as well as infamously!! ( In relation to certain incidents in relation to some sources.)
The incidents related in connection with her had been so controversial that they had instigated many speculations in the imaginations of respective writers. They had exercised their imagination ,creating, exaggerating and most often being often self consciously judgmental.
The phenomenon has been such that when one refers to ‘the queen’ in Sri Lankan History it is Anula that comes automatically to one’s mind , in spite of other devis having ruled the country in history.
Selection of Anula devi to be the centre of his creation may have been also due to the fact that, she had been a different women in the cultural and social context of the back drop. (The fact that she had been exceptional?)
The novelist in his work had become a creator as well. He had planted his feet firmly on the reality of history, yet had been bold enough to fantasize. The effort allows him to merge the marvelous with the magical in an atmosphere of legendary allusion. The incidents that flow one after another makes the reader slide down with the fascination of nothing other than reality. Hence he would be a participant which surpasses the boundaries of limits.
Facts and imagination seem to fuse with a humane understanding and sympathy , even to the extent of challenging age old norms and traditions. One is led to observe the serious message of promoting harmony , within and the social context of racial conflict. It propagates an insightful understanding , if the reader is willing to open up in reception. The willful destruction of artificially imposed marginalization is in fact what underlies the saga.
The manner in which the Queen is treated throughout is interesting. One may ask oneself – ‘had circumstances made her a feminine feminist?’ The author makes one realize the the extent and gravity of what fate plus man had made her experience. The story is also about how she faced the various situations and how she found solutions to each problem. In building up her character one is given a glimpse of how a woman’s mind would react in extreme circumstances. And Queen Anula was no ordinary woman. Rejection, sexual humiliation, subjugation of love, betrayal ,exploitation and subjugation were some that she was made to undergo. Finally, lonely at the top, it was pathetic that her only confidants were the fish in the royal pond. Hence the question one may ask oneself is the extent of fairness to estimate her actions as purely results of lust.
When reading Rejina, one feels like reading the ancient Greek historian Herodotus or Homer, the great poet who wrote The Iliad. The writer seems to move from one sphere to another with so much fluidity that the reader may recognize the transition. The reader would participate in the marvelous. Such an incident is the conversations she had with the fish in the pond. Though there is a feeling of fairy tale fantasy involved is it not also deep human psychology? How many of us ,in the modern day talked our woes with our dogs or cats in desperate situations of isolation? The humane humanness that the author makes one feels is proven at the shock or the tragic shudder one is made to experience when the invading army had made piles of bones from the talking fish, who were her ultimate allies.
If an estimation of the language that is used, one is bound to notice the flexible fluidity in the style of expression and composition. It has been the custom among Sri Lankan novelists who recreate the past in their creations to adhere to probable language that they presume to have been used at the period. Though this method might be historically and linguistically correct, the reader might feel the text somewhat strained and artificial. Excuse me if I am wrong, but the basic appeal in a novel is that it should be appealing and readable to the reader. One had to be mindful at not posing a riddle in camouflage of a novel. The language that has been a vehicle through the novelist had expressed his imaginative creativity.
