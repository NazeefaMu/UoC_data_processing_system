The Minister also said that they have taken quick steps against harassment and physical assault of tourists in Mirrisa recently by locals in the area.
The incident which caused outrage in the tourism industry was made known only through the media as neither the victims nor the establishment concerned or any other person had reported the matter to the police or any other authority. Investigations began only after directions were issued by the Minister of Tourism Development to the Tourist Police to investigate the matter following media reports. “Ever since the incident in Mirissa was first reported on Monday April 9, I have been closely following the progress of the investigations.

“He assured me that all measures were being taken to bring the culprits to book as soon as possible,” said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga.
Four suspects were arrested by the Weligama Police on Friday the 13th of April and two others on the 15thfollowing the recording of statements from several witnesses.
Minister said that the affected tourists would be once again called for the inquiry and all their travel and other expenses would be sponsored by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
SLTDA has also launched a separate investigation in to the operation of the establishment.
Minister also requested the Tourism Police to increase’ beats’ in tourism areas which in turn will help to irradiate such incidents.
Tourist Hotels Association Chairman, Sanath Ukwatte said this is the first time that such a stern action is taken against this kind of incident by the government and they welcome this move.
Meanwhile SP Ruwan Gunasekera Police Spokesmen said the government has allocated Rs. 80 million from the last budget to set up 20 more tourist Police stations in popular tourist destinations increasing the total to 41 stations.
