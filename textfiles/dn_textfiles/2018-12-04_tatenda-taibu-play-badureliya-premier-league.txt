Former Zim captain and selector to make a comeback
Tatenda Taibu to play for Badureliya in Premier League

Former Zimbabwe cricket captain and convenor of selectors Tatenda Taibu is making a comeback to the cricket field and has signed up with Badureliya SC to play in the ongoing Premier League cricket tournament.
Taibu is due shortly in Sri Lanka to fulfill his contract.
The 35-year-old wicket-keeper/batsman is one of the few talented cricketers from Zimbabwe to make a name for himself at the highest level.
Making his debut against West Indies at Harare SC in 2001 he carved a reputation as one of the most skilled batsmen in all forms of cricket.
He represented his country in 28 Tests, 150 ODIs adb 17 T20Is. He was also a competent wicket-keeper.
However, in July 2012, he decided to bid adieu to the illustrious sport at the age of 29 and said that he would want to concentrate on working for the church.
Crictracker.com reported that the experienced campaigner approached the club after they had put out an advertisement for an overseas player in the lineup.
Badureliya SC has a history of playing overseas cricketers in the domestic tournaments. Afghanistan’s left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran, Digvijay Amarnath, the son of former Indian Test cricketer Surinder Amarnath, Michael Richardson, son of former South African wicket-keeper/batsman and current ICC CEO Dave Richardson and Greg Smith, former Nottinghamshire batsman are some of the overseas players who have played for Badureliya SC.
Taibu will become the most high profile cricketer ever to represent the club.
According to the tournament rules a club can register a maximum of three overseas players but only two can play at one time.
Badureliya SC already has two Indian cricketers signed up with them and Taibu will be the third overseas player.
