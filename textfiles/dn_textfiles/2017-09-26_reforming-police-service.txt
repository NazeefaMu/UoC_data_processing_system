Reforming the police service

The country's police force is to undergo a shake-up, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a public gathering that followed the inauguration of the Police Officials’ Residential Complex at Wekunugoda, in Galle. He said new reforms will be introduced to make the police service more efficient and productive. He said; “the Sri Lanka Police is administered and functions under very archaic laws and regulations which were introduced a long time ago. We plan to modernize our Police Force by introducing laws and regulations for an effective and productive service to the nation”.
It is about time that our police force underwent a radical change and get out of the strait jacketed groove in which it operates, at present. The police force, constituted as it is, is lacking in dynamism and there is a feeling that it is merely going through the motions. Perhaps, the old moribund laws governing the service has stood in the way of advancement and the creation of a modern police force. There is also much disgruntlement in the service due to lack of recognition for career advancement and also the poor pay structure of the police, particularly where the bottom ranks are concerned. Steps should be taken to remedy this situation in order to get the best out of our police personnel.
No amount of new laws, or, attempts to modernize the police force, will succeed, unless discipline is given pride of place in the service. Regrettably, the police service has recently not exactly endeared itself to the public due to the actions of a minority in the force. The war years compelled the authorities to dispense with standards, and proper screening, when recruitment was carried out, due to the urgency in augmenting manpower to meet the challenge. As a result, certain bad eggs found their way into the service, whose actions resulted in the good name of the police being blackened. The war also brutalized segments within the police force, which manifested itself from time to time in the form of violent behaviour.
The nexus between the law enforcement and the underworld too has besmirched the service. Death of prisoners, while in police cells, too has forced the public to view the police with a jaundiced eye. A former Sports Minister once described the police, as being the second most corrupt public institution, behind the education sector and followed by the Cricket Board, and there is ample justification for this indictment. These shortcomings have got to be rectified, first, before the introduction of new laws to modernize and upgrade the police service.
The woes of the police personnel too has to be addressed at the same time. Presently, there is a lot of frustration in the service, as once mentioned by State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne, during a TV talk show. According to him, policemen are among the lowest paid public servants, who are called upon to perform a thankless job of protecting the citizenry and exposed to danger.
One should also not forget the not inconsiderable role played by the police, during the war. Many police personnel paid the supreme sacrifice, while on active duty in the operational areas. During the nascent stages of the Eelam war, the police, it was, who was in the initial firing line, falling prey to the terrorists when police stations in the north were overrun. In one of the blackest episodes of the Eelam war, some 600 policemen were gunned down, in cold blood, in the east, after surrendering to the LTTE, on the instructions of the government of the day.
We say this, because, there is today, a tendency to discount the role played by the police in the war, with the army, navy and the air-force hogging the limelight. Hence, the part played by the police, during the conflict, should also be duly recognized and the service elevated to comparable levels.
True, it is over eight years since the war ended, but there are still vestiges of the war mentality ingrained in the service, to a certain extent, given the actions and conduct of some members of the khaki brigade. While modernizing the police service is being spoken about, steps should also be taken to rid the service of this hangover and revert it to the purely, civilian law enforcement body that it used to be. Measures should also be taken to enhance police PR, which had suffered over the years. More and more programmes of police-public interaction should be organsied, such as sports events and shramadana campaigns.
The Premier also noted that there was poor response from Tamil youth, to join the police service, and that only 150 had responded to the 7,000 vacancies advertised by the government, which wanted to fill 10 percent of this number from the Tamil Community. In the past, the LTTE forbade Tamil youth from joining the police, but this threat is no longer there. Hence, concrete measures should be taken to encourage Tamil youth to join the police force, by building trust. After all, we have had Tamils as IGPs, in the past, who were well received by the majority community.
