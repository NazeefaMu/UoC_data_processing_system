Kandy SC regains top spot

As expected Kandy Sports Club show cased a completely dominating performance at Nittawela where they managed to remain unbeaten in the second round. Besides, this was their second highest score of the season. Kandy Sports Club with this win and also with bonus points goes top of the points table.
Kandy again made an instant impact and steered the Airmen into turbulence and made the game a one sided contest recording a score of 73-13 underlining their superiority. Now comes the crucial moment when both defending champions Kandy SC and second placed Havelock's SC lock horns in a crunch game. This game which is eagerly looked forward to will be on Sunday, 5 February at the Park grounds under lights commencing at 6.30 pm. Both teams are earnestly preparing themselves for this big game but they need to keep calm heads and take the field in the right manner. They have to adapt to the weather conditions and understand that both clubs have been on the back of a thumping and so they are going to want to put things right as well. It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future unlike most future events, it is impossible to know for certain who will win the 2016/17 rugby league championship. Will it be the Nittawela Club or the Park
Club? Kandy SC has won the league on seventeen occasions, the only team to have done so in the history of rugby in Sri Lanka. Each club has played five games and only Kandy SC and Havelock's SC are in the running.
Kandy led by scrum half Roshan Weeraratne has a well-balanced side and have reached peak form with the team playing as one unit, particular the forwards have improved tremendously and co-ordinate well with the three quarters. If Roshan’s team continues to play in the same trend and fashion they should have no problem in retaining the League title this year too. The Kandy forwards are very big and heavy compared to the other clubs and a combined unit. They are also fast on their feet.
The back division too comprises some exciting players. In the game against Air Force SC, Kandy SC enjoyed some good advantage in territory, and went on to score fourteen tries; from the fifth minute of the first half they completely dominated the game in every department. The Airmen came into the game unsettled and they lacked momentum. Absolutely nothing went right for the Air Force although they were improving rapidly this season.
It must be mentioned that the Kandy Rugby Committee headed by Lasantha Wijesuriya, Coach - Sean Wijesinghe, Assistant Coach Nalaka Weerakoody, Team Manager Kapila Silva, Convener Saliya Kumara, and masseur Sanjeewa Perera and attendant S. Kumar for their devoted, committed, tireless and yeoman services done single-handedly to bring back the lost prestige and pride after a disastrous first round two defeats against the Air Force SC and Navy SC to head the points table with effect from this week. The encouragement and support rendered by 'Mr. Rugby' Trustee of the club Malik Samarawickrema and the sponsors
Cargills Ltd, Etisalat Mobile PLC, Singer Sri Lanka Ltd, Print Media and the rugby fans are enormous and immeasurable.
