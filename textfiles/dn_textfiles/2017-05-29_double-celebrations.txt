Double celebrations

The twin sisters Maria Pignaton Pontin and Paulina Pignaton Pandolfi are close to turning 100 and are now given a photo essay to commemorate another year of life.
The photos were taken on May 15, in Ilha do Frade, located in the city of Vitória (Brazil).
According to the photographer who presented the sisters, Camila Lima, they occupy the post of older twins of the Holy Spirit and the second place at the national level.
“I was aware of their existence and I decided to give them a present with this beautiful photographic essay. They are beautiful and very cute! I’ve never met anyone so old, especially twins. They deserve it and the rehearsal was beautiful,” says the photographer. Bored Panda
