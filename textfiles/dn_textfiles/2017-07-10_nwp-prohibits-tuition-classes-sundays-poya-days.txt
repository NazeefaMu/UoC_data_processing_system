NWP prohibits tuition classes on Sundays, Poya days

The North Western Provincial Council (NWP) has decided to take legal steps against private tuition class owners and teachers who conduct classes in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts on Sundays and Poya days.
A special Gazette notification was issued prohibiting private tuition classes in 2015 by the then Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara on Sundays and poya days as schoolchildren are deprived of gaining religious knowledge and spiritual guidance from Sunday dhamma schools and places of worships.
The private tuition class owners are openly violating the rule now and therefore, the NWP Human Resources Development Authority decided to conduct raids in the province to nab errant tuition teachers and file cases against them in courts.
The offenders are liable to undergo one year jail term and a Rs. 50,000 fine if they are found guilty by the law in this regard, NWP Human Resources Development Authority General Manager B.M.L.C. Balasooriya said.
