I have stopped supporting JO activites - Manusha

The newly appointed Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said he had stopped supporting the activities of the Joint Opposition as of August 17, 2015.
He stressed: "I have always supported the SLFP".
Nanayakkara on Wednesday left the ranks of the Joint Opposition (JO) to become a Deputy Minister of the national government.
"At the January 8 elections, I supported the SLFP and worked towards the victory of its leader at the time, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Thereafter, we kept working for Rajapaksa because he was the most popular Prime Ministerial candidate for the SLFP. We wanted to establish a SLFP government, not a UNP government,"explained the deputy minister.
He added, "Our aim is to form an SLFP government in 2020, not another UNP government". He further explained that one of the main reasons for his crossover was that certain minor parties in the JO were working towards breaking the SLFP apart and that he could no longer be party to such an enterprise. "Those who left at the time of crisis have come back to take charge and run things in the JO. We lost because of the family bandism practiced previously, but, it seems that we are having that system once again and they are taking things forward," Nanayakkara said.
He also said that many other members of the JO were also holding discussions with the President on the possibility of joining the government,
"There are even senior SLFP members in the JO interested in crossing over,but, they want Cabinet posts to do so. But, on the other hand, there are others who have said that they will join the President when the time is right," Nanayakkara said.
The recent crossovers will take the total number of Cabinet, State and Deputy Ministers to 92. Former President Mahinda Rajpaksa in 2010 too appointed a total of 91 Ministers, Senior Ministers and Deputy Ministers to form his government.
