SriLankan GSAs appointed on Wickremasinghe’s dictates

SriLankan Airlines had flouted its standard procedure in appointing General Sales Agents (GSAs) during the chairmanship of Nishantha Wickremasinghe.
The national carrier had flouted this procedure and appointed sales agents only approved by former Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe during his tenure, former SriLankan Airlines Technical Services Manager Yasmin Majeed said on Monday.
Testifying before the Presidential Commission probing into malpractices of SriLankan Airlines, Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Catering the witness said under cross examination by State Counsel Sajith Bandara. Majeed submitting relevant documents said former Chairman Wickremasinghe had even appointed persons who received lowest marks at interviews as General Sales Agents.
She said sales agents were appointed according to the dictates of former Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe and Chief Executive Officer Kapila Chandrasena. She said the former chairman had even visited foreign countries to appoint General Sales Agents causing a heavy expenditure to the Airline.
