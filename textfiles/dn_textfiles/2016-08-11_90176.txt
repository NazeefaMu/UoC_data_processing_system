Automated system reaps in big revenue

 
Sri Lanka Cricket president said that the way his Cricket Board has handled arrangements for the ongoing tour here by Australia has reaped in big profits from the first two Tests played at Pallekele and Galle.
“We like to say the Galle cricket match was a tremendous success as well as Kandy,” said Sumathipala at a media briefing yesterday. “With our new automated system, for the two and a half days in Galle we got the highest ever recorded revenue at the gates.”
The figures provided by SLC Head of Finance Chandramali Korale states that for the first Test at Pallekele there was a total collection of Rs. 1,824,900 and at Galle a total of Rs. 2,826,150.
“We had never had more than 200,000 to 500,000 of revenue rupees in the past at the end of a five-day game. We had over 4.1 million rupees of the turnover for two and a half days. We totally managed secured gate collections of Rs. 2.9 million which is a huge amount of money for two and a half days of a Test, which we had never expected,” Sumathipala said.
Comparatively the figures given for previous tours show: Pakistan tour 2015 (3rd Test) – Rs. 323,300, Indian tour 2015 (1st Test) – Rs. 229,900, Pakistan tour (1st Test) – Rs. 31,900.
