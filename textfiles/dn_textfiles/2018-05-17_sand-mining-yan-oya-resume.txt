Sand-mining at Yan Oya to resume

It was learnt that certain parties including the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), had been attempting to revive sand-mining activities at the Yan Oya reservoir, which had been recently suspended on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Yan Oya Reservoir Project information sources revealed that a group of officials attached to the GSMB had launched an exploratory investigation into the sand deposit site, collecting data such as the consignment of sand that could be extracted until the project’s completion, prevention of environmental contamination and modes of monitoring sand excavation while adhering to permitted conditions. However, residents of the Yan Oya and Wahalkada areas along with families being resettled, were reported to have opposed the renewal of sand-mining licenses and the issuance of new mining and transportation permits.
Sources said that taking the environmental pollution caused by such activities into consideration (such as seepage into dams and adjoining water sources) along with the continued opposition for the project, the site was closed and the issuance of sand-mining permits were halted by the President.
It was revealed that by that time, around 250,000 cubic metres of sand had been excavated and that the GSMB had earned nearly Rs. 200 million.
At a Yan Oya Reservoir Progress Review Committee meeting headed by Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka, Yan Oya reservoir project officials including irrigation engineers, had said that the poorly supervised sand-mining work being carried out beyond the permitted three-metre depth, would damage the reservoir’s basin which was composed of limestone and in turn, result in seepage.
An Anuradhapura district mining engineer had said that reckless and prolonged sand-mining had created large pits within the reservoir catchment region.
Later, it was decided to neither extend the existing permits nor to issue new permits in this connection. Meanwhile, the Anuradhapura District Coordinating Committee’s attention was brought to the sand deposit issue when Irrigation officials had pointed out that the disposal of sand available in the reservoir site would adversely affect the final stage of the reservoir’s construction work.
Committee Co-Chairman and Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake and Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage, had called for more clarifications and opinions from the GSMB and the reservoir project management committee, including the Anuradhapura government agent, with regard to the re-opening of the sand deposit for further mining.
In reply, they had said that the re-issuance of mining permits would be initiated with a special investigation committee consisting of Irrigation officials and representatives of all other relevant agencies to overlook the excavation activities.
The said committee would recommend whether further sand mining would be detrimental or not by submitting a detailed report on the areas and extent of mining activities along with the quantity of sand to be mined from each area, transportation conditions and a transparent taxation system.
A Yan Oya Reservoir Project Management Committee spokesman, referring to the sand deposit issue, said that if sand mining and transportation activities which had previously jeopardised the Rs. 36-billion worth project were allowed to be carried out again, history would repeat itself.
He said rather than promoting sand-mining, the two-years-overdue resettlement programme and the compensation programme for the lands acquired to accommodate the reservoir’s infrastructural facilities, should be accelerated.
