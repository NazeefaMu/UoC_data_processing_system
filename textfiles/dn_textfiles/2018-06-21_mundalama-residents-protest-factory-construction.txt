Mundalama residents protest factory construction

People resident in several villages in the Mundalama area conducted a protest on the Chilaw - Puttalam road demanding the government to halt the construction of a factory in the 412-acre area in Mundalama using fly ash emitted by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant.
As the demonstrators refused to disperse until and unless a responsible officer visited and spoke to them, police had to summon Mundalama Divisional Secretary A. M. C. M. Premasuriya to speak to the demonstrations.
When the demonstrators demanded a written undertaking to stop the constructions of the proposed factory, the Divisional Secretary refused to accede to their demand and the protestors said they would never abandon the protest until some guarantee was given.
Thereafter, the Chairman of the Puttalam District Development Committee, Parliamentarian Hector Appuhamy spoke to the demonstrators via the mobile phone of the Mundalama police OIC and promised to halt the construction work until he held discussions with the demonstrators and they later dispersed peacefully.
Administration manager of the proposed factory, Channa Ratnayake when contacted, said the proposed factory is intended to minimise the environmental damage caused by the Norochcholai coal power plant. It will only build blocs using fly ash of the Norochcholai factory.
Although a licence had not been obtained for the project so far, the Wayamba Provincial Environmental Authority had issued guidelines to proceed with the project. Black flags had been put up in Mundalam against the Chinese presence and shops remained closed while police had beefed up security in the area yesterday.
