Serendib Leisure  refurbishes Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya in Kalutara

Serendib Leisure Management stepped to the aid of the flood-affected community of Neboda, Kalutara by refurbishing the Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya that was severely damaged during the devastating floods which affected many parts of Sri Lanka in May 2017.
The Kalutara district was one of the most affected areas out of over 14 districts impacted by the floods and landslides that resulted from heavy rainfall in the South Eastern parts of the island. With hotels of its chain located in the vicinity, Serendib Leisure Management initiated a project to help rebuild Kalutara and bring relief to its community in the wake of the destruction.
Chief Operating Officer of Serendib Leisure Management, Shantha Kurumbalapitiya said, “We are grateful to the GA of Kalutara and Divisional Secretariat for informing us of the dire need to lend a helping hand to the community of Neboda.
Having already witnessed the destruction that the floods and landslides caused the community, we did not hesitate to offer our assistance to help restore the lives of those affected.
I am also proud to note that the Serendib Leisure team went the extra mile to reduce costs from its Annual Awards ceremony and contributed it to this worthy cause. Further, it was extremely heartening to witness the community coming together, from the School Principal to the parents, teachers and students who rallied together to rebuild an establishment that is close to their hearts.”
The restoration of the Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya in Neboda, Kalutara, which was carried out over a period of three months by Serendib Leisure Management together with the community of Neboda, successfully reached completion in November.
