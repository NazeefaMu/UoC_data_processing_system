Increased spot fines for traffic offences from Sunday

Regulations to impose increased spot fines for 33 traffic offences will come into effect on Sunday (15).
The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has amended the fines imposed on relevant motor traffic violations with the aim of controlling the rising number of road accidents and ensuring disciplined driving, a Ministry spokesman said.
According to this amendment made by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, spot fines imposed on 33 traffic offences will be increased by 30-50 percent.
Spot fines for speeding have been revised as follows: for speeding 20 percent above the speed limit, a fine of Rs 3,000; between 20-30 percent above the limit, a fine of Rs 5,000; between 30-50 percent above the limit, a fine of Rs 10,000; speeding over 50 percent above limit, a fine of Rs 15,000.
The high-speed fine will have to be paid within 14 days. After 14 days, the offender will have to pay double,” a spokesman from the Traffic Police said.
A spot fine of Rs.2,000 has been introduced for offences related to non-compliance with traffic rules, disobeying the commands and signals of police officers, not taking precautionary measures when parking a vehicle and instructing without an instructor’s licence.
A Rs. 1,000 spot fine for excessive emission of noise and smoke from a vehicle, non-use of seat belts, not displaying the revenue licence and driving licence when required, non-compliance with traffic signs, using inappropriate signals when driving, and failure to wear protective helmets.
Offences related to identification plates, use of motor vehicles in contravention of the provisions of the revenue licence, failure to obtain authorisation to drive emergency service vehicles and public service vehicles, driving a special-purpose vehicle without obtaining a licence, failure to obtain authorisation to drive a vehicle loaded with chemicals, hazardous waste and failure to have a licence to drive a specific class vehicle would also subject to a spot fine of Rs.1,000.
Reversing a motor vehicle for a long distance on a road and exceeding the number of persons allowed in front seats of motor cars would also subject to a spot fine of Rs 1,000.
The fines applicable to the carriage of persons in excess of the authorised number in private coaches and of goods other than personal luggage in motor cars or private coaches, carriage on lorry of goods in excess of the maximum load or maximum axle load, exceeding the number of persons carried in a lorry and failure to carry the emission certificate or fitness certificate of a vehicle have been revised to Rs. 500.
The regulations state that where a police officer makes a detection in respect of certain traffic offences and where the person involved admits liability for such offence, such person may, in lieu of prosecution for such offence, become liable to the spot fine.
“The traffic fines would be implemented following an Extraordinary Gazette notification that was issued on January 15 this year. The relevant spot fines charge sheets have already been printed and handed over to all police stations and will be implemented by July 15,” the Ministry spokesman said.
“We believe the new fines will ensure the drivers are more careful. It has worked in other countries. We also believe, at least 50 per cent of the violations committed will reduce due to the increased fines,” he said.
