JVP to introduce 20th Amendment in May as private member’s bill

 
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake plans to introduce a 20th amendment to the Constitution, as a private member’s bill in May, seeking to completely abolish the executive presidency.
Many country leaders such as President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickrememsinghe, and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged to eliminate the executive presidency in the past.
But Dissanayake asserted in March of this year that he believed neither the UNP nor President Maithripala Sirisena ever intended to actually elimination the position.
The office of the President was created in 1972 as a ceremonial position but was only endowed with executive powers in the 1978 Constitution introduced by J.R. Jayewardene.
