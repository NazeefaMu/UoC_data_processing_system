Reservoir at spill level

The Wimalasurendra Reservoir started overflowing due to heavy rains in the western slopes of the hill country, and the reservoir’s sluice gates were opened on Monday afternoon to release excess water.
The Castlereagh and Maussakelle Reservoirs are also near spill level.
Hydroelectricity generation has reached the optimum capacity since the Canyon, Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya and Wimalasurendra Reservoirs are filled to capacity, a spokesmen for the Ceylon Electricity Board said.
