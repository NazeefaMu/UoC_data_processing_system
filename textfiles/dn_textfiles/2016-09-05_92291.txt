SLFP’s 65th Convention

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s 65th Convention was held in Kurunegala yesterday, under the patronage of party leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
The convention attracted large crowds of party members from all parts of the country which according to many party stalwarts was the biggest ever gathering seen at a SLFP Convention. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike, former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne, other SLFP leaders and SLFP members from the grassroots level attended.
