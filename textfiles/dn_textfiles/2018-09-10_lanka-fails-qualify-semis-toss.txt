2018 SAFF Championship
Lanka fails to qualify for semis on the toss

India finished as winners of Group B after beating Maldives 2-0 in their final group game of the 2018 SAFF Championship at the Bangabandhu Stadium in Dhaka, Bangladesh yesterday.
Nikhil Poojary (36th minute) opened the scoring and Manvir Singh (44th) doubled the lead right before the break to help India finish with six points and set up a semi-final date with Group A runners-up Pakistan. Both Nikhil and Manvir scored their first international goals.
The second semi-finalists was decided by the toss of a coin because both Sri Lanka and Maldives had tied with the same number of points. Maldives won the toss and they will play Nepal in the first semi-final on 12 September at the same venue.
The referee and the linesmen gave a poor display which enabled India to take the lead.
Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the semi-finals due to referees’ mistakes. The FFSL intends writing a protest letter to the AFC and FIFA regarding the poor quality of refereeing.
