Cook, Amla share double century stand before England fight back

CENTURION, FRIDAY: Debutant Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla shared a double century partnership for South Africa before England fought back on the first day of the fourth and final Test at SuperSport Park on Friday.
Cook made 115 and Amla hit 109 in a South Africa total of 329 for five at the close of play.
The pair put on 202 for the second wicket before Amla's dismissal sparked a collapse in which four wickets, including that of Cook, fell for 36 runs.
Cook, called up at the age of 33 when the South African selectors finally opted for a specialist opening batsman to partner Dean Elgar, was calm and organised from the start of his 218-ball innings during which he hit 14 boundaries.
Amla, four months younger than Cook but 91 matches richer in Test experience, was back to his fluent best as he reached his century off 131 deliveries with 18 fours.
Hashim Amla stroked his 25th Test century as he and new cap Stephen Cook batted South Africa into a strong position on the first day of the fourth and final Test against England at SuperSport Park on Friday.
Amla made 102 not out and Cook was unbeaten on 91 as South Africa reached 224 for one at tea. The pair's second wicket partnership was worth 189 at the interval.
Cook, 33, displayed the old-fashioned virtues of a specialist opening batsman. He left alone balls that threatened danger outside the off stump and was strong off his legs, punctuated by the occasional firm drive through the off side.
In contrast to his father, Jimmy, who was dismissed first ball on his Test debut against India in 1992/93, Stephen Cook scored four off the first ball he faced, a leg side half volley from James Anderson. Jimmy Cook did, however, make a century on his debut against an English team in a 'rebel' international 11 seasons earlier. A freak catch by James Taylor at short leg was England's only success after South Africa won the toss and decided to bat.
Dean Elgar and Cook put on 35 for the first wicket before Elgar was caught by Taylor off Moeen Ali for 20 when the off-spinner was brought into the attack in the 11th over.
Elgar went for a pull shot and Taylor took avoiding action but the ball lodged between his legs and he was able to grab it before it touched the ground. AFP
