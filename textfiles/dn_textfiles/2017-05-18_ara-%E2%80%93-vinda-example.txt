ARA – VINDA  an example

He was like a powder keg in the pavilion. Then came his turn to walk to the centre. And did not the keg explode! It did so in all his fury hitting bowlers, especially the speed merchants, to whatever corner in the field or over it with sheer brutality.
He was none other than PINNADUWEGE ARAVNDA DE SILVA a cricketing star that shone brightly for over a decade, driving, hooking, cutting and flicking opposing bowlers with disdain as he cut loose with twinkle toed footwork which was a sight to behold.
When he walked to the middle, he exuded confidence and was an inspiration to his partners who all prospered owing to his inspiration and the manner in which he laid into the bowlers treating them as if they were just trundlers with no fear of them.
He began his early schooling at Isipathana before switching on to D.S.Senanayake College where his rich cricketing talent began to bloom and blossom. He had a peculiar stance. Yet his coaches Charles Warnakulasuriya and W.A.N. Silva did not think it necessary and did not rightly attempt to change it because that was how his creator wanted him to bat. Even the great Sir Donald Bradman had a peculiar stance.
Stance not from the book
The stance was not particularly from the book. He was not an example to the youngsters watching him bat. However it did not deter him from rewriting the books even at school to club and then national level with his record breaking feats with the bat which was like a sword in his hand as he took on the bowlers and scattered them with rare world timing and footwork which what batting is all about.
Early in his career he was known to go slap bang at the bowlers attempting to hit the cover out of the ball and most times lost his wicket not being able to keep the ball along the ground, but hitting it up and being caught out.
This style of carefree batting earned him the nickname’ MAD MAX.’ But as his career unwound, he began to learn getting in line, foot to the pitch of the ball, head over it and then hitting it to the boundary or over it with great arrogance and pride.
ARAVINDA had a good eye. He had the ability to spot the ball long before other batsmen could do and this ability he put to good use to score his fifties, hundreds and double hundreds. When he was striking spectators who flocked to see him motoring went into raptures. But when he was dismissed cheaply there were oohs and ahhs with his followers cursing the bowler who got his wicket.
Outstanding cricketers
At school two of the most outstanding cricketers were his captain Malik Alles and Hashan Tillekeratne. While ARAVINDA and Hashan hit the top in the game, it was sad the way Alles had his promising career cut short. While at practice Alles was unaware when a ball struck his head and he dropped dead. Frantic efforts to revive him failed and a cricketer who would also have hit the big time was cruelly cut short. He showed promise of being a master with the willow.
No wonder that it is said that death comes like a thief in the night and that in the midst of life we are in death. ARAVINDA and Hashan really missed him and his influence. ARAVINDA’s records like good wine needs no bush. It is there for posterity.
ARAVINDA made many big scores at Test level. But the one he cherishes most must be the 267 he made against New Zealand in Wellington in a Test match. He massacred all of the Kiwi bowlers and the one who suffered most was speed ace Danny Morrison.
Morrison was one of the fastest going at that hurling the ball at great speed. The faster he bowled the harder ARAVINDA hit him and the humiliation Morrison suffered would have eased when ARAVINDA was finally dismissed. I was there at the scene of action soaking in the ARAVINDA heroics describing the fireworks for the ‘DAILY NEWS’ and the ‘SUNDAY OBSERVER.’
Fast bowlers to suffer
ARAVINDA had a sweet tooth where fast bowlers were concerned. The men who suffered were Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney, Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Kapil Dev. He knew they would want to bounce him out and he was superbly is position to hit the short ones, mainly over square leg. And they were once bitten twice shy and would not bounce at him.
Then it was ARAVINDA who paved the way for success in 1995/96 World Cup that was co-hosted by Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. In the preliminary rounds he made 91 against Zimbabwe and then massacred the Kenyan bowlers racing to 145 in 115 deliveries.
In the semi-final against India when things looked bleak with Sri Lanka losing their two explosive openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana for just two runs, both to Javagal Srinath at Eden Gardens in Culcutta he steered the floundering batting ship with 66 off 47 balls and saw Sri Lanka make a challenging 252.
India in their chase batted stupidly making 120 for 8 and with all hope gone, frustrated Indian spectators unable to watch this disaster threw bottles on to the outfield and set fire to the stands. With the game unable to proceed Match Referee former West India captain Clive Lloyd had to abandon the game and award Sri Lanka victory by default.
His crowning moment
But his crowning moment was when he master minded the World Cup final victory against Australia in Lahore, Pakistan. He played the stellar all rounder’s role as he broke the back of the Aussie batting getting rid of captain Mark Taylor, Ricky Ponting in taking 3 for 42 and also pocketing two catches. Then chasing 242 for victory he batted like a champion to score a century – 107 and become the first Sri Lankan to do so.
In 1996 he was included in Wisden’s five cricketers of the year another rare honour. In 1990 he was chosen one of the five Indian cricketers of the year. After retirement he was made a selector and later chairman. He made his Test debut as an 18 year old against England at the home of cricket - Lord’s.
There are many other records that are too numerous to mention but suffice to say that he played in 93 Tests scoring 6,361 runs with 20 hundreds and 22 fifties with 267 his highest. He played 308 ODIs scoring 9284 runs with 145 as his highest. He also played for Kent in England and the century he made being the highlight.
Cheer leader Percy Abeysekera’s famous refrain – Aravinda oba hinda appi okkama duk vindha.
