BASL to write to JSC over Kannan controversy

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) is to write to the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) over the controversy surrounding the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge.
BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya told the Daily News yesterday that it has been revealed that the appointment was made subsequent to a letter written by BASL President Geoffrey Alagaratnam. However, the Executive Committee members as well as Bar Council members were unaware of this letter. “It came up during the Executive Committee meeting on Saturday that this letter was sent by the BASL President without the consent of the Bar Council or Executive Committee. This is an internal issue that we must first be resolved. It was pointed out at the meeting that the BASL President had violated the BASL Constitution by sending the recommendation letter without the approval of the Bar Council or Executive Committee” he said.
“We would write to the JSC explaining the entire episode surrounding the controversial appointment” he said.
It has also been decided to hold the BASL election on March 15 after amending its Constitution.
