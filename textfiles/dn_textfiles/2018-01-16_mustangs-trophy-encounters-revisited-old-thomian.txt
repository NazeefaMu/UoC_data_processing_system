Mustangs trophy encounters revisited by an old Thomian

The book is a valuable one as it has authentic details of the matches and the team members. Great pains must have been taken to find out the Christian names or other popular names of the players. Outstanding performances have been given pride of place
Shantilal Wijesundere, an old Thomian and a cricket enthusiast, has compiled a comprehensive book on the encounters for the Mustangs Trophy. I must congratulate him as he has added to a collection of material already available in relation to Royal-Thomian encounters of the longer version. The match as all cricket lovers know is played after the Big Match by the teams of Royal College and S. Thomas’ College. The match has been played from 1975 and the history of the matches is well presented.
Wijesundere not only covers the matches but also gives us the history of how the Mustangs Trophy came about th includes an article by one of those responsible for initiating the idea. He also gives us some interesting trivia on the shorter form of the game and the Duckworth Lewis Stern (DWS) method of dealing with shortened matches.
Many famous names are mentioned against the individual matches and it was interesting to read some messages from cricketers who participated in the first encounter. Cricket enthusiasts who are not old boys would also be fascinated to be reminded of many schoolboy cricketers who were household names in the past.
The book is a valuable one as it has authentic details of the matches and the team members. Great pains must have been taken to find out the Christian names or other popular names of the players. Outstanding performances have been given pride of place. The research which has gone into this work is commendable and should be applauded.
The record produced is given official recognition by the Principals of the Colleges giving their own messages.
The compiler intended that the proceeds of the book be used for sport activities of the two Colleges.
The book is available at the STC OBA Secretariat or the Royal College Union office.
