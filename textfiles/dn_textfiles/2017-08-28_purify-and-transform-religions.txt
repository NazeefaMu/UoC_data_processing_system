PURIFY AND TRANSFORM RELIGIONS

Precious insights about the human condition, the meaning of human life, how life is to be lived, and towards what end life should tend have come to us through philosophers, thinkers and the founding leaders of religions. ‘What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and ruin his life?’ (Gospel of St. Mark, Ch.8 v. 36). Founders of religions, philosophers and great thinkers have endeavoured to lay down principles and values that could be and should be applied to life and influence human behaviour.
Succeeding those leaders, their immediate followers who grasped their teaching and understood them well and followed their ways have transmitted that teaching to succeeding generations. Thus they have raised the minds of human beings beyond the visible, material and the tangible to the intangible, the invisible and the transcendent. Due to their closeness to their teacher, the disciples’ insight and experience of the unseen and the invisible were to them as real as the visible.
They even came to an experience of them in their life as a foretaste and a pledge of what is to come. They have freely communicated their life-experiences to us and it is up to us to examine, investigate and understand them and if they seem agreeable and true, follow them.
BACK TO THE ROOTS
We find ourselves endowed with not only physical capacities but also intellectual, spiritual and moral capacities. We have not exhausted finding the depths in them. The human being not only learns to scale physical heights and overcome physical limitations, the human being also has the capacity to reach spiritual heights not only individually but also as a community, as a national and global family. The modern age provides many challenges in all these spheres and areas of human endeavour.
Thinkers have even attempted to go to the roots and beginnings of religions to investigate the values that had been handed down by religious leaders.
Though we have inherited valuable insights from the wisdom of the ancients, we ourselves are endowed and have the ability to look at, observe and decipher the vast visible world and the observable universe in our own way. We try to understand the meaning and end of all that exists. We keep striving to understand and test various long established principles and values, compare and analyze them and arrive at principles of life, values and truths we begin to firmly hold.
Especially today, with the advancement of knowledge on all frontiers, the modern human beings are also delving into the teachings of the ancient religions to search for and find if there be in them meanings and values that could underpin, consolidate and direct individual and community lives of people in the modern epoch’s ‘twenty-first century’ even though human beings have lived on earth for hundreds of centuries.
REACQUIRING OLD WISDOM
To some people, today, who are extremely confident of their ability which they think they superabundantly possess, the insights of the ancients are absolutely worthless because ‘today we are the most intelligent, the most sophisticated and advanced people to ever inhabit this planet earth’.
Others wiser than the former are humbler and more realistic are readier to learn from the heritage of those who have gone before us. Just as they have inherited an old house which they suitably repair and refurbish to make it a habitable dwelling, they gratefully inherit also the wisdom of the old transmitted to them by their forefathers; they do not put them away, they gladly accept them and adopt them and even refine and sharpen them as values to live by.
In our journey to the modern world we may have not only thrown away unique values of life, many have got closely involved in their religions and lost themselves in a confusing maze of callous assumptions and preferences alien to the religion’s fundamental beliefs and principles. Human hearts until they are formed by disciplined practice often turn to things that are wrong and evil.
Many distinct religions and communities of belief have not done for centuries a sober self-assessment and a self-criticism of their manner of living according to their respective foundational beliefs. Many have not come to a comprehensive understanding of the values they have opted to believe in and live by.
Many are hesitant to admit that among themselves a ghetto mentality has predominated and due to a peculiar way of treatment extended to others, relationships with other human beings and communities have got distorted. Elite religious communities themselves that should have remained refined and unpolluted have got tainted and corrupted. In such a state relationships with others are difficult and even if they are established, they remain unstable. Many are reluctant to say mea culpa (my fault) for not having promoted the good of every man and the whole man without discrimination.
Unless we constantly review and purify our outlook and understanding of human affairs, they tend to degenerate and get corrupted. Human beings have corrupted and could still corrupt themselves, religious beliefs as well as religious precincts and environments.
HUMAN BEINGS MADE NEW
If misunderstandings that could give rise to antagonism, violent conflict and warring among religions are undesirable, how are we going to avoid such possible situations? Could we have the foresight and establish acceptable, honest and frank relationships among ourselves?
Could we not severally and collectively search and come to a fresh and broad understanding of a vision of human destiny, the meaning and purpose of human life, the value of human life, the growth and development of humanness and the legitimate hopes and aspirations of human beings? Are not human beings prior to the things, places and edifices they use and the powers they exercise? Do we accept that avoidance of facing these challenges could lead us all to be insensitive and heartless, that is inhuman, sub-human and immoral?
We need to come to a newer and deeper understanding of our religions and religious beliefs. Neither religions nor the followers of religions should cause hurt and destruction to the lives and possessions of others. All human beings have human dignity and human rights which should be always respected. Human beings are endowed with intelligence and rationality. All human beings are capable of cooperation, collaboration and sharing. With motivations provided and inspired by religions, all human beings could be made new and saved from the humanly demeaning cravings arising from selfishness, egoism, self-absorption and the ghetto mentality. None of us are perfect. Therefore we need to get rid of our imperfections; we all need constant purification. Religions should be helpful in that if religions too undergo regular purification.
RELIGIOUS FANATICISM
The extent that religion and religious beliefs could be depraved and perverted is well demonstrated by the phenomenon of the ISIS attempts of ‘restoration of the caliphate’ calling all Muslims to unite and rally round Abu Bakr Baghdadi of the extremist group of Sunni Muslims who emanated after the ideologue Osama Bin Laden, in the 1990s.
Though the great majority of Muslims do not see any legitimacy in Baghdadi and refuse to recognize him or support his terrorist activities, this shows that unacceptable emphasis of religious texts and corruption of religious norms could lead to and cause bloodshed not only among non Muslims but also among Muslims themselves.
Religious fanatics obsessed with a peculiar stance on religion and the rights of their followers do not regard human dignity and rights of other people and cannot tolerate them. ISIS fellows who succeed in attracting and indoctrinating fanatical ideologies and terrorist attitudes to some raw young people brought up in communities with confused values, have destroyed many young lives and manipulated them to commit many unspeakable crimes in the name of a religion they have hardly understood. Far too late many young people have later regretted joining IIIS and committing unspeakable crimes.
Such revolting attitudes should never corrupt any religion in Sri Lanka. However that does not absolve religious leaders from being vigilant and imparting wholesome religious training and formation to the young so that any form of religious fanaticism may be prevented.
Religions need purification and transformation under the guidance of prudent and wise religious leaders if they wish to bequeath to the coming generations the riches of religious truth, good traditions and the noble religious way of life.
