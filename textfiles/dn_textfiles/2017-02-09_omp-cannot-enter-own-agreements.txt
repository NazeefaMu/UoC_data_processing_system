OMP cannot enter into own agreements

Amendments approved by the Cabinet this week will not allow the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) to enter on its own into agreements with any person or organisation to help achieve its mandate. The amendments proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought to repeal paragraph (a) of article 11 of the Missing Persons Act No 14 of 2016.
Paragraph (a) of Article 11 states that, “The OMP shall have the following general powers- (a) to enter into agreements, as are necessary to achieve the mandate of the OMP, with any person or organization”.
The Office of Missing Persons was authorised through an Act of Parliament in August of 2016 but the office responsible for tracing those missing during conflict is yet to be established.
