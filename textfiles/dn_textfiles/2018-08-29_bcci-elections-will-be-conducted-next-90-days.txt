BCCI elections will be conducted in next 90 days

The Committee of Administrators (CoA) chief Vinod Rai on Monday said that BCCI elections will be held in next 90 days now that the Constitution has been adopted.
"BCCI elections will happen in 90 days and that's the deadline we have given ourselves. The moment the new body takes over, the COA will leave. We would do exactly what Justice Vikramjit Sen did (handover reins to DDCA's elected body)," Rai said.
"We have tried to ensure total transparency in the functioning and decision making process of the BCCI," Rai said.
"There are queries in Supreme Court and although I have an interpretation but I will not comment on it," Rai added.
Rai termed one of his big achievements as getting a pay hike for international as well as domestic cricketers. "Now players can raise invoice and payments would be directly credited to their accounts," Rai said.
