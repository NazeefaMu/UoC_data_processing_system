Patient passion

Being a Prefect gives you a taste of power at a very young age. It is how you use that opportunity at such a young age that defines you. Perfect Prefects features Head Prefect of Kingswood College Udaya Sumanasena who shows strong leadership skills and stamina in this post and shared with us the lessons he has learnt when it comes to successfully wielding power.
Sumanasena’s first lesson is that you need a strong personality to deal with a school community which is a mixture of teachers and students from various social and political backgrounds. This gives the young Head Prefect his or her first taste of power, having to adapt and deal with so many different personalities. The Head Prefect needs to listen to everyone carefully, use logic and reasoning powers and needs to be patient and understanding. These skills and traits should be what the Head Prefect should possess.
Compassionate and understanding
Handling people from different backgrounds, different economical statuses, multi-cultural and multi-religious backgrounds is no easy task but needs to be approached with empathy and a competent intellect. A strong leader needs to be compassionate and understanding. In history we have seen plenty of leaders who are strong, but who have become despotic because of a lack of compassion.
“All of us are social beings. I possess emotions such as love and compassion. I am humane and kind. But sometimes I need to control be tough. I cannot always be emotional. In order to fulfill the responsibilities of my post I need to control my emotions,” said Sumanasena.
Patience and remaining calm when things start to get out of control is a must when you are in any leadership role in a school. You need to compose yourself and you need to be focused. This temperament will help you perform any role.
Sumanasena looks up to leaders who are mentally and physically strong. According to Sumanasena, they should have good interpersonal relationship skills. Decision making is a vital personality attribute that needs to be perfected. A leader should be able to make stable decisions. Sometimes these decisions need to be made quickly. Sometimes a Head Prefect should be able to make decisions under pressure without depending on others.
Future aspirations
“I wish to be a scientist. However I would like to take up any challenge that will lead to a career that would be beneficial for me as well as society. Mass killings and massacres which are taking place all over the world in the name of political and racial conflicts make me feel so emotional. Some natural disasters occurred in Sri Lanka and all over the world during the past few months. This made me so passionate as thousands of infants and people died for no reason,” explained Sumanasena.
Sumanasena is into aesthetic activities which he says gives him spiritual and mental satisfaction. “It provides me with the opportunity to relax while enjoying good books and music. Also I believe interests in Arts is very important to personal and character development which some in the present generation lacks,” said Sumanasena
For inspiration Sumanasena looks to his parents. His father is a technical officer working for Sri Lanka Telecom. His mother attends to the needs of the children and duties at home. Sumanasena being the eldest in the family has a great responsibility, as he has to be a role model to his siblings as well as being a loving and caring brother. His parents give him so much support when it comes to his studies and his future career. He proudly says that he is no one without his parents support and guidance.
Happy and free
As mentioned before Sumanasena loves the aesthetics. He loves to watch classical movies and enjoys all sorts of writings which gives him immense pleasure. “I do read during my leisure and it gives me a heavenly feeling, making me so happy and free,” says Sumanasena.
Sumanasena believes that when facing something particularly challenging, it is normal to become anxious. But he overcomes these feelings by remembering everything in life he is grateful for such as the love, strength and courage given to him by his parents, teachers and gentlemen of Kingswood. This is how he makes up his mind, because he believes he is a strong person and can meet any challenge.
“I believe a good leader should possess a balanced personality, mixing patience, understanding, stability and human qualities and physical strengths. Such a man can be a successful leader with a strong personality,” pointed out Sumanasena.
