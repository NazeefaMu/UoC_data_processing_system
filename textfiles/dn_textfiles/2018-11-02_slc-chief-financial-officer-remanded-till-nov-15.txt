SLC Chief Financial Officer remanded till Nov. 15

The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Sri Lanka Cricket Piyal Nandana Dissanayake, who was arrested for the alleged financial fraud, has been remanded until November 15, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
Piyal Nandana was arrested on October 22, following a complaint lodged by the SLC to the Inspector General of Police.
The arrest of the Sri Lanka Cricket CFO is related to an alleged financial fraud, which was unearthed last September.
He had managed to successfully thwart the fraudulent attempt to transfer US$. 5.5 million of the SLC’s Media Rights sponsorship funds, which was due from an international Media Network, to an offshore account.
The SLC had cited CFO Nandana as the prime suspect who had claimed that his e-mail account had been hacked and requested for the transfer of the money to an off shore account. He was sent on compulsory leave.
The money was one of the three tranches coming from the Sony Picture Networks for broadcast rights of the England tour.
The Magistrate fixed the next hearing for November 15.
