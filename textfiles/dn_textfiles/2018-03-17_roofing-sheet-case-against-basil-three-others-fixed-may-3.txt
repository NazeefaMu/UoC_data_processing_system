Roofing sheet case against Basil, three others fixed for May 3

The case filed against four accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.2991 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department while distributing roofing sheets among Divi Neguma beneficiaries during the previous Presidential Election was yesterday fixed for further trial on May 3 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the defence party sought a further date citing that their counsels have to appear before the Supreme Court regarding a Special Determination petition.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Economic Development Ministry Secretary Dr. Nihal Jayatilake, former Divi Neguma Department Director General Kithsiri Ranawaka and former Divi Neguma Department Deputy Director General Bandula Tillekasiri in the Colombo High Court for allegedly distributing roofing sheets costing Rs.2991 million in the run up to the January 2015 presidential election. The Attorney General has initiated legal proceedings against four accused under Penal Code and Public Property Act for misappropriating a sum of R. 2991 million without parliament approval.
