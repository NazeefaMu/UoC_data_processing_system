Rain’s the main beauty pain?

The pre-monsoon drizzle is a respite from the sweltering heat, indeed! But, make-up wise, the ‘downpour’ season calls for extra caution. So, what are the dos and don’ts? Here are guidelines to follow...
The message for the season is clear: Go minimalistic! As a rule, always use water-resistant products. Waterproof and cream-based foundations help keep your skin’s base uniform, without making it appear cakey.
Skip the eye-shadow or at the most, opt for subtle colours like beige, brown and pink. Steer clear of glitter, fake falsies and gloss during the day, especially while stepping outdoors.
Choose cream blushers and gel-based eye liners for a lasting effect. Do away with the kajal. This look is less messier and smudge-safe.
Pre-monsoon also happens to be that time of the year, when your skin gets flaky and dry. The skin on your lips is the most sensitive, so ensure you scrub them well-enough. Stock up on hydrating lip masks. It is liquid matte all the way for your pout, this season. Lipsticks in darker shades are also raging this season. Opt for berry, deep plum or marsala and go easy on the eyes to make a striking statement.
The importance of using a good SPF (even when it looks gloomy outside) can’t be overstated. Slather on sunscreen even when indoors. Always ensure you keep your skin make-up free, toned, and pores closed before applying it.
