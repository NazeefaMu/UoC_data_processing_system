Skanda hosts Dharmasena in Canberra

Sri Lanka’s ICC Elite Panel Umpire Kumar Dharmasena was recently hosted by Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner in Australia S Skandakumar when he officiated in the second ODI between Australia and New Zealand at Manuka Oval in Canberra. “We had a very pleasant chat and the staff, like me, were delighted to meet him,” said Skandakumar.
