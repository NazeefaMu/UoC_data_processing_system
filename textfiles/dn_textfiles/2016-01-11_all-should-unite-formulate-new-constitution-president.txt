All should unite to formulate new constitution - President

All of should unite in formulating the new constitution to build a modern Sri Lankan State in the 21st century, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
"Whenever a government attempted to draft a new constitution a kind of unrest had erupted in the country," President said.
Delivering a special statement on drafting a new constitution, President Sirisena told the Parliament on Saturday that whenever a government attempted to draft a new constitution a kind of unrest erupted in the country.
"Even today some sections of the society are trying to create unrest to make the government uncomfortable," he said.
The President emphasized that it is the responsibility of everyone to unite towards this and draft a new constitution for the betterment of the future generation by keeping aside narrow political agendas.
Refusing the rumours spreading across the country allegedly by some extremists claiming that the government is implementing the new constitution under foreign influence, President Sirisena said that there is no foreign influence in formulating the new constitution and this will be done understanding the needs of the country.
"The government's intention is to consider the ideas of all sections including the scholars, intellectuals and Constitutional experts in drafting the new constitution,” he said.
President Sirisena also said that depicting the new constitution, which is focused on the betterment of the country, as a Billa (boogeyman) is a great sin.
The President said that we should not maintain the Executive Presidency to prevent the possibility of emerging a war in the future, but to create an environment to prevent recurrence of such a situation.
President Sirisena also pointed out that we should not preserve the constitution as words etched on stone and changes should be made according to the aspirations of the people and it should be suitable for the modern technological world. He also said that even though the laws and constitution are retained in whatever mode, the success of these aspects depends on characteristics of the people who are initiating these things.
