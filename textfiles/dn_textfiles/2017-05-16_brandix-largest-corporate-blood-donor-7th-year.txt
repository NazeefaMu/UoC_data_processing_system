Brandix largest corporate blood donor for 7th year

Employees of the Brandix Group donated 4,090 units of blood in 2016-17, reaffirming the Group’s status as the largest corporate blood donor in Sri Lanka for the seventh successive year. The highest annual volume donated by the Group to the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) to date, the blood was collected at 27 manufacturing locations in Sri Lanka over several months. With this latest donation, the cumulative figure for blood donations by employees of Brandix over the past ten years reached 24,513 units.
“The civic consciousness of our associates is an inspiration and a great example,” said Colonel Sujith Jayasekara, Senior General Manager Group Human Resources of Brandix. “They understand that a sustained and consistent supply of blood to the NBTS is a national priority and willingly donate every year.”
In appreciation of the Group’s enduring commitment to the cause of blood donation, the National Blood Transfusion Service recently presented Brandix with a special plaque for being the largest corporate blood donor in the countryduring the last 12 months.
Among the highest contributing locations to the Brandix blood donation campaign in the concluded year were Brandix Lingerie Wathupitiwala with 448 units followed by Brandix Essentials Koggala with 356 units and Brandix Athleisure Polonnaruwa with 333units.
Seventeen of the 27 locations covered by the collection campaign donated more than 100 units each.
According to the NBTS, donations of this scale over a significant time period are necessary to meet the organisation’s requirements.
Brandix’s blood donation campaigns are also significant as they are conducted on weekdays instead of the general norm of weekends. This is particularly helpful in sustaining blood platelets, which have a lifespan of five days, for use during the course of the week.
