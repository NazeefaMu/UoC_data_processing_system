Malinga needs rest and proper management - medical panel

 
The medical panel appointed by Sri Lanka Cricket to assess injuries to its national cricketers has indicated that legendary fast bowler Lasith Malinga will not require any surgery to his injured left knee.
Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva said that the panel after examining all the MRI scans taken on his injured leg yesterday is of the opinion that with rest and proper management Malinga will be able to recover and return to play cricket again.
De Silva said that SLC has requested for a comprehensive report on Malinga's injury from the panel and they expect it to be available to them sometime next week.
However it is learnt that Malinga will be out of action for at least six months and with proper management and rest he will be able resume his career.
Malinga 32 is suffering from a bone bruise which doctors say occurs as a result of sustaining forceful impacts while playing sports. In the case of a bowler like Malinga, his left knee supports his entire body weight during his delivery stride.
The medical panel comprises Prof Arjuna de Silva, Dr Harindu Wijesinghe, Dr Kithsiri and Dr Tharindu Wijesinghe.
