‘Sri Lanka turning to upper-middle income country’

UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna yesterday said the government has started a number of programmes including the Enterprise Sri Lanka Loan Scheme to help Sri Lanka’s transition to an upper middle income country.
He was addressing a media briefing held at the UNP Headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday.
The MP said the World Bank Sri Lanka’s new development update released recently has praised the country’s economic growth.
The report mentioned that the country is already marching towards the Upper-Middle-Income status and more and better jobs hinge on the economy’s competitiveness and its ability to pursue a private sector-led growth model.
The WB update said that for the first time in decades, Sri Lanka’s fiscal revenue exceeded expenditures excluding interest payments, leading to a primary fiscal surplus. “This is the significant growth achieved by us,” he said.
“We were given a debt-ridden country by the former government. But we have somehow managed to overcome these obstacles while providing benefits of the economic growth to the people,” the MP said.
“Official reserves have too increased making stronger the Treasury. The government’s aim is to strengthen enterprises and build a strong economy and create job opportunities,” he said.
