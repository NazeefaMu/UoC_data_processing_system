Minister expresses concerns over social media reports

Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday expressed concerns over certain stories circulating on the social media that Disaster Management Minister was not in the country at the moment.
Minister Abeywardena said it is unfair by Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa since he is participating in an international conference on disaster management, representing Sri Lanka.
“Whatever benefits gained at this conference, they will be important to strengthen Sri Lanka’s disaster management process,” the Minister said.
“Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa is communicating with us regularly and giving the best possible assistance,” Minister Abeywardena said.
