‘Sonduru Sarisara – Sakwala Piyasa Dige’ by Saman Athaudahetti launched

Since Sri Lankan readers had to read accounts written from a western angle in the past, the book 'Sonduru Sarisara – Sakwala Piyasa Dige,' written by Saman Athaudahetti enables them to form a correct picture about the social, cultural, religious and political tendencies in China, said Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke.
Sri Lankan people can also derive a clear understanding of the anti-corruption programme launched by Chinese President Shi Jing Pin, he said.
Minister Karunatilleke was speaking as chief guest at the launching of Saman Athaudahetti's book 'Sonduru Sarisara, Sakwala Piyasa Dige' held at the multi-purpose hall of Wangshu Hotel, in Beijing, China on September 12.
The launching ceremony organised by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee International Affairs Department was attended by diplomats, communist party officials and representatives of publication and media institutions among others.
Director General of the Chinese Community Party Central Committee International Department Yuan Sha Bin said Athaudahetti is rendering a great service as a cultural emissary between China and Sri Lanka and he could be described as a true and sincere friend.
Sri Lankan Ambassador in China Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku read out President Maithripala Sirisena's message of greetings to the event. Dr. Kodituwakku addressing the gathering said political and economic opportunities are provided to people living in the Tibet zone, ensuring their language, religious and cultural identity while integrating them into the Chinese political mainstream. It was a fine example to countries such as Sri Lanka searching avenues to establish communal unity and reconciliation.
He said Tibet had the same level of economic development seen in Chinese provinces. The Chinese political mechanism was instrumental in punishing small groups bent on bribery and corruption for personal gain and this process had been clearly elucidated in Athudahetti's book.
Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne who delivered the main lecture said Saman Athaudahetti was a professional engaged in the political sector.
Although it was usual for some engaged in the field of politics to decline in stature quickly, Athaudahetti had always kept his head above and maintained his status despite holding several posts such as Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister, Chairman of Public Performance Board and ITN.
Despite holding several crowns on his head Athaudahetti had always kept his feet firmly on the ground.
Deputy Director General of the Tibet Communist Party Publicity Department Tang Shien Wen and several others also spoke.
Sandani Wijetunge presented a song recital.
A video presentation about the other books written by Athaudahetti followed. Nisansala Ratnayake and Wang Ying compered.
