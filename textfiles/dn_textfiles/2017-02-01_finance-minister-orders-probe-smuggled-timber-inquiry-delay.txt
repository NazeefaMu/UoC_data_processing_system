Finance Minister orders probe on smuggled timber inquiry delay

 
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has ordered Chulananda Perera, the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs to probe the incident in which the inquiry into a large stock of timber that was to be smuggled out of the country, was delayed for three years. 
A large stock of timber was seized by Sri Lanka Customs in 2014 but due action had not been taken during the previous regime, denying the government due penalty or proceeds, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka said.
Minister Karunanayake pointed out that the Customs Department should be held full responsible for the liability.
The Minister said that an inquiry had not been made regarding this issue by certain Customs Department officials, in an attempt to embarrass the government.
‘‘It is a scam to create new topics by the Joint Opposition minor politicians’’, the Minister said.
‘‘The current government led by the President and the Prime Minister are taking every measure to end corruption and other misappropriation in the country and, under such circumstances, if the Department of Customs, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Finance, has disregarded legal procedures in connection with this incident, stern action will be taken against those responsible’’,  the Finance Minister said.
