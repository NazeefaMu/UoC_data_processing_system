Country lost a great Buddhaputra - PM

The country has lost a great Buddhaputra with the demise of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera, who engaged in an unceasing fearless struggle for several decades to realise the dream of a disciplined society and a wide democratic administration, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated in a condolence message issued yesterday.
The thera who did not restrict himself to a particular party, community or religion has passed away by leaving the name 'Maduluwawe Sobhita' as a symbol, the message added.
The Prime Minister said the demise of Ven. Sobhita thera was an irreparable loss to the country and its people.
Born on May 29, 1942 at Maduluwawa in Padukka, he entered the order in his young age and completed his education from the Vidyalankara and Vidyodaya Universities. Making the university campus the birth place for the people's struggle for social justice, he worked hand-in-hand continuously with the people for the benefit and welfare of the Buddhasasana, nation and the people with deep devotion and dedication till his demise.
He took the forefront to create a change for the better in the country when ever democracy was endangered irrespective of which ever party was in power.
He worked selflessly for the country's progress and welfare without concern for any personal gain.
At a time when many were reluctant to oppose the authoritative and autocratic administration which engulfed the country in the recent past he took the leadership and played a pioneering role to create good governance by setting up the 'People's movement for social justice'.
He was bhikkhu who performed an outstanding and an epochal service towards literature, arts, environment, Dhamma education as well as the Temperance Movement.
He could be described as a national seal which unifies the Maha Sangha of the Tri Nikayas for a common national purpose.
The Prime Minister said he wished to record with gratitude the strength the late thera offered him for his political path by giving him counsel at various times.
The Prime Minister's message said "when I went to see him before he left for Singapore for further treatment he held a long discussion with a group of people including me and Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya about the current performance of the good governance government and future steps to be taken by it".
Accordingly he wished to emphasise that the prime concern of the present government should be to establish the just society the late thera expected and that the people should rally round to accomplish it.
May the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
