MP Moulana condemns moves to set up distillery in Batticaloa

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Batticaloa District Parliamentarian Seyed Ali Zhahir Moulana condemned the setting up of a liquor production factory in the district participating at a protest in Batticaloa on Wednesday.
He said the move which the government taken to establish the factory is a wrong decision. The Eastern Provincial Council is also against the project, he said.
The Parliamentarian said the Right to Information Act is questionable as two correspondents who went to collect information in connection with the establishment of the liquor factory were attacked.
