Chinese workers demand protection after thief slashes colleague

The management of the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation engaged in the extension of the Matara – Beliatta railway had asked for police protection after one of their staffers was slashed by a thief on Saturday.
Gu Feng, CMC’s Manager HSE Development of the Sri Lanka Railway project said the company was extremely concerned about the safety of the 2,300 employees working day and night to complete the project which is already behind schedule.
Out of the 2,300 employees, 380 are Chinese. He said employees attached to the railway project had been attacked by villagers and members of organized gangs before. He also stated that there are organized gangs who are said to demand fuel and other material from those engaged in the project and assault those who do not comply. He added that the private security firms are unable to deal with organized crime.
The incident occurred at about 4 am on Saturday when 31-year-old Zhang Fei, head of the survey team was suddenly woken up due to a sound and had seen a stranger in his room. As there was hi-tech survey equipment valued at over Rs. 3.5 million in his room, he had immediately grappled with the intruder. On hearing the commotion in the room, his co-workers had broken down the door and come to his assistance by which time the assailant had slashed Fei in an attempt to get away. The assailant, a member of a three-member gang, had entered Fei’s room through a window.
Zhang Fei who was admitted to the emergency ward of the District General Hospital, Matara has been working on the Matara – Beliatta Railway extension project since its inception in 2013.
