Isipathana hot favourites against Zahira today

Singer ‘A’ Div. inter-school league rugby resumes:
High riding Isipathana College will go out as the hot favourite against Zahira College Maradana when the second round of the Singer ‘A’ Division inter-school league rugby tournament resumes at Havelock Park today at 4:30pm.
The Pathana lads under the leadership of Sumudu Rankothge have an immaculate record in this year’s ongoing league tournament where they lost only to the Peterites.
Patana’s cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards spearheaded by cracking number eight Devin Gunaratne (younger brother of Sri Lanka national rugby player Omalka Gunaratne) along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of playmakers scrum half Harith Bandara and full back Chamod Fernando who have been scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves.
On the other hand Zahira possesses a good team with playmaker and fly half ex- Isipathana College player Shaid Sinhawansa (nephew of Hasan Sinhawansa of CH & FC, Kandy SC and Up Country Lions fame) turning out for Zahira against his old school along with winger Yuzran Lanthra who can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the nail biting defeat they had against a top team like Trinity College Kandy where they lost in the last quarter by (26-34) in a first round game. This will be a do or die battle for Zahira and if they lose to Isipathana it could be worse for them as they will slip further down in the rankings.
Wesley-Joes will be a close game
Wesley College will once again come under bit of pressure when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season St. Joseph’s College Maradana in their Singer 'A' Division inter-school league rugby tournament match at the CR & FC grounds in Longden Place today at 4.30pm.
Wesley kicked off this season with a thrashing from the formidable Trinity College (24-64) but went on to beat Prince of Wales College Moratuwa (28-10), S. Thomas’ Mount Lavinia (23-19), Science College Mount Lavinia (36-10) before edging out Zahira College Maradana (32-29) by a whisker in their last game of the first round.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal (22-28) and Isipathana (32-39) before beating Dharmaraja Kandy (44-10), St. Anthony’s Kandy (24-11) arch rivals St. Peter’s Bambalapitiya (25-10) and D.S. Senanayake whom they thrashed 72-10 in their final outing of the first round.
Wesley will have to watch out for the opposition three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent St. Joseph from scoring through their famous three quarter moves. The two forward packs are evenly matched and a close tussle for supremacy can be expected among the forwards.
