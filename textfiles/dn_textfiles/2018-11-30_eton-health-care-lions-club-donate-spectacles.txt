Eton Health Care, Lions Club donate spectacles

In commemoration of World Elders Day Eton Health Care donated spectacles to the needy under the patronage of Managing Director Deshamanya Lion Ranjith Kulatunga at its premises.
The Chief Guest was Deshamanya Nimal Ranawaka, the District Governor of Lion District 306 C2. This act of charity was carried out for the 3rd consecutive time to commemorate the death anniversary of his father Rehenasiri Kulatunga. At the previous years medical treatment and medical equipment were donated to thousands of patients.
In his speech Lion Kulatunga said that his theme is giving sight to see the world. He further added that specially the elders belonging to low income levels, due to their ignorance, lose opportunities of prevention and avoiding such situations and through correct advice and guidance and providing suitable spectacles, they will be able to do their day to day work and lead a happy life. Another commendable feature at this program was the skillful performances of the two eminent artists Giriraj Kaushalya and Rodni Warnakula who added much joy to the happy audience. In expressing their views the elders wished that Lion Kulatunga may be blessed with strength and courage to carry out such noble deeds in future, these types of good deeds are an example to others.
They said that they see him as a noble man, because of such actions as donating spectacles making us happy. This event was organized by Lions Club of Maharagama Central.
In parallel to this event a project to plant trees was also carried out.
