SUNIL GUNEWARDANE was like a 'BOLT' on track

That was the era when men and women athletes from little known schools stole the limelight from their counterparts from the Metropolis, with their phenomenal deeds on the track and field in athletics.
During that reign, SUNIL GUNEWARDENE took the scene by storm. He worked wonders on the track and left his opponents far behind physically and emotionally. That we remember him to this day speaks to the ‘SPORTS LEGEND’ he was.
SUNIL BENEDICT GUNEWARDANE, from the time he put on spikes as a schoolboy at St.Mary’s, Chilaw showcased talents. He was an athlete of international class. Coaches and connoisseurs who watched his dazzling bolting on the track predicted a bright future for him. And he did not disappoint them.
Born in Bandarawatta
GUNEWARDANE was born on October 6 in Bandarawatta, Kaakkapitiya. His father was Joseph Gunewardane and mother Harriot. His father was a landed proprietor. SUNIL was the second in a family of six.
In the pre GUNEWARDANE era athletes from rural areas who shone on the track and reached great heights to mention a few were the Khan bothers – A.S.M and A.L.M, Linus Diaz and R.J.K.Karunananda. The above mentioned four were long distance wonders.
Of the foursome the man who brought great credit to the country was Karunananda running in the Tokyo Olympics marathon. He did not make waves for winning the event, but for a different reason.
Guts and determination
Karunananda had the guts and determination to finish the course long after the event was over.
The big crowd at the Stadium stood up to him and cheered him all the way to the tape in appreciation in not giving up but finishing the course. Athletes and followers of that sport in that era still remember that great moment.
GUNEWARDANE when under starter’s would take off like a jet and flew in the style of the modern day Jamaican Usain Bolt and would not look back until he breasted the tape well ahead of his opponents.
Whenever it was known that GUNEWARDANE was going to be on the track there would be big crowds to watch his heroics and he seldom let them down. He had a brilliant burst of speed and what was amazing was that he maintained that pace right up to the tape.
Monumental success
His monumental success on the track did not make him lose his unassuming and simple ways. He got on with everyone especially his opponents and was ever ready to proffer advice to the young and up and coming athletes.
GUNEWARDANE hugged the track so much so that records he set up remained unbroken believe it or not for 25,32 and 37 years. Athletes and sports fans of that era still talk about this feat. He showed talent as a schoolboy and was crowned the All Island champion in 1968.
In a meet in Thailand with his wife to be K.G.Badra also making waves in the women’s scene, GUNEWARDANE stunned the packed stands at that meet by becoming the first Sri Lankan schoolboy to bag the 100 metres event in less than 10 seconds.
Young gazelle
Having watched the young gazelle performing wonders, athletes of an earlier era in their schools - St.Peter’s College and St.Joseph’s College – Carlton Seneviratne and Harry Jayawardene told me, when I began my journalistic career at ‘Times of Ceylon’ in the early 1960s to watch the gazelle who was going to set up records on the track that will not be easily equaled or broken. And GOONEWARDANE lived up to their expectations.
Carlton and Harry were Sports Editors of the ‘DAILY NEWS’ and ‘DAILY MIRROR’. In poking a little fun, Seneviratne once told me that whenever there was an athletic meet on his school grounds in Bambalapitiya records tumbled in all most all events.
When asked why with a loud guffaw he would say because the athletes were running away from the stench that emanated from the canal adjoining the ground. It was hilarious. It is appropriate to recall that perennial by MARY HOPKINS - ‘Those were the days my friend’.
The golden era
That was also the golden era when there were a galaxy and exemplary sports writers from whom one could learn and to mention them – A.V.Fernando, Percy Beling and M.B.Marjan of the ’TIMES’, guest writer M.V.Muhsin. Lawford Martinus, Premnath Moraes and Austin Daniel ‘DAILY MIRROR’, M.M. Thowfeek, Bertie Wijesinha, Eustace Rulach, Stanley Wickremasuriya, J.E.M Garnier, T.M.K.Samat and A.C. de Silva ‘OBSERVER’, Christie Seneviratne and N.E.Thangaraja ‘DAILY NEWS’. Cream of sports journalists with lofty ideals.
Coming back to GUNEWARDANE, it was that 100 metre win tat shot him to stardom. His school record of 10.9 secs in the 100 metres and 21.65 secs in the 200 metres stood the test of time for 32 and 37 years respectively. Not satisfied with that he continued his brilliance and set up Sri Lankan records in both the 100 metres – 10.5 secs – and the 200 metres in 21.7 secs.
Remarkable
And what was remarkable and memorable was that he set up these records on his 21st birthday on October 6, 1970. His 100 metres record stood for 25 years. GUNEWARDANE, at the Munich Olympics in Munich in 1972 ran the 200 metre event in 21.31 secs which was Asia’s fastest timing. That record lasted for 18 years.
Then he achieved further success by winning the gold medal by finishing the 4 x 400 m. in 3 mins 7 secs at the Teheran Asian Games. Then GUNEWARDANE had the good fortune of a two week course in sprinting and hurdles in 1987 in Indonesia. He followed a similar course under Charles Taylor the famous British coach in the UK in 1991.He was also a recipient of a two week special course with Jackie Joyner Kerser the world record holder in Bejing in 2007.
Saying goodbye
Saying goodbye to the track on which he dominated he took to administration.He took on the role of coach and manager of the Sri Lanka Athletic team and in 2000 was the chef-de-mission at the Olympic Games. He was President of the Sri Lanka Athletic Association and Vice President of the National Olympic Committee in 2001.
GUNEWARDANE gave to the game what he got from it by coaching promising and up and coming athletes and at times helping them financially too. When S.B.Dissanayake was the Minister of Sport that athletics in the country hit the big time and supporting and helping the Minister was GUNEWARDANE as Co-ordinating Secretary.
With his expert coaching he turned out many national and international athletes among them were – Damayantha Darsha, Rohan Pradeep Kumara, Mahesh Perera, Tania Van Heer and Ranga Wimalawansa.
Produced champions
He also produced Commonwealth and Asian Games champions in Prasanna Amerasekersa, Ashok Jayasundara, Nayanthi Kumara, Rohitha Pushpakumara, Shivantha Weerasuriya, Prdeep Herath and Sujani Buddhika.
The game of athletics, athletes and those who watched his magic on the track will always remember and admire him. The likes of GUNEWARDANE will not unwind again.
