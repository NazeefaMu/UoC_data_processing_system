Major General (Rtd) Amal Karunasekera  further remanded

Former Military Intelligence Director and Army Chief of Staff Major General (Retired) Amal Karunasekara who was arrested in connection with the abduction and assault of former The Nations Newspaper Editor Keith Noyahr in 2008, was further remanded till June 26 by Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrema yesterday.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing on behalf of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday, pleaded the Magistrate to direct Major General Karunasekara to the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer.
SSC Girihagama also submitted that the suspect was being treated at the Prison hospital without any unhealthy condition. “The Prison hospital should not be a privilege, but a right ,“ SSC added.
The Magistrate ordered the Prison Superintendent to direct Major General Amal Karunasekara to the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer and submit the full medical report before the Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate.
Attorney- at-Law Shehan de Silva, appearing on behalf of Major General Karunasekara, pleaded that his client be granted bail.
However, SSC Girihagama objected to the suspect being granted bail. On a previous day, the Magistrate ordered Current Army Intelligence Director to direct the documents related to the safe house to the CID.
SSC Girihagama informed the Magistrate that current Army Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku had sent a letter stating that he was unable to provide those safe house documents to the CID, owing to National security concerns.
Due to this reason, SSC Girihagama pleaded the Magistrate to issue an order to the current Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku to have a discussion with the Attorney General, Magistrate and the CID officials.
After considering all matters, the Magistrate ordered the Current Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku to attend a discussion on the safe house document issue on June 26.
SSC Girihagama stated that when the CID Gang and Robbery Unit OIC Nishantha de Silva went to the Prison to take a statement from the suspect, he saw some documents in the possession of the suspect. “When questioned about those documents, the suspect refused to reply to his questions,” SSC added.
SSC Girihagama also pleaded with the Magistrate to issue an order to the Prison Superintend to hand over the names, identity card numbers, food taken and all other details of the persons who visit the suspect in Prison.
After considering SSC Girihagama’s request, the Magistrate ordered the Prison Superintend to hand over those documents to the CID officials. The Magistrate fixed inquiries for June 26.
