Sainthood of the Servant of God, late His Eminence Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray
End of an era

The Archdiocesan phase of the Road to Sainthood of the Servant of God, late His Eminence Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray, an illustrious son of Sri Lanka and a very much treasured Member of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the first native Archbishop and the First Sri Lanka Cardinal, is over.
Ragama, Tewatte Basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Sri Lanka was the venue where the official closing ceremony of the Archdiocesan phase of inquiry took place on October 28 with a Concelebrated Holy Mass offered by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo and the Promoter of the Cause, who shoulders the responsibility of getting the Vatican Curia move to name the Sri Lankan, a Saint of the Universal Church, presided as the chief celebrant.
The Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Most Rev. Dr. Piere Vanvot, Chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Bishop of Badulla Diocese Most Rev. Dr. Vincent Fernando, Colombo Auxiliary Bishop Most Rev. Dr. Maxwell Silva, Very Rev. Fr. Ervin Moraes OMI, the Provincial of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Colombo Chapter, joined to Concelebrate the Holy Mass.
The day also marked the 29th death anniversary of the late Prelate. (His Eminence passed away – Rested-In-Peace in the year 1988 at the age of 87).
Colombo Archbishops now in retirement Most Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando and Most Rev. Dr. Oswald Gomis along with the distinguished delegates of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate and other ecclesiastical dignitaries graced the occasion by their presence. Very Rev. Fr. Francis Nicholas Senanayake, Vicar of Judiciary, Colombo Diocese and the Episcopal delegate of the Postulate delivering his homily at the Concelebrated Holy Mass said the Servant of God late Cardinal Cooray’s deep relationship with God Almighty had guided all his actions in serving the people God as the Chief Shepherd of the diocese and as Cardinal, the local and universal church.
Status of Venerable
The Basilica ground was filled with the devotees from parishes far away to attend the ceremony, that was being an event of historical importance, that being the very first time an event of that nature took place in the annals of the Sri Lanka Catholic Church.
The Roman phase of the inquiry will commence once the Curia, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints receives the Historical Report sealed and dispatched from the Diocese where the Servant of God born and bred, served the People of God as their pastor. The Colombo Archdiocese Canonization Committee will comply with the request and seal and dispatch in due course after ceremonial closure of the local process. The Local Church prayerfully awaits for the day, the Servant of God Cardinal Cooray enters the next phase, the status of Venerable. At the commencement of the Holy Mass His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith expressed his appreciation of the work done by the Postulator Very Rev. Frs. Leoplod Ratnasekera OMI, Very Rev.Fr. Nicholas Senanayake and Rev. Fr. Jude Samantha. While admiring the work done the documents due to be sent to Rome was signed and sealed. From the three boxes containing detail reports of events and issues relevant to the life time of late Cardinal Cooray, two will be kept in the Archives of the Archdiocese and one will be dispatched to Rome. There was also floral tribute to the late Cardinal at the site where his mortal body laid to rest.
Rev. Fr. Leopold Ratnasekera OMI, the Postulator with able support of the Archdiocesan Canonization Committee has completed the preparing of the Historical Report ‘Positio Historica’ as required by the Vatican Curia, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which including all documentation, compiled with the life story of late Cardinal Cooray, collection of his writings, pastoral dealings, record of challenges he faced on crucial issues during his three decades long episcopate, (1947 -1976) his involvement in Asian and Universal church, and his pastoral apostolic activities.
The Historical Report prepared by Very Rev. Fr. Ratnasekera, as the Postulator was certified by Most Rev. Dr. Oswald Gomis, the former Archbishop of Colombo.
According to reliable sources since the commencement of the work of the Sri Lanka Canonization Committee in May, in the year 2010, Fr. Rathnasekera as Postulator has visited well over 60 churches/parishes, delivered special sermons, gathered information, collected data, both supportive evidences and criticisms within the archdiocese of Colombo, beginning from the year, the Holy See endorsed the process.
His was a mission to awake people, educate the devotees the process of canonization and strengthen the campaign to pray without ceasing to grant that miracles do take place through the intercession of late Cardinal Cooray, now known as the Servant of God, to declare him a Blessed.
The books on late Cardinal Cooray OMI written by scholarly priest, the erudite feature writer and author Rev. Fr. Ernet Portuthota and the former Editor of Gnanartha Pradeepaya, Hector Welgampola would have helped a great deal, as some of the vital of information of the Servant of God is included in them. Fr. Poruthota has also taken pains to include what both eminent lay Buddhists and religious personalities of the decades gone by- had said about late His Eminence. Raphayel Tennakoon is one of the greatest poets of this country and a journalist par excellence Sirus W. Surendra, both Buddhist by religion had expressed words of appreciation when the Archbishop Cooray was elevated as a Cardinal of the Catholic Church.
Winning all hearts
They shun aside all differences and had the guts to hail a person, when they know that despite differences of opinion, one has to honour when and where it is due. Late L.H. Meththananada, a great defender of Buddhism and late Ven. Madihe Pannaaseeha Thera, one of best Monks, among the Sangha fraternity though in opposition camps when vital issues proper but had the courage and audacity to honour and praise Cardinal Cooray. They saw in Cardinal Cooray a simple man of the village who firmly stood his ground when He found it just, right and correct to do so and had won the hearts and mind of those closely associated with and those who shared his thoughts and views of his day.
Late Cardinal Cooray was a ‘simple simon’ so to say coming all the way from Periyamulla, Negombo, known to rest of the land as the Little Rome born in 1901 and lived his school days until he entered the Minor Seminary to be a Priest of God to serve His flock. He was sent to Rome to do his philosophical and theological studies and once retuned with flying colours obtained successfully completing studies with Ph. D. for Philosophy and S.T.D. for Theology.
During this period of studying in Rome he took his First Vows at the age of 24, in 1925, and in the year 1929 he was ordained a Priest of God in Rome at the age of 28. His first obedience was to the teaching staff of St. Joseph’s College, Maradana October 1, 1931, and also served as the Warden of Catholic University Students’ hostel, at Bambalapitiyafrom September 1, 1934 .
On August 6, 1937 he assumed duties as the Superior of the Oblate House of Studies at Kynsey Road, Borella and taught as a professor at St. Bernard Major Seminary, Borella. While Fr. Cooray was serving in this capacity as a professor, in December 14, 1945, at the age of 45, he was nominated the Archbishop Co-adjutor to Archbishop Jean- Marie Masson OMI, with the right to succeed the See of Colombo Archdiocese one day.
The consecration ceremony took place on March 7, 1946, and He took over the Colombo See on July 28, 1947 as the first native Archbishop with the passing away of the then Archbishop French-man Most Rev. Dr. John Mary Masson OMI, and held that post for long 30 years until his retirement in 1976, as Archbishop of Colombo but retaining the Post of the Prince of the Church, the first Sinhala Sri Lankan Cardinal.
