Review:
Charmed by the Chinese Heart!

For one night only, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra came to Colombo. The stage was set at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre last Friday, and the audience was packed—filling both the theatre’s ground level and its two balconies. From across the city, and indeed the country, patrons of the arts came to hear what the Orchestra had in store.
The China Cultural Centre in Colombo, which hosts an array of Chinese cultural events year-round, had arranged the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra’s performance. As the first in China to introduce western music to its audiences back in 1985, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra had a reputation that preceded the music it played. And when the orchestral members took to the stage, clad in formal wear that felt fitting of the momentous occasion, and then took their seats, they didn’t disappoint.
For the next two hours, give and take, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra put on a performance that would put to shame any other city’s.
The tunes fluctuated from songs native to the country of origin—such as “Good News From Beijing Spreads to the Borderland” and “My Chinese Heart”—to songs that most western audiences might know, or at least recognize.
There was Brahms played, and there was also Quincy Jones, whose “Bossa Nova” rendition by the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra lit up the audience.
A particular highlight of the evening came during a male-female opera duet for the song, “Libiamo Ne’ Lieti Calici,” from La Traviata, an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian Libretto by Francesco Maria Piave.
Under immense pressure, the two soloists’ voices increased in their strength, reaching heights and notes inaccessible to the average human. All this, no doubt, was only added to by the impressive acoustics inside the Nelum Pokuna—seemingly designed to bring out the best of sound.
Equally as impressive was that the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra performed to the highest and most meticulous of standards all without a conductor.
It was an usual sight to behold—no suit-clad figure standing in front, directing musicians one way or another. Instead, the musicians took their cues from each other, never missing a beat, never appearing unsteady or unsure of which key or note or song to play next.
This speaks to the intense, rote preparation and practice that undoubtedly went on behind the scenes and in advance of this performance.
The entire evening, if the audience’s reaction is a proper barometer, can be classified as nothing if not an utter success.
What was meant to be the final song, termed “Hooked on Classics” by the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra, was an amalgam of various classics that sparked joy in the listener’s ear. And at its conclusion, the applause was so overwhelming, so enthusiastic, that the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra had no choice but to perform an encore.
Playing Jacques Offenbach’s “Infernal Galop,” also known colloquially as the “Can Can Song,” before transitioning into a more traditional Chinese orchestral song, “Blooming Flowers and Full Moon,” the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra knocked the encore out of the park. The only possible fault with the evening is that it ended too soon.
Inside the theatre, I was lucky enough to be sitting alongside a delegation from the Chinese High Commission in Colombo, including the Ambassador Yi Xianliang. Throughout the evening, the entire delegation wore looks of pride stretched wide across their faces. And after hearing the performance of the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra in all its glory, I could easily understand why.
