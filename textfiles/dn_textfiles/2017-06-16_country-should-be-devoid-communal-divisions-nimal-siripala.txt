Country should be devoid of communal divisions: Nimal Siripala

Sustainable development:
A country should be devoid of communal divisions and clashes to achieve sustainable development, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Badulla kachcheri to mark the distribution of a stock of festival equipment valued at Rs 1.5 million among mosques and Muslim welfare societies in Badulla on Wednesday.
Minister de Silva said Sri Lankans should learn lessons from the war and the terrorist problem which engulfed the country for nearly 30 years.
The development and progress of the country retrograded by about 50 years owing to the war. The setback had affected the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities equally. Political leaders should never foster communal or religious divisions for short term political gain.
He said that the ‘Yahapalana’ government was acting in a responsible manner to foster harmony and reconciliation among communities.
Referring to talks about harassment towards Muslims in the country, Minister de Silva said the government never condoned such actions. The President and the government condemned such irresponsible actions, he said.
He said Badulla had achieved considerable development and progress in recent years as all politicians in the district worked in unity.
He said the country never forgot the services rendered by past Muslim leaders such as Siddilebbe and T. B. Jayah who joined Sinhala leaders in the country’s independence struggle. Late Minister Badi-ud-din Mahmud had rendered an enormous service towards the development of education.
