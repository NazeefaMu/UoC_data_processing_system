ITB Berlin 2017 sells out as event approaches

This year too the entire world is in 26 display hall at the ITB Berlin, the world’s largest travel trade show which is all booked up again.
ITB Berlin has also met numerous exhibitors’ requests for more floor space.
Some of the stands have grown in height and the hall layout has been improved. This year the stands of many tourism destinations, especially in the Mediterranean, are now in different locations.
Thus, from March 8th -12th around 10,000 organisations and companies will be represented in the largest marketplace of the international travel industry.
“The fact that our halls are booked up sends out a clear message: even in times of political uncertainty the international travel industry places a focus on strong participation, progress and face-to-face meetings.
“Demand has been high again this year, particularly from Asia, Arab destinations and the travel technology sector.
“We have taken this into account with a new, improved hall layout and have been able to meet many exhibitors’ requests for additional space,” said David Ruetz, head of ITB Berlin. This year the spotlight is on Botswana, the official partner country of ITB Berlin.
This fascinating, landlocked country in southern Africa will host the artistic performances at the opening ceremonies on the eve of ITB Berlin and will be represented on a larger, two-tier stand.
