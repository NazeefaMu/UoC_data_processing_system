France based company to construct 65,000 houses in North - Minister Swaminathan

The 65,000 houses to be constructed by the France based company ‘Arcelor Mittal Construction’ in the North, having a minimum lifetime of 70 years and the company had already given a 30 year guarantee, said Prison Reform, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Affairs Minister D M Swaminathan.
He was replying to an adjournment motion moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan concerning the problems faced by the people in the North and the East.
“These houses will be of international quality. The cost of Rs 2.1 million is not just for a basic house, but a fully furnished house with all facilities. This project would definitely raise the living standards of the people of Northern and Eastern provinces. According to the expertise report of the Peradeniya University, the prefabricated housing construction programme would not involve local labour or resources and the construction period would be comparatively less,” he said.
The Minister said his ministry had received a total of 97,232 applications from the people of the North and East for the Houses to be constructed under this project. “In Jaffna district, we have received 32,050 applications for the housing project. A total of 97,232 applications have been received from Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara,” he explained.
The minister said Rs 154 million have been allocated to provide optional lands and to construct permanent houses to people in the Mannar District whose lands are in the possession of the Armed Forces.
“Our Ministry has allocated Rs 14 Billion to resettle and rehabilitate the people of the North and East who have been victimized by the 30 years long war. Under the funding of the Ministry, 10,030 permanent houses are being built in 11 Districts, including several districts in the North and East. Rs 647million have been allocated to facilitate drinking water to 11 war affected districts.
In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, 2,400 war-damaged houses were renovated at a cost of Rs 480 million. Rs. 418 million had also been allocated to improve sanitation facilities of 7,600 families. Rs 632.7 million have been allocated to develop the infrastructure facilities in resettled areas,” he said.
