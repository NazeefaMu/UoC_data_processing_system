A response to May 31st editorial
On ending tobacco menace
On behalf of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) and the thousands who are committed to eliminate the harm from tobacco, I want to say thank you and congratulate you for your excellent editorial “Ending the tobacco menace” of May 31, the WHO World No Tobacco Day. It was so inspiring and instructive to all of us who are doing what we can to totally eliminate the harm from tobacco in all its forms to have the premier newspaper in the country providing such strong support.
I might also mention that the media has been one of the key partners over the past decade that helped Sri Lanka to arrest and contain the tobacco menace to what it is today.
I was also so heartened to note that you had got all the factual information absolutely correct and had addressed the whole range of issues around cigarettes in particular and tobacco in general.
We are planning to use your editorial and some of its contents in some of our prevention and advocacy work widely and I am sure you would not have any objection to our doing so.
Finally I have no doubt that you will continue to support and work in partnership on this nationally important issue in the future.
As you have correctly mentioned in the article it is imperative that we eliminate the socio-economic harm from tobacco as soon as we possibly can. Once again thank you very much.
Dr. Palitha Abeykoon
Chairman
National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA)
