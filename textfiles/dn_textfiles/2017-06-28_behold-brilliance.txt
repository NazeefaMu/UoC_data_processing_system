Behold brilliance

After much wait and anxious anticipation, the 13th edition of the Raigam Tele’es saw the light of day last Saturday. The gala ceremony, forced to be put on hold for several weeks by the floods, dedicated a good portion of its first half hour to remember, appreciate, revere and pay a tribute to immortal Amaradeva who bade farewell to the nation just a few months ago. It took a beat to recognise the talent radiant with creative brilliance.
Podi Malli and Chuti Malli injected a little comedy into the audience while many other vocalists and choreographers inundated the audience with unique aesthetic opulence. The ceremony moved on at a steady pace well into midnight with President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and a spectacle of distinguished personnel on board.
