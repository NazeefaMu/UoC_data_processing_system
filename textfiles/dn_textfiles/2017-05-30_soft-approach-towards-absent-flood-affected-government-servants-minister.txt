Soft approach towards absent flood affected government servants: Minister

The Public Administration and Management Ministry would demonstrate a soft approach with the absence of the public servants to the duty in the flood affected districts, Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday said.
He said the public servants in flood affected areas are not in a situation even to send a telegram or make a call. He said they would be given reliefs in applying for leaves.
“The ministry would coordinate with other ministries to provide reliefs to the flood affected public servants,” the Minister said.
