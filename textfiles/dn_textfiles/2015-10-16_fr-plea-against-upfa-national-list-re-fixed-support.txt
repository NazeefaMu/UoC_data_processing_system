FR plea against UPFA National list re-fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights violation petition filed by Former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament, was yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court. The petition is to be taken up again on October 23.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Eva Wanasundara, Upali Abeyratne and Anil Gunaratne, the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Attotney General, moved for a further date.
Petitioner Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as the Vice Chairman of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala, former General Secretary Susil Premajayantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties namely the MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP and that at its inception said the Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner, while all decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajayantha in his capacity as Secretary of the said Alliance, submitted a list of names, including the Petitioners' for the National List. He alleged that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala was subsequently appointed as General Secretary of the UPFA by the incumbent President, without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He stated that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with names of some persons who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament. The petitioner said he was seeking the assistance of Court for a declaration that he was entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a member of Parliament, submitted according to the 1st list.
He is also seeking the assistance of Court to cancel and/or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.
