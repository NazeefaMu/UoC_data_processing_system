Federal Court upholds deportation of Tigers fundraiser who fought to stay in Canada for 22 years

An alleged fundraiser for the LTTE who has been fighting deportation from Canada for more than two decades has lost a key court battle after a federal judge dismissed his appeal.
The Federal Court upheld the deportation of Manickavasagam Suresh on the grounds he was a member of a terrorist organisation and that he was complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The evidence “adequately supported” the Immigration and Refugee Board’s finding that Suresh was a member of the LTTE, Justice Richard Mosley wrote in his ruling.
The judge also found reasonable the IRB’s finding that Suresh was “a dedicated supporter who voluntarily worked on behalf of the LTTE and willingly followed the direction of the organisation’s leadership.”
In 1990, Suresh was allegedly sent to Toronto by the LTTE to help run the group’s front organisation, the World Tamil Movement, serving as its co-ordinator. But he was arrested in 1995 as a security risk.
Initially, Canadian authorities tried to deport him under a security certificate, which was upheld by the Federal Court. He fought the case to the Supreme Court, which ruled he could face torture if returned to his home country.
But the government continued to quietly push for his removal and in 2008, immigration officials drafted a report alleging he was inadmissible to Canada due to his membership in the WTM and his complicity in war crimes.
Following a hearing, the IRB ordered his deportation in 2015. The 40-page decision dismissing his appeal of that ruling was handed down on January 10 but as of Monday had not yet been posted on the Federal Court website.
The Tigers ran a lucrative fundraising operation in Toronto and Montreal until the WTM’s offices were raided by the RCMP in 2006. Among other things, the searches turned up appeals for money to buy weapons.
