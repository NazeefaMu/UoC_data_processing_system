Prodigious odyssey

The sons of Ananda are known for their rigid discipline and uncompromising attitudes when it comes to values in life. Their attitudes are stoic and steadfast. Perfect Prefects meets up with Head Boy of Ananda College Pasindu Herath who is very much dedicated to the core values of his school.
“A head prefect needs to be a good leader. He should also have a vision and target and more than anything else he should be on track. He should stick to the plan and be flexible enough to deviate from it and make the right decisions at the right time,” said Herath.
When electing a Head Prefect, he is examined on five sectors.
Five-point someone
“Firstly Academics – O/L results (A/Ls results are released just after appointment). Term test marks are considered. Then there is sports. (If you are a Coloursman you have a bonus point). The third sector is pertaining to Dhamma Activities. The fourth sector is Clubs and Societies. The fifth sector is the presentation (Case study).
Then there is a two-day interview program. The first day you need to present your certificates, medals and awards and the second day it is all about presentation. You will have to face a case study and give an introduction in English and answer some questions in English and give a brief introduction about yourself and what you have achieved in your life in Sinhala, and present some projects you are planning to do if you are appointed as a member of the senior executive board,” stated Herath.
However, for this one has to apply. But not everybody can apply.
“But not everyone gets to be an applicant for the post of Head Prefect. It is a selected number of people. If you do not have enough qualifications you will not be able to apply. Firstly you need to become a trainee, you have to become a temporary Assistant Prefect, then a permanent Assistant Prefect, then you have to become a Junior Prefect, and then a senior prefect and then you have to become senior executive board applicant and then you can choose whatever position you want. There are four positions: Head Prefect, Deputy Head Prefect, Chief Senior Supervisor and Senior Supervisor. To be a Head Prefect you need to be extremely qualified. When you become an applicant you have to face the interview and then only do you get the chance. Only grade 12 and 13 students can be prefects. We have a head prefect, then we have three deputy head prefects, three chief Senior supervisors and three senior supervisors,” explained Herath.
There are many duties and responsibilities a Head Prefect should undertake at Ananda

“During the first three or four months of the appointment we have some duties such as the Big Match, then we have the colours night and the Prefects’ annual encounter which we play with the prefects of Nalanda College. And we have the annual vehicle parade. So these are the four major events in the first four months. Then we have student-oriented programs like the leadership building program and training camps at an Army Camp during the next three or four months. And during the last four months, we have teachers’ day, and a prefects day called ‘feel the field’ and we have school renovation project and we have the yearbook containing the projects we have done throughout the year. Those are the duties we undertake. Then we have duties such as general assembly duties and checking bags. Sometimes clubs and societies at Ananda request the prefects’ guild to assist them in their events in the college,” pointed out Herath.
Hard worker
It is mandatory for prefects to come to school on all five days and Saturdays and Sundays at special events. If they cannot make it on one day they need to submit a letter the day before stating the reasons. If they get sick they need to report in sick and bring an excuse letter the following day/days.
An admirable hard worker, Herath is dedicated towards his work.
“I am a man with a vision and target. When it comes to my mind I try to put it into action. I visualise it. And I worked towards it have advice and guidance from my brother who was a Head Prefect. If you lose focus then you cannot reach your target. Sometimes when I have missed classes due to my obligations, I go home and call my friends and inquire about class work and material. Sometimes I have Googled A/L stuff, then go to Wikipedia and went to YouTube. Because I had to go to camps and stuff some areas I could not cover. So I asked my brother how to get through things, and he helped me. I explain the actual situation to all my teachers and ask them to help me explain the actual situation. I stay after school and ask them to teach me the areas. I even join other classes to make up for the work I have to do. My parents have always inspired me and they helped me keep in mind the goal I had to reach,” elucidated Herath.
Pasindu’s goal is to be the richest man in Sri Lanka.
“I have already got my A/L results. I was appointed Head Prefect November last year and will give up my post November this year. Only after A/Ls can you become a Head Prefect. Now I am moving towards the commerce field (though he did his A/Ls in the math stream). I am a CIMA student on a 100 percent scholarship. I have the chartered institute scholarship as well. As soon as I finish CIMA I will be starting chartered accountancy and I got selected to go the University of Moratuwa. I want to become a CEO of a company,” informed Herath.
One of the most valuable lessons Herath has learnt from his school is to make sacrifices.
Perfect responsibility
“There are five forms of cadetting at Ananda: Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Band. I am a police cadet. In 2016 there was no one to take on the responsibility of being the police cadet sergeant. But I was there. But in the month of August, I had my A/Ls and we had a camp in the month of June. There is a one month gap between June and August. If I go there it will be really hard to manage my A/Ls. In this island, Ananda was at the pinnacle of police cadetting. I could not sacrifice the honour and glory Ananda had. So I took the risk and accepted the post of Sergeant and went there with my platoon of 24 Anandians. We went there and we won the camp and became the island best Police cadet platoon. We secured seven trophies out of 11. I became the best police cadet in the island,” said Herath triumphantly.
Herath took the risk and even passed his A/Ls well! Herath puts it down to hard work and risk-taking.
“I used to be a debater at Ananda and we use to prepare for debates, by running around the school grounds. That way you learn to manage things with life getting busier and busier every day. So we ran around the grounds sweating preparing our arguments. It is hard work. I am a coloursman in three sports. Also, you need to understand your priorities. My current prefect body is very supportive and they are just one phone call away. If I need them they are there. There are 200 people under my command,” added Herath.
Herath’s message to any boy is to put the school first and be friendly towards everyone. He says work for the glory of the school and they you can get to the top at Ananda and you will be able to be very good leaders at Ananda. And he says – “Never Give up!”
“Before going to sports we go to the Buddhist Shrine at Ananda and pray. Then we go and meet the principal. Before the match, we get into the huddle and for 30 seconds we close our eyes and visualise the shrine. So we respect the Shrine a lot. That is the Buddhist environment we are brought up in,” summed up Herath.
