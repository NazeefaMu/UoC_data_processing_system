Presidential Commission of Inquiry into SriLankan Airlines

The foreign exchange the country should have received since 2009 went into the hands of SriLankan Airlines General Sales Agents in foreign countries, it was revealed at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Tuesday.
A General Sales Agent is a sales representative for an airline in a specific country or region.
The Commission probing into the financial irregularities in the Sri Lankan and Mihin Lanka Airlines and SriLankan Catering Ltd., will shortly summon the relevant authorities of the Airlines to verify the amount of foreign exchange the national carrier had deprived in this manner.
The documents presented to the Commission revealed that certain agents were paid higher than the agreed percentage of payment. Certain agents who were new to the industry, had also been offered higher percentages.
The documents related to General Sales Agents in Seychelles, Dubai, Thailand, Singapore, Pakistan, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, the USA, Maldives and Australia, were presented to the Commission on Tuesday.
