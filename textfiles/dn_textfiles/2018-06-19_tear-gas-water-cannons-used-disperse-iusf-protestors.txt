Tear gas, water cannons used to disperse IUSF protestors

 
Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) protestors a short while ago.
Roads surrounding Rajagiriya is reportedly hampered with traffic due to the protest.
The protest was launched against passing the bill allowing to extract South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) MBBS students to Kothalawala Defense Institute (KDU).
The protestors intended to head towards the Parliament.
