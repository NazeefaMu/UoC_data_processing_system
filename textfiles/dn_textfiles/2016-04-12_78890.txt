Duvindu - first bowler from Central Province to claim 100 wickets

 
A late flourish by Trinity College's left arm spinner Duvindu Tillakaratne saw him win the race for the first to reach 100 wickets in the Central Province. In all he has captured 106 wickets in the two day matches is the highest number of wickets by a school boy bowler from Kandy and Central provicne during the 2016 school cricket season.
Speaking to this writer Duvindu Tillakaratne son of former Sri Lanka cricket captain Hashan Tillakaratne said that just before their traditional big match against St. Anthony's College he had captured 99 wickets and his skipper Ravin Sayer was on 98 wickets. The big match had to be postponed due to the passing away of Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter and the venue shifted from Asgiriya to the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.
In the second over he bowled he got the much needed one wicket to reach 100 wickets for the season. In the next over Ravin Sayer reached his 100th wicket from the other end. It was thrilling for two bowlers to get 100 wickets in successive overs of the big match. There may be no parallel to this.
Duvindu said that at the beginning of the season he lost his sights of reaching 100 wickets in the season he was not among the wickets and in the first 7 matches he managed around 20 odd wickets and he had a long way to go. It was like reaching the Himalayan heights. Then came the match against Wesley College in which he had a match haul of 8 wickets and followed up with 9 wickets in the next match. He had found his lien and length and was able to bemuse the opposing batsmen.
Perhaps his best match against Royal College played at the Asgiriya Stadium and the match was heading towards a draw. When the mandatory overs began Royal College had 6 wickets in hand and needed a few runs to wipe out the deficit. Wickets started falling and Trinity won by an innings and one run with three overs to spare. This match was a personal triumph for young Duvindu Tillakaratne he captured 1 for 35 and 6 for 55 in the match. In the second innings he was able to break the back bone of Royal's batting.
Duvindu Tillakaratne is already a cricket colours man and his 100 wickets will make him eligible for the prestigious Cricket Lion which will be awarded later this year.
What the father former national cricket captain Hashan Tillakaratne had done with the bat, the son Duvindu had performed with the ball which are contrasting performances.
His tally for the season would have been much more and would have reached the 100 wicket mark much earlier if not for the fact that he did not bowl in three of the innings in the matches played by his school and this was mostly second innings of the opponents.
His season's match haul records is as follows:
Vs Maliyadewa College 1 for 23, Vs St. Aloysius College Galle 5 for 29, Vs St. Anthony's College, Wattala 3 for 25, Vs De Mazenod College, Kandana 3 for 29, Vs. D. S. Senanayake College 1 for 20, Vs. St. Servatius College 3 for 43 (bowled only in the one innings) Vs. Wesley College 8 for 64, Vs. Bandranaike National School 9 for 71, Vs. Dharmapala Vidyalaya 5 for 90, Vs. St Benedcits College 3 for 71 (bowled only in one innigns), Vs St. Josephs College 10 for 131, Vs Dharmaraja College 9 for 74, Vs Ananda College 6 for 71, Vs Issipathana College 6 for 125, Vs Zahira College 5 for 72, Vs St. Thomas College 3 for 93 (bowled only in one innings), Vs St. Peters College 3 for 112, Vs Royal College 6 for 77, Vs Maris Stella College 8 for 122, Vs St. Anthony's College, Kandy 7 for 76.
