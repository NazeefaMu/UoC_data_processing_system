Gamer.LK brings Esports to schools with Inter-School Esports C’ship

Gamer.LK, the leader in Esports and Digital Entertainment experiences in Sri Lanka, is bringing the thrill of competitive video gaming to Schools across Sri Lanka with the Inter-School Esports Championship - powered by Dialog Gaming. The Championship being organised for the third consecutive year will be held on September 22 and 23 at Trace Expert City and is open to students from any schools (Government or private) in Sri Lanka.
Considered one of the largest School sporting events, the event has provided a unique platform for participants to compete for the prestigious championship trophy and represent their school across a number of team games (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, League of Legends, Overwatch and Special Force 2) and individual games (FIFA 18, Injustice 2, Project CARS, Tekken 7, Clash Royale, Fortnite, Fruit Ninja and Subway Surfers). In addition a women’s Championship (featuring Mario Kart 8 and Need for Speed: Most Wanted) will be held with its own championship trophy that will recognise the best female student-cyber athletes in the Esports field.
In addition to the competitive titles, participants will also be able to compete in finding Sri Lanka’s Fastest eRacer. Complete with Red Bull racing seats, racing wheels and pedals, large-screen TVs and the tracks on Project CARS, this is a brand-new concept devised by Gamer.LK and aimed at promoting simulation racing in the country.
The Inter-School event which began in 2016 with the intention of bringing out the positives of structured competitive video games, saw over 75 schools taking part last year. After some exciting encounters, Gateway College emerged the champions for the second year running with Royal College coming in second whilst Nalanda College and Zahira College came in joint third.
Electronic Sports is the competitive play of video games - a fast growing sport across the globe with a strong following in Sri Lanka. Esports is currently officially recognised by the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka and will be recognised by the Ministry of Sports this year.
Esports athletes from Sri Lanka were able to earn national colors and represent their country at the recently concluded 18th Asian Games held in Indonesia, with the sport on track to be a medal event in the 2022 Asian Games in China.
The benefits of Esports are many, with studies showing increased cognitive growth, better hand-eye coordination, enhanced communication skills with team members, and increased
critical thinking for problem solving. Esports in Sri Lanka has received the support of organisations such as the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) and Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) for its promotion of Information Technology, with Esports being considered a gateway to computer literacy and a career in the IT industry.
The Inter-School Esports Championship is powered by Dialog Gaming, who over the years have provided vital support towards the development of Esports in the country.
Dialog Gaming is also promoting the competitive title Special Force 2 at the event. In addition, they will be kicking off the Dialog Gaming League later this year, for which the Special Force 2 champions at Inter-School Esports will qualify.
The overall winners of the League will get the chance to represent Sri Lanka at International tournaments.
MSI is on board as the Technology Partner for the event. Honda is the Motorbike Partner of the event. Honda is starting out a brand new season of the Rider Rush championship where they offer a free Honda NAVI to the winner.
HyperX marks its entry into the Sri Lankan Esports scene as the Silver Partner for the event. TRACE Expert City is the Venue Partner for the event.
