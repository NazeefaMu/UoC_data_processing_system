‘Toppling government a pipe dream'

Making reference to Article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic, a Senior Stalwart of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) fired warning signals at dissidents and members of the party asserting that the discourse of toppling the government, is but a pipe dream. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the current Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and one of the most senior members of the SLFP pointing out the balance of power within the Parliament said that, in order to change the status quo a majority of 2/3rds is required in Parliament.
“Many people in the Joint Opposition have been dreaming of toppling the Unity Government and forming a new one. It will only remain a dream. They could dance in any which way they want to but, this government would continue till 2020. If there is to be a change there needs to be a two thirds majority,” he said. De Silva pointed this out, making reference to Article 70 of the Constitution as amended by the 19th Amendment.
The Amendment specifies that if an election was to be called for by the President by dissolving Parliament four years and six months from the date appointed for its (Parliaments) first meeting, the President could only do so by a “resolution passed by not less that two-thirds of the whole number of members (including those not present) voting in its favour”.
Speaking at the Badulla Auditorium during the SLFP Badulla District Bala Mandalaya,de Silva said that he stood firm with the party throughout.
“Unlike many people, we didn’t play double games. During the 2015 Presidential election, we all worked for the then leader of the party Mahinda Rajapaksa.However,he lost. Thereafter the leadership of the party was handed over to Maithripala Sirisena.
“He invited us to form the Unity Government instead of kicking us out. He did that because he wanted to protect our party. We joined the government consequent to the Central Committee decision of the party,” he said.
Making clear and unambiguous reference to members of the party who are currently not aligned with the government, he said that they have set upon themselves the goal of destroying the party.
“There are certain sections within the SLFP who want to break our party, to destroy this government. These conspirators have made it their priority to divide us.But, we won’t fall prey to them, the SLFP wont fall prey to these conspiracies,” he said.
He further said that the majority partner of the government could form a government without the SLFP.
“If the SLFP leaves, the UNP could form a government on their own. They have 106 Parliamentarians, while only 113 seats are required to form a government. The required seats could be from the Joint Opposition or the TNA,” he said, while asserting that the SLFP would stand united against the onslaught.
During the ceremony attended by Spokesperson for the SLFP, Dilan Perera, the Chief Minister of the Uva Province Chamara Dassanayaka and other district leaders of the party, Silva reiterated that the government would remain intact until 2020.
“Whether we like it or not this government would be in place till 2020. It is something that the 19th Amendment specifies. In a few months the local government elections would be held and we will be nominating our representatives. The elections will be held on the first past the post system and the people could chose their representatives. The people should never be afraid of this government being changed. It wont” he said.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was passed on April 28, 2015 with 215 MP’s voting for the amendment.
