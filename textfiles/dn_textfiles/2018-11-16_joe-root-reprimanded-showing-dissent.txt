Joe Root reprimanded for showing dissent

England captain Joe Root has received an official reprimand and one demerit point for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the second day’s play in the Pallekele Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
Root was found to have violated Article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match”.
The incident happened in the 76th over of Sri Lanka’s innings when Root appeared to show dissent at umpire Marais Erasmus’ decision by shaking his head and then kicking the turf after Dilruwan Perera had been given not-out off Moeen Ali.
Root pleaded not guilty to the charge and, as such, a hearing took place after the day’s play following which the match referee found the England captain guilty of dissent as charged and handed him an official reprimand and one demerit point.
The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Erasmus and S. Ravi, third umpire Chris Gaffaney and fourth umpire Ranmore Martinesz.
