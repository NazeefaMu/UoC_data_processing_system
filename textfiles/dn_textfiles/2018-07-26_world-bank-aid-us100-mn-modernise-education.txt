World Bank aid of US$100 mn to modernise education

Sri Lanka signed a $100 million credit agreement with the World Bank tosupport its efforts to strengthen and modernise the education system in the country.
The General Education Modernisation Project (GEM) will modernise and diversify the curriculum of general education in keeping with the transformation taking place in Sri Lanka’s society and economy.
Greater emphasis will be on strategic subjects that are key for economic development such as English and Mathematics. The project will help broaden choices for the GCE A Level so that students have the flexibility to select subjects from among the arts, management, science, technology, and vocational streams. Learning material for the English language and Mathematics will be developed digitally and the focus will be on children from schools located in more disadvantaged regions.
World Bank Country Director Dr. IdahPswarayi-Riddihough and Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga signed the agreement at the Finance Ministry yesterday, on behalf of the World Bank and the Sri Lankan government respectively.
“Sri Lanka has made impressive progress in expanding access to education. However, to reach the status of an upper middle-income country, it needs to further improve the overall learning outcomes. Sri Lanka’s education policy makers recognise that a high-quality general education system will enable students to meet the demands of 21st century jobs,” said Pswarayi-Riddihough. “We are happy to partner with the government to ensure that all children have the opportunity to gain foundational skills, especially in Mathematics and English, needed to participate in Sri Lanka’s economic growth.”
The project will benefit school students both at the primary (Grades 1-5) and at the secondary (Grades 6-13) levels. Technical education and vocational training institutes, academic and managerial staff of the schools will also benefit from this project.
The World Bank has been a long-standing partner of Sri Lanka in the education sector. The Transforming School Education System Project (TSEP),supported by the World Bank, has helped the country increase the rate of children attending school from Grades 1–11 (ages 6–16) to over 87 percent; introduced a regular cycle of national assessments of learning outcomes, and started school-based management (SBM) to support the administration of schools in all zones. In addition, TSEP helped in strengthening the capacity of the decentralised tiers of education administration.
“GEM will support the government to modernise the primary and secondary education system in line with international standards established in middle-income and high-income education systems,” said World Bank’s Task Team Leader for the project and Lead Economist Harsha Aturupane. “Successful implementation of the overall general education reform programme and the key priorities supported by GEM should lead to improved learning outcomes and higher socio-emotional skills among students.”
The GEM project will build on the experience and lessons learned from TSEP and strengthen the World Bank’s support to the general education sector.
