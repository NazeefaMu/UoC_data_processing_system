Death fast 1,132 ft underground.....

The first unto death launched by employees attached to the Dodangaskanda Kahatagaha Graphite (Mines) Lanka Company in support of several demands continued for the third day yesterday.
The employees who are conducting the fast inside the mine, almost 1,132 fleet below ground level, have threatened to go down to 2,000 feet unless their demands were met.
The employees said their main demand was for the management to rectify their salary anomalies. They said they had not received any salary increments since 2012, and they are paid salaries on two different scales.
