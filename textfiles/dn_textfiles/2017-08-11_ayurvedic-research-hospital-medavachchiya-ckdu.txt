A new Ayurvedic Research Hospital was established recently in Medavachchiya to research the reason behind the rapidly increasing Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) in the North Central Province and some other areas in the country, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
According to the Spokesman, a total of 2,487 patients have already registered to obtain medical treatment for CKDU and monthly medical treatment is being offered to 600 patients. There are eight Ayurvedic treatment centres in the Anuradhapura district.
The newly opened Ayurvedic Research Hospital will provide services under 17 areas. Some of them are upgrading the nutritional standard of patients, providing safe drinking water for patients, looking after their maternal health, family health, etc, he said.
Addressing the gathering after commissioning the hospital, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that Cabinet approval had been received to give appointments to 960 graduates who hold degrees in Ayurveda.
