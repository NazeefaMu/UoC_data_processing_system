England made to toil as Board XI runs up 392/9
Kaushal Silva, Mathews warm-up for Galle Test

Opening bat Kaushal Silva and former captain Angelo Mathews made good use of the two-day practice game against touring England to get runs under their belt on the opening day at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Sri Lanka Board XI winning the toss and batting first ended the day on an impressive 392-9 declared keeping the England bowlers the entire day on the field.
Silva attempting to make a comeback to the Test side after a year on the sidelines scored a compact 62 off 82 balls (9 fours) before retiring out at the lunch break. With skipper Lahiru Thirimanne who scored 45 before edging a drive to slip Silva put on an opening stand of 99. Mathews returning to competitive cricket after being left out of the recently concluded five-match ODI series struck five fours and two sixes in an aggressive knock of 45 off 38 balls before drilling one to cover.
Roshen Silva, a member of the 16-member Test squad failed to make use of the opportunity to get some runs behind him ahead of the first Test at Galle on November 6 when he was dismissed for 11.
Sadeera Samarawickrama, Ashan Priyanjan and Manoj Sarathchandra all made full use of the match to hit attractive half-centuries. Samaraweera hit 11 fours in his 66-ball knock for 58, Priyanjan hit an accomplished half century off 86 balls with six fours before retiring out and Tamil Union wicket-keeper batsman Sarathchandra struck seven fours and a six in his unbeaten innings of 59 off 56 balls. England’s new ball bowler James Anderson and Stuart Broad bowled 23 overs between them taking one wicket for 80 runs.
Spinners Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Joe Denly who are expected to play big roles in the Test series proved costly. Ali’s two wickets cost 64 runs, Rashid one for 82 off his 19 overs and Denly’s one wicket cost him 48 runs. England are expected to bat making use of the entire second day today.
