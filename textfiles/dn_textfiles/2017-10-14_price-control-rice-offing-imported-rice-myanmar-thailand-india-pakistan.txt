PRICE CONTROL FOR RICE IN THE OFFING : IMPORTED RICE FROM MYANMAR, THAILAND, INDIA, PAKISTAN

The Industry and Commerce Ministry will issue a Gazette Notification stipulating a controlled price for rice if traders fail to take measures to bring down prices in the market, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen said.
He was addressing the media at the Industries and Commerce Ministry yesterday.
“During a meeting held three months ago with Wholesale and Retail Traders Associations, they agreed to sell rice at a fair price. But, they have not yet taken measures to do that,” the Minister said.
The Minister said the government plans to import 500,000 Metric Tonnes of rice from Myanmar, Thailand, India, Pakistan and around 10,000 MTs of rice has already been imported from India.
The Minister said the government has already allocated Rs.7 billion for this purpose.
Measures have also been taken to sell a kilo of imported rice varieties at Rs.73 through Sathosa wholesale outlets established in the 25 districts. Consumers would be able to purchase a kilo of imported Nadu rice at Rs.74, White Kekulu at Rs.65 and Samba at Rs.84 from the 370 Sathosa outlets. The Ministry has also discussed with the Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardane to establish Sathosa express outlets in all Divisional Secretariats and measures would also be taken to establish such outlets in government institutions.
