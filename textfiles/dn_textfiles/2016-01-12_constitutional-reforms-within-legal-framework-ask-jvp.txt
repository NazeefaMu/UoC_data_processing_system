Constitutional reforms within the legal framework, ask JVP

 
Constitutional reforms should take place within the legal framework outlined in the current constitution, Leader of the JVP, Anura Dissanayake said.
While acknowledging the need for a new constitution, he said that the reforms should not be done in a manner that curtails the equal rights of Members of the Parliament, violating standing orders.
"The proposal made by the Prime Minister does not fall within Parliament standing orders, it goes beyond that. The Prime Minister has displayed by his behavior in Parliament and in Party Leaders meetings that ideas and suggestions by other parties and sections will be ignored by him," Dissanayake said.
Designing a constitution should not be done according to any one's single preference, not the way the TNA wants it, nor should it be just as the President or the Prime Minister wants it, Dissanayake said. "Both the JVP and the TNA have equal right to contribute," he said.
Dissanayake also said that the current issue with the constitution was not a lack of clauses, but the failure to adhere to what was already enshrined.
He also accused certain political factions of using the constitutional reforms to cover up their shortcomings and crimes while the government is using the same to divert attention from welfare cuts, and their shortcomings, he said.
