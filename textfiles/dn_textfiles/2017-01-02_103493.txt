Development (Special Provisions) Bill to be re-presented with amendments

 
The Development (Special Provisions) Bill will be re-presented with Amendments, President Maithripala Sirisena had told a group of UNP backbenchers on Friday.
The President had told them that he would discuss with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and finalise Amendments to the Bill.
About 30 UNP backbenchers met the President at the Presidential Secretariat for a special discussion on the current political developments.
The meeting came in the wake of Provincial Councils defeating the Development (Special Provisions) Bill and statements of certain SLFP and UNP members undermining the unity of the ruling coalition. When the UNP MPs complained about the recent derogatory statements of some SLFP members in the government ranks, the President had told them that he had thoroughly advised his party members to refrain from making such statements in the future. President Sirisena had allayed the worries of the UNP backbenchers stating that the issues between the two parties could be resolved in due course. A UNP MP said the President agreed to meet their group once a month to discuss their grievances and issues.
