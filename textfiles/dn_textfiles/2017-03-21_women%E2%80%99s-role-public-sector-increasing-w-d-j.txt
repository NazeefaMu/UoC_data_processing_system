Women’s role in public sector increasing : W. D. J.

Women represent 36.5 percent of Sri Lanka’s labour force at present while 40 percent of the public service is represented by women. Women's representation in the provincial public service is 60 percent, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing a ceremony at Koggala to mark the International Women's Day, recently.
According to Minister Seneviratne, 68 percent of the total number of teachers in Sri Lanka is women and 60 percent of the workforce in 12 free trade zones is represented by women. More women get through competitive examinations and join the public service, the minister said.
Minister Seneviratne said women's representation in politics in Sri Lanka is, however, low. Therefore, it has been made compulsory to appoint 25 percent of women into the Local Government bodies through next LG polls. At least one fourth of all nomination lists should include women, he added.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said there are around 7,000 female Grama Niladharis at the moment. Women have been appointed for almost all positions in the public service. Today women are in high positions everywhere, he added.
Ministry officials and others were present.
