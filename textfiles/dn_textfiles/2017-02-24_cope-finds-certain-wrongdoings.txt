COPE finds certain wrongdoings

Sports Minister and SLFP member for the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said COPE had found certain wrong doings in the manner in which SAITM was granted approval to establish itself as a private medical campus in 2011.
“When COPE was looking into the UGC, the UGC included a note on SAITM. It explained that at the time, the UGC had given six months for SAITM to correct certain shortcomings before it canapply for recognition as a private medical institute. In the meantime, the Ministry of Higher Education passed a gazette in 2011 to empower the Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education to grant approval for the setting up of SAITM once necessary conditions were met”, said Jayasekara addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters in Darley Road. He further explained that COPE had found no clear evidence to show that the Secretary to the Ministry at the time had appointed a committee to look into whether the conditions were met or not prior to granting approval and there was no evidence of any deliberations made on the issue before arriving at such a decision.
COPE which is currently conducting its periodic review of the UGC thus has also decided to look into the procedural issues which led to setting up of SAITM.
“Overall however, we note that the government needs to take a policy decision on private universities without swinging from one end to the other every time there’s a change in regime”, said the Sports minister.
He explained that while the government was investing in more in universities, it has become necessary that private universities be included in higher education, “The question is how are we going to do it?,”Jayasekara said.
