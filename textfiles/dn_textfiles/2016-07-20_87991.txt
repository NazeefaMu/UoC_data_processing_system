Amaraweera wants woes of  fishermen solved at district level

 
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera instructed of Fisheries District Assistant Directors to solve fishing communities' issues at district level without sending them to the Fisheries Ministry or the Fisheries Department Head Office.
Distributing appointment letters among 15 District Assistant Directors of Fisheries, the minister said it is difficult for fishermen staying in far away places to travel to the Fisheries Ministry or the Fisheries Department in Colombo.
Their issues should be solved at district or regional level, he said.
"Persons spending several nights at sea need a rest during the day. If they have to come to Colombo to solve their issues, they will have no time for a rest," the minister said.
Minister Amaraweera instructed officials to build close ties with the fishing community as this will enable them to solve their issues and find solutions.
He requested the District Assistant Directors of Fisheries to contact the ministry or the Fisheries Department if there are doubts and instructed the ministerial officials to look into fishermen's issues and solve them.
“The fishing community contributes to the country's economy. We should see that solutions are found to fishermen's problems," Amaraweera said.
