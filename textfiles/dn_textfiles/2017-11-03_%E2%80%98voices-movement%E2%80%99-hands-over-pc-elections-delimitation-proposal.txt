The final report prepared by ‘Voices Movement’ regarding the Provincial Council Elections delimitation, was officially handed over to the Secretary of the Delimitation Commission Saman Sri Ratnayake, yesterday.
The final date to handover the Delimitation written Proposals for Provincial Councils was scheduled for yesterday.
The announcement was made by the Delimitation Commission by a Gazette notification on October 13.
The 15-member research group of ‘Voices Movement’ had been involved in the research and had prepared the final report as a civil organization.
The report includes valuable recommendations to the delimitation committee on the demarcations of PC electorates in Muslim populated areas.
Accordingly, the final report of ‘VMOVE’ was officially handed over by the members of VMOVE, Researcher Dilshan Mohamed, Journalist Rizwan Segu Mohaideen, Attorneys-at-law Khalid Muhaimin, Ashar Latheef and Radheef Ahmed to the secretary of the committee.
The ‘Voices Movement’ pointed out that their proposal would help to protect the numbers of Muslim representation to the provincial councils that was affected by the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament.
VMOVE has called on all civil organizations in all districts to take steps to push the relevant political parties to include the recommendations in their report to be included in the final report to be submitted in Parliament by the Delimitation Commission.
