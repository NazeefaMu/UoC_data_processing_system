Threatening SLMC a futile move: Prof. Carlo

SAITM's legality is questionable:
No one will be able to fulfill their objectives by threatening the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The SLMC is not scared of anything or anyone and accepts the religion of justice, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said.
Addressing the media at the SLMC Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said nothing can be get done by the SLMC by making its members scared. The recent bomb attack attempt is the seventh such incident on the SLMC since 2002. The SLMC ensures the safety of patients by ensuring the quality of medical education and keeping the discipline of doctors, he said.
According to Prof. Fonseka, the Western medical practice came to Sri Lanka in 1870. The SLMC was established in 1925. Various attacks on the SLMC commenced in the 21st century.
The SLMC is the highest authority which can access and decide technical matters in connection with higher education in medicine. The SLMC sent a team of 10 experts to SAITM in 2015 and compiled a report on it. SAITM's legality is questionable, he said.
Former Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura Prof. Narada Warnasuriya said SAITM did not follow rules and regulations to obtain the degree awarding status. The degree awarding status was offered to SAITM through `other' ways. The Kothalawa Defence Academy Medical Collage followed the proper procedure, Prof. Fonseka said.
