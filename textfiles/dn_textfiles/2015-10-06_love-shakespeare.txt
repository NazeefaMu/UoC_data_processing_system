For the love of Shakespeare

Colombo International School (CIS) plans to stage a bold theatrical adaptation of 'Shakespeare in Love' directed by Head of Performing Arts Colombo International School (CIS) Vinod Senadeera. The cast are well drilled and well trained and feature some seasoned campaigners.
'Shakespeare in Love' was a 1998 British-American romantic comedy-drama film which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. In the play Senadeera directs, the role of William Shakespeare is played by Aashiq Fassuhudeen and the Role of Viola is played by Amrita Khandpur.
"The play is based on the famous movie 'Shakespeare in Love'. We have taken the script off the movie and converted it into the theatre. If you ask me why I selected it; it is our annual school senior production and I like to have a large cast. It is one of the requirements of the school that there are more people on stage.
Maybe another reason why I selected this particular play was because we have not done comedy for a long time. To do comedy I need to have experienced actors. I need to have performers who can handle comedy because it is the most difficult genre to act in plays," said Head of Performing Arts CIS, Vinod Senadeera.
The cast and their director have a special connection having worked with each other previously and they are quite capable of handling a comedy. "But this is not a normal comedy. It is extremely difficult to perform, because there are lots of sub plots and plays within plays. You need a very alert cast and I think my cast are reaching those expectations."
Shakespeare in love is a comedy set in Shakespeare's time. The whole story is about how Shakespeare began writing his Romeo and Juliet. Having fallen in love with the movie Senadeera wanted to do a stage play.
"Shakespeare in Love is a period play in the Elizabethan Age. That is one hassle. In Shakespeare's time girls' parts were played by boys. This is because girls were not allowed to act on stage. This is difficult because most of the boys have to perform as girls and being in a mixed school it is tough. If you are in a same sex school it is easier to do things like this. Because in a school like this, that sort of culture is not easy. It is not heard of. So it is a case of the boys performing girls and it is about their removing costumes on stage. It is a lot of hard work."
From the point of view of the kids it is extremely challenging, because it requires a lot of intelligence to bring out a 16th Century attitude. So it is a tall order.
"Rehearsals have been frustrating because these kids are extremely busy with various other things. They do sports and attend various other classes and societies and it has not been an easy ride. But because I am directing school kids I always need to give children the scope to perform and do things elsewhere as well. I don't expect them to be 100 percent committed. They are all involved in other things as well and I need to accept that fact and encourage that.
But the issue is as a director, it is frustrating when you don't have a cast to work with. But it has not been that bad. We are managing and pooling in. The kids are cooperating a lot." The whole process, the whole story line of Shakespeare in Love is tremendously insightful. Because a lot of people are not aware of how Shakespeare wrote his plays.
The play will be staged at the CIS Auditorium on October 8 and 9 from 7 to 8.30 pm.
