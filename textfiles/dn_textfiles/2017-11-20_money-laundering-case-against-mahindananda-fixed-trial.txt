Money laundering case against Mahindananda fixed for trial

 
A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 through illegally acquired money was fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court, today.  
Accordingly, the case was fixed for trial on December 13, 14 and 15 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Meanwhile, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage was not present in Court, citing that he had to attend parliament sessions.
The two sureties who signed bonds on behalf of the accused were also not present in Court and they were notified to appear before Courts tomorrow.
The High Court Judge observed that it is unacceptable for the defense to inform court at the last moment that they are not ready for the trial.
"The accused should have informed his difficulties through a motion, prior to the trial date," Judge Kulatunga said.  
The Attorney General filed indictments against Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs.27 million.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused has failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money to purchase the house and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under Section 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former Minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the convener of the Voice against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared on behalf of the accused.
