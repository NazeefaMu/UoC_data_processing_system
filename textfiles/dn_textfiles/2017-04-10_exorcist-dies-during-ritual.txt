Exorcist dies during ritual

A Kattadiya (Exorcist) died while performing an exorcism on an allegedly possessed girl on Saturday in the Anuradhapura area.The exorcist, a father of two from Saliyapura, Anuradhapura had fallen unconscious during the exorcism performed on Saturday night and had been pronounced dead upon admittance to the hospital.
The parents of the young girl had sought the exorcist’s help to cure their daughter’s long-standing mental illness which they attributed to the work of evil spirits.
Giving evidence during the postmortem, a person who attended the ritual said that although the Kattadiya had tried to speak to the mentally-ill girl, she kept crying without uttering a word during the ritual.
Even after performing several religious rituals, the Kattadiya could not obtain any response or reaction from the girl, he added.
Then the Kattadiya had kept his right hand on the girl’s head and while chanting bent towards her at which point he had collapsed unconscious.
Following the autopsy, the Coroner has found that the death of the Kattadiya was due to a heart attack.
