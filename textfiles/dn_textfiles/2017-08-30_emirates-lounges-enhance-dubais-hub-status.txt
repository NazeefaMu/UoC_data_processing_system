Emirates' lounges enhance Dubai's hub status

Rejuvenated. That’s what the ultra modern and luxurious Emirates’ lounges at Dubai International Airport make its First and Business Class passengers feel.
From seating to cuisine to amenities, the lounges provide an array of facilities that one would find in a luxury hotel, making passengers feel refreshed and relaxed before take off.
The airport’s Terminal 3 which is dedicated to Emirates’ flights has First Class and Business Class Lounges on each of its Concourses A, B and C. Concourse C has an additional new mixed lounge. Together, the seven lounges can accommodate over 7,000 premium passengers at any given time.
The Business Class Lounge on Concourse B which is spacious and flooded with warm sunlight in the morning has comfortable leather chairs for passengers who wish to enjoy the buffet watch TV, read the newspapers or just chat. Formal dining areas are also available, while the lounge has a separate smoking area.
Silver and Gold Skywards (Emirates’ loyalty club) members can enjoy the Business Class Lounge, while Platinum members can use the First Class Lounge.
It is doubtful that any passenger would pass over the enticing spread at the buffet. The Business Class Lounge on Concourse B has four identical buffets so passengers do not have to crowd over one area or stand in queue. Cuisine ranges from light to heavy meals with a choice of Continental, Arabic, American and more, with menus changing every month.
Indeed the choice of croissants, éclairs, cookies and fruit to begin with, would be hard to decline. Cuisine is accompanied by an exclusive range of beverages including an extensive selection of teas, champagnes and wines and other liquor, all on the house. If coffee is the preference, complimentary barista coffee is available at the Costa bar; if juice is preferred, there is a juice bar. For those who want something more spirited, there is an impressive champagne bar.
The health hub can vie with the very best a lounge has to offer: breakfast comes complete with a choice of sashimi, cold meats, dried fruit, a variety of wholesome breads, yoghurt, cereal, fresh fruit and the ultimate - delectable smoothies.
Passengers can pick one of the top international dailies like the New York Times, Financial Times and Daily Mail or international magazines while eating or just watch TV on life size screens which are plentiful around the lounge.
Passengers who would rather catch up on much needed rest can stretch out on comfortable flat beds in the one of three ‘quiet zones’ in the lounge.
If there is work to catch up with, there is a fully-equipped business centre with individual touch screen workstations, printers, recharging facility for laptops and mobile phones and free wifi as a well a meeting room equipped with a projector.
The lounge has mobile phone charging stations and large flight information displays, a Skywards counter and mosque for worship. Emirates Airport Services staff manage the lounge at all times.
Shoe shine is available for a fee as is the elegant Timeless Spa. Passengers who wish to freshen up before take off can use the designer shower rooms in three different areas.
The play area for children is as attractive as any at an amusement park. With brightly coloured fall proof jigsaw puzzle floor and fun rides and games, parents can be sure children will have plenty to occupy themselves with.
Passengers can indulge in some duty free shopping at the Le Clos luxury wine and Carolina Herrera perfume stores before leaving. Five gates are accessible from the same level as the lounge.
The First Class Lounge has even more comfortable seating and superior cuisine with a la carte dining, an excellent selection of cheeses and wines, a sushi station and mocktails and cocktails customised for passengers. Quiet rooms are enclosed for privacy. There is a mother and child care room and a hostess desk for VIPs. Shoe shine is complimentary as is the first 15 minutes of spa treatment.
The First Class Lounge on Concourse B has a wine cellar providing passengers an opportunity to view, taste and purchase a range of exquisite wines. First and Business Class passengers using Concourse B have a dedicated premium cigar lounge.
Emirates offers all this and more in its lounges, in a bid to make its homebase Dubai a truly global hub.
