Fifty two years ago, when Ananda won after 26 years

Dear readers I landed in Melbourne just a few days back and it’s freezing cold but ideal surroundings to continue with my series of articles which is a privilege and a pleasure.
Ananda Sumanadasa wrote a detailed write up on this particular match, a few years back in America. He is domiciled there for a long time. Ananda got his degree from The Cambridge University in England, he worked as a consultant engineer and is retired now. He was Ananda’s solid opening batsman during that era. Sumandasa gave a vivid description of this match a few years back.
Ananda College was captained by that dashing opener A.G.Perera and yours truly was the vice-captain of that side. Interestingly both captain and the vice-captain ended up as Chartered Engineers in later life.
As is the tradition the match was played at the Colombo Oval on March 19 and 20th in 1965.Sumanadasa stated that Ananda won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket that looked full of runs. The players were greeted by two experienced umpires Lucky Mayo and Harmer as they descended on to the playing arena. Nalanda opened with their two left arm paceman Anura De Silva and A.Ponamperuma, both bowled round the wicket inswingers as their stock balls. Our opening batsmen A, Sumanadasa and A.G.Perera started soundly and the later in typical style belting a couple of fours all of a sudden , with the score at 19 , A.G. fell to a full blooded pull shot smartly taken by Amaraweera who flung himself to his left. Then three more batsmen Late Lakshman de Silva , Sumanadasa and Duminda Siriwardene were back in the pavilion within a space of half an hour.
The ideal batting wicket played as expected stated Sumanadasa, it was the dismal batting by the Anandians which surprised all, they struggled at 28 for 4. The early damage was done by Ponnamperuma , Vas Gunawardene and Anura De Silva. At that stage Ananda pinned their hopes on left hander G.C.Perera and Tilak De Silva, who hit a century against St Benedict’s the previous year. Rescue they did. These two batsmen batted with purpose and sound judgement, and punished the loose balls and moved the score to 91 for 4 by Lunch.
After the resumption Tilak De Silva went for 25 caught behind by late Wasantha Senewiratne and the partnership of 70 runs concluded. As it happens another collapse occurred and G.C.Perere ran out of partners and got out for 57 well compiled runs, battled for 2 hours, his innings was studded with pleasing drives and well timed pull shots which grazed the mid-wicket boundary. The tail did not wag and the innings folded up at 122. If not for the Perera -De silva partnership Ananda would have been in dire straits, this was invaluable since it was made between two major collapses. The Nalanda bowlers Vas Gunewardene bagging 4 for 25 and Shantha Pieris scalping 3 for 29 kept a tight leash on the Anandians to contain them for a mediocre total of 122, the brilliant fielding of the Nalandians helped their cause.
Nalanda opened in a business-like fashion Shantha Pieris scoring all-round the Oval, rookie Laxman Doolwela, just 14 years of age and still wet behind the years, ably supported his free scoring partner. There were no threats offered by the Ananda bowlers, till Lalith Gunaratne was brought into the attack, Lalith’s gentle in dippers got Pieris caught behind by Ivan Amaranayake. According to Sumanadasa this was the turning point of the match, he further added that all this drama on the first day was missed by Dhanasiri Weerasinghe who was on election duty due to the prevailing General Election.
At 45 for 1, A.G.Perera threw caution to the wind, and against the coaches instruction started bowling, he caused havoc capturing 3 wickets in 5 balls with his medium pace seamers, Cholmondeley Amarasekera ,Anura De Silva and late Wasntha Senewiratne were his victims. At the tea break Nalanda were 52 for 4.
Sumandasa stated that after tea Jayawardene with a couple of hits to the boundary tried to resurrect the innings but got out with the score at 65 for 5. Doolwela the back bone of the innings was joined by Gunawardene both being freshers put on a brave partnership and took the total past the 100 mark, the latter bating aggressively, as Nalanda looked like gaining the upper hand, Gunawardene got out trying to sweep Siriwardene and was adjudged lbw, score was 111.
In the gathering darkness, the stubborn Doolewla was joined by Mahinda Wijesekera with half an hour to go. Confusion set in and this pair trying to push the score along were both run out. Doolwela’s vigil came to an end after 3 hours and scored 37 precious runs. A.G.Perera came back in to the attack and polished off the tail, Nalanda all out for 138 giving them a slender lead of 16 runs.
Sumanadasa stated that at the end of the first day, Nalanda could breathe a sigh of relief by restricting the stronger Anandians to a paltry score and outscored their opponents by a small margin. He adds that fortunately they were unable to drive home the early advantage with a significant score.
The match was left on a knife edge since it could have gone either way the following day.
A.G. Pererera with his cutters, seam and swing ripped through the Nalandians, he was cheeky enough to go against the grain defying the coach’s orders not to bowl. His calculated gamble finally paid off. Doolwela at the raw age of 14 years batted like a veteran to glue the Nalanda innings together, I saw with my own eyes standing at slip his concentration! it was not second to a Sunil Gavaskar.
I was also proud enough to have that small partnership with the elegant left hander G.C.Perera, which really boosted our score.
