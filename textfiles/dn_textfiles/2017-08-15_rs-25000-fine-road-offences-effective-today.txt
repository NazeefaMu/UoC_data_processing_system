Rs. 25,000 fine for road offences effective from today

The decision to impose a fine of Rs. 25,000 on several road offences will be effective from today.
According to the Chairman of the National Committee for Road Safety Sisira Kodagoda, revised fines for several road offences will be active soon.
However, several parties, including the Association of Private Bus Owners, three wheeler societies and motorcycle unions had leveled allegations against the decision to increase fines by a large amount.
The road offences, including driving without a licence, employing a person who does not have a driving licence, driving under the influence of alcohol, crossing the railway tracks with a reckless manner and driving without an insurance cover are subjected to fines.
The National Committee for Road Safety has taken a decision to increase the amount of fines related to road offences, including overtaking a vehicle from left side and driving while communicating through mobile phones up to Rs. 2,000 and driving in a reckless manner up to Rs. 10,000.
The fine for driving a vehicle by an underage person will be increased from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 30,000.
