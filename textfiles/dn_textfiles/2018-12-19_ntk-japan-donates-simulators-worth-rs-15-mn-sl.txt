N.T.K. Japan donates simulators  worth Rs 15 mn to SL

N.T.K. Co. Ltd. of Japan donated three simulators worth Rs. 15 million on the request of Dr. Sisira Kodagoda, Chairman of National Council for Road Safety at the intervention of the Japanese government at the ceremony held at the Electronic Technical Training Centre for Drivers constructed in the premises of the National Council for Road Safety recently.
During this year, from 1st January 2018 until 31st October 2018, there have been 2481 fatal road accidents and 2590 persons have died as a result of them.
In these accidents 792 pedestrians have been killed and 1011 persons have died in motor cycle accidents. Reports of the World Health Organization show that the tendency for accidents in the first year of obtaining the Driving License is very high.
Taking all these into consideration, it is intended to provide initial training in simulators before going to a driving School to obtain new driving licenses.
