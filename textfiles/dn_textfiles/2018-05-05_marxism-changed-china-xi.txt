Marxism  changed  China- Xi

CHINA: The 200th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx on Friday illustrated how times have changed in China, as a group of seven of Donald Trump’s trade hawks spent the day in Beijing negotiating over the impending trade war.
Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a major speech on how Marxism still drove China onwards, while across town, China’s top economic advisor, vice premier Liu He, upheld the principals of globalisation and free trade in talks with the American group.
The Marx anniversary speech, which was televised nationally, highlights that Xi is pushing the ruling Communist Party and its philosophy into the centre of Chinese life – on university campuses, in business and in government.
That this could occur at the same time as economic reform and opening up was explained by Xi as Marxism adapting to the times.
Among a small busload of foreign media invited to hear Xi speak, Fairfax Media struck up a conversation with a North Korean journalist. He strode smiling up the staircase in the Great Hall of the People, wearing the standard North Korean grey summer suit (worn without a shirt underneath) and obligatory Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung duo lapel badge.
It is rare for a North Korean reporter to be seen, let alone speak with western media. Marx’s anniversary would be big in Pyongyang, he said.
Times were good, the reporter said. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had met with Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un this week, and North Korea’s nuclear reactor would be publicly dismantled.
What was left unsaid was that China and South Korea have very likely offered North Korea a path for economic reform, out of old-school socialist planned economies, in exchange for nuclear dismantlement.
Marxism had changed China, said Xi, and scientific socialism was “by no means an immutable dogma”.
“The great social changes in contemporary China are not ... a simple application of the template envisaged by a classical Marxist writer, nor a republication of the practice of socialism in other countries, nor a reprint of the modernisation of foreign countries,” he said.
Marx was even invoked as a champion of globalisation. Xi gave an apparent dig at the Trump trade delegation across town.
“Countries are more connected and interdependent to each other than ever before. An integrated world is there. Whoever rejects the world, the world will reject them,” said Xi.
Xi said the world had undergone earth-shaking changes since the Communist Manifesto was published 170 years ago, but its general principles were “entirely correct”.
The speech reinforced that China has no intention of following western democratic reforms.
China faced “unprecedented heavy tasks of reform” and challenges and risks in governance, Xi said, but it had to use Marxism to solve its problems.Karl Marx’s work “can be explained in five minutes, five hours, in five years or in a half century,” wrote French political thinker Raymond Aron.
A utopian vision of a just society for some, a blueprint for totalitarian regimes for others, Marxist thought is laid out in the Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital.
“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle,” says the Communist Manifesto, co-written with Friedrich Engels and published in 1848.
Marx believed that humanity’s core conflict rages between the ruling class, or bourgeoisie, that controls the means of production such as factories, farms and mines, and the working class, or proletariat, which is forced to sell their labour.
According to Marx, this conflict at the heart of capitalism -- of slaves against masters, serfs against landlords, workers against bosses -- would inevitably cause it to self-destruct, to be followed by socialism and eventually communism. Marx believed that religion, like a drug, helps the exploited to suppress their immediate pain and misery with pleasant illusions, to the benefit of their oppressors.
The quote usually paraphrased as “religion is the opium of the people” originates from the introduction of Marx’s work “A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right”.
In full, it reads: “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.” The idea was used to justify brutal purges of religions in Russia, China and across eastern Europe.
Some scholars point out that Marx saw religion as only one of many elements explaining the enslavement of the proletariat and may have been surprised to see radical atheism become a core tenet of communist regimes.
