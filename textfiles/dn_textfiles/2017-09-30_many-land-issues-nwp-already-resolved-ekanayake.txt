Many land issues in NWP already resolved: Ekanayake

The Government was able to resolve 2,146 land issues in the North Western Province (NWP) this year, Land State Minister T.B. Ekanayake said at a discussion held at the Kurunegala District Secretariat Conference Hall yesterday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena under the ‘Bim Saviya’ programme took the country towards progress and restored peace.
He said 34,600 families did not receive title deeds for their land in Wayamba.
“We hope to issue deeds to all of them before the end of the year,” he said.
He said Land Ministry officials extend their fullest cooperation to fulfil the task. Commissioner of land E.A.R. Renuka, Provincial Land Commissioner Chandana Dissanayake, Land Ministry Secretary N.P.V.C. Piyathilake and officials were participated.
