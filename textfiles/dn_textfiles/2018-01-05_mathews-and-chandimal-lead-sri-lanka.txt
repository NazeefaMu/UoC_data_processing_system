Only two captains for three formats says chief selector
Mathews and Chandimal to lead Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka cricket in future will have only two captains for the three formats – Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal.
In recent times Sri Lanka appointed three different captains for Tests, ODIs and T20Is, but that decision didn’t work out well with the country going through one of their worst years in one-day cricket in 2017 losing 23 of 29 ODIs and 15 of 20 T20Is.
To add more salt to the wound Sri Lanka went through 2017 with as many as six captains in the two formats ODIs and T20Is at different times.
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday made a statement to the effect that they would announce its limited overs captain on January 9 following a discussion held on Wednesday by SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala, SLC vice president in charge of international cricket K Mathivanan, SLC CEO Ashley de Silva, chief selector Graeme Labrooy, Sri Lanka cricket manager and selector Asanka Gurusinha and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha.
“During the discussion the chairman of selectors informed me that they are considering appointing either Angelo Mathews or Dinesh Chandimal to fill the role,” Sumthipala was quoted in the press statement.
Labrooy told the Daily News yesterday that they were looking at appointing only two captains for the three formats and it would be between Mathews and Chandimal. Both players have captained their country on different occasions across all three formats.
“We want to appoint a captain long term who can take us through till the 2019 World Cup. It could be a captain who will lead in the Tests as well as the ODI side or a captain who will captain the ODI and T20 sides. We have pushed back in taking this decision until January 8 as there are a few things we need to discuss before making the final choice,” said Labrooy.
At present Chandimal is the Test captain and considering Mathews’ history with injuries, Chandimal may even be handed the ODI captaincy as well, with Mathews asked to lead the T20 side. Mathews who pulled a hamstring during the third T20I against India last month is expected to undergo a fitness test on January 7.
In the event, the selectors who were to pick the ODI squad for Bangladesh today have postponed it till January 8 when they would name the ODI captain who will then sit with them to select the ODI team.
All-rounder Thisara Perera led Sri Lanka in the recently concluded ODI and T20I series in India that Sri Lanka lost by 2-1 and 3-0 margins respectively.
Sri Lanka are due to leave for Bangladesh on January 13 to participate in a tri-nation one-day series with Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
