CID Sleuths trailing Anika's complaint - IGP

Police yesterday refuted media reports that two Ministers have forced the IGP to halt CID investigations into the purported death threats on Anika Wijesuriya, a witness in the Treasury Bond Commission.
The Police Department said no minister has intimidated the Police Department to stop investigations into a underworld gangster.
IGP Pujith Jayasundera and Police spokesman, SP Ruwan Gunasekera while denying the media reports to the effect, yesterday stressed that no minister has forced him or other police officers to to soften these investigations.
SP Gunasekera said a number of Divisions including theCriminal Investigation Department (CID) , Colombo Crimes Division (CCD), Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) are conducting investigations into suspects involved in criminal activities around the country and no person has meddled in these investigations.
Addressing a special press conference at the Uduwana Police station in Galle, SP Gunasekera said the IGP has referred the complaint of Anika Wijesuriya’s death threats to the CID to conduct a full scale investigation.
“It was the IGP who has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department to initiate a thorough investigation into this complaint”, he said.
SP Gunasekera added that the IGP who has ordered investigations into this complaint, will not reverse his decision or give into pressure of anyone powerful and deter their investigations into wrongdoers. “The recent arrest of a UNP provincial councillor and his wife manifeststhe impartiality”, he said
He said that police went to the extent of searching their house too.Gunasekera added that the Police department had already informed the relevant newspapers which carried misleading news over police investigations into these incidents,demanding corrections.
