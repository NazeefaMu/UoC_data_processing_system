CCBSL, Eco Spindles and RDA launch plastic recycling project

Coca-cola Beverages Sri Lanka (CCBSL) along with Eco Spindles Pvt Ltd and Road Development Authority (RDA) of Sri Lanka launched a plastic recycling project last week.
The project “Give Back Life” focuses on collecting PET plastic bottles for recycling at every exit point along the Colombo-Katunayake Express way.
Addressing the gathering Saman Opanayake, Director, Expressway Operation & Maintenance Division, Road Development Authority said that this project helps to minimize environment issues. Thus it makes a favorable place for both consumers and residents dwelling on either side of the road way. The intention behind this project is to build up an eco-friendly environment. “We hope to place 10 bins at every exit point and 16 bins at every police and STF check point.” Steps are taken to distribute educational material about recycling to the public. The first stage of this project has been already initiated in Southern Express way where 48 bins are already placed at every exit point. John Keels Pvt Ltd and Eco Spindles have sponsored for this commitment.
CCBSL’s project’ “Give Back Life”, provides easily accessible collection bins as an effective solution. ‘World without waste’ been their global goal they hope to reach this target well before 2030. Through this they intend not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also to collect and recycle the same amount. “We believe that all packaging materials have benefits and they can be turned into valuable products” said Asoka Wickremesinghe, Chairman, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. He further emphasized that they require a better collection of plastic materials. With the help of Eco Spindles these plastics can be turned into brushes, yarn, clothing and shoes. He also said that the government gives their full support to this public-private partnership. Furthermore Coca Cola has expanded its project with Arpico Super center, Perera and Sons Pvt Ltd and Sri Lanka Cricket Council.
BPPL Holdings with its wholly subsidiary Eco Spindles is the largest plastic recycling firm in Sri Lanka. Every month 250 tons of plastic are recycled for usable products. They have 125 collection points all over the island which are run by independent parties. These points are regularly audited and health and safety rules are strictly followed. The bottles collected from these centers are delivered to the washing plant in Horana. The washed bottles are then produced into usable industrial and housing appliances exported across the globe. In July 2018, the company opened the first yarn industry in the country. “It is never possible to eliminate plastic from our lives due to economic factors. But what we could do is to recycle them to usable products,” Anush Amarasinghe, CEO of BPPL Holdings said. Each kilo of plastic is purchased at a price of Rs.20 to Rs.40.
This initiative would help not only to make Sri Lanka an eco friendly environment but also provides many job opportunities.
