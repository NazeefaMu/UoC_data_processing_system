Ampara: Flour clumps; no chemical - govt Analyst

The Government Analyst’s Department has confirmed that samples of particles found in food sold at a local eatery in Ampara does not contain sterilising chemicals as alleged but were mere clumps of flour.
Government Analyst A. Weliangage told the Daily News that the particles were clumps of flour, contents of carbohydrates.
“We have sent a detailed report to the Ampara Magistrate and the DIG as there is an ongoing investigation related to this incident.” He debunked the popular misconception that sterilisation pills were sold in the food, adding that they were clumps of flour.
A tense situation arose in Ampara on February 27 when an eatery owned by a Muslim was accused of mixing sterilization pills with food served to non-Muslim patrons.
A video of the owner having to admit the crime under duress went viral sparking violence and racial riots.
