networking session  with New Zealand  Trade Commissioner

The Sri Lanka-Australia-New Zealand Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has convened a networking session on June 19 at Mövenpick Hotel Colombo, with the New Zealand Trade Commissioner and his team to coincide with the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2018.
Ralph has been with NZTE for 7 years and during this time has been Trade Commissioner based in Sao Paulo and a Business Development Manager for Spain and Portugal based in Madrid.
New Zealand Trade Commissioner will speak on the topic “Opportunities for enhancing Business with New Zealand”. The networking session follows a successful NZ Trade Mission to Colombo in April and is a good opportunity for the New Zealand and Sri Lankan business communities to connect.
This will also give an opportunity to discuss trade related issues faced, if any, and establish contacts with the Trade Commissioner and his team by introducing your company products/services and exchange/share views for further development of trade, investment and tourism between Sri Lanka and New Zealand.
