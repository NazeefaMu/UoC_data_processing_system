Break free from the chain of consumerism

Let’s face it. We have become a nation of big spenders. Our already high ratio of household debt to income continues to grow year on year. For example, our nation’s credit card debt as at end of last year stood at Rs. 60 billion. Just five years ago, the corresponding figure was Rs. 30 billion. The increase of active cardholders during this period was 35%, but the total debt increased by 100%. In addition to the credit card debt, we have also been told that in the last five years, the total of the bank loans for consumer durables were experiencing considerable increases year on year.
This high household debt total is indicative of the fact that as individual citizens, we are inclined to spend money which we have not yet earned. We have adopted the modern global economic policy of consumerism.
Today, consumerism has already become the hallmark of our economy in spite of it goes against our ancient philosophical approach towards life. Consumption has become a more important source of self-identity and status than work for many people. And, they are willing to go into debt to achieve it. Consumption then has become an indicator of achievement.
“Consumerised” events
Business leaders use two techniques to power this excessive consumerism: planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence. In planned obsolescence, companies design products so that people will need or want to throw them out within a short period after they buy them. In perceived obsolescence, companies use advertisements and gimmicky new models to convince the consumer that they need the new model. It is the concept of “keeping up with the Joneses”.
Consumerism have now turned major life events like weddings and births into “consumerised” events with their own hierarchy of demands. For example, the bride's dress and accessories assumes far more significance than the bride's state of mind. Baby gifts take precedence over helping with the baby.
Recreation, too, has become commercialized. Branded leisure clothing, shoes and sporting equipment and attendance at expensive sporting events with corporate sponsorship are the manifestation of consumerism in recreation.
Millions of cans, bottles, plastic cartons, are thrown away each year. "Disposable" items exemplify this. Rather than compete on quality or reliability, products are made for a one time use. "Fun" is a catchword discarding notions of inherent value, longevity, and the environmental consequences.
What can we do about it
To move away from the web of consumerism, we will need a cultural shift in our society and its values. Perhaps the current financial crisis gives us the ideal opportunity to think about the direction in which we’re heading as a society, and to consider new ideas.
Sri Lanka has been shaped by neoliberal policies by successive regimes since the “open economy” reforms after 1977. Whether the neo-liberal economic philosophy applied in toto is suitable for Sri Lanka has now become questionable. This economic policy is based on the view that human beings are rational consumers seeking to maximise their share of available goods. All of the systems and institutions that we go through in life and the communications we receive in day-to-day life serve to promote lives that uphold this view - so it profoundly affects and moulds our world views.
However, we are not simply ‘rational consumers’ who want to maximise our share of goods – we are also human beings who need love, human touch, personal relationships, cooperation, nature and, above all, the ability to choose the lives we want. Neo-liberalism therefore leads to a system that fails to give us what we really need and forces us to live the lives we might not otherwise choose. It only promotes the restricted view of what a ‘good life’ consists of and doesn’t give us any opportunities to consider alternative views or ways of living. It also puts pressure on us to behave in particular ways or be particular people that may not be 'us' and this causes us stress and anxiety.
New economic policy
We need to move towards a society that has a much broader and refined view of what gives us well-being and happiness, and use the economic system simply as one of the means to achieve this end, rather than as an end in itself. We need to do all this within parameters of sustainability and social justice.
Therefore, we need a new economic policy that sees real choice as a key aspect of the good life. It should enable people to have real choices about the lives they want to lead, give them the skills they need to make those choices, and encourage them to pursue the lives they really want. It should include a basic level of material goods such as food, drink, shelter and money, plus non-material goods such as the life skills we need to be truly self-determined and live happily.
The new economic policy should also promote particular conditions that are felt to be conducive to human flourishing, such as stronger local communities, greater equality, education to promote well-being and the opportunity for children to grow without being exposed to external influences that they are not yet equipped to deal with. There should be regulations to ensure that we live within the resources of the planet and within some boundaries of social justice.
Defend ourselves
Even if a new economic path is adopted, the changes in society will not happen overnight. There are however some immediate steps we can each take in our own lives to release ourselves from the grip of consumerism, and to start living the lives we really want.
Firstly, we must be aware of how consumerism touches our lives and when people or organisations are trying to manipulate us. We must defend ourselves from unwanted external pressures. When we receive any message, whether it is in a social conversation, at work, in a newspaper, or on television, we must consider the source it came from and whether it might have a particular agenda. Then decide whether we can trust it and whether we should make any allowances for it in our interpretation of the message. We can then choose whether the message is to be digested or ignored.
Secondly, we must also take some time to stand back from our lives, away from external influences, and think about what really matters to us in our lives and how we want to live. Then, try to live the life we want, not the one that others would like us to lead. Many of us will find that reducing our levels of consumption, caring less about materialism and refocusing our attention and time towards things that really matter to us will eliminate a lot of problems in our lives and give us a great deal more satisfaction, whilst also leading to a more sustainable and fair future for all.
Policy matters
What Government policy agenda would help move Sri Lanka beyond consumerism
First, there are basic steps, that would help immensely: (1) eliminate wasteful subsidies and impose limits on emissions, toxics, and other residuals discharged to the environment; (2) insist on full-cost, honest prices, to protect our producers and workers from unfair foreign competition; (3) impose a surtax on high-end consumption spending along with various luxury taxes;(4) provide high-quality public services, infrastructure, and amenities; (5) move to much greater social and economic equality and security; (6) conduct educational and social marketing campaigns that not only provide accurate information to consumers but also address deeper issues such as the shortcomings of consumerism; (7) impose tight regulation on “easy credit,” predatory lending; and (8) promote initiatives to shift cultural norms that promote consumerism.
We also need to put advertising in its due place. A good start would be a ban on advertising to children under twelve years. We should also severely restrict out-of-home advertising, especially near schools. We must ban on highway billboards. We should make it unlawful to circulate mail-order catalogues except on request.
To ensure greater truthfulness and relevancy in advertising, a committee of each company’s directors should be required to attest to the accuracy and relevance of all claims in major ad campaigns, and accuracy and relevance should be closely policed by the appropriate Government agencies, with fines levied when appropriate. Television and radio should be required to make time available so that the public can challenge advertising pitches and commercialism generally.
Consumerism has affected our generation’s peace of mind and health, capacity to save and build future income, capacity to spend at will, capacity to pay lawful tax, capacity to get quality education and capacity to have a work-life balance. It is the price of consumerism that we pay every day, without realising what we have lost.
