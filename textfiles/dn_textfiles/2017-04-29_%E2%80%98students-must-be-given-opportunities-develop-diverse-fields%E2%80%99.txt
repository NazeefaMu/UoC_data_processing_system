‘Students must be given opportunities to develop in diverse fields’

Quality of education has to be improved while providing opportunities for the students to develop interests in diverse fields, Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chang Won-Sam said.
He was addressing the opening ceremony of Happy Children’s Centre in Dematagoda yesterday.
The centre was established with the financial assistance from the Hyundai Engineering and Constructions jointly with the Korea Food for the Hungry International (KFHI).
Won- Sam said the institution would help the children in need to fulfil their wishes and dreams. “Education is vital for the personal as well as economic developments of a country. Education and learning are the most important processes in today’s society,” he said.
Primary school education and evening classes will be conducted for underprivileged children for free of charge and it will be managed by the KFHI, he said.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction Representative Ha Wuk Jin and Colombo Municipal Council former member Roy Bogahawatte were present.
