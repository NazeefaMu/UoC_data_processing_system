Alternative water supply plans for Anuradhapura

Alternative water supply plans are under consideration if the drought continues further in the Anuradhapura District.
Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) sources said that it has been decided to purify Malwathuoya water to meet the drinking water needs of the city population.
The WSDB Anuradhapura Manager said the water level of the Nuwarawewa tank which is the main source to provide drinking water to the Anuradhapura city and the suburbs is remaining at 8 feet whereas the normal depth of the water level is 23 feet.
“If the present level has come down by about 1 foot, there would be difficulties in the purification process as the sediment and the other waste deposits in the tank mix with the water. He said in the past, when difficult situations arose, arrangements had been made to get water from Malwathu Oya via the Anuradhapura city,” the Manager said.
Arrangements are being made to get water from the Malwathuoya anicut close to the town up to the Nuwarawewa tank water purification plant through a pipe line to the length of about 3 kms. The project will cost around Rs. 10 million
Civil organisations and senior citizens in Anuradhapura said water stored in the Malwathuoya anicut is unclean. It is not advisable to use such water even after purification. They said as the upcountry is receiving rains, the authorities will take action to get Mahaweli water via Kalawewa to Nachchaduwa tank.
A spokesman for the WSDB said officials had submitted facts at the Mahaweli water control committee meeting to get at least 8,000 acre feet of Mahaweli water to Anuradhapura to increase the water levels of Nuwarawewa, Thuruvila and Tissawewa tanks which are the major water sources providing pipe borne drinking water to 300,000 people in the Anuradhapura city and the adjoining areas.
