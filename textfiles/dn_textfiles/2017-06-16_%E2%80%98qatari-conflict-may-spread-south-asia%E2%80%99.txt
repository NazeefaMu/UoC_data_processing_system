‘Qatari conflict may spread to South Asia’

The conflict between Qatar and Saudi Arabia could spread in the Sunni Islamic Organisation that leads Saudi Arabia, Iran and other adjoining countries later to the countries in South Asia, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
In a press release issued by the media Unit of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said that the minister made this observation to his Face Book web page.
The release said Saudi Arabia and three of its biggest allies Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain announced that they were severing diplomatic ties with Qatar and suspending air, land and sea travel to and from the country.
Minister Ranawaka said the the Arabic countries pointed out Qatar was backing radical Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS due to severing diplomatic relations. He said Arabic countries ordered banks operating in Qutar to freeze assets and bank accounts of the Qatar-linked 57 individuals and other entities.
Saudi Arabia has closed the border to Qatar which was the access way for 40 percent of the latter’s food requirement. He said those countries closed down the Al Jazeera which was operating from Qatar.
The minister said the USA was behind the scene.
