Champika demands urgent political solution to burning issues

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday demanded an urgent political solution to the burning issues of the country.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
Demanding clear and powerful government reforms, the Minister stressed the importance of working on a political plan for the burning issues of the country, including the SAITM issue, public servants’ salaries, drought, fertilizer issue and drinking water issue.
He said that the government should identify the key priorities that needed attention within the next 18 months, before implementing this plan.
“That plan should be implemented with the agreement of both parties of the government. It is also necessary to involve 50 young MPs of the UNP and 36 young MPs of SLFP in this plan,” he added. The JHU leader further stressed the necessity of uniting all member parties of the yahapalana government to fulfill the pledges made to the public during the 2018 election campaign, without boasting about their parties.
The Minister stressed the importance of identifying the weaknesses of the ‘good governance’ government and taking immediate measures to correct them, since the people of this country are disillusioned by the weaknesses of the government.
Minister Ranawaka further said that the local government election results clearly proved people’s dissatisfaction with the government.
JHU Co-Chairman Hedigalle Wimalasara, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana, Deputy Chairman Nirosha Athukorala and National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe also participated at the occasion.
