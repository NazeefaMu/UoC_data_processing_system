Secrets hidden among plants

Gardening is hardly a straightforward practice — goodness knows it takes skills, dedication and more than a little luck to grow flowers and veggies. But while certain facts about gardens are perplexing, some are just plain fun, silly, or even mind-boggling.
1. A sunflower is not just one flower.
Both the fuzzy brown center and the classic yellow petals are actually 1,000 – 2,000 individual flowers, held together on a single stalk.
2. There are more microorganisms in one teaspoon of soil than there are people on earth.
It is alive! That fact might make you itchy, but microbes are important for keeping your soil full of nutrients.
3. Plants really do respond to sound.
Studies have shown vibration (like music, or perhaps even the sweet sound of your voice) can affect plant growth.
4. Butterflies might be more attracted to your weeds than your flowers.
Colorful blooms aren't the chief reason these insects love your garden – it's more about the fragrance and nectar. New cultivars of popular flowers have been bred for enhanced colour and size, but have often lost their fragrance in the process. Everyday weeds like dandelions and clovers might actually be the most appealing things in your yard to butterflies. Taking care to choose heirloom flower seeds can get them to also fly your way.
5. A little baking soda can help you grow sweeter tomatoes.
A regular sprinkling of this kitchen staple into your plant's soil can help reduce acidity, which sweetens up your crop.
6. Some of your favorite fruits are actually in the rose family.
Apples, pears, peaches, cherries, raspberries, strawberries, and more are rosaceae, making them cousins to the long-stemmed Valentine's Day variety.
7. The right orchid combination can smell like your favorite dessert.
Did you know that the vanilla bean comes from an orchid varietal? And it's not the only sweet-smelling kind: "An oncidum hyrbrid called Sharry Baby smells like chocolate. The cymbidium Golden Elf smells lemony, and the phalaenopsis violacea has a cinnamon scent.
8. You don't need to be a dedicated composter to reap similar benefits.
Call it cheating, but applying used coffee grounds, eggshells, chopped-up banana peels, and other organic matter directly to your soil (no composting required) can offer plants nutrients as they decompose. For already-growing beds, scatter and bury the items within the first few inches of soil.
