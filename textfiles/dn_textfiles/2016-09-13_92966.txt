A Smorgasbord of Delicious Bites

From Grammy Award winning platinum records to Broadway, the West End and the silver screen, the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka’s annual Pops Concert presents a veritable smorgasbord of delightful music for the musical gourmand on September 24 and 25 at the Bishop’s College Auditorium.
Soundarie David RodrigoConductor Dushy Perera
Under the baton of Dushy Perera who debuted as conductor of the SOSL in 2012 and is also the Founder and Director of the Cantando Cello Ensemble and Guest Principal Cellist of the Bombay Chamber Orchestra, the concert will feature award winning musician, pianist, composer, musical director and arranger Soundarie David-Rodrigo as the soloist. Adding zest to the concert will be multiple award winning all female ensemble Soul Sounds and British trumpeters Sara Munns and Rebecca Spinks, both teachers who perform with various brass ensembles.
Take wing with the Eagles on Tour or a tribute to the soul searching lyrics of the pelvis gyrating blue suede shoes donning Elvis Presley, a walk down Abbey Street with John Lennon and even the smooth delectable flavours of Carlos Santana is what the SOSL presents in its delectable menu of gastronomic flavours.
Musical connoisseurs can indulge in some nights on Broadway, venturing onto the streets of West Side Story, dabble in the magic of Wicked and become a part of Biblical history with Jesus Christ Superstar. A host of box-office hits serve varied flavours creating sumptuous offerings that titillate the senses. Watch as the lights come on for, ‘The name’s Bond. James Bond’ as the orchestra runs through the years of 007, imagine a flying lesson with Harry Potter on a broomstick in the Harry Potter Symphonic Suite. Pursue the Dark Knight Rising aka Batman, the thrills and spills of Chicago and even a glimpse of Westeros, as the SOSL plays the theme from the Game of Thrones. But that’s not all – there’s Walt Disney’s Frozen, the Old West’s Magnificent Seven and the showy decadent battle scene in The Assault on Beautiful Gorky.
Tickets and box plan are available on tickets.lk or can be purchased from Sarasavi Bookshops in Nugegoda and Maharagama, Abans main showroom, tickets.lk office on Jawatte Gardens and Yamaha Music Center.
