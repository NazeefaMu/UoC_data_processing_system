Realistic 3D cat portraits

Japanese artist Wakuneco takes something as simple as wool and makes incredible hyper-realistic cat portraits.
The artist uses wool of various different colours and creates 3D portraits of cats using needle felting techniques. On her Instagram, the artist shared that it’s a very long and delicate work and it takes her about a month to complete one portrait, but the stunning result is worth the efforts.
