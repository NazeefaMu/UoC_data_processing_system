Mitra Innovation helps Northern Ireland’s Kraydel to launch at DigiHealth

Mitra Innovation, a UK and Sri Lankan based company specialising in SaaS technology platform incubation, digital transformation and Cloud-to-Cloud integration, has developed Northern Ireland’s Kraydel, to build their innovative new healthcare technology platform and launch it onto the market.
Early March was a milestone in Kraydel’s history and for Mitra Innovation when the service was launched to potential buyers at DigiHealth UK, in London. Kraydel is an innovative new assisted living service that enables elderly people to live independently in their own homes.
Using a smartphone app, a customised remote control, and a base station, Kraydel provides people with peace of mind that their elderly relatives are safe and well, by letting them know about their daily activity, the ambient temperature in their homes, whether they have taken their medication, and if they have a medical issue or emergency.
The service also provides elderly people with peace of mind that help is just a click away, if they get into any mobility or medical difficulties.
Mitra Innovation helped Kraydel develop the cloud-based technology behind the business, and program the platform.
The DigiHealth UK event was designed to encourage and advance the best practices in digital healthcare innovation as well as promoting the very latest opportunities in the health and social care sector.
Mitra Innovation were happy to help the Kraydel team showcase and demonstrate the new Kraydel platform to potential buyers at the event.
Mitra Innovation MD Dammika Ganegama said “We have been privileged to be a part of the technological build of Kraydel. It is an amazing new service that takes advantage of Cloud-to-Cloud integration technologies and the Internet of Things, and it fills a gap that enables elderly people to retain independence in their old age, and families to know that they’re safe and well. We have enjoyed assisting Kraydel on this project and we were delighted to help them launch it at DigiHealth UK.”
Paul Moorhead, CTO of Kraydel said: “The team at Mitra Innovation helped us develop a world-class Cloud-based platform. Launching the service at DigiHealth was a great experience.”
