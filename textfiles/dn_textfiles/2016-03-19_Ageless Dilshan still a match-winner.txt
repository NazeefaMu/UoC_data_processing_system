Ageless Dilshan still a match-winner

BANGALORE: Age it seems is no barrier for the ageless Tillakaratne Dilshan who at 39 is still good enough to win matches for his country.
Sri Lanka had to thank the cool head of Dilshan and the experience he brought to the middle to surpass Afghanistan's total of 153-7 as Sri Lanka opened their ICC World T20 campaign with a six wickets win with seven balls to spare.
Dilshan anchored the innings from one end to score a flawless unbeaten 83 off 56 balls and after receiving the man of the match award said, "If I am batting like this, I don't want to think of any retirement. I am enjoying my cricket. I haven't thought anything on those lines. If I get up in the morning and feel that I don't enjoy, I will retire. But as of now I am enjoying everything and I want to go on."
Such words will be like music to the ears of Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews whose struggling team is looking for some match winners to get their game on track.
"The main target is when you get a start you need to finish it. The seniors in every team need to step up and put their hands up and do a job. We have lot of young guys in the side. They can bat around the seniors and gain experience. It's much easier when you chase targets," said Dilshan.
"It was a good target. The wicket was a bit slow and not easy. We had played a practice game here before. It's not easy to play spin bowlers. Once I got the start, I wanted to go on. It's not easy when you are a new batsman to go out in the middle and strike the ball straight away. That's why I held up one end batted through. They batted well. We knew it wouldn't be an easy task. We thought of someone batting through the innings," he said.
One area where Dilshan stands supreme defying his age is his fielding. He is still the best fielder in the team and there is no hidden secret behind his success.
"I train a lot in that vital discipline of fielding. I work a lot with the fielding coaches. If I can contribute something on the field, I am really happy," said Dilshan.
"My attitude when I go to the field is that I want every ball to come my way. That helps me to keep the enthusiasm very high. I field at cover point and I take lot of pride in it.
I want to help the team through a run out or a half chance. I try to set high standards when it comes to fielding and I encourage others also to do well in field."
Sri Lanka certainly needs to raise their fielding standards after spilling three catches against Afghanistan and allowing them to go past a total in excess of 150.
Their next opponents are the West Indies on Sunday.
