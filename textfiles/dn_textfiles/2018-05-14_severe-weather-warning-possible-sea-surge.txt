The Meteorology Department issued a severe weather warning yesterday while predicting heavy falls above 100 mm in four provinces.

The Meteorology Department said a low level atmospheric disturbance is developing in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Met. Department also said coastal areas extending from Mannar to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle, may experience sea surges until May 15 due to effect of swell waves.

Showers or thunder showers will occur over most provinces of the island, particularly after 2 p.m.
Showers will occur in the Western and Southern Provinces and in the Puttalam district during the morning too.
Heavy falls, about 100 mm can be expected in some places, particularly in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva and Western Provinces and in the Polonnaruwa and Vauniya districts.
Misty conditions can be expected in some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thunder showers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimise possible damage caused by lightning activity.
