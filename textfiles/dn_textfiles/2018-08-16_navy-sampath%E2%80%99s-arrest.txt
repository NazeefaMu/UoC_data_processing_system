Navy Sampath’s arrest

Hettiarachchi Mudiyanselage Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, also known as ‘Navy Sampath’, wanted in connection with the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009, was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday.
The CID arrested him on Lotus Road, in Colombo, according to the Police Media Spokesman’s office. He was produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court where Colombo Additional Magistrate Kanchana N. Silva granted permission to the CID to detain him on a 48-hour detention order, for questioning.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court had earlier issued arrest warrants for the arrest of the suspect for evading magisterial inquiry into the alleged abduction and murder case.
It was revealed that the suspect had been in hiding and working as a guard officer under the name Polwattage Gallage Ashoka, using a fake National Identity Card. He had been working as a security guard attached to an estate in Dompe, prior to his arrest. The arrest had been made by the OIC of the CID’s Organised Crimes Unit, Inspector Nishantha Silva.
Six accused including former Lieutenant Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi who were indicted over the murder of former TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj had been acquitted and released in the case after they were found not guilty by the Colombo High Court. However, the state has now filed an appeal.
Navy Sampath, who previously served in the Sri Lanka Navy as a Lieutenant Commander, was wanted by the police in connection with the kidnapping for ransom, illegal detention and murder of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
The CID is currently investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths and several Navy personnel have been arrested in this connection, including the former Navy Spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake.
The CID is investigating the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths based on a written complaint by the then Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the DIG of the CID on May 28, 2009, against his personal security officer, then Lt. Commander Nilantha Sampath Munasinghe, following which the CID was able to uncover the Navy’s involvement in the abductions. Those abducted were Kasthuriarachchilage John Rit alias John, Rajiv Naganathan alias Malli, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Tillakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohomed Sajith, Jamamdeen Dilan, Amalan Leon, Roshan Leon, Antony Kasthuriarachchi, Thyagaraja Jegan and Mohomed Ali Anver alias Hajiya.
(Amalan Leon’s father, Stanley Leon, was also abducted in 2008 and is still missing. He had come to Colombo with his son and the foreigner Mike Ogan, to apply for a visa to the United Kingdom. They were staying at the Ramanadan Flats in Kotahena. On August 25, 2008, Amalan and Stanley were kidnapped by an unidentified armed group.)
The abduction
The CID had arrested retired Navy soldier Luthuwahandige Thushara Mendis on January 23 this year, in connection with the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008. He was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court on January 24 and ordered to be remanded.
According to the CID, Mendis had served as the senior Master Chief Petty Officer in the Special Intelligence unit headed by Lieutenant Commander Sumith Ranasinghe, and had been involved in the abduction of Ali Anver in Katunayake. Ali Anver was an informant for this intelligence group. Mendis had also been part of the Navy Special Intelligence team that had taken the eight abducted youths to ‘Gun Side’, located within the Ocean Science Faculty premises of the Naval Command in Trincomalee, from where they were being held at the Naval camp in Chaithya Road, Colombo Fort.
A CID source told the Daily News that Mendis had been in charge of a boat which was providing support to this Special Intelligence team, especially in the disposal of bodies. He had served under Ranasinghe from 2008 to 2009, attached to the Parakrama Naval base.
CID investigations revealed that on October 17, 2008, the intelligence team had obtained an open warrant and raided a house near the Dehiwela Police Station and arrested five youths, including Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohommed Jilan and Mohommed Saajith. The five youths were taken in their black Indigo car (KC 5565) and held at the ‘Pittu Bambuwa’ jail under Lt. Commander Hettiarachchi.
However, during the period from December 31, 2008, to the end of March 2009, one of the abducted youth, Rajiv Naganathan had been in contact with his parents Govindasamy Naganathan and Sarojini Naganathan. The Navy soldiers guarding these abducted youths had lent them their mobile phones for them to contact their families.
The CID sources said that Ali Anver had been the informant to this special Navy team, but he too disappeared in 2009. However, it was revealed during the investigations that in fact, Rajiv Naganathan had told his parents that Ali Anver had also been arrested and he was being beaten up. The five boys had been later taken to Trincomalee by Mendis and Ranasinghe.
Further, the Indigo car had been taken to Giriulla by Thammitage Dharmadasa and Aluthgedara Upul Bandara, who had also given evidence. The duo were residents of Giriulla. Several soldiers too had given evidence confirming the detention of these youths. The CID source also added that they had obtained evidence that the Indigo car had later been handed over to the former Navy Spokesman Commander Dassanayake.
An NIC found at Sampath Munasinghe’s official residence was found to belong to Thiyagaraja Jegan, who was from Trincomalee. Jegan, who was working at a jewellery shop in Colombo 13, went missing in 2008.
The CID was able to get much useful information regarding the abduction when communicators attached to the Sri Lankan Navy Signal Corps, Aluthgedara Upul Bandara and Lakshman Udaya Kumara, who were working under Sampath Munasinghe, were questioned.
A mother’s diary
According to police records, the abduction is said to have taken place on September 17, 2008.
Sarojini Naganathan, the mother of Rajiv Naganathan, had made several hurried notes in a diary during several secret phone conversations with her abducted son, that first makes mention of Dassanayake. While being held at Chaithya Road, a place locally known as ‘Pittu Bambuwa’ after his abduction, the CID says Naganathan, calling his mother through a borrowed phone, was able to identify those holding him captive, as his mother noted the details down. Presented to the courts as evidence after being handed over to the CID for investigation, Sarojini’s notes, quoting her son, mention that “Commander Dassanayake who is to be made Captain, is here.”
According to an investigating officer at the CID, these notes have helped investigators in uncovering details of Dassanayake’s alleged link to the supposed extortion racket and abductions carried out by a group of Naval officers at the time. In fact Rajiv, in a series of calls, was able to provide valuable information regarding his whereabouts and captors to his mother, which has now greatly contributed to the investigations.
Dassanayake who was working as the Deputy Director of Operations at the time, was far more involved in these abductions than just being there, as mentioned by Sarojini.
The CID claims that Dassanayake was in fact aware that several of the abducted persons were being held captive at the ‘Pittu Bambuwa’.
According to the CID source, yet another suspect in the case, Lt. Commander Sampath Munasinghe, in his statement to the CID, maintained that Dassanayake was made aware, particularly, about the presence of Amalan Lyon and Roshan Lyon at the ‘Pittu Bambuwa’ by him. The CID also claims that the Navy maintained files regarding the two, another fact known to Dassanayake.
Therefore, they say his knowledge regarding the captives led to his arrest under the charges of aiding and abetting the disappearance of the men.
Photographic evidence
Further to these facts and evidence presented in court, the CID says they are in possession of photographic evidence showing then Lt. Commander Sumith Ranasinghe, who was also arrested in connection with the case, along with Dassanayake and a number of sailors serving at ‘Gun Side’ in Trincomalee, where the abducted youth were said to have been last held, and two other intelligence officers working under Dassanayake. According to the CID source, Dassanayake is part of the group photograph, in his capacity as an officer with authority to oversee them.
Meanwhile, the CID was also able to reveal that complaints were made to the department regarding alleged attempts by Dassanayake to intimidate Naval officers speaking to the investigators. “Lt. Commander Welagedara and Sailor Upul Bandara complained to us of death threats made to them by him,” the source claimed.
Since the beginning of the CID investigations in 2009 to probe the disappearances, the CID, along with other related parties, is said to have faced various obstacles, including non-cooperation by the Navy, and other interferences.
However, for the parents of the abducted youths, the wait for information about their children has been gruelling. In fact it has been nine long years since Sarojini Naganathan last saw her only son, Rajiv. The latter, along with four others, was abducted on September 17, 2008, a day before he was scheduled to leave for the United Kingdom for higher studies. Rajiv was a lover of animals, cricket and a studious child, Sarojini says, adding that she prays daily for his return and for the capture of all the perpetrators. Despite having last heard from her son in May 2011, she holds on to the belief that Rajiv is still being held in an undisclosed location.
“My son is alive, but they are afraid to release him,” she says, adding that it is as if life has stopped since Rajiv was taken from them. “We spend our lives just waiting for our child to be returned to us.” Having suffered a fate worse than death, having lost her only child, Sarojini says she is now fearless.
“I will fight for justice and find my son in whichever way possible,” she says, adding that she is pained by the callous statements made about her child by certain individuals.
“My son was talented and educated, and would have served the country well if he was allowed to do his higher studies,” she says, questioning if such a gifted child could be an LTTE sympathiser. “They are spewing lies about these children” she says.
Ransom demand
Recalling the past, Sarojini says, she herself had withdrawn money on that day, to give her son.
“He wanted to treat his friends before leaving,” she says, adding that he had then left with his friends. Having spoken to anyone possible to secure the release of her son, she says, a man calling himself Annachchi had kept calling her asking for Rs. 10 million as ransom in order to release Rajiv.
The tip-off on the economic situation of Rajiv’s family, to demand a ransom, was given to Munasinghe by Anver Ali, alias ‘Haajiyar,’ who was in the intelligence service at the time. Anvar Ali is a resident of Dehiwala.
“We told him we will pay, but just return the child,” Sarojini says, adding that their pleas fell on deaf ears. Sarojini and her husband today continue to live in their family home visiting places of worship and the courts, focusing solely on the return of their son and justice for the wrong that was done to them. The mother of Thilakeshwaran, who was abducted along with Rajiv, passed away earlier this year, and Sarojini says the disappearance of her son greatly contributed to her failing health and eventual death.
The suffering and stress due to losing Rajiv too appears to have taken a toll on Sarojini and her husband. Despite failing health, the brave parents have vowed to fight for justice.
“I can barely walk, but I will go anywhere and do anything to get justice for my son,” she says, determinedly. However, according to Sarojini and attorney-at-law Achala Seneviratne representing the disappeared youths, more support is needed from the Attorney General’s Department and the other parties involved to ensure that justice is done.
Recalling the obstacles faced, Sarojini commended the CID for their tireless efforts, saying that she is thankful the case is now being heard by the courts regularly.
“My child did no wrong to anyone and all of them were just students,” she says, adding that due to her belief in God, she refuses to give up hope that one day she will once again see her son.
