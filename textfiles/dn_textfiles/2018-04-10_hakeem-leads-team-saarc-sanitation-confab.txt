Hakeem leads team to SAARC sanitation confab

City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem will lead a delegation of 35 Sri Lankans representing key stakeholders engaged in improving sanitation in Sri Lanka including government, civil society, donors, national experts and community organizations, to participate in the SACOSAN VII in Pakistan.
The conference will begin today and go on till April 14. Sri Lankan professionals will conduct a technical session on financing sanitation. The session will be chaired by Minister Hakeem during which four research papers on financing sanitation will be presented for discussion.
SACOSAN (South Asian Conference on Sanitation) is a government-led biennial convention held on a rotational basis in each SAARC country and provides a platform for interaction on sanitation. SACOSANs are intended to develop a regional agenda on sanitation, enabling learning from past experiences and setting actions for the future. The SACOSAN process is instrumental in generating the political will for better sanitation in the region.
Pakistan’s Climate Change Ministry has made arrangements to host the 7th South Asian Conference on Sanitation and it will be attended by governments of the SAARC regions along with the donor community, development partners, civil society, private sector, community-based organisations, researchers, professionals, schoolchildren and grassroots activists.
New challenges have emerged in the financing of sanitation with the commitment to achieve universal access to safely-managed sanitation under the Sustainable Development Goals. Investment decisions on sanitation have to depend on many factors as there is no clear picture on the existing situation unlike water supply.
On April 13, a ministerial summit with the participation of sector ministers of the SAARC region will be held to sign the Islamabad declaration on agreed commitments based on the outcomes of the conference deliberation over the previous three days.
The South Asian countries take every effort to implement the commitments made at the conference in the next few years until the next SACOSAN conference at which progress on implementation will be reviewed by all stakeholders.
Sanitation has become the most challenging social service priority in the South Asian region. One in three people worldwide lacks adequate sanitation facilities. The total population practising open defection in Asia exceeds 700 million. In 2003, South Asian countries met in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for the first-ever major conference on sanitation.
