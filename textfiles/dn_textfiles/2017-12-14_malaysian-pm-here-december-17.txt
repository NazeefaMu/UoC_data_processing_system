Malaysian PM here on December 17

Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on December 17, 2017, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson’s office yesterday confirmed.
Meanwhile, Malaysia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issuing a press release stated that the Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka His Excellency Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah, had been reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prior to this scheduled visit. “He is due to take up an important assignment related to Malaysia’s Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), to be held in April, 2020.
Given the scale of the CHOGM, which would involve 52 countries, early preparations are essential for it to be a success. Wan Zaidi performed the functions during Malaysia’s successful chairmanship of ASEAN 2015,” the press release said.
