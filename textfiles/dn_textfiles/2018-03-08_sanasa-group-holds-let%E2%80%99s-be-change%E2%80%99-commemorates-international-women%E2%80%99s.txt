SANASA group holds Let’s Be the Change’  to commemorates International Women’s Day

In conjunction with the International Women's Day, SANASA Group held a special program under the theme ‘Let’s be the Change’ at the ‘Navarangahala’, Royal College recently. Marking the beginning of a series of women-centered programs, plans are underway to implement a comprehensive islandwide awareness campaign encompassing the key drivers including women, children, family and the environment.
Chairperson of SDB bank Samadanie Kiriwandeniya expressed her views on the tremendous contribution made by SANASA Movement, an organization strongly backed by a majority of women, towards uplifting the living standards of the local women.
This year's commemoration of Women's Day has become quite special as women have earned a higher representation in local government areas. As SANASA Movement, we intend to collaborate with the new local government agents and implement a broad scale plan at regional level for the benefit of our women. This year's theme for Women's Day is ‘Let’s be the Change'.
SANASA Movement has made a tremendous contribution towards empowering women. Our movement is backed by 54% of women. For 40 long years, we have been able to provide a conducive environment to build a strong women's force as a result of inculcating entrepreneurship and income generating means among rural communities.
At this juncture, we believe women should act more intelligently and cautiously. It’s of utmost importance that a woman should identify the needs of her own as well as of her family. Gaining sufficient knowledge and discipline to meet essential needs, without falling into market gimmicks is a quintessential trait for a woman. In a matriarchal society, a family revolves around the mother of the household. Hence, it’s pivotal for a mother to properly manage the household tasks.
We feel that, when striving to improve our assets, we need to act based on a new vision. One of the major issues of the society is having a higher ‘Dependent Population’ in comparison to ‘Independent Population’. Instead of simply saving, this calls for a more pragmatic approach in improving assets. Therefore, it’s important to contemplate on utilizing the hard earned money for a successful investment. For example, if one wishes to target a sum of Rs. 10 million in Ten years, then it’s imperative to decide on a proper investment plan to follow in order to achieve the target.
SANASA Movement has given a prominent place for women, and also implements various programs including Uththamavi in order to appreciate their true values. Since ancient times, Sri Lankan women have been known to be courageous and wise.
