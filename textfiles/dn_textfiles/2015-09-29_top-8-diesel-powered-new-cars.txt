Top 8 Diesel-Powered New Cars

If you're interested in saving money at the pump, then you've come to the right place. We've listed eight excellent new cars (and two used alternatives) that offer diesel engines, so the cars on this list are able to squeeze more miles out of a gallon of fuel than a typical gasoline-powered vehicle. While it was once hard to find diesel fuel stations, diesel-powered cars -- and diesel pumps -- are becoming a lot more popular, meaning that you'll never have trouble filling up your new gas-saver.
Audi A3
The newly redesigned Audi A3 brings a compact car back to Audi's lineup after a short absence.
The latest A3 is a sedan, however, instead of a hatchback, but like the old model, it still offers two enticing engines: a sporty 4-cylinder and a frugal 2.0-liter diesel.
Jeep Grand Cherokee
Chevrolet Cruze
It's the diesel that especially catches our eye, as it touts 150 horsepower, a muscular 236 lb-ft of torque and an impressive fuel economy rating of 31 miles per gallon in the city and 43 mpg on the highway. Pricing is also reasonable, as the 5-passenger A3 2.0 TDI starts around $33,600 with shipping -- and there's even an all-wheel-drive option for shoppers in cold-weather climates.
BMW 3 Series
The entry-level 328d is now BMW's most affordable diesel-powered model, thanks to a starting price of around $39,800 with shipping.
Powered by a 180-hp 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine, the 328d may not seem especially muscular -- until you consider its brawny 280 lb-ft of torque. Don't think that the 328d doesn't conserve fuel, though: It offers gas mileage ratings as high as 32 mpg city/45 mpg hwy.
The 328d also boasts a wide range of standard equipment and safety features, along with impressive interior build quality. Best of all, it's offered in three forms: There's a rear-wheel-drive sedan for performance-minded drivers, an all-wheel-drive version for drivers who have to contend with snow and an all-wheel-drive wagon that adds a little more practicality to the model's lineup.
Chevrolet Cruze
Although the newly released Chevrolet Cruze Diesel may start at a lofty $25,900 with shipping, the frugal sedan actually offers impressive bang for your buck.
One reason is its powerplant: In addition to producing an adequate 151 hp, the Cruze Diesel boasts an excellent 27 mpg city/46 mpg hwy.
The Cruze Diesel also comes with an impressive array of standard equipment, including 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless access with a push-button starter, leather upholstery, heated front seats and Chevrolet MyLinkinfotainment system. Consider the Cruze Diesel to be an alternative toVolkswagen's popular Jetta TDI.
Jeep Grand Cherokee
Audi A3
Mercedes-Benz GLK
The recently updated Jeep Grand Cherokee has added a frugal 240-hp EcoDiesel engine to its powertrain lineup. Fuel economy is a strong suit, as the engine boasts up to 21 mpg city/30 mpg hwy -- an increase of 4 mpg city/6 mpg hwy over the gas-powered V6. Standard equipment is also a strong point, as all Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel models include a remote starter, a power lift gate, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and 18-in alloy wheels. Unfortunately, the Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel's biggest drawback is cost. At nearly $42,000 with shipping, the Jeep rivals some premium SUVs from luxury brands.
Still, we think that the Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel offers an excellent way to add a little fuel efficiency to the world of the midsize SUV.
Mercedes-Benz GLK
We like the idea of a fuel-efficient SUV, since it combines carlike gas mileage with SUV capabilities and added practicality.
That perfectly describes theGLK250 BlueTEC, which offers the same 2.1-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder as the E250 BlueTEC -- an engine that makes around 200 hp and a strapping 369 lb-ft of torque.
It also offers standard all-wheel drive and fuel economy that reaches as high as 24 mpg city/33 mpg hwy. Best of all, pricing isn't too high -- especially for a Mercedes-Benz. The GLK250 BlueTEC starts around $40,000 with shipping.
