Nine years’ RI for rape

A man who was found guilty of raping a woman whilst her husband had left for the night to guard over his paddy fields was sentenced to nine years’ rigorous imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 50,000 to the victim, by the North Central Province High Court Judge Mahesh Weeraman yesterday.
The accused is a resident of Medawewa, Kekirawa. The judge also ordered that the accused to pay a fine of Rs. 1,500 and if he failed to pay the fine, he would be sentenced to a further three months in prison with reduced labour.
In addition, the judge also ruled that if the accused failed to pay compensation to the woman, he would receive another year added to his original prison sentence. He further explained that if the accused failed to pay the fine and the compensation, he would have to serve the three month and extra year sentence separately.
On January 18, 2013, the 48-year-old woman living in Medawewa in the Kekirawa Police division was brutally sexually abused and raped. The Attorney General filed a case against the accused under Section 363 of the Penal Code before the Anuradhapura High Court.
The woman had lodged a complaint against the accused with the police who thereafter arrested him. He was 23 years old at the time and was married with two children. Preliminary hearings of the case were held at the Kekirawa Magistrate’s Court and the case was later transferred to the Anuradhapura High Court. The High Court Judge ruled that the charges against the accused have been proven beyond reasonable doubt and thus, he was sentenced to a nine-year prison sentence.
Attorney-at-law Lewke Bandara appeared on behalf of the accused, whilst attorney-at-law Dhammika Udawatte appeared for the Attorney General’s Department along with Sergeant M.H.M.J.B. Iriyagolla for the Kekirawa Police.
