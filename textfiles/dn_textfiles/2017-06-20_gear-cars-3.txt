Gear up for Cars 3

Cars 3 is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the eighteenth Pixar feature film and the third installment in the Cars film franchise, following Cars 2 (2011). It is directed by Brian Fee, a storyboard artist on Cars (2006) and Cars 2, and stars the voices of Owen Wilson, Cristela Alonzo, Chris Cooper, Armie Hammer, Larry the Cable Guy, Bonnie Hunt, Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington and Lea DeLaria.
Lightning McQueen sets out to prove to a new generation of racers that he’s still the best race car in the world. Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast new generation racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves.
Get ready for fun-filled ‘Cars 3’ which is a tribute to the Pixar characters who don’t need any introduction in order to make a huge impact on its audience.
Cars 3 is definitely the best film in the Cars series and the first to feel worthy of the Pixar label. It’s got more on its agenda than simply being about Lightning trying to win a race, and is the first Cars film likely to truly resonate with a larger audience beyond the kids who love it already.
Cars 3 screens at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm and 7.15 pm and on Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and on Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.
