Heart in the right place

Disabilities take many forms. Some of these disabilities are developed during childhood or at birth and are lifelong. Others may be developed in their teens or early adulthood and these too maybe lifelong. However one thing that is clear is survivingw these disabilities take strength and courage. And the truth is without parental support and parental love the prospects are bleak for these children. The courage and the strength to bear the pain and the strength to hope and to love are all part of the process of healing.
For some it is a permanent battle. Whichever way it is, parents play a vital and invaluable role in the lives of these children. Sunera Foundation is involved in a unique program to bring some relief to these parents through the arts.
“When a family has a disabled child and in some families there are more than one, it is the mother who suffers the most. The responsibility is entirely on the mother to bring up that child and look after that child. The mothers give a lot of love and care to the children plus they have to look after the other children. The mother takes the brunt of such a situation. Therefore the mothers are always under stress. They do not know what the future of the child would be when they are no more. They continue to live in that world. We have been for nearly 20 years working to enhance the lives of the disabled young people. That is fine and there have been very good results. But what about the mothers? So we came up with this idea fully supported by the mothers – why don’t they get together? This can be done through theatre – dance items and songs, a drama. Now they get a lot of joy doing that! So that is exactly what we are doing,” said Sunera Foundation, Chairperson, Sunethra Bandaranaike.
These parents get together and conceive of a plot for the theatre piece, discuss their movements, dance and music.
Highly productive
“Our trainers are very good at helping them. They can shake off their shyness, sadness and anxieties. That gives them a lot of joy. That is basically what we are doing. We want to give joy to the mothers. They are probably very good at certain things, they have never discovered it because they have never had the opportunity. Here it opens the door for them in a very private space to practice, joke and laugh enjoying the company of each other. We hope we can carry this to all the 36 workshops in the country over a period of time. Once this is a success, mothers of other children also will want to do the same thing. The trainers are of course very happy to train them. It is something new we are doing for mothers,” stated Bandaranaike
For everyone one involved this endeavor is highly productive and very fruitful. What one takes out of this experience will impact their lives.
“This is a very important program and I believe it is a first in Sri Lanka. We are concentrating on the parents of children with disabilities. We want to bring their creative talents onto the stage. So the pressure and the worry that they have been consumed with due to their love for their children is relieved. So that is the main purpose. Because of their children they have been carrying a certain weight in their hearts. So this provides them with the opportunity to release, ease their tension and enjoy themselves in the company of each other. Today we are rehearsing for a show that involves these parents acting and singing. This is basically harnessing their aesthetic talents for a show that will go on boards at S. De .S Jayasinghe Hall Dehiwala. It will commence on June 3 at 3.30pm. Up until now there is a participation of around 25 parents. Personally for me this has been an incredible experience, making a difference in the lives of these people and help release their pressure,” said Senior Trainer Sandun Bandara Dissanayake.
Sunera Foundation has workshops throughout Colombo – Maharagama, Dehiwala, Panadura and Horana etc. So the parents of these children will be participating in this show.
Remarkable improvement
“This is actually a kind of experiment. It may have its shortcomings but we have gathered all these parents and are attempting to do this show. So this is very much a journey united for these parents. The parents are showing a lot of interest but need more confidence as they have their trepidations. They are of the age range of 40 to 60 years. So they have their doubts concerning if they can perform well. But we assure them and strengthen them giving them confidence and make them positive. The themes of this play touches on parents becoming helpless and forgotten after their children start lives of their own. Some of these themes actually transpire in their lives because these parents are abandoned by their other children and are left alone to fend for the special needs child in the family. In addition to this they experience a lot of problems. So in the end all they have in the world are these special needs children,” explained Dissanayake.
Daily News also spoke to Indra Chandrasekera a mother with a child with disability.
“There is a remarkable improvement after brining my child to the workshop. My child was not afraid to go out into society after that. Because of the exposure she received from Sunera she has benefited. She cannot walk and is confined to a wheelchair but can speak very well. I feel this show is very useful and good. We are somewhat under pressure because of the constant care we give to our children. That is all gone when we act in this play.
It gives us a sense of normalcy like other people in society. Sunethra Foundation is doing us a great service. My child has come to a level of improvement that we could not even dream possible. Taking part in this show gives us all a sense of freedom as one family. We are one big family – us parents. The pressure is gone and our minds our blissful.”
Kumari Perera is another mother who is benefiting from this program. “My daughter Dulashi is affected by Autism and that is tough to deal with. Through acting in this program our tangled minds untangle, and we have a sense of detachment from our problems. In many ways we are alone with our problems. In a way as much as our children are disabled we too are in a form of bondage. When doing this show there is a release. Now however my child’s status is very positive and she has come a long way. When comparing now and the past there is a remarkable improvement. My child is very beautiful. Sunera Foundation has been indispensable in all of this. I take care of all my child’s needs.” 
We want to give joy to the mothers. They are probably very good at certain things, they have never discovered it because they have never had the opportunity. Here it opens the door for them in a very private space to practice, joke and laugh enjoying the company of each other. We hope we can carry this to all the 36 workshops in the country over a period of time.
