Dalugoda culvert in disrepair

The culvert at Dalugoda on Malimbada main road is on the verge of collapse. Motorists and pedestrians complain that they undergo severe difficulties when they cross the road.
Two heavy vehicles from opposite directions cannot pass the point.
The Southern Provincial Road Development Authority was informed to renovate the bridge but so far steps have not been taken to address the issue.
Residents say that they can reach Kadduwa, Malimbada, Kanburupitiya, Akuressa and many other destinations easily on this road. The Godagama Interchange of the Southern Expressway is also easily accessible from this side, the residents said.
