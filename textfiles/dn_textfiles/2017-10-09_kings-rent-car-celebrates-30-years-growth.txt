Kings Rent-A-Car celebrates 30 years of growth

 
Kings Rent-a-Car, a pioneering rent a car company in Sri Lanka, entered it’s thirtieth year this year.
Founded by Chairman, Titus Perera in 1987, the company today caters to a broad clientele which includes tourist, expatriates, locals and corporate, which include providing large fleet service to multinationals, blue chip organizations, SMEs, NGOs, and government institutions.
When operations began in 1985, the company was established as a partnership, but due to the rapid expansion of operations and market share, it was later incorporated as a limited liability company.
Kings Rent a Car was also a pioneer member in the formation of the RACA (Rent-A-Car Association) in Sri Lanka, which is today presided by Kishan Perera, acting as the president.
“Our clientele is quality conscious. We cater to clients who are looking for a value-added service rather than merely ‘rent a car’,” CEO and Managing Director, Kishan Perera says of the loyal clientele with strong customer retention of 70 percent.
“Nearly all our customers have been in partnership with us for a long term period. Our best form of marketing is simply the high caliber endorsements given by our existing customers.”
“We possess the versatility to be flexible, in order to tailor-make any type of package to our clients, based on their price and service requirements.”
“In this regard, we are well supported by the availability of our own workshop, in-house 24-hour road-side assistance service and dedicated customer-care executives who are on call right round the clock,” he said.
Kings Rent-a-Car provides an exceptionally friendly customer service, in adherence to its business etiquette that stresses on quality and professionalism.
Kishan Perera noted, ‘We want our organisation’s culture reflected to our customers through our staff.”
As a car rental firm dedicated to providing the best customer experience, Kings Rent-a-Car ensures that vehicles are maintained and serviced in-house, reducing the probability of breakdowns to near Zero levels.
