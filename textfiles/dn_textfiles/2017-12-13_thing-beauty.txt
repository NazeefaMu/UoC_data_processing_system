A thing of beauty

Over the years, the term beauty has given rise to many a concept of varying types. Once the great art critic, Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy, wrote a fascinating resourceful essay titled as Beauty is a state. He underlined several aspects of the concepts on the beauty that paved the way to observe several symbolic references to the literary and art concepts as laid down by great oriental thinkers, creators and aesthetes.
This also paved the way to bring out so far hidden meanings into the term beauty. The art critics had the added advantage of developing their outlook via the contents. It is recorded that one of the closest followers of Coomaraswamy’s thinking process had been the American scholar Susan Sontag, who also wrote a resourceful essay titled as beauty which appeared in several periodicals inclusive of Atlantis and Harper’s and most particularly in her widely praised collection of essays titled as On Photography (1976). Sontag in her essay beauty reveals her extraordinary ability to understand and interpret modern art with special reference to the concept of beauty as accepted and as alternative ways of perception.
Penetrative visions
In this essay, at the outset, she says that for Greeks beauty was a virtue: a kind of excellence. One of the most penetrative visions laid down by Sontag goes as follows.
If it did occur to the Greeks to distinguish between a person’s inside and outside, they still expected that inner beauty would be matched by the beauty of the other kind.
The ideology is developed as a comparison. For the young Athenians who gathered around the great teacher, Socrates, found it quite paradoxical that their hero was so intelligent, so brave, so honourable, and so seductive.
But Socrates was not a good looking person. One may have called him ugly, a term used against the term beauty. At one moment of his teaching, Plato the pupil records on what beauty is, and what ugly is. Can a physical appearance be termed as beautiful and ugly?
Sontag takes the cue from Socrates to analyse her concept of beauty. It is in the very inception, a pleasing term and used from the long past. Coming down the centuries, the analysis and interpretation of beauty have taken different trends. As Sontag points out: It was principally the influence of Christianity that deprived beauty of the central place it had in classical ideals of human excellence. By limiting excellence (virtus in Latin) to moral only, Christianity set beauty. Adrift, as an alienated arbitrary, superficial enchantment.
Beholder’s beauty
As such according to Sontag, beauty has continued to lose prestige.
The views held by Susan Sontag may sometimes sound as far searching and perhaps lay a controversy. Still, the question arises on what actually is the beauty. Does it not rest in the eyes of the beholder? Quite a number of proverbs emerge from the concept of beauty over the years. I had the chance of collecting a few for my own self-study.
1. Beauty is only skin deep.
2. Beauty is only one layer (Japanese proverb).
3. Beauty may have fair leaves, yet better fruit.
4. Beauty opens locked doors.
5. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder (a sentiment that has been traced back to the Greek poet Theocritus (3rd Century BC).
6. A thing of beauty if a joy forever (the first line of Keats’ poem Endymion.
Coming back to Sontag, a pretty good-looking woman is termed as a beauty. But when it comes to a man the term used is handsome. This is the masculine equivalent of beauty. But it is not only the terms that differ. But the concepts too differ from culture to culture. Extending the original meaning of beauty, the concepts are applied to paintings, poetry, and underlying conceptual meanings in aesthetics. The writing down of a beautiful phrase may evoke various communication meanings adduced to the changing concepts of beauty. The term belles lettre in French may mean beautiful writings.
Persuasive power
The privileges of beauty are immense, said the Cocteau the writer. On this matter, Sontag states that to be sure, beauty is a form of power, a persuasive power. It is not the power to do, but the power to attract. This power is not one that can be chosen freely.
In this manner, one can broaden the accepted and traditional patterns of meanings attributed to beauty and the underlying concepts linked. The changing meanings of beauty are traced. Inevitably, one is reminded of the age-old fairytale that goes as beauty and the beast that lurks in the canons of literature in many oriental and occidental cultures. The underlined theme is the transformation of a beast (or an ugly man) through the visionary beauty of a young girl who helps the beast showing the all-pervading kindness and compassion. The same theme is twisted in many a poem, drama and narratives in many ways. So the theme beauty is much more than a mere parable or a saying.
