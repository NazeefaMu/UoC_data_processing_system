Introduction to corporate debt investments

Fixed Income could be considered the most popular asset class among retail and institutional investors in Sri Lanka with Fixed Deposits being a very popular investment tool among investors.
However, corporate debt,although not very popular among Sri Lankan investors, is also an important segment within the fixed income asset class, which might be second only to Government Securities. Corporate debt instruments could be differentiated based on the characteristics of the type of each instrument.Following are some examples of the types of corporate debt instruments widely available for investors in Sri Lanka.
1. Bank and Finance company deposits (Savings accounts, Current accounts and Fixed Deposits)
2. Debentures.
3. Commercial Paper (Commercial Paper Repo is another instrument created from Commercial Papers).
4. Asset Backed Instruments and Securitisation.
5. Promissory Notes.
Despite the range of available corporate debt instruments, only few of the above are easily accessible to the retail investors. For example, majority of the retail investors are familiar and comfortable with investing in deposit products offered by banks and finance companies. Availability, convenience and less complexity of the products might be the main reasons for the popularity of such instruments. Moreover, lack of awareness of investors and general preference for investments which are short term in nature, could also be cited as reasons for the demand for bank and finance company deposits.
However, investors should consider alternative fixed income instruments for investment purposes as there are a few instruments which are useful for retail investors for increasing returns and providing diversification benefits.
Debentures are one of such instruments which retail investors could invest to improve their overall returns in the long term. However, it is important to understand the nature of debentures and how they vary in characteristics compared to the more popular and traditional deposit products available in the market.
A Debenture is essentially a loan taken by a company through the capital market. Corporates can raise money in the capital markets in two ways. One is the popular method of raising money by issuing stocks in the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The other alternative is to issue debentures. Stocks are equity instruments and when an investor purchases a stock he essentially becomes a part owner of the company. When an investor purchases a debenture he is lending to the company and becomes a creditor or debt holder of the company.
Debentures are widely available for investments for retail investors with a CDS account. However, there are a few important characteristics to be considered before investing in a debenture. Debentures are long term in nature compared to deposit products available in the market. Thus, investors should evaluate their ability to hold to maturity of a long term investment such as a debenture.
As debentures are listed instruments, technically, an investor could trade and liquidate the investment in the market. However, market prices are subject to change and depend on many factors including demand and supply and other factors such as market interest rates which uniquely affect debenture prices. Therefore, investors should evaluate the investment taking to consideration their ability to hold the instrument till maturity.
As an investor in a debenture is essentially giving a loan to the company and he is entitled to receive interest on that loan. In market terminology the loan interest is referred to as coupons and there are different types of debentures available in the market depending on the basis of the coupon paid.
1. In most debentures the coupon rate would be fixed and will be paid based at promised intervals (monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually)
2. Some debentures carry Floating rate coupons where the coupon rate changes with market interest rates. If interest rates in the market are going up, investors would receive higher cash flows from these types of debentures and vice versa.
3. In Zero coupon debentures a coupon is not paid until it matures. The investment will accrue interest during the tenure of the debenture, however, will not be paid to the investor till maturity.
There are several factors investors should consider when deciding to invest in a debenture. If the investor requires regular cash flows for day to day necessities, they should opt for a debenture with frequent coupon payments such as monthly or quarterly. If funds are invested in debentures with semiannual or annual coupons, the investor may run in to cash flow management issues during the period of the debenture. However, if the investor's main objective of investing in the debenture is returns, he or she should consider the semiannual, annual or zero coupon options.
When trying to maximize returns, investors should always keep in mind the reinvestment risk of the coupon payments of the debentures. At the time a debenture is issued in the market, the prospectus and other marketing material for the debenture may indicate the interest rate of the debenture and the annual effective rate of the debenture (AER). It is important to note that AER is arrived at by assuming the cash flows will be reinvested at the same rate, which is extremely rare in real life of investing.
For example, if a debenture offers an interest rate of 12.60% semiannual coupons, the AER of the debenture would be 13%. If an investor invests Rs. 100,000.00 in a debenture, he would receive Rs. 6,300.00 every 6 months. However, if this coupon of Rs. 6,300.00 is not reinvested at 12.60%, the AER of the debenture would be different (higher if the reinvestment rate is higher than 12.60% and lower if the reinvestment rate is less than 12.60%).
The following example illustrates the actual effective rate an investor would receive from a Rs. 100,000 investment in a debenture paying a 12.60% p.a. coupon semi annually, depending on the market interest rates prevailing at the time the coupon is received. In this debenture each coupon payment an investor would receive is Rs. 6,300 (12.6% x Rs. 100,000 / 2).
Assume the following are the maturity value of the investment of the coupon payment of Rs. 6,300.00 at three different rates, 12.60%, 11.00% and 13.50%.
The main advantage for individual investors from a fixed rate debenture is the consistency of the interest rate for a longer tenure compared to the bank and finance company deposits. The short term nature of the deposit products offered in the market means the interest rates would be reset more frequently at the maturity of each deposit.
Finally, an investor should take into consideration the risk of their investment. Debentures are long term investments and investors should consider the ability of the borrower to pay back.
The long term nature of the debentures itself increases the risk of the investment compared to the short term investments.
The series of events that could trigger during the period of the instruments (macroeconomic and/or issuer specific) might be more, compared to short term investments. Therefore, in addition to the return, investors should understand the quality of the issuer and the kind of risk they are willing to take before investing in a debenture of a corporate.
Investors should not invest in a debenture below their risk appetite, irrespective of the interest rate offered. And an investor should not invest in a debenture if they cannot afford to hold to maturity (unless they are willing take the risk of interest rate and market volatility).
The rating of the debenture would give investors a good idea of the riskiness of the investment and should be an important consideration in their investment decision making process.
