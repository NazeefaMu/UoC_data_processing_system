Majority of Matale schools in deplorable state

The majority of government schools in the Matale district are currently in a deplorable state due to the lack of proper security arrangements.
At present, there are nearly 300 schools functioning in the district, while most of them lack fences or walls. Stray cattle are often seen entering school premises, damaging their properties. Further, vandals had also trespassed on several occasions.
Further, the schools also lack hostel facilities and hence, staffers urge the relevant authorities to take immediate steps to resolve the matter.
