Faiszer happy with Delimitation Committee report

Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Faiszer Musthapha said he was satisfied with the highly controversial Delimitation Committee report and believed it to be ‘fair to all’. Amendments to the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act of No 21 of 2012 however are yet to be made and though the minister believes that this can be done soon, it will further delay the local government elections expected this year.
Excerpts follow:
Q: What is happening to the Delimitation Committee report?
A: The report has been to be gazetted. We are on track and I have given a report which is fair to all, compared to the original report which was biassed and arbitrarily done to the whims and fancies of Basil Rajapaksa.
He did that without consulting the political leadership of the country.
Q: Minister to be clear, were there any changes made to Asoka Peiris’s report?
A: No. There were no changes made to that report. I don’t usually interfere with committees. They had the free mandate to work on it.
Q: When will the elections be held?
A: Very soon
Q: So the date has not been decided yet?
A: I have done my task and the rest is with the Elections Commissioner. There are a few more issues that I need to solve or steps that I have to take like gazetting the number of members for each local body. And also there are some technical amendments that need to bring to the act no. 21 of 2012.
Q: How long will it take to make changes to the Act?
A: I think it will take less than a month. The amendments can be made and passed within a very short time. We have passed certain mile stones and have a few more to achieve.
Q: Has money been allocated for the Local Government elections?
A: I don’t think this government will deprive the elections of funds. It will go through Cabinet and Parliament will allocate. The government is not going to do anything that would disrupt the franchise.
Q: What is your opinion on allegations that Asoka Peiris was put under heavy pressure? The JVP has said there is no freedom for a government servant to execute his duties fairly?
A: Everybody can say what they want and that is politics. Unlike in the past, if you say what you like to say, you are not penalized today. There is freedom for all. You can demonstrate, you can protest and you can speak against the government. People are enjoying unprecedented freedom under President Maithripala Sirisena.
Q: What is your opinion on the gap between the Centre and the Periphery?
A: Yes there is a big gap between the Centre and the periphery. A chief Ministers forum has been organized by the Ministry and I hope to discuss all the related problems in full there.
