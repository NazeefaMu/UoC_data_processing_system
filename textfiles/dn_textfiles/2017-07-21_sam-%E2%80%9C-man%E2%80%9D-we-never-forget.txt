Sam “The Man” - we never forget!

Colombo – 1957,a boy who had just left school was asked to play the Saxophone for Leonard Franke’s band “The Manhattans.” He never looked back. Music was to become his life for the next sixty years. It took him from the Royal Albert Hall in London to the United States, Salzburg-Austria, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Zambia, The Middle-East, India, Pakistan and Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
The importance of being Nihal Samarasinghe, popularly known as ‘Sam the Man,’is more than being an “icon of the Sri Lanka English popular music scene.”A man like Sam had to be around for sixty years in post-independent Sri Lanka, to lead us confidently in singing the songs of the dominant global culture. As a nation, competing in international arenas with our own dialect of Sri Lankan English, with its own Sri Lankan English linguistic diction, he had to be there.
Men like Sam were the pioneer builders of that popular self-confidence of Sri Lanka as an English speaking nation, singing the popular songs of the English speaking world, anywhere in the world. He earned the accolade ‘King’ of the Sing Along, having introduced the first Sing Along Concert in Sri Lanka in 1997, together with the Y’s men of Sri Lanka.
Sixty years after he left S.Thomas’ for a career in music, he was laid to rest on Sunday, July 16 2017. His old school in Mount Lavinia in a rare gesture of condolence lowered the school flag to half-mast. It was perhaps the first time that S.Thomas’ College had honoured an old boy for his music, in this manner. When he was taken away from his home at 50 Hotel Road, Mount Lavina after a simple Buddhist ceremony, college prefects sang the college song before his casket, and carried him away.
He played his Saxophone and sang his songs in his eightieth year in life. That was the beauty of his existence. He leaves behind powerful memories of how he gave brave and beautiful expression to his songs. Those who performed with him with “The Jetliners” in the 1960’s and later with his own “Sam the Man and his Gaylord’s” have said of Sam, “music had an unexplainable fascination for Sam, the chords coloured his life” describing him as “a man with an inimitable style of performing.”
His music of the night which reverberated from the sanctums of the Old Thomians’ Swimming Club, leaves behind the echoes of the “ Tennessee Waltz,” “Beyond the Reef,” “Stranger on the Shore,” “My Way,” “It’s only a paper Moon,” “Marie the Dawn is Breaking” to the moments of sunset at the Terrace of the Mount Lavinia Hotel with “Red sails in the Sunset,” “South of the Border,” “I’ll take you home again Kathleen” or the evenings at the Harbour Room of the Grand Oriental Hotel in Fort with “He’ll have to go,” “Moonlight and Roses,” “Banks of the Ohio,” to “Darling how can you forget so soon.”
This was his flamboyant life style for six decades. Sam the Man with his Saxophone and his songs which brought happiness and left memories of great moments to hundreds in Sri Lanka and overseas, as one of Sri Lanka’s true international entertainers.
There was also a routine disciplined lifestyle of “Sam the Man” in Mount Lavinia. He derived his strength from the simplicity of his life style which enabled him to sing along to his eightieth year. On Sunday mornings he used to walk to the Sunday fair at the Mount Lavinia junction looking for herbs, a fascinating “organic” collection that turns up at the stalls of small vendors, to make his nectar for healthy living. Then three or four times a week he used to walk to the S.Thomas’Swimming Pool, for the swims he used to relish.
Away from the glamour of the lights of the many evenings of his life, he knew how to live his life in relaxed comfort. Of course Sam and his wife Felicia were bestowed with a home in one of the few remaining gardens on Hotel Road. Their son Nuwan is pursuing his own career in computer engineering, and his own interest in music in the United States.
It was in that tiny world of the men’s changing room of the S.Thomas’swimming pool that he used to hold sway. His conversation with a few of us, the regulars who hardly knew much about music, turned into a fascinating exercise. He enlightened us from the history of Jazz and its New Orleans days, to popular English country music, and the issues in creating good taste in western music and song, in Sri Lanka.
He was trying to tell us we have never belonged outside the global home; we all cannot but share with others across the world. They were contained in the iconic nature of some of those songs of the international popular English music scene, he sang for us in Sri Lanka.
In the evening of his life “Sam the Man,” “the icon of our club” left with us a picture of a man who has led a meaningful, productive and disciplined life in the Sri Lanka popular English music scene.
