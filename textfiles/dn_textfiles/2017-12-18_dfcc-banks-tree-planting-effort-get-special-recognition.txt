DFCC Banks tree-planting effort  get special recognition

DFCC Bank embarked on far-reaching tree planting sustainability measures during the current year which have been commended by Reforest Sri Lanka, with whom the Bank collaborated to plant endemic and native species of trees.
A non-profit society committed to protect and extend the forest cover in Sri Lanka, Reforest Sri Lanka has specifically mentioned the extensive commitment of funds and volunteers that DFCC Bank has committed to this cause.
This project was conducted as part of the commemorative staff tree-planting campaign launched this year to reforest key areas across the island, whilst giving back to society at large. In this campaign, a tree is planted to celebrate each and every staff member’s birthday for which they receive a personalized invitation to attend the tree-planting campaign with their families.
An e-tree-dedication certificate providing the link to the exact location on Google maps where the tree was planted is sent to them. All staff members are also invited to attend these campaigns and are encouraged to participate with their families.

In 2017 eleven tree planting campaigns were held under this initiative in places such as Aranayake, Kaduwela, Jaffna, Duplication Road, Thalawila, Athurugiriya, Kahathuduwa, Beddagana, Bellanwila and Batticaloa. A total of 7,355 trees were planted during the year, out of which approximately 1,700 trees were planted to commemorate staff birthdays. Most of these campaigns were carried out with Reforest Sri Lanka.
Trees planted in these campaigns included, Mee, Kumbuk, Karanda, Gammalu, Kos/Jackfruit, Veera, Ehala, Rath Handun, Sudu Handun, Hora, Ranawara, Atamba, Wara, Olinda and many other endemic and native species. The trees will help to improve soil quality in the areas and minimize soil erosion, whilst returning much-needed oxygen to the environment.
DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva, commented, “DFCC Bank has demonstrated its corporate stewardship through various sustainable actions and this tree planting initiative is yet another way for us to make a tangible difference to society and the environment. Planting over 7000 trees would not have been possible without the support of Reforest Sri Lanka and the management and staff of DFCC Bank, who participated wholeheartedly in this project.”
“By involving families of staff members in this initiative, we are shaping a strong consciousness of the need to green our nation, which I hope they will carry forward. We plan to expand this initiative by planting additional trees at locations where reforestation is a priority. We are also gratified by the fact that apart from our tree planting efforts, Reforest Sri Lanka has also acknowledged DFCC’s support for major solar powered initiatives in the country. DFCC Bank has emerged as a pioneer financier in all renewable energy projects undertaken by the private sector in Sri Lanka.”
