HNB partners SL Customs for real-time duty payments

HNB, Sri Lanka’s largest private sector bank now offers its retail and corporate customers real-time, customs duty payment facility with Sri Lanka Customs.
HNB customers can now avail themselves of the streamlined approach of the online payment platform to pay customs duty and other payments.
The facility is enabled through LankaClear and can be used by any HNB Internet or mobile banking customer.
HNB Head of Electronic Delivery Channels Mangala Wickramasinghe says, “We at HNB are glad to make possible the seamless, electronic payment facility which would provide great convenience to our Corporate as well as Retail customers.”
Wickramasinghe went on to note, “The tie up with Sri Lanka Customs and LankaClear for the e-payment solution will make redundant the complicated paperwork and lots of running around associated with this process, thus providing the freedom and convenience to make remittances as seamlessly as possible”.
HNB is certified as a pilot operator for the e-payment solution.
