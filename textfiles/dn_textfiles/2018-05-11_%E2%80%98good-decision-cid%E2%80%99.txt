Summons issued to BBC journalist withdrawn:
‘Good decision by CID’

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has withdrawn summons issued to BBC journalist Azzam Ameen to appear before it to make a statement over a tweet.
It was a good decision taken by the CID to ensure media freedom, said the Minister.
He was responding a question by a journalist at the media conference held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
“He was not summoned as a suspect but as a witness to record a statement,” said the Minister.
Ameen had re-tweeted: “You are a wonderful speaker. But how do you ensure they turn into action. Show by doing!” Advice to President Sirisena from his own @PMDNewsGov”.
Azzam Ameen was asked to appear before the CID after he re-tweeted a tweet which appeared on the official twitter account of the President’s Media Division. The President’s Media Division claims that they have not tweeted it.
“We are very much aware of some incidents of cyber terrorism. So the government will conduct an investigation with regard to this incident in order to find the source of this tweet,” said the Minister. Responding to a question, Director General of Information Sudarshana Gunaratne said the original tweet is not available and that they have the re-tweet only as evidence for further investigations.
The CID recorded statements from officers attached to the PMD.
The Government Information Department intervened in this issue to ensure media freedom, he said.
The Director General asked journalists to inform of any issue faced by journalists, claiming that safeguarding journalists and ensuring their freedom of expression is the policy of the government.
