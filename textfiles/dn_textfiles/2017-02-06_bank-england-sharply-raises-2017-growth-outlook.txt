Bank of England sharply raises 2017 growth outlook

The Bank of England has made another dramatic rise in its growth forecast for this year.
It expects the economy to grow 2% in 2017, up from a November forecast of 1.4%, which was itself an upgrade from the 0.8% forecast made in August.
The Bank also made a striking forecast about the savings rate, which it expects to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since the early 1960s.
As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.25%.
The raised growth forecast follows much criticism levelled at the Bank for being too gloomy when it drastically cut its growth forecast after June’s vote in favour of Brexit.
“Domestic demand has been stronger than expected in the past few months, and there have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the committee had anticipated following the referendum,” the Bank said in its latest Quarterly Inflation Report.
The Bank said the latest, improved forecast was partly the result of higher spending and investment contained in Chancellor Philip Hammond’s Autumn Statement.
It also credited stronger growth in the US and Europe, rising stock markets and the greater availability of credit for households, for its more optimistic outlook for the UK
economy.
However, the Bank still sees the economy slowing in 2018, when it expects growth of 1.6%.
It blames that deceleration on an expected slowdown in spending by households as they adjust to higher inflation. The Bank thinks that income growth, when adjusted for inflation, will stall in 2017.
It predicts “a significant fall in the saving ratio over the next three years as consumers take time to adjust spending growth to weaker income flows”. The savings rate is expected to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since records began in the early 1960s.
The erosion in consumer spending power is partly down to higher consumer price inflation, which the Bank forecasts running at 2% this year, slightly higher than its previous forecast of 1.8% made in November.
Much of that inflation is the result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive.
The pound is still about 16% below the level seen before the referendum. In recent months it has fallen below $1.21 against the dollar, but has bounced off those lows.
The Bank expects the weakness in the pound to propel inflation higher and it expects inflation of 2.7% next year, which is well above its target rate of 2%. BBC News
