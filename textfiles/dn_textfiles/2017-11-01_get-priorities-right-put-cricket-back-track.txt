Get priorities right to put cricket back on track

Sri Lanka cricket clearly needs to get its priorities right especially in the fifty-over one-day format if the team wants to make an impact at the next Cricket World Cup in England 2019 let alone think about winning it, which at this stage seems a far cry away and only a distant dream.
Sri Lanka’s sudden dip in form especially in their batting unit is something hard to explain and there doesn’t seem to be a solution to how they can come out of the rut they have fallen into and is hurting them grievously.
Cricketers have come and gone over the years since Sri Lanka first played in the World Cup in 1975 but never have they experienced such a low depth in the batting, which has always been their forte even during the early years as a Test-playing nation. At the time it was the lack of international experience that proved a setback to our cricket until the arrival of Dav Whatmore as head coach of the national team. From 1995 the country’s cricket scaled the heights it has never reached before and remained so for the next two decades until after the 2015 World Cup when the dip in fortunes started to take place.
Sri Lanka has won only two bilateral ODI series (v West Indies and Ireland) out of 11 since then and apart from winning the tri-series in Zimbabwe that also included West Indies; they have failed to get beyond the first round of the ICC Champions Trophy.
To add more salt to the already festering wound they have suffered three 5-0 whitewashes this year alone at the hands of South Africa, India and Pakistan – so low has the country’s cricket sunk that it needs a Messiah to come and save it from total degradation.
Sri Lanka’s cricketing stocks has never been so low in the batting department where we have produced some of the greatest players ever to grace the cricket field. Sri Lanka maybe hit by injuries to Angelo Mathews, Kusal Perera and Asela Gunaratne that have weakened the middle order batting, but are we so famished of batsmen that we cannot find suitable replacements for them?
The fault lies with the school system as well as the domestic club system – both of which have been diluted to the point that we are no longer producing the quality batsmen and bowlers we used to in the past. The club system as we are made to understand has been diluted by increasing the number of clubs from 14 to 24 to strengthen the vote base of the administration that is in power, and the schools system where the controlling body for the sport - the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association has no control on the number of matches a school plays for a season which has resulted in several schools playing as many as 20 or more matches, some against schools that are hardly competitive. As a result scoring 1000 runs and capturing over 50 wickets in a season has now become a very common feature compared to the past where batsmen got to the 1000-run mark playing only 10 matches or less.
When Graham Ford arrived as coach for a second term he said that there were no quick fixes to Sri Lanka’s present problems of team building and that it would be years before Sri Lanka becomes a top cricketing nation again. He saw his role as a long-term facilitator of the rebuilding process. The lack of short-term results prompted SLC to appoint a new coaching and management staff that led to loss of faith and the eventual resignation of Ford.
Since the series against Zimbabwe, SLC has been saddled with Nic Pothas whose credentials as head coach is a far cry when compared to those who had held that position before. A first-class cricketer Pothas’ previous experience at coaching before he took up the role of fielding coach of the Sri Lanka team was being appointed the first director of cricket of Guernsey, an island in the English Channel. To Pothas’ credit it must be said he has done an exceptional job in uplifting the team’s fielding standards to the level where it is competing with other countries today. But whether he has the know-how and is qualified to hold the position of head coach to take Sri Lanka cricket forward is a matter of conjecture. Pothas is among the five who have applied for the permanent post of head coach which SLC will decide before the end of the year.
Sri Lanka also needs to look hard at the one-day captaincy. Upul Tharanga will come under scrutiny as all three whitewashes Sri Lanka has suffered this year have been under his captaincy. Tharanga is also facing the danger of a lengthy suspension for slow over-rate. During the last five months, he has been suspended twice for slow over-rate offences and another transgression will see him banned for six games. Tharanga seems to be a laid back captain who does not have the charisma or the drive to get the best out of his players. At the moment Sri Lanka is in dire need of someone to fit the bill, but the cupboard looks rather bare.
Dinesh Chandimal led the Test team from the front to beat Pakistan 2-0 and overcome the defeats suffered at the hands of India, a feat which the one-day and T20 teams failed to achieve.
Currently the national team seems to be starved a good leaders and good batsmen. Where is the country’s cricket heading?
It is normally the bounden duty of the administration that is currently in power to uplift the cricketing standards of the country by finding solutions to the problems that are affecting the nation’s beloved sport. In that aspect the Sumathipala administration faces a tough challenge to extract the country’s cricket from its present predicament, a challenge which he has not faced in his previous three times as president.
