Growing Roses in Containers

Growing roses in containers is a lot like growing them in your garden bed. The same keys to healthy roses apply: sun, great soil, fertilization, ample air circulation and consistent watering.
Selecting Roses
Choose varieties that are more compact and disease resistant
Climbing roses and large shrub roses are better suited for the garden bed unless you have room for very large planters and trellises
Why grow roses in containers?
Container grown roses are an easy addition to a patio or deck
When placed on casters, containers are easy to move roses in containers.
Ease of Access
Place container roses by a door or open window to enjoy their fragrance
Eliminates the need to bend and stoop in the garden to deadhead spent blooms, remove diseased foliage and keep the soil clear of debris
Watering and Feeding
Growing roses in containers does require a bit more diligence when it comes to watering and fertilizing.
Containers dry out more quickly than garden beds
The smaller the container the more quickly the soil will become dry
Water container roses at last once a day (early morning and evening hours are best)
When the soil is dry just under the surface, your roses need more watering
The extra watering container roses require leaches nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in a garden. Container grown roses may need feeding every two weeks or weekly with a diluted solution of fertilizer.
Re-potting
As the roses grow, increase the size of the container, or simply cut back the plant and its roots to maintain a smaller size
Refresh potting soil every few years
Winter Protection
Where frost and freezing temperatures occur, protect container grown roses in the garden shed or basement
If garden space allows, plant the roses, container and all, in the garden and top dress with mulch
