It’s showtime!

Most films featured in the films have already travelled in many other film festivals. Kshitij, 28 and Serga Mathang are few such special attractions. 
No matter how far the palm-held device has invaded our territory, the dark cinema hall continues to hold that special allure. With an unsealed paper bag of popcorn in hand, the fans slowly escape into the genre of their choice: action, thriller, horror, war, drama, epic and so on. That massive wide screen has kept the movie aficionados on the edge of the seat. That has never been replaceable.
The movie aficionados now have that once in a year opportunity to a cinematic indulgence with the SAARC Film Festival. With the input from eight countries of the organisation, the festival will commence on May 22 and last till May 26, for the eighth consecutive time at the Tharangani Cinema Hall as a collaboration of the National Film Corporation and the SAARC Cultural Centre.
Cultural imagination
The centre has forwarded a formal invitation to nominate films from each member state: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The festival hosts the cinematic works that display the cinematic imagination and the cultural expression of the South Asian Region with dramatic and diverse award-winning submissions from the SAARC Member States.
According to SAARC Cultural Centre Deputy Director (Programmes) Kishani Jayasinghe, the SAARC Film Festival is the most successful programme organised by the SAARC Cultural Centre. The festival hosts three categories of films: feature, short and master. The master films are the ones specifically nominated by the designated countries. The Centre has no involvement n the selection process.
The Festival will screen a minimum of 26 films with entrance free of charge. A masterclass will also be held in the middle of the festival with the participation of international experts on cinema. 
Master class
In addition to the films being screened throughout the festival, a master class will also be held by three international experts on cinema: Paolo Bertolin, Han Sunhee and Amable Tikoy Aguiluz. They will offer their choice at the SAARC Film Awards Ceremony on May 27 at the National Film Corporation.
Dr Soumya Chavan, a visiting researcher, maintained that film festivals are an integral part of any culture.
“Each film is a must watch. They offer knowledge and culture of the particular country. In India, film festivals are quite a popular element. About 1500 films are produced this year. And that has led the way to grand festivals.”
Festival Consultant Danushka Gunatilaka offered insights on the role of producers. Although the role is confined to someone investing money in Sri Lanka, the producer has a wider role in the international platform. Most festivals bank on excellent producers. Of all the films, Wasanthe Obeysekara’s ‘Aganthukaya’ is the only 35-mm film.
Most films featured in the films have already travelled in many other film festivals. Kshitij, 28 and Serga Mathang are few such special attractions.
SAARC Cultural Centre Director Wasanthe Kotuwella emphasised on the need to have training workshops for budding filmmakers of Sri Lanka with the resource people from the member states. Kotuwella indicated that the festival will be held in remote areas the next time.
