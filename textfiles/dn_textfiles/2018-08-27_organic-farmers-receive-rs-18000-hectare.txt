Organic farmers to receive Rs. 18,000 per hectare

The Agriculture Ministry will provide farmers with Rs. 18,000 per hectare to buy organic fertiliser for the upcoming Maha season to encourage them in organic farming,
Minister Amaraweera was participating in an event yesterday (26) to reap the harvest of a three-acre organic paddy cultivation at Yakagala, Angunakolapelessa.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said his Ministry has already drafted the Cabinet Memorandum in this regard.
“Paddy cultivating farmers using chemical fertilisers are given a Rs. 500 subsidy for urea fertiliser and Rs. 1,500 for other cultivation. No government has given any subsidy for the farmers in the organic farming so far,” the Minister said.
“Scientists of the Agriculture Department tested soil and proved that there are enough Phosphorus and Potassium in the soil in many areas of the country. “Applying too much of chemical fertiliser to the cultivations is useless,” the Minister said. He commended Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and others for promoting organic fertiliser usage. Sri Lanka has about 5,000 organic paddy farmers now.
