Politics is infected with Dengue and Garbage

The whirligig of politics has brought to the fore two matters of health and social management that poses many threats both to governance and the lives of people. A country and people that defeated the major threat of terrorism is today faced with the dual threats of dengue and garbage, moving away from the rivalry of party politics to the major issue of competent and capable governance.
The disastrous floods in the past month certainly contributed to the wider spread of dengue, which problem is made worse by the new strain of the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti and its new breeding grounds. The situation is more serious with the overall failure of successive governments to come up with effective waste management, and the contribution that uncleared waste and a dirty environment makes to the further spread of dengue. The situation is such that facing up to the threat that society is faced by dengue and poor garbage disposal has emerged as the major political issue before the government, accepting the situation as a major threat to social organisation, in fact displaying the nature of a war waged by the weapons of deadly infection and environmental pollution.
The government shows signs it is moving fast to face the new and wider threat of dengue. The relief given to people by the reduction of the cost of blood tests is most welcome. But it has to face the larger issue of overcrowding in both government and private hospitals. It will have to look at expanding facilities to handle dengue patients in state hospitals, looking at it as an emergency move, seeing whether there are any unused areas in state hospitals that can be converted for dengue treatment. The Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila, which is faced with a vast number of dengue patients, (I am personally aware of the fight the medical and nursing staff there carry out with limited facilities) could possibly benefit if a newly constructed wing that is unoccupied for some time, possibly for another purpose, is swiftly converted for the treatment of dengue. There may be other places too, where necessary and speedy changes could help combat the rising tide of dengue.
Image of politicians
The fight against dengue is an opportunity for politicians, especially in government, with some commitment of service to the people, to break the image of politicians being those who exploit and live upon the people, to show a difference in service to seriously fight this major health hazard. There is much that genuine politicians could do to bring about good public awareness of the fight against dengue, by community participation in anti-dengue activity that is not any media hype. This opportunity is also available to politicians in the opposition. It would be good for the politicians of today to look back at how the politicians of the past, even before the country gained independence, fought against the British rulers and also made major contributions to the fight against malaria.
The government will of course have to face the constant criticism that the blame for the current situation on dengue and garbage is due to the continued delay in holding the Local Government elections. However much that is denied, and with whatever “evidence” to suit the government’s position, the public certainly has the impression that the absence of functioning local authorities are part of, if not entirely, the cause of these problems today. As the fight against dengue takes a more serious strand, it would be best if the government takes steps to hold the Local Government polls, and not make any further excuse for its delay. Whatever the political outcome of the LG Polls, it will produce local politicians who will have to be active in carrying on the fight against both dengue and garbage, whatever their political colours may be.
As the Ministry of Health takes many measures to bring better life and meaning to the fight against dengue, it gained a major publicity advantage against the GMOA and the Inter University Students (that crawls behind the GMOA) in the clash between the students who broke into the Ministry of Health, against Court orders, as well as against the normal laws of trespass, with the Police, that saw both students and police injured. The sudden one-day token strike by the GMOA, the very next day in protest at the police action against the students, made a huge mockery of the GMOA’s claims of service to the people. That token strike took place when most state hospitals are teeming with dengue patients; and the death toll from dengue is rising.
This certainly gave President Sirisena the opportunity to make a statement in support of private sector or public-private participation in the training of doctors, and not leave it as a monopoly of the state universities, which unquestionably helps richer students who are able to go abroad for medical education and training, with no GMOA or Inter University Students protesting. The President’s statement was timely, even though delayed in the context of the long drawn out SAITM issue.
Politics of garbage
While Health is on what could be the verge of a national emergency due to the spread of dengue, garbage is creating much more than mere ripples of politics. The garbage dumps in the cities may be cleared with special action initiated by the Prime Minister or any other political authority, but the larger issue of provincial and local government inaction or failure in action, remains a reality, with the results extending to the Central Government.
There is little purpose in trying to use the garbage issue to gain political advantage by blaming the previous government for inaction. The reality is that two or more of the previous governments and the present government too, have been wholly inactive, and wrongly functional in handling this matter, or often evading action in what is certainly no easy task. An observer of the recent Grenfell Tower fire disaster in London, UK referred to it as “corporate manslaughter”. It would not be wrong for the Meethotamulla disaster to be described as governance manslaughter - by central, provincial and local authorities. It is difficult for those who try to pass the blame to the previous government, to get themselves a clean sheet on this, because most of those who try to pass such blame were holding ministerial positions in that government.
Statements by the Colombo Municipal Council that it had only 50 garbage trucks and those also old, and not having enough staff for garbage clearing and handling, is hardly the stuff the public needs to hear as the garbage issue gets worse each day.
There is a clear demand for very clear and firm political action on a commitment to enable this country handle its garbage in the most modern and scientific way available, with the maximum use of local resources and any foreign assistance to carry out the work.
The cartoon in The Island (22nd) titled “People ready to segregate garbage” had an impactful drawing of people ready to remove the “segregated political garbage” from the Parliament. That reflects the public feeling on the garbage issue, especially when local authorities and ministers state that the best way to get rid of garbage is to segregate it. If so, why not give the public the means to segregate their domestic garbage? Is it so very difficult, especially for politicians and senior bureaucrats who spend so much time abroad to see how garbage is segregated and removed in all the western capitals of this world?
As the garbage issue gets more closely involved with the spread of dengue, the politicians and government too will certainly have to be ready to provide the best answers to the issue of garbage handling – with the proper scientific approach on the subject and the necessary environmental protection. Going back to 40 year proposals by foreigners may be interesting, but why not look at the more modern approaches that deal with the current situations?
Unless an effective political leap is done over the rising garbage issue, governance will be trapped in the continuing muck of a garbage crisis.
Northern calm
Calm has been restored in the politics of the North. The motion of No Confidence against Chief Minister Wigneswaran has been removed, and some understanding has been reached between the TNA and Sampanthan and Chief Minister Wigneswaran.
The situation that arose after the Chief Minister decided to take disciplinary action against four ministers who had allegations of corruption and fraud against them, has moved away from crisis, but the situation gives a new indication of the politics in the North. It is now clear that the public in the North is prepared to move into mass action on issues of politics and provincial governance, of course involving key personalities, as in this case. One hopes that this readiness to act will also be seen on matters of development and social progress in the North, where much is still needed to be done.
