Navy in hard fought win

Navy Sports Club team scored a hard fought 36 points (5 tries, 4 conversions, 1 penalty) to 28 (4 tries, 4 conversions) win over fighting Police Sports Club outfit in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club knock-out rugby quarter final match played at Race Course grounds yesterday.
The winners led 17 points to 14 at half time. After being contained in the first half the Navy ‘eight’ came up with a sterling display in the second half to outplay their counterparts in the loose. Hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe was a source of inspiration to his team-mates with his fiery loose play and capped a fine performance by scoring two tries.
For the winning Navy SC team the five tries were scored by hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe (two), prop forward Charith Silva (one), scrum half Harsha Maduranga (one) and full back Thilina Weerasinghe (one), while the four conversions and the solitary penalty were fired across by full back Weerasinghe.
For the losing Police the four tries were scored by full back Suranga Kasun (two), flanker Wajid Fawmy (one) and replacement number eight Kavinda Jayasundara (one) with former Peterite captain and fly half Sandesh Jayawickrama putting over all four conversions.
