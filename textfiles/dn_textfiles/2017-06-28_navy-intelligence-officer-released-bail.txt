Navy Intelligence Officer released on bail

Abductions in Colombo in 2009:
Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy Camp held in remand custody for allegedly abducting a resident of Kotahena in 2009, was yesterday released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
The suspect was released on a bail of Rs.40,000 with two sureties of Rs.500,000 by the Colombo Additional Magistrate.
Taking into consideration a revision application filed by the suspect, the Colombo High Court ordered to release the suspect on bail.
The CID had informed court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and cut into 72 pieces.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into abductions of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan on the instructions of the IGP, following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID also informed court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their basic human rights.
