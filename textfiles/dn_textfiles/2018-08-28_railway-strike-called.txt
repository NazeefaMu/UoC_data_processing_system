Railway strike called off

A planned railway strike which was supposed to come into effect from Midnight tomorrow has been called off following a fruitful discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena, sources said.
Railway authorities were planning to stage the strike citing that disussions with the Salaries Commission failed as it did not address their demands.
