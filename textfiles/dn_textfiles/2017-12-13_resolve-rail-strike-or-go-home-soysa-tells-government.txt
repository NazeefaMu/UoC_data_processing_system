Resolve rail strike or go home, Soysa tells government

The Lanka Sama Samaja Party’s Deputy Secretary Anil de Soysa said yesterday, that the government should intervene immediately to resolve the prevailing railway strike since last week causing great inconvenience to the public.
The fact that it had not been resolved so far, was that the government was a failure,” he added.
We urge the government to provide a permanent solution to the problem without placing unnecessary burdens on the public or else to go home,” he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said that there were indications that other sections of society too would join the strike which would cripple the day to day lives of the people. The train strike had already caused severe difficulties to students sitting the G.C.E. O/L Examination.
Whenever a UNP government was ruling the country, there were communal unrest as well as workers’ struggles. Therefore, we urge the government to resolve this problem or to go home.
Commenting on the forthcoming Local Government election, he said the LSSP would work towards the victory of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
But, if our party did not receive sufficient a quota in certain areas where we were strong, we would field an independent candidate or we will contest under ender the LSSP symbol of the Key. Anyway, discussions
are underway at present to come to a final decision in this regard.
Meanwhile, the LSSP would conduct its 82nd Anniversary Convention at the Negombo Town Hall on December 17, under the theme of chasing out this anti-people government. He said the government had failed in providing job opportunities to the youth. During the last two and half years, not even a single industrial zone had been set up even though many pledges were given to the people during the election.
