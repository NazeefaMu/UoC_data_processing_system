Beginning of golden stretch for young and ruthless South Africa ?

There are certain seismic moments when it feels a shift at the top of cricket's landscape is unfurling before our eyes. In 1995, an injury-plagued Australia brought down the West Indies reign with a surprising series victory in the Caribbean, which also proved the breakout tour for legendary paceman Glenn McGrath. It started an utter domination of international cricket for Australia, which lasted until about 2008 when South Africa conquered their demons and won Down Under. Perhaps not quite as obviously dominant as their inimitable predecessors, the Proteas nonetheless were undoubtedly cricket's best team over the next five or six years.
In the last couple of years, the Test landscape has felt decidedly open with teams seemingly dominant in their creature comforts but rudderless abroad. Accordingly, the No. 1 world ranking has repeatedly hanged hands but the mantle has felt fraudulent because none of the recipients have been particularly good. In other words, there hasn't been a definitive ‘best Test team’ since South Africa started to spiral after losing legendary duo Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith a couple of years ago.
Sliding down the rankings after comprehensively losing in India and suffering a shock series loss to England at home, South Africa were largely written off ahead of their Australian tour despite the hosts struggling abroad across the formats. Having now won their third consecutive Test series in Australia, a feat last achieved by the West Indies circa 1984-93, this unheralded team astonishingly achieved arguably two of South Africa's finest ever Test victories - in consecutive matches.
South Africa's comeback victory in Perth was achieved through sheer grit and plenty of heart, made the more incredible after losing spearhead Dale Steyn early in the contest. Neil Manthorp, South Africa's broadcasting doyen, rated it arguably their finest victory since readmission.
While that win was a grinding and resolute performance, which absolutely showcased South Africa's inherent characteristics, their innings and 80 runs evisceration of Australia in the second Test in Hobart was ruthless. It almost jarring seeing South Africa steam-roll through a dishevelled Australian team.
Marked by innate pragmatism, South Africa's philosophy has generally revolved around grinding teams into submission. At the post-Test press conference, man-of-the match Kyle Abbott hinted at this ingrained approach.
“We always talk about winning in the last afternoon (of the Test) and taking it deep.... (it's about) being patient,” he said.
In Hobart, South Africa sealed the series in effectively less than seven sessions due to the entirety of the second day being washed out with rain.
Australia's batsmen were abominable but South Africa's probing trio of pacemen deserve plenty of plaudits. Abbott, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada scarcely bowled a bad delivery and ensured Australia's batsmen - who aren't nearly as feeble as they have shown - couldn't muster any confidence..
Australia were humiliatingly bowled out for 85 on the opening morning and then suffered another indignity by losing 8 for 32 in 19 overs early on the fourth morning. The bereft batsmen were clueless and sinking further into the abyss but, impressively, South Africa put their foot down and grinded Australia into the Hobart dirt. Their brutal approach was reminiscent of Australia's halcyon days under Steve Waugh or the West Indies’ heyday.
Notably, South Africa displayed a killer instinct that was often missing even during their highly successful periods under Graeme Smith. Excitingly, South Africa has achieved this series victory through their precocious youngsters. Without Steyn and injured captain AB de Villiers, it felt like South Africa would have to heavily rely on veterans Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis and Vernon Philander. But that hasn't been necessary as South Africa's youngsters have impressively emerged in spades.Their batting has decidedly more depth than Amla and du Plessis, with Dean Elgar, Temba Bavuma and brilliant wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock shining thus far this series.
That trio ensures South Africa has a solid backbone in pivotal areas of the batting order, which looked so tentative on paper ahead of the series.
There was plenty of hype surrounding Rabada ahead of this series and the 21-year-old hasn't disappointed. Rabada has showcased sheer pace and hostility - as evidenced by a withering spell on the fourth morning to effectively end the second Test - but, perhaps most impressively, he has demonstrated maturity beyond his years by being far more consistent and probing than Australia imagined pre-series.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj was barely required in Hobart but showed enough ticker in Perth to suggest a long career awaits. All of this bodes well for them in the long-term and suggests South Africa is moulding into the next Test superpower.
Perhaps these victories will be the beginning of a golden stretch for South Africa. They seemingly have the requisite personnel and temperament to conjure something special. Abbott, who claimed 6 for 77 in Australia's second innings to prove a worthy replacement for Steyn, said South Africa have worked hard at creating a new culture following their malaise. “The last four or five months we drew a line in the sand and it is up to us to start a new culture,” he said. “Our values are totally different to 18 months ago... but we've set down our goals and what we stand for. We walk it and talk it every day and that's how you turn it around.” Du Plessis labelled the victory as one of South Africa's best ever achievements. “We know this is something we will forever remember,” he said. “That is exactly what we came here to do, to create memories.”
The skipper said South Africa was keen to become the first team to whitewash Australia in a Test series on their home soil. “That's the mission, we want to do that badly (achieve the whitewash),” he said. “We have got Australia in a position where they are under pressure and we don't want to let it go.
“(We must) stay nice and humble, for us as a team we want to go to special places,” du Plessis said.
