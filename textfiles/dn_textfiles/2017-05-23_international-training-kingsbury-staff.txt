International training for Kingsbury staff

A key aspect of The Kingsbury's human resource strategy is its continuous and investment towards training and development to instill world class quality service delivery.
In order to achieve that The Kingsbury had partnered with the prestigious William Angliss Institute, Australia, to raise the benchmark in the Sri Lankan hospitality sector.
William Angliss Institute is Australia's largest specialist centre for food, tourism, hospitality and events training.
The Institute operates nationally and internationally, delivering industry-focused training from half day programmes through to four-year degrees.
The Kingsbury's five-star standards are maintained through rigorous and regular skill upgrades aligned with international hospitality best practices.
This is achieved through a comprehensive training calendar especially designed to incorporate new skill requirements as well as revision and upgrades of competencies of its staff members. Specialist trainers from the William Angliss Institute are conducting a customised training programme for The Kingsbury. The programme spans over a course of seven weeks and sees each employee receiving 56 hours of training.
The courses are designed to push the boundaries and improve all standards, challenge mindsets and encourage multiskilling among The Kingsbury staff.
The programme particularly focuses on the food and beverage division and covers areas such as interpersonal skills, communication, guest relations, selling techniques, cocktail making, wine and wine service, silver service and much more.
As a result of the training and development, staff members at The Kingsbury are able to better perform their roles and meet and exceed customer expectations.
In an industry where service delivery and customer satisfaction is paramount, The Kingsbury has taken great strides as a class leading ambassador of Sri Lankan hospitality.
