DFCC Bank launches staff tree-planting initiative

DFCC Bank recently launched a commemorative staff tree-planting initiative where a tree is planted to celebrate each and every staff member’s birthday. Additional trees are also planted at key sites, where reforestation is a priority and these programmes are carried out in collaboration with Reforest Lanka, a non-profit society committed to the protection and extension of forest cover in Sri Lanka.
Staff members whose birthdays are celebrated each month receive a personalised invitation to attend the tree-planting campaign. They also receive an e-tree dedication certificate after the tree planting campaign which provides the link to find the exact location of the planted tree on Google Maps.
In January alone, DFCC Bank planted a total of 960 trees in Aranayake, 160 of which were planted to commemorate staff birthdays in January. Furthermore, to coincide with Independence Day celebrations, a further 1,000 trees were planted alongside the Kaduwela - Kadawatha Highway, out of which 100 seedlings were planted in commemoration of staff birthdays in February. In addition, DFCC Bank will plant 1,000 trees at the University of Jaffna during the latter part of February.
These tree-planting programmes were attended by staff members and their families, as well as members of the local community, who came together to support the Bank’s initiative. “I would like to extend my congratulations to the DFCC Sustainability Unit and the entire team for successfully launching this initiative. In a short period of time, we have planted approximately 2,000 trees and actively engaged team members at every level of our organisation. This initiative has helped to instil a greater commitment towards protecting the planet and operating as a responsible corporate citizen internally which is in line with one of our core values; being socially responsible,” states CEO - DFCC Bank Arjun Fernando in a press release.
