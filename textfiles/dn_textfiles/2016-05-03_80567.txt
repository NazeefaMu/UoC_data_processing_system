Speaker calls for report on Parliament clash

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday assigned Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikkilanathan to hold an investigation into yesterday’s brawl in Parliament and submit a report
of the investigations immediately. He added that upon receipt of the report, he would take action against the MPs responsible for the incident.
Speaker Jayasuriya made these observations in Parliament soon after sittings resumed after the MPs resorted to fisticuffs over the reduction of security provided to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Speaker condemned the conduct of MPs who exchanged blows in the Well of Parliament.
He added that when this unfortunate incident that affected the dignity and esteem of Parliament took place, there were large number of people including schoolchildren in the public gallery.
“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to a question raised by Dinesh Gunawardena on the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa,” the Speaker said. “The Prime Minister invited Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka who had a expert knowledge on security matters, to further explain the matter.” He said that when Field Marshal Fonseka was explaining the matter a group of MPs entered the Well creating unrest and that led to ugly incidents where some MPs exchanged blows.
“Thereafter I suspended sittings and convened a meeting of the Parliamentary Affairs Working Committee to discuss this incident,” the Speaker said. “All members of the committee unanimously condemned the incident”. The Speaker said that he instructed the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of Committees to investigate the incident and submit a report immediately.
“Upon the receipt of that report I would take action against the MPs responsible for the incident. As you all know I have taken an initiative to introduce a Code of Conduct for MPs and informed you of that initiative during the last parliament session,” the Speaker said. “I have received reports that one MP has been hospitalised and several others were injured in this incident.”
