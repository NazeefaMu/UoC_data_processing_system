Citizens' Mail

Keep our nation clean
Almost all the newspapers are blasting on the hot issue, presently, regarding the garbage menace and its disposal in our country. However, the media howl that people are still more ignorant and negligent and not at all serious about the seriousness of the matter by themselves.
They fail to realise the utmost annihilation of the country on a long run. I have noticed the plethora of times many an individual blindly throw polythene bags, lunch sheets, plastic bottles, cans after drinking juice or soda, food wastages, cigarette butts etc on streets.
The worst part of it is spitting on the middle of roads which is an intolerable scene. Especially betel chewers and others do not bother whether the people are on the way. When they spit out while they are riding bicycle, motorbike, or driving the bus, the saliva will be spotted over the body/dress because of the wind blow, on the commuters travelling or walking behind and along the paths.
This is the ugliest and unhygienic practice that I have always seen and faced personally in my day-to-day journey. These are the main factors for spreading non-communicable diseases. Top of all, it is sad to say, even our educated people too, exercise such mean ways. This clearly indicates that, in general, people of our country have less concern about their surroundings. The skills like protecting and beautifying our environment, our nation and valuing human beings should be practised from everyone’s early childhood.
Such mannerisms and dexterity cannot be earned overnight.
As the proverb says, charity begins at home. Every single moral practice and etiquette should be moulded and trained by parents at home, then from the teachers of schools at the very beginning stage of life. The tender age is prominently easier to inculcate the good habits as actions speak louder than words. If the elders set an example for the younger generation rather than preaching or teaching they would follow their steps.
All in all, each and every citizen of the country must have the bounden duty to protect and keep their own nation clean. A watched pot never boils. Likewise, just reading these incidents as interesting news and speaking plainly about Meethottamulla garbage catastrophe throughout the year would never end, until the words wheel into motion and deeds.
