Mel Gibson returns to Oscars

Mel Gibson staged a major Hollywood comeback with his World War II drama ‘Hacksaw Ridge’ bagging a surprise six nominations, signaling that the industry has finally forgiven the actor-director for his many controversies including his infamous anti-Semitic.
The 61-year-old blue-eyed actor, who created an impressive filmography as an actor by starring in action franchise ‘Lethal Weapon’, ‘What Women Want’ and ‘Mad Max’, easily morphed into one of the most talented directors in Hollywood by helming critically-acclaimed films like ‘Bravheart’, ‘The Passion of the Christ’ and ‘Apocalypto’.
However, it all came crashing down with Gibson’s DUI arrest in 2006, during which he unleashed a drunken tirade capped with anti-Semitic comments against the police officer.
He was later sentenced to three years probation. Many saw the rants as a potential career suicide for the actor but that was followed by another embarrassment on the personal front when his abusive phone call to ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva became public.
Gibson was barred from going near Grigorieva or their daughter by a restraining order, and later plead no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge. He apologised for his anti-Semitic rant and found support in many in the industry as he starred in ‘Beaver’, a small-budget drama directed by Jodie Foster.
His latest directorial venture ‘Hacksaw Ridge’ tells the story of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and how he saved 75 people during the Battle of Okinawa. It has racked up six total nominations best picture, best director, best actor (Andrew Garfield), film editing, sound mixing, and sound editing.
‘Hacksaw Ridge’ is Gibson’s fifth directorial effort, following ‘The Man Without a Face,’ ‘Braveheart,’ ‘The Passion of the Christ’ and ‘Apocalypto.’ The Hollywood Reporter
