CID gets more time in Ravi’s false  evidence case

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday gave more time for the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit their written submissions.
This is regarding investigations against MP Ravi Karunanayake for allegedly providing false evidence before the Presidential Commission of inquiry appointed to investigate into the Treasury bond issue on August 20, 2016.
Earlier, the Colombo Chief Magistrate temporarily suspended all the orders given on the requests made by Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama regarding this incident.
When the case was called, the Senior State Counsel appearing on behalf of the CID informed the Magistrate that they need more time to make their written submissions. On a previous occasion, SSC Girihagama pleaded permission to obtain several documents related to Global Transportation and Logistics Company.
The magistrate ordered counsel to submit their written submissions before September 28.
