Raids on illegal distilleries to be carried out countrywide

A number of sudden raids have been planned to be carried out countrywide to crack down manufacturers of illegal liquor. All steps would be taken soon to launch a well-planned programme to conduct raids on illegal liquor and kasippu manufacturers.
"We have now only 31 officers for this purpose of conducting illegal liquor racketeers and more officers would be recruited when and where it is required to expand the net of raids countrywide and this new plan would pave the way for the government to collect more revenue too, while discouraging the liquor-addicts,” said newly-appointed Commissioner General of Excise Department K. Helon A. Meegasmulla when she was contacted by the Daily News in Kurunegala on Tuesday.
