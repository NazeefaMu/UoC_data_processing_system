Try Marmite pasta!

Nigella Lawson, national treasure and culinary powerhouse, is forever causing commotion with her quirky recipes.
Who can forget the time she upset pasta aficionados by putting cream in carbonara? Or when she put an egg on a leaf and called it a Caesar salad. No bad thing, just lacking in ingredients. Purests were ‘livid’.
Not that she would mind. Nigella has always proudly called herself a home cook – never a chef. Her repertoire focuses on food that’s accessible, but that impresses at dinner parties.
Today, Nigella shared one of her more unusual and divisive dishes: Marmite pasta.
Nigella first published her ‘Spaghetti with Marmite’ recipe in 2009. She starts by melting the yeast extract with butter, before running it through fresh pasta with that important ladle-full of the salted pasta water to amalgamate. A heady grating of Parmesan completes the dish.
Nigella claims she’s not yet found a child who isn’t keen. Considering a vast proportion of the nation hates Marmite, we imagine there might be a handful. For Marmite fans, the meal is apparently dreamy.
Thismummycooks said: “Was sceptical about this recipe but one day in the early stages of pregnancy when I was too tired to cook a normal meal, I tried Marmite spaghetti and oh my goodness, what a treat! Still cook it as my go-to quick fix supper”.
Sunita added: “I’ve made this and it’s so tasty”.
Nigella discovered the recipe in Anna Del Conte’s memoirs, Risotto with Nettles. Del Conte was a prolific food writer, and helped the English discover Italian food is more than bolognese and pizza. And yes, she’s Italian. Marmite?
“I know the combination of pasta and Marmite sounds odd to the point of unfeasibility,” Nigella writes.
“But wait a moment, there is a traditional day-after-the-roast pasta dish, in which spaghetti is tossed in stock, and I have eaten shortcut versions of this in Italy (recreated guiltlessly in my own kitchen) which use a crumbled stock cube, along with some butter, olive oil, chopped rosemary and a little of the pasta cooking water to make a flavoursome sauce for spaghetti.
“If you think about it, Marmite offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might. I’m glad this recipe is here, and I thank Anna for it.” Mirror
