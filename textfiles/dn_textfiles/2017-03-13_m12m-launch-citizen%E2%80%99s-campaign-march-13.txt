M12M to launch citizen’s campaign on March 13

The ‘March 12 Movement’, a mission to elect clean and corruption-free politicians will launch a Citizen’s March around the country on March 13 from Independence Square. The event is scheduled to commence at 9.30 a.m.
The movement, in a bid to encourage political parties to avoid giving nominations to corrupt individuals and encourage the public to vote for talented and clean candidates, will travel to all the districts in the country.
The march will be joined by religious leaders, government officials, scholars, civil society leaders; trade union leaders, politicians and the public. More than 25 young MPs have already pledged their support for the movement.
The event will include an educational programme to make the public aware of how to choose the candidate they wish to vote for, pressure the political leaders of their constituencies to select best candidates and the importance of voting for capable women candidates. The distribution of leaflets with election oriented information and street dramas will take place along with the march and each day there will be a district meeting in the main city of the district.
The march will take place from March 13 to April 7. It will mark its finale on the April 8 at the BMICH with the patronage of President Mithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The March 12th Movement says it remains committed to work with dedication to collaborate with the public to bring forth positive changes in the political culture in Sri Lanka.
Whilst acknowledging and offering our sincere gratitude to all civil society organisations, government officials, trade unions, political parties, the media and the proactive citizenry of our country in general, for their unstinting support extended towards the movement which was crafted with the active participation of the civil societies to create a positive impact on the political culture of Sri Lanka.
