PBSS conducts business forum in Wayamba

A regional business forum for Wayamba businessmen was held recently in Kurunegala.
The event which was held under the theme ‘Grow Your Business with a Perfect Business Solution’ conducted by IT Business Solution Provider, Perfect Business Solution Services (PBSS) drew a huge audience of businessmen from Wayamba.
The objective of conducting the forum was to introduce Enterprise Resource Planning solutions and products and add value to the businesses in Wayamba, said PBSS Managing Director Madura Gamanayake
He said their concept was woven around ‘never hire cheap people, they make expensive mistakes and that was his own experience after providing business solutions to over 1,500 business entities in his 25 year long career.
“Low quality people do lots of mistakes. Hire quality people, even for higher salaries. Same thing applies for your business solution or business consultancy. That is our strategy and plan,” he told the businessmen in Wayamba. The PBSS Chief said that PBSS could cater to any type of business in their area being the partners of the world’s best two Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems SAP and Sage in Sri Lanka. He said Sage was the top ERP for small to medium scale businesses and over six million use it worldwide.
