Seventy seven families in Kuruwita evacuated

Seventy seven families living in Keeragala group plantation division 2 in Kuruwita have been evacuated from their homes due to a possible landslide threat in the area.
They are accommodated at the Udawatta Community Centre and several homes in the neighbourhood. Cracks have appeared over an area of about 2 acres in the threatened area.
Water spouts had appeared on some of the fissures in the land area concerned.
A resident named R. A. Nalin Sampath said some up rooted boulders had rolled over and seen hanging above the Kataragama Kovil. A stream had also erupted and this had prompted them to move to a safer area. A. Vijayakumara another resident said when they informed the police about the danger they were advised to evacuate the area.
Grama Sevaka of Keeragale Asela Priyantha Gunatillake said two overhanging massive granite rocks in Habaralahena and Agalawatta had posed a landslide threat affecting 77 families.
The National Building Research organisation which examined the region had submitted its report recommending measures to get rid of the rocks.
They had said the two rocks should be safely splintered using chemicals without blasting which would adversely affect the area lying below. Kuruwita Divisional Secretary Dilini Dharmadasa said displaced people are housed in safer locations and they are provided with cooked meals. Volunteer organisations too had come to the assistance of the displaced.
