Grand Talk, Grand Win  competition from Hyundai

Under the initiatives of Hyundai’s global branding strategy beneath the concept “modern premium” Hyundai Lanka launched their latest marketing movement, be the Hyundai Star with Grand Talk, Grand Win contest.
Hyundai as a global renowned automobile brand whose name meaning is “modern” in Korean, was long known as an economy brand that chip away at rivals on sticker prices.
But now the company wants to foster an image that matches its rapidly increasing reputation for top-notch quality.
The brand has been doing quite well in building good functional quality, and in the past 10 years, Hyundai has been very successful in building an image for quality for a fair-haired sticker price. But Hyundai still have some room to improve our emotional quality and that is related to our brand strategy.
That's why we set modern premium as the brand direction and to increase the brand awareness among Sri Lankan consumers. With the help of these new initiatives we expect improved customer service, more innovative marketing and a better look and feel for the vehicles themselves.
Brand recognition for Hyundai in Sri Lanka is not at the predictable level compared to the other markets in the developing world, perhaps due to the lack of unawareness about the genuine growth of the brand over the years in the globe. Our goal is to improve the customer engagement level with our brand in Sri Lanka.
Loyalty is something that Hyundai is serious about. That’s why the company is focused on earning the loyalty of our customers by delivering convincing customer schemes like this.
Just as Hyundai fans show their loyalty by buying another Hyundai after another, Sri Lankan fans that go to any extent to express their loyalty, passion and dedication towards the brand and talk about the most awarded compact car in the world “Grand i10” will have more chances of winning a car free.
Thus the company consider the person who wins the car as a “hero/Star”.
