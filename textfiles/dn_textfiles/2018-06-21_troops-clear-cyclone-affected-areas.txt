Troops clear cyclone-affected areas

Over 40 Army personnel of the 143rd Brigade of the 14 Division and 532 Brigade of the 53rd Division under the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West) on Tuesday, rushed to Kuliyapitiya, Meegahakotuwa, Pahala Piduma and Pahatha Embawa areas in the Kuliyapitiya Divisional Secretariat to provide emergency services to the people affected by powerful wind that swept across the area.
Troops are still clearing the debris, fallen trees, lamp posts and other objects that blocked the passage between Kuliyapitiya and Kurunegala after strong winds disturbed the normalcy early morning.
Initial reports confirmed 21 houses and 12 commercial establishments in the area to have been badly affected, forcing some civilians to get out of their dwellings.
Some of the entry points to the Kuliyapitiya town have also been obstructed after winds felled trees and posts. On the directions of Major General Sathyapriya Liyanage, Commander, Security Forces - West (SF-West) and Major General Ralph Nugera, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 14 Division, 16 Gajaba Regiment and 1 Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) of the 143 Brigade and troops of the 532nd Brigade cleared affected areas and restored normalcy.
Brigadier Palitha Perera, 143rd Brigade Commander, together with the troops are still engaged in the clearing work.
