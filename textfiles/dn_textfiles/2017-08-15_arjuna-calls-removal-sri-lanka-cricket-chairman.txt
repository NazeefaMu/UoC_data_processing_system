Arjuna calls for removal of Sri Lanka Cricket Chairman

 
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga has called for the removal of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Chairman.
“The Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket should resign from his post”, the Minister said, following the recent 3-0 defeat to India.
“The Chairman of SLC said Ravi Karunanyake should resign from him post,” the Minister said referring to recent comments made by Thilanga Sumathipala – “he should resign first.”
The Petroleum Resources Development Minister blamed ‘cricket administration’ for Sri Lanka’s defeat and said he would apprise the President and the Prime Minister of the situation.
