Executive Presidency will be abolished as promised - MP

UNP MP Dr. Ashubodhi Marasinghe yesterday said the proposed constitutional reforms come in as a part of the positive social transformation promised by the government in 2015.
He pointed out, for the first time in history, all political parties have come to an agreement for an undivided country.
“We should not let this golden opportunity slip away. Three Presidents including Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena promised to abolish the Executive Presidency in five Presidential Elections. However, both Bandaranaike and Rajapaksa failed to do it." he said.
At the last Presidential Election, Rajapaksa did not promise to abolish the executive presidency, as he wanted to become the President for the third time.It was evident that people did not vote for him. They voted for Sirisena who promised to abolish the executive presidency.” Dr. Marasinghe said. Dr. Marasinghe said it is unbecoming if, for the fifth time, a President failed to keep the promise of abolishing the executive presidency. He also commended the memory of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha thera, who called for constitutional reforms. Dr. Marasinghe also alleged that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is misleading the Maha Sangha with regards to the proposed constitutional reforms.
Meanwhile, MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickremeratne, a member of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, said he is of the opinion that the National Audit Bill must soon be presented to Parliament.
He also said the report of the Finance subcommittee of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, was the only report which was unanimously agreed, which emphasises the importance of the National Audit Bill.
These observations were made at a press brief held yesterday at the Government Information Department on the interim report submitted to the Constitutional Assembly by the Steering Committee of the constitutional reforms.
