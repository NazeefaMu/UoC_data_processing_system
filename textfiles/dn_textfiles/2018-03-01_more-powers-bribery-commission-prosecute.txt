President’s cabinet paper approved:
More powers for Bribery Commission to prosecute

Cabinet approval has been granted to empower the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to file cases based on facts revealed by the Commissions of Inquiry.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the decision to transfer the power of filing cases based on facts revealed by the Commissions of Inquiry to the Bribery Commission was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday. Accordingly, Director General of the Bribery Commission will be given the power to file cases under the Bribery Act or Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law based on the findings of Commissions of Inquiry appointed by the President.
The Legal Draftsman has drafted legislation to amend the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 to allow the CIABOC to file cases based on the investigations and facts revealed by the Commissions of Inquiry.
 The Attorney General has informed that the amendment Bill has to be passed by a 2/3 majority in Parliament.
The Cabinet paper submitted by President Maithripala Sirisena seeking to publish the bill in the Gazette and subsequently present it to Parliament. This proposal received the Cabinet approval. Minister Senaratne said that the above amendment to the bill will quicken the process of taking legal action against the wrongdoers.
He assured that the above measure was taken to hear the cases soon and punish the perpetrators involved. According to the Act, the President can appoint Commissions of Inquiry, whenever it appears to him that an investigation or inquiry or both is necessary on the administration, management and functions of any Government institution or the conduct of any public officer. Presidential Commissions of Inquiries can be appointed on any matter relating to the national interest of the public safety or well-being as decided by the President.
