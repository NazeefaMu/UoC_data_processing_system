Royal out to regain Michael Gunaratne Trophy today

Royal College will be looking to regain the Michael Gunaratne Trophy after a lapse of one year when they take on arch rivals S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia in their annual inter- school rugby encounter of the Singer ‘A’ Division league tournament second round at Mount Lavinia commencing 4.30pm today.
This traditional encounter was inaugurated in 1962 and the first match ended in a draw. Present tally stands 28 wins to Royal and 19 to S.Thomas’ with 5 draws. In 1979 the match was not played due to a dispute regarding the date for the encounter.
The Royalist lost last year’s encounter 15-21 at Royal Sports Complex under the leadership of number eight Nikhila Gunadeera where the winning Thomian captain was hooker Pandula de Silva.
This time they seem to have a great chance of regaining the trophy after having won all their previous games against St. Joseph College (28-22), St.Peter’s College (17-10), Dharmaraja College Kandy (18-15), D.S. Senanayake College (47-7) and St. Anthony’s College Kandy (48-35) while losing only one match to Isipathana College (17-22).
Royal will be captained this year by their experienced fly half Ovin Askey while the most experienced and one of the best school coaches if not the very best Sanath Martis, the Sri Lanka under 19 national 15 a side head coach will once again be the head coach of Royal and ex-Royal College rugby player and former Sri Lanka national rugby captain Dushanth Lewke will be his assistant. T.A. Silva, former Army and Sri Lanka national full back is the kicking coach.
The 2015 Royal side under the leadership of Bhanuka Gamage and head coach Sanath Martis, re wrote the Royal-Thomian rugby history where they demolished the Thomians 52-0 at Havelock Park, which to-date is the highest score by a team in this traditional encounter. The Thomians’ highest score is 22-0 under the captaincy of Charya de Saram in 1991.
Incidentally in 2015 Royal’s unsung hero and the highest try scorer in the league tournament, number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya emerged the first and only rugby player from both the schools to score a hat trick of tries when he touched down four times to enable Royal to achieve this remarkable 52-0 victory.
The Thomians will be hoping to produce an improved performance after their match against Science College where they scored a narrow (20-12) win in their last first round game. They also won against Prince of Wales (57-0), Zahira College (29-24) but lost to Wesley College (19-23) and unbeaten Trinity College (14-29). The Thomian outfit will be captained this year by experienced speedy Sri Lanka national under 18 Asian Sevens champion skipper and winger Naveen Heenakankanamge while Samoan Tevita Tulagaese “Laga” will be their head coach and former Sri Lanka captain Viraj Prasantha the forwards coach.
