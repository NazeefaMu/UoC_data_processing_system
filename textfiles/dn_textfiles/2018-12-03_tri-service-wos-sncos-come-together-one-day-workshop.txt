Historic Army initiative
Tri-Service WOs, SNCOs come together for one-day workshop

A monumentally unique assembly of a few more than 2,000 Tri-Service Warrant Officers (WOs) and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) under one roof on a conceptual notion of the Army Commander for the first time in military history took place at Attidiya Eagle’s Lakeside Convention Hall last Monday (26).
The officers in a spirit of comradeship participated in a full-day seminar to receive updates on logistics and improved performance of their tasks, responsibilities, inter-relations, capacity, leadership skills, professional conduct and accountability issues.
The seminar, inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces as the chief guest, themed on the professional role of Tri-Service WOs and SNCOs, was also designed to mould those attendees to be role models for their junior rankers who would often interact at first with WOs and SNCOs for resolution of their concerns while on duty.
The ceremonial event was also graced by Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe and Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy. Recital of the National Anthem, Army song and the two-minute silence to honour the memory of fallen war heroes set the stage for the day’s proceedings.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, extending a warm welcome spelt out why an educative seminar, targeting this category of Tri-Service personnel was launched for the first time under one roof. “SNCOs are the backbone of the armed forces and it is you who steer the direction for those serving with you and you are the one who is the ‘ombudsman’ for other ranks sharing their duties with you. Mutual understanding among the Tri-Services is essential and portends fellow-relationships.”
“You are the guiding light that provides guidance and relieves them of their grievances and burdens at first before they reach higher command. This attempt is therefore meant to expand your capacity which would help simultaneously elevate the capacity of the soldier with whom you are working. Cooperation with overseas regional partners too will broaden your horizons,” the Commander said.
In his brief speech to the gathering, President Sirisena lauded the services rendered by these NCOs for conduct of logistics in the three service wings which in the post-conflict period have thrown their full weight behind realisation of the government’s development and reconciliation goals. “I would like to bow my head to all of you for your services before the war, during the war and in the post-war era. These were the major three sectors in the recent military history. Your services are much more required, but your retirement age does not permit you to continue. You are part of an Army recognised by the UN. Not every Army in the world is recognised in this way,” the President said.
Speaker of the first session of the seminar, Brigadier S.N. Halangoda (retd), one of the most respected veterans in the Army, elaborated on how disciplined leadership skills of Tri-Service WOs and SNCOs impacts the progress of establishments. Eastern Commander Major General Aruna Jayasekera, Rear Admiral W. E. M. Sudarshana and Air Vice Marshal K. S. R. Fernando, in their separate presentations in the second session dwelt on dedication to nation-building through military experience’ while Kuma Iddamallena, reputed personality development and leadership trainer delivered a comprehensive lecture on promotion of professional efficiency through positive thoughts.
In the final session, Defence Services Command and Staff College (DSCS) Commandant Major General Ruwan Kulathunge added a new dimension to the seminar, touching on the subject of life after retirement and planning for retired life, in which he spelt out how the Army is geared to train potential Army retirees as well as those still serving the Tri-Services.
The day’s mega event drew to a close with the award of certificates of participation to all Tri-Service participants.
After Lieutenant General Senanayake assumed the mantle of command in the latter part of 2017, he took steps to implement a variety of capacity-based projects to elevate professional standards of the Army WOs, SNCOs and Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) who the Commander regards as the heavy-weight in the making of a soldier. Overseas interactive exchange programmes, introduction of pre-retirement vocational training slots, sending officers for overseas sports events, public appreciation of their achievements, and award of special monetary grants are among the most prominent, to cite a few of those projects.
