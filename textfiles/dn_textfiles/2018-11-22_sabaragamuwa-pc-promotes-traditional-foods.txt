Sabaragamuwa PC promotes traditional foods

The Provincial Agriculture Department of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council is promoting traditional foods in the Kegalle and Ratnapura districts, with the aim of building a healthy nation.
Under the project Suwa Diviyata Hela Aahara, housewives are being made aware about the nutritional value of local foods.
The first workshop under the project was conducted recently at the Ratnapura Provincial Council auditorium by veteran chef Dr. Publis Silva, and was attended by around 1,000 housewives.
According to experts in the health and food and nutrition sectors, the present-day food habits of people have become the major cause of non-communicable diseases such as diabetics, cholesterol, high and low blood pleasure, kidney diseases and more.
Therefore, it is important to return to the culture of consuming traditional healthy foods, so as to a measure to minimise the effects caused by present-day food habits.
“The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council believes that we are duty bound to make people aware of the local food culture as a measure to keep people healthy,” Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake said.
Provincial Chief Secretary Herath P. Kularatne, Agriculture Secretary Sunil Premachandra, Education Secretary Mahinda S. Weerasuriya and other officials attended the event.
