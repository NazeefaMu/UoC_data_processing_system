Magistrate refuses to accept AG’s observations against prosecution counsel

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday refused to accept the Attorney General’s observations sent in a confidential letter on allegations against prosecution counsel in the bond issue inquiry when it was taken up yesterday.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda submitted the Attorney General’s observations in a confidential letter along with the observations of the CID and further report into the bond issue inquiry before the Magistrate.
The Attorney General’s and CID observations were on the allegations made by the defence in the case that a State Counsel and a Solicitor General demanded account details of W.M. Mendis Company related to the bond issue from Defence counsel Chandana Perera and threatened him to make a complaint against him before the CID if he refused.
The court was told on an earlier day by the witnesses that Chandana Perera asked them to give false evidence before court. On a later date the defence counsel in absentia of Attorney-at-Law Chandana Perera submitted before the Magistrate that the above said State Counsel and the Solicitor General demanded Chandana Perera to come to the Attorney General’s Department where he was was told to give them the account details of the W.M.Mendis Company. Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda submitted that he could not make a statement on the allegation and would make a submission later.

He added that he would declare his decision on acceptance of those documents on the next hearing.
However during the hearing a defense counsel submitted that the wife of Arjuna Aloysius had delivered their third baby and pleaded permission to show the photographs of Arjuna Aloysius’ new born baby to him.
