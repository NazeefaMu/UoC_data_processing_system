Lanka’s first all-suite hotel to come up in Panadura

White Heaven Hotel Panadura along with a Chinese partner would build Sri Lanka’s first all-suite 100 room hotel in Panadura. Managing Director, White Heaven Hotel, Sunil Silva told ‘Daily News Business’ that he has already acquired a one and a half acre land bordering the sea and river in Panadura for this project. “We will start construction by next February and the project would be completed in 18 months,”he said.
The Chinese investor from Beijing is already involved in the real estate and construction business for the past 19 years in China having built and managed over 12 sky scrapers.
“This is the first time the company is venturing overseas,”he said. Silva was also a partner and an investor with China’s J. J. Construction for Sri Lanka’s first purpose built Chinese five star hotel, Jie Jie Beach which opened in Panadura early this year. The project is a US$ 30 million investment and hotel is now managed by the Jetwing Group.
Silva said that they invest around Rs 800 million for this project which would be a BOI approved venture.
“The unique feature of this hotel too would be that modern building techniques by Chinese construction team were used to build the hotel. This the reason we would be able to complete the project in eighteen months.
As we are using engineer’s architects and several workers from China construction cost too would be reduced by nearly 25%.” He also said that in this hotel too they will have 90% power generated from solar and it would be given to a local or foreign hotel operator to manage once it’s being constructed.
“We will have 100 rooms with each room having their own Jacqui, kitchen and many other facilities.”
He said that they are leaving almost nine months in advance until March to obtain all necessary approvals which was the main delay for their first JV project, Jie Jie Beach.
