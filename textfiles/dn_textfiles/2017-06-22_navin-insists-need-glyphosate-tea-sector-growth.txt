Navin insists on need for Glyphosate for tea sector growth

Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said he will seek Cabinet approval to import the Glyphosate weedicide to be used in tea cultivation for a limited period once again.
Monsanto’s ‘RoundUp’ Glyphosate was banned for sale and use by the government after a study found the weedicide is responsible for the increasing number of chronic kidney disease patients.
Addressing media at Sirikotha yesterday, Dissanayake said tea production has witnessed a decrease after the Glyphosate ban in 2015.According to him commercial agriculture,especially tea cultivation cannot be done without the use of Glyphosate.
“A direct connectivity between the use of Glyphosate and chronic kidney disease has not been proved from research conducted by the World Health Organisation,” the Minister noted.
The Minister said tea cultivation companies are calling him to lift the Glyphosate ban and he is seeking Cabinet approval to lift the ban for a few years.
“As the Plantation Industries Minister I am concerned by the tea production decrease.The ban on Glyphosate should be lifted for at least five years until an organic weedicide is ready. But it should be imported only under strictly supervised conditions and regulations” he said.
The Tea Research Institute is working on introducing an organic weedicide for tea cultivation by now.
A committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to study the issue and decide whether Glyphosate ban to be relaxed.
