‘Honda’ Trophy – MCA ‘G’ division 25 Over League:
SLT bags very first MCA title

Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) led by K. Amarasinghe won their very first Mercantile Cricket title when they brought down the high riding, Fairfirst Insurance by 07 wickets in the 08th Stafford Motor Co. (Pvt) Ltd., ‘Honda’ Trophy – MCA ‘G’ division 25 Over League Tournament 2018 final, concluded at the MCA Grounds recently.
Fairfirst Insurance went into the final with high hopes on bagging a hat trick of wins, as they had bagged the 02 MCA ‘Sixes’ titles earlier on.
Fairfirst sent into bat, got off on the wrong foot getting their big hitting captain, Lakshan Perera, run-out for 06 at 14. More disaster followed at 14 as Perera’s opening partner R. Peiris perished for 07, followed by their new recruit, Asela Sigera for a duck, both falling to SLT’s opening bowler, I Devin.(Score 14 for 3).
No. 4 batsman, Thilina Masmulla and No. 5, P. Fernando did some repairs to the total with a fighting 51 runs stand for the 04th wicket in 18 balls, before Fernando was trapped LBW by L. Kumara (Score 65 for 4 in 12.2 overs).
Masmulla fired away from one end, but he was fast losing partners including veteran, Sanjaya Attanayake (02), Fairfirst’s last crusader (Score 78 for 5).
Finally, Masmulla got stranded with a gusty 87 not out in 62 balls with 01 six and 13 fours – Fairfirst all out for 144 in 24.3 overs.
SLT chasing a target of 145 runs in 25 overs (RPO 5.8), was given a solid start by Nirushan Ramachandran (63 in 57 balls with 03 sixes & 06 fours) and L.Thambawita (32 in 29 balls with 05 fours ) who put on 88 runs in 76 balls.
SLT now virtually in the fast lane, cruised along to win handsomely with L.Ranatunga (17 not out) and M. de Silva (17 not out) putting on the finishing touches with an unbroken 35 runs stand for 04 th wicket (148 for 3 in 23.5 overs).
Match Referee, Chandana Mahesh picked SLT’s opening batsman, Nirushan Ramachandran, as his Man of the Match.
The other 03 special awards, based on performances up to the semifinals, went to Mangala Pradeep from MAS Linea Aqua (Best Bowler and Man of the Series) and Suranga Thushara from Allaris Lanka (Best Batsman).
