Green turtles at Gurubewila

 
Green turtles which are a rare species of turtle are now seen on the Gurubewila beach in Weligama drawing a large number of curious crowds.
People in the area who witnessed about 250 hatchlings coming out of a cave on the beach had informed officers of the Mirissa Wildlife about it. Wildlife officials said they quickly caught the turtles and released them to the sea.
These varieties of turtles are seen in Sri Lanka, they said.
