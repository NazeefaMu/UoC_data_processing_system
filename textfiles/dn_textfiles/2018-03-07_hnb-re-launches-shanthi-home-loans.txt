HNB re-launches Shanthi Home Loans

Leveraging on the expansion of its technological and service transformation over the past year, Sri Lanka’s premier retail bank, HNB, announced the launch of a new and improved Shanthi Home Loans product that aims to offer an unprecedented level of simplicity and convenience for customers seeking to build or develop their dream home.
Updated to meet the changing requirements of customers in an increasingly fast-paced Sri Lankan market, HNB’s updated Shanthi Home Loans product aims to deliver the most flexible and competitive loans in the market to suit any requirement, from the purchase of land, property, apartments, to construction and condominium financing, including foreign currency home loans.
The versatility of HNB Shanthi Home Loans is complemented by the addition of a host of value added services including comprehensive support for all legal and other documentation requirements through dedicated agents, who will also provide doorstep mortgage advisory services.
The bank’s recent up-scaling of its technological capacities through the consolidation of its back-end processes has also enabled drastic improvements in the speed at which HNB processes documentation, enabling a remarkable 2-day loan approval process; ideal for customers relying on a speedy response to their loan applications.
“Especially in the case of professionals, entrepreneurs and executives, the process of buying or developing a home can be tedious, time consuming and difficult. By offering complete support that takes care of every step of the process, we are confident that HNB Shanthi Home Loans now offers the smoothest pathway to new home,” HNB Personal Financial Services Head, Viraj Mendis explained.
Additionally, clients seeking to purchase a condominium property can now enter into tripartite agreements with HNB and the developer of their choice to receive loans that commence during construction in order to allow customers the benefit of lower prices on advance purchases.
“If the existing facility is being repaid satisfactorily customers can obtain a second loan from us to build or purchase another house, as an investment or home to let for additional income. We also offer a loyalty card with a wide range of discounts on building material such as cement, steel, paint, fittings, décor furniture and even for gardening. Therefore we invite all of those interested in setting up their own dream home to contact HNB and experience our world class service first hand,” HNB Personal Financial Services, Senior Manager, Kanchana Karunagama said.
