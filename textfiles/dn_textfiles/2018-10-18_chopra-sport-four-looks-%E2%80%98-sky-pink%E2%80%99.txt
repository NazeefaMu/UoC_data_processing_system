Chopra  to sport  four looks in  ‘The Sky Is Pink’?

Priyanka Chopra might be busy with her newly engaged life with Nick Jonas but the actor knows how to strike a balance between her personal and professional life.
Soon after returning from Lake Como, Priyanka resumed the shoot of her next film ‘The Sky Is Pink’.
While the film marks her return to the Indian film industry after a gap of two years, the film will also see her sporting four different avatars. Priyanka plays Aditi Chaudhary, mother to author and motivational speaker Aisha Chaudhary. Aisha was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis at 13 and later penned a book titled ‘My Little Epiphanies’. After her demise at 21, her mother Aditi has dedicated herself to spreading her daughter’s story. Times Now News
