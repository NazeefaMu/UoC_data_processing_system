ComBank supports pensioners with loan facilities

Pensioners below the age of 69 can now apply for an advance of up to 75% on their previous month’s pension, thanks to a new Pension Advance Facility introduced by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
Government pensioners, widows and widowers who receive their pension through the Government Pensions Department, pensioners of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and pensioners of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) who have at least one of their pensions of Rs 10,000 or more credited to a Commercial Bank account will be eligible for this facility, the Bank said.
After applying for the facility just once, eligible persons can enjoy up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 as an advance on their pensions when the need arises. This amount can be withdrawn at any ATM in the country using a Commercial Bank Debit card.
Additionally, pensioners who credit their pensions to accounts at Commercial Bank can also apply for personal loans of up to Rs. 2.5 million with a repayment period of up to 10 years, the Bank said.
Commenting on these special facilities, Commercial Bank’s Chief Operating Officer Sanath Manatunge said: “There are more than 600,000 government pensioners in the country, all of whom have rendered valuable service to the nation. Our new scheme is a means of empowering them by offeringaccess to disposable income that can meet their urgent cash requirements without having to wait for the pension remittance date.”
