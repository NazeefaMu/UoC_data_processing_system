‘Unemployment worsened due to current education system’

A burning problem in Sri Lanka is the challenge of providing employment to the youth. Being without employment is a big loss not only to the youth concerned but to the entire country, said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
He was addressing the representatives of teachers and university students at his Galagedara office, recently.
“In most countries, youths get jobs when they are 18, 19 or 20 years. However, the sad state of affairs in our country is that the prevailing system of education does not enable one to get a job after leaving school. You cannot qualify to get a job merely through knowledge from books. In other countries, those leaving school are enabled to get a job without difficulty as they receive an education which fits them for employment. In Sri Lanka, a student does not get the practical knowledge which makes him suitable to be selected for a job. This has resulted in the increase of youth unemployment,” the minister said.
Sri Lanka occupies a high place in comparison with other countries in respect of literacy. It is more than 93 percent. Our student population is more than 4.2 million. The number of schools we have is about 10,200. A total of 353 out of these are national schools. The number of teachers is about 235,032. We have 15 universities. The students who pass out of the schools and the universities annually join the employment queue, he pointed out.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said, “We face the challenge of finding employment for them. They should be incorporated actively into the economic processes of the country. This will not be a big challenge if our education system produces persons who fit into the country’s development process, who can contribute to the improvement of the country and who are qualified for employment.”
“We should develop our agriculture to a high level. It is through the development of rural industries, small-scale industries and medium scale industries that the rural economy can be strengthened. The President’s attention is primarily focused on the utilization of every inch of land in the country for its development and economic advancement.
It is the duty of all of us to take the country forward by increasing the incomes of the people, by enhancing production, by multiplying employment opportunities and by strengthening peace and amity among communities,” the minister said.
Engaging in politics of trickery only to gain power, without taking into consideration the development of the country will not result in the welfare of the people. No one should think of only getting into power through the ballot of the people merely to enjoy the privileges of office. One should use one’s office only for the advancement of the cause of the country and the people. It is a crime to do otherwise, he said.
“Democracy is well established in our country today. It is the duty of all people’s representatives to utilize that freedom in such a way that it will not harm the forward march of the country. However, some people’s representatives often exceed that limit and act only to realize their personal goals, inviting thereby the opprobrium of intelligent citizens. We should always try to conduct ourselves according to high democratic principles. When we do so people’s representatives will win the respect and the approbation of the people,” the minister added.
He said it has become imperative that political parties and people’s representatives work in dedication to minimize unemployment, eradicate poverty, strengthen the economy and usher in a social, economic and cultural regeneration in this country.
However, it has to be said that some political leaders and people’s representatives conduct themselves in an utterly disappointing manner, Minister Amunugama said.
