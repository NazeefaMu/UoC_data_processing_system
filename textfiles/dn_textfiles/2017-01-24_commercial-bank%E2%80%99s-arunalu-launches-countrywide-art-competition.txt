Commercial Bank’s Arunalu launches countrywide art competition

Art enables children to express themselves on virtually anything that interests them, and the Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched an islandwide competition to stimulate such expression by the country’s young artists.
Sri Lanka’s benchmark private bank has announced it will award Rs 555,000 in 45 cash prizes at an art competition to be conducted under the banner of ‘Arunalu’ – the Bank’s flagship Children’s Savings Account.
Titled ‘Arunalu Siththam,’ the competition is open to school-going children in three age groups – Grades 1 to 3, Grades 4 to 6 and Grades 7 to 9, the Bank said. Contestants can choose their own topics and colour medium, and submit their art on 18 x 16 inch drawing paper on or before March 14.
Each drawing should mention the topic and colour medium, the full name of the child, Grade, School, child's address, telephone number and date on the back of the drawing and every submission should be certified by the child’s school Principal or Class Teacher or Grama Niladhari or by a Justice of the Peace.
The Bank said the drawing that wins first place in each age group will receive a cash prize of Rs 50,000, while the second and third placed drawings in each group will receive cash prizes of Rs 35,000 and Rs 25,000 respectively. A cash prize of Rs 15,000 each and Rs 10,000 each will be presented to the fourth and fifth placed drawings in each group.
The Bank will also award cash prizes of Rs 5,000 each to ten highly commended drawings in each age group, making a total of 15 cash prizes per segment.
The submitted drawings will be judged by an eminent panel of judges which is comprised of reputed professional artists who are experienced in judging paintings created by children.
