‘Prisons Dept., Police cannot shirk responsibility’

The Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry in a statement to the media stated that neither the Prison Department nor the Sri Lanka Police could shirk their collective responsibilities in the recent Kalutara Prison shooting.
The ministry in its statement released yesterday expressed its regret over the unfortunate and serious incident took place on Monday (27) where five inmates and two prison guards being shot dead in front of the Kalutara Prison while they were being transported to courts.
The current legal framework stipulates that the Prisons Department is responsible for the prisoners and their security and when transporting dangerous criminals, they have been advised to seek police assistance, stated the ministry.
“Prison officials and the police have been given necessary training on measures to be taken when transporting such prisoners in addition to being trained in the handling of weapons. Hence the Sri Lanka Police nor the Prisons Department cannot evade their collective responsibility in this matter”, the statement said.
In response to recent statement made by Prisons, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan, who assigned blame to the police, the Law and Order Ministry stated that the former could not absolve all blame from the Prison Department by merely blaming the police.
“The more productive measure to the general public would be to identify the main responsibilities of all the main departments and their shortcomings and to work towards meeting these challenges better in future. But for that all should first accept responsibility,” the ministry stated. The ministry stated that as a responsible government, they were duty bound to take action against all responsible officers in the Prisons Department as well as the Police and to expedite the arrest of the suspects responsible in the shooting.
