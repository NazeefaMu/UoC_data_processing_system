GMOA gets more  SLMC seats

 The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has won handsomely at the Sri Lanka Medical Council election held yesterday, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya had obtained 6,254 votes from the total 8,000 votes. The GMOA obtained 3,750 votes which is 77.7 percent from the total number of votes cast. The GMOA will win three more seats of members in the SLMC to be vacant next month (mid February). At the moment there is one more vacant seat for a member in the SLMC.
Dr. De Zoysa pointed out that the minimum standard of Medical Education should be three B passes (the lowest university entrance result of the previous year) and the Health Minister wanted to drop it to three simple (S) passes. But later he said he raised the minimum standards to two Credit Passes (3C) and one Simple Pass (1S). But the minimum standard agreed by the Prime Minister’s representation and all the other relevant parties was three B passes (3B).
