Galle Dialogue on October 9 and 10

The International Maritime Conference, “Galle Dialogue 2017”, organised by the Sri Lanka Navy, will be held at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, on October 9 and 10 for the eighth consecutive year.
Over 100 local and foreign scholars and experts in naval and maritime affairs representing 38 countries and 11 international organisations will share their expertise at the two-day dialogue to be held under the theme, “Greater maritime visibility for enhanced maritime security”.
The Galle dialogue was initiated by the Navy in 2010.
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah said the conference will provide a common platform for stakeholders of national and international reputes to discuss and deliberate issues related to maritime security.
He said Sri Lanka has the potential to become the maritime hub of Asia and added that similar conferences would strengthen the regional maritime cooperation.
“Indian Ocean continues to face maritime insecurity in different ways. A discussion among stakeholders is vital to find out global strategies to face common issues and challenges in the maritime domain," he said.
