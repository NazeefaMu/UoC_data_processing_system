Cabinet approves to increase bus fares

 
The Cabinet of Ministers approved to increase bus fares by 6.5 percent from midnight today.
However the minimum fare of Rs.10 will remain the same.
The proposal to increase bus fares, made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers after considering a report submitted by the Committee appointed to revise bus fares.
Accordingly the committee submitted a report containing 12 factors which includes the recent fuel price hike, in favor of the bus fare hike.
The Transport and Civil Aviation Minister has instructed the National Transport Commission to take  measures to provide a detailed revised price list to the public and bus owners soon.
