Avurudu festivities at Galadari

The Galadari Hotel had a special Avurudu celebration recently for its in-house guests. As a part of the festivity the Management of the hotel invited guests to the auspicious milk boiling ceremony and ‘raban’ playing whichtook place at the Centre Lobby. This was followed by the lighting of the oil lamp. Guests were entertained by traditional dancers and later invited to partake in the New Year Table which included a fabulous spread of sweetmeats and trimmings.
