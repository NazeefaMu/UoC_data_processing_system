Anuradharapura Teaching Hospital Doctor produces aspirator machine

Dr. Dulan Samaraweera attached to Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital has produced a portable aspirator machine.
According to Dr. Samaraweera, this machine is required in transporting critical patients.
A patient’s breathing is assisted by a medical assistant in the ambulance or in hospital during emergencies with an aspirator machine.
The portable machine invented by Dr. Samaraweera is operated with a 12-watt battery. He said it cost him only Rs. 12,000 for the invention. The machine can easily be fixed in an ambulance.
“It was developed so as it to be carried easily with a patient. When the machine is linked to a patient, it gives 10 to 12 aspirator rates per minute. The rate can be adjusted,” he said.
He said he is ready to share the knowledge with the Health Ministry to save lives. More machines can be produced and distributed among hospitals, especially among rural hospitals.
“As a doctor, I do not want to make profit but to save innocent patients’ lives,” he said.
