A compelling story  for young minds

The talent that can speak and touch young minds does not come easily for many. You need to develop the art and a unique form of writing to captivate them and keep them engaged. Tiny tots love listening to stories. The challenge is not only in writing stories in a unique manner but also in writing tales with a meaningful message. Roopanthi Bulathsinhala has taken on this challenge in her latest book Keekaru Sevakaya (The Obedient Servant). The story rotates around a little boy named Daniel who teaches its readers a lesson on faith and trust. Written in simple language and adorned with colourful illustrations by Samanthi Meeriyagalla this is Roopanthi’s 11th book. It is an author publication.
