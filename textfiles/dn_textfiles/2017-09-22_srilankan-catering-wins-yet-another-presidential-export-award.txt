SriLankan Catering Limited (SLC), a fully owned subsidiary of National Carrier SriLankan Airlines, covered itself in more glory when it was named the winner of yet another Presidential Export Award, the third such award in recent years, as recognition for its steadfast commitment to supporting the nation’s economy and the growth of the aviation industry.
Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies & International Trade, presented the award to SriLankan Airlines Group Chairman Ajith Dias at the Presidential Export Awards 2016 at a gala ceremony at Colombo’s main international convention centre the BMICH last week. SLC was adjudged the winner as the Highest Value Added Exporter in the Professional Services (Other) category.

The Presidential Export Awards were adjudged by a panel of judges appointed by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board. SLC was rewarded for its contribution of value added exports amounting to USD 45.23 million during the financial year 2016/17, an increase from the USD 42.15 million over the previous year.
