Towards a coherent economic policy

As the country gears up for fast pace growth in the next few years, a coherent national economic policy is a must to aid this growth and help attract more Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into the country, said Professor. of Finance at the University of Houston (USA), Financial Economist and the President of Sri Lanka Finance Association, Prof Lalith Samarakoon in an interview with the Daily News.
Excerpts follow:
Q. What do you think of the current economic policy environment in the country?
A. There has been little change in policy in the last two years. There is a need for a coherent economic policy. We saw the new government come in and they had to conduct certain diagnostics to see what is going on and then understand where the needs are. But one of the key issues are economic policy uncertainty and that is not good for the government.
This means that there is uncertainty in policy formulation, communication of policies and its implementation.
When you take policy, it is a long-term guideline of strategy based on proper analysis of the situation and the long-term needs of the country. To formulate this, we first need an institutional framework, secondly, you need the people- experts and other stakeholders, thirdly, we need to see what is being done, and what are the gaps and issues and fourthly, what is the best experience in other countries in terms of dealing with these issues. We don’t need to follow them but at the same time, we don’t need to re-invent the wheel. You then also have to have the consultation with all stakeholders including the public, have it approved at a higher level and then communicated to all.
It looks almost like theory but it works in practice. Countries that have done well have got this methodology right. So to get the right policy environment, we need these frameworks set up.
Q. It is generally accepted that public consultation of policies in a country such as ours will not bear fruition in time and it is easier if it is made at the top and then implemented. Can you explain how similar Asian countries have dealt with this?
A. I agree that is how it is done and I think that is the problem. At present, policies are formulated at a political level, the problem with this is, what is the top you are talking about? The top can be what I call a bureaucratic expert framework, devoid of politics. So in real policy formulation, once it is formulated at the bureaucratic level, it can go to the next level, which is the political. At the political level, you are talking about the cabinet and the rest. The problem with policies being formulated at the political first is that it might not necessarily address the issues in a coherent, comprehensive way and it may not relate to the needs of the constituents.
Countries which have more diverse opinions that Sri Lanka have, managed to do this. Diverse viewpoints can be taken into account through an institutional framework and short cutting the policy process means you are not addressing the national economic problems on a long term basis. And you end up consulting only a segment of the people because you want to get it done early but I don’t think even that has happened because we have not been able to make policies for the big or small issues. Rarely does it happen that we say ok we want to make this policy fast and implement it and move forwards.
When we don’t address issues in a consensus-building manner, when governments change, policies change. So in order to preserve the long-term integrity of the policy, it is important that we get it right.
Q. Are you proposing an economic think tank of sorts or a planning commission?
A. Yes, something similar. It would be more of a National Economic Council. It has to be a permanent structure so that it will not be changed with changing governments. And it should be staffed by experts and bureaucrats of all fields. They can formulate the policies and issues can be brought to their notice by anyone, including the politicians, but they take a very coordinated, careful approach to formulating policy for the country. When this is submitted to the political level, they can change it, but if they are going to change it completely, there might still be problems in the way we make policy but we must expect certain changes.
But countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, etc… have jumped this hurdle. Though political structures may change they have ensured that the economic policy machinery that runs the country, to a certain degree, remains constant. They have institutionalized the running and implementation of the economic policy of the country, which we too need to do.
Q. That would instill the confidence needed for businesses both local and international to invest in the economy?
A. Yes. We as a country have never had a serious effort at establishing a policy making and implementation machinery. There have been ad hoc measures and various attempts to establish various committees, but I think that without a coordinated approach of that nature, we will be able to make substantial progress in any economic matter.
Q. What are the priority areas the government could look at to improve the economy?
A. Number one is public finance reforms. That would mean largely tax reforms and expenditure reforms which is why we are in the IMF program right now; to put some structure to the fiscal policy.
Q. With the IMF program there are questions about whether we can implement all what they want and whether it is best suited to our own context. What do you think?
A. The IMF program is aimed mostly at addressing the fiscal issue and the budget deficit; so everything is connected to revenue and expenditure.
When you take the IMF experience with the European debt crisis; you see that the latter, as a result of mismanagement of public finances, had the twin problems of debt and deficit. They thus sought the assistance of the IMF in addition to that of the European Central Bank. The IMF prescriptions would ultimately try to bring down the fiscal deficit to a reasonably manageable level. This would mean cutting down public expenditure and increasing revenue; usually by increasing taxes. And this could be counterproductive in terms of retarding the growth and this happened, for example in Greece and it never been able to recover. Overall Europe seems to have gotten out of that stalemate and they expect growth but not necessarily all these countries have resolved their debt and deficit issues because of retarded growth. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to implement IMF prescriptions in a way that would not reduce the economic growth of the country in a substantial manner, that’s why when a country goes to the IMF program, they need to know whether it is the right thing for them. One option for the country is to figure out their fiscal management policy on their own and if not, you have the IMF program and once you are in it, you are borrowing money and you have to agree to their policy conditions. But even with the program, it is up to us to figure out what the right approach to it is in the context of Sri Lanka and what the right sequencing and timing is. So that the medicine is not injected in a drastic manner. You have to sequence, for that to happen, we need to know what we need. We should understand our problems really well and the solutions to them and if we don’t have a coordinated institutional framework to understand the problems and find out what the policy prescriptions might be, we will be walking blind. And you will take whatever the prescription they give in their timeframe.
On the other hand, anytime you have to squeeze the belts of the public, it is going to backfire. Ultimately, you want to do something with some sort of public support, you cannot ignore that. In Greece, when the public became unsatisfied with the program, they changed the government.
Q. What are the other economic policy suggestions?
A. Tax reforms are very important. You have to have a simple, efficient tax system which is development and investment growth enhancing; you don’t want a tax system that is retarding. Think of how the tax system would give incentives to the sectoral areas where growth is needed, bring in FDIs and improve the capital markets.
On the fiscal side, expenditure reform is also much needed. Sri Lanka has always had a tendency to opt for a luxurious style of government structure, which is disproportionately large to the needs of a country this size. We have political structures, we have governance structures, departments, ministries, etc…one really needs to look at downsizing and streamlining government.
If you could do that, you could solve a lot of the fiscal problems.
Q. That would be a politically unpopular decision to make?
A. Yes, nothing is going to be popular. When the country is in a state of flux, when you have issues in almost every area of economic activity, we need the bold political leadership to say, “We need to fix this and nothing is easy”. I am not suggesting anything that would be hundred percent accepted by the public. That is why implementation should not be drastic, if you know the path you want to go on, then make a timeline and gradually implement it. But you have to do it, otherwise you will be stuck in a place like Greece where they have been unable to make changes for a long time. Whereas our neighbours, including India and Bangladesh, have figured things out.
Though we might be ok with our economy staying flat, relatively speaking we are going to be lagging behind in the region.
Apart from these, public enterprise reforms need to be done. Because the government can no longer afford to have loss-making public enterprises. If you take loss-making commercial enterprises, you need to restructure them and the government could think about bringing in private investors, and listing them on the stock exchange but retaining government ownership so that they can benefit from the increased value and dividends, rather than completely privatising them. Similar to what we did with the plantations initially.
You don’t need to go to 51 percent immediately, at least 5-10 percent, sell it through an IPO, and this would bring in the market discipline, management structures and business models.
The government can no longer finance these enterprises because where would they get the funds when it has a continuous budget deficit? They would have to borrow money for that, then debt stock will increase and we will be stuck in a vicious cycle.
The government’s idea of starting with the non-strategic enterprises is good and that should happen. They are not very controversial, so why not start with them? The government’s role is to regulate public enterprises that are needed for the public welfare such as utilities.
Then you have infrastructure development. Latest data from the central bank shows that infrastructure expenditure has decreased last year, and if you look at a five-year time horizon, they have remained relatively flat as a percentage of the economy though absolute levels may have increased. In 2012, it was 4.8 percent of GDP, 2013 4.7 of GDP, 2014 4.3 percent of GDP, 2015 4.9 percent of GDP and in 2016 it was 4.6 of GDP.
Q. Was this due to an increasing debt burden which had them pull back on spending?
A. Not necessarily. It is perhaps the lack of ability; the government does not have enough income or there were no FDIs to invest. So we need to break this cycle. Growth will require substantial infrastructure spending. How do we do that? As you said, we do have debt to deal with. Our debt level is at 79 percent of GDP, and we are talking about issues related to debt servicing which has a huge impact on the government budget. At present, the government has very little fiscal space in order to invest in infrastructure. So the money has to come from FDIs and they will have to come in a big way if we are to make a bigger stride in economic growth.
If you look at the question of FDIs, the trend there in the last five years is that they have stayed somewhere around an average of 700 USD million. The best we have had was in 2013 which was slightly more than 900 million USD. We have never even had a billion yet and last 10 years haven’t been that great either.
And it has continued to go down, last year it was 898 million USD and while it increased compared to 2015 where it wasUSD 680 million, relative to the economy, in 2016, it was at 1.1 percent of GDP.
We have large infrastructure needs but interest from foreign investments are low. We need to bring them in and in a large way, therefore, we need to make changes in the way we are doing our economic policy and management.
We also need to decide where these FDIs need to go: partly to infrastructure and then to export-oriented industrial development. The latter is due to the fact that we have a large amount of foreign debt that needs to be paid off in dollars and that can only be done through increasing our exports.
Here you also need an industrial production strategy. We need to identify our relative advantages and competencies and promote that. A long-term strategy apart from just having the BOI and tax incentives will be needed and it will have to project the country’s journey in the next 10-20 years. Of course, the investment landscape will change in 10 years and then can see how you can adapt to that.
The Chinese for an example are trying to implement the Maritime Silk Route to counter global weaknesses and slowing down of international trade. Similarly, we need such a mechanism for policy making.
I also think sustainable and profitable agriculture is very important to the country. Whenever you talk about inflation, you talk of the agricultural sector. We don’t need to be completely protectionist, but if the agriculture is not prosperous how will people sustain it? Also a country our size should not be depending on food imports. Sustainable agriculture will also give us food security which is paramount to national security.
Even if we have to do that with certain subsidies and protectionism, that is fine.
Q. What are your views on the debt situation?
A. This is not something new, it has been developing for the last 10 years in some form or the otherIf you look at it from 2014-2015, there was a huge jump. At present the total debt is at Rs 9,387 billion, which is 79 percent of GDP, in 2015, it was at 78 percent. In addition, domestic debt has increased but foreign debt increased at a higher rate; a 14 percent increase for the latter while the former only had an 8 percent increase.
We have had to take in new debt to refinance existing debt. The government has also resorted to more and more foreign sources for financing government funding needs.
In 2014, foreign debt was at Rs 3,544 billion and by 2016 it was at Rs 4,046 billion. So the foreign debt has increased from 30 percent in 2014 to 34 percent in 2016. The issue is how will we sustain it all?
The Central bank forecasts that the 79 percent debt in 2016, will come down to 70 percent by 2020. That is if we achieve the medium-term economic growth projections. They project a 5 percent economic growth in 2017, 6 percent in 2018, 6.5 percent in 2019 and 7 percent by 2020. But at present, we have only managed 4.4 percent growth this year.
They also project a better fiscal situation, fairly stable inflation and fairly stable interest rates. This will lead to debt sustainability.
This is the best case scenario without taking into account natural shocks to the economy.
But in the worst case scenario, if we cannot manage our growth, in my estimate, debt can increase from 79 to 87 percent by 2020. Then the country would have to go through credit restructuring and you find yourself in a debt trap. I am not saying this would happen but if you don’t take action to put the situation in order, grow the economy at a higher pace, you are looking at possibilities where the debt stock will become unsustainable.
Q. What’s the best strategy to restructure debt?
A. At this point, we have to hope that we will have a good growth scenario which will take our fiscal policy under control so that we will be able to slowly pay off debt and future cash needs will be funded by private sector involvement in development projects. The government cannot be the provider of capital for development purposes. The government has to say we cannot increase debt and we need to get the private sector involved through public-private partnerships, so the burden shifts from government to private sector. This is where capital markets can be of use too. But for all this, we first need a sound long-term economic policy to know where we are headed.
