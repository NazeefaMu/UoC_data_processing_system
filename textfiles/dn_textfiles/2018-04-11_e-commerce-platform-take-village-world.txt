E-commerce platform to take village to world

The Postal Department will establish an e-commerce platform to sell products from the village to the world. The project is known as ‘Beyond Post’ and will come under the domain www.bepost.lk
“The Be Post system will be implemented soon. It will connect the online community of the world to the villages,” said Postal Minister M. H. A. Haleem.
He was addressing the press at the Postal Headquarters, yesterday.
“The project is implemented by the Postal Department without any motive for profit,” said Postmaster General D. L. P. R. Abeyratne. “We can also fulfill 14 of the Sustainable Development goals through this project. Entrepreneurs will be able to sell their homemade products such as food, clothing, handy craft items and sweets. We will not keep a big profit margin because the Postal Department is not profit motivated,” he said.
The project will be launched with the cooperation of the National Enterprise Development Authority.
“We have over 300 development officers working in villages and they will recognize and provide the entrepreneurs to us. The entrepreneurs will be monitored during the first six months and if the authority is satisfied with the quality, the authority will provide the entrepreneurs with the SLSI certificate and a certificate for Good Manufacturing Practice,” said National Enterprise Development Authority Director Lakshman Wijewardana.
When asked about funding, the Postmaster stated that no state funding was used for this project and the project will be a public-public partnership between the Posts Ministry and the National Enterprise Development Authority. He said the ministry will take full responsibility of handling the income and distributing the income to entrepreneurs.
