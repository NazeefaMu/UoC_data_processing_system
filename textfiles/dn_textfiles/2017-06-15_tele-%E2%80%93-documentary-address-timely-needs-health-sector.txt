Tele – documentary to address timely needs of health sector

A tele-documentary on Responsiveness in Healthcare was launched by the Health Ministry in Colombo recently, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the Directorate of Healthcare and Safety of the Health Ministry has produced this tele-documentary with the technical assistance of senior medical professionals in the country.
The main objective of the tele-documentary is to address the timely needs of responding to the non-health expectations of patients / consumers of healthcare such as prompt attention, dignity, communication, confidentiality, autonomy, quality of basic amenities and social support during care, the sources said.
Health system responsiveness has been identified as one of the intrinsic goals of the healthcare system contributions. Responsiveness relates to a system's ability to respond to the legitimate expectations of potential users about non-health enhancing aspects of care, the sources added.
