Madushan and Himaya most outstanding players

 
Fourteen year old Madushan Suriyabandara of Maliyadewa College, Kurunegala (men’s) and Himaya Dewindi of Karandeniya Central College, (women) were adjudged the most outstanding players of the tournament at the annual Mora’s Table Tennis Championship organized by the University of Moratuwa and worked off over the weekend at the Indoor Stadium of the University of Moratuwa.
Despite the ongoing GCE Ordinary Level Examination there was a very good participation of paddlers at this championship, which turned out to be a successful one for the outstation players who grabbed the major honours.
Fourteen year old Himaya Dewindi from Karandeniya Central College was off to an inauspicious start when she lost the girls under 15 singles event to virtually unknown player Aishath Rafa Nizim of Stag Table Tennis Academy in straight sets. She once again fared badly in the girls under 18 singles, losing this time 2-0 to Amadhi Seya Siyambalapitiya of Musaeus College.
But this little girl did not lose hope and fought back with tenacity in the higher ranked events. She first won the Women’s Novices Singles defeating Sanaya Buddhadasa of Visakha College 2-0. Her improved form was evidenced in her winning this event quite comfortably 11/3 and 11/4.
Climbing further higher she won the Women’s Intermediate Singles event and her opponent in the finals was once again Sanaya Buddhadasa of Visakha College and won 2-0 in straight sets. But the loser displayed a lot of fight quite different from the earlier one Sanaya lost the first set 11/9 and stretched the winner upto 11/12 and was unlucky not to have leveled the scores which could have forced this event into a possible five sets.
Coming from a school off the beaten track Himaya Dewindi shows plenty of promise and if groomed properly she could be in the reckoning. Her court craft was good and the rallies were well directed. Staging in two age group finals and winning the two higher group events which followed shows she is one of perverance type. Another 14 year old to steal the honours was Madushan Suriyabandara of Maliyadewa College, Kurunegala who won a triple crown by winning the boys under 15 and under 18 singles and rounded off by taking Men’s Novices Singles.
Having just entered her teens Aishath Rafa Nizim of Stag Table Tennis Academy – an unknown quantity at table tennis put up a sparkling display to win the girls under 12 and under 15 singles event. Very few girls from the Muslim community participate in sports but this little girl possibly casting aside the purdah put up a grand display to win bother her events in a very convincing manner and did not lose a single set.
Aisath Rafa Nizim’s win in the girls under 15 event ranks very high as she demolished the ultimate Most Outstanding player Himaya Dewindi by scores of 11/8 and 11/5 which shows that the loser had no chance. One could only hope that she will be in this sport for a long time.
Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy has produced another good paddler in Dinewini Dissanayake who won the girls under 8 singles title with a 2-0 win. Holy Family Convent, Kalutara has produced another good player in Micheli Maleesha who grabbed the girls under 10 titles.
Dulaj Ranatunga of Sussex College, Kandy too came up with a good display in winning the Mens Intermediate event with a 2-0 win in the finals.
