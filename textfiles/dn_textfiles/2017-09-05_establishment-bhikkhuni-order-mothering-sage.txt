Establishment of the Bhikkhuni Order: Mothering a sage

 The Buddha always stressed the fact the woman can always achieve Nibbana being a laity. Women entering the monk establishment will lead to more complications. If the monk order has the life span of 10,000 years, the Buddha went on to say, it will go down to 5000 years when women join it. He likened the Bhikkhuni participation as a house full of women being vulnerable for smugglers. It will disturb the peace of the monk's mind and make the path for misuse, mostly
The Buddha’s initial rejection for a Bhikkhuni Sasana is scoffed at by feminists from some quarters. They question if the woman cannot achieve the Nibbana. This shows their lack of common sense as well as ignorance of teachings. The Buddha was only reluctant to install the Bhikkhuni order, but he preached to women such as his mothers and wife: Maya, Prajapati, and Yasodhara.
Prajapati had the support of 500 wives of princes. They all shaved their heads, wore yellow robes, and met monk Ananda. Only following monk Ananda’s continuous request did the Buddha accept the Bhikkhuni Sasana on a Binara Poya. Prajapati became the first nun in the Buddhist order, but on eight conditions:
1. The monk shall be given priority in respect and deference over the nun.
2. The nun shall spend rain retreat away from the monks.
3. The nun shall seek consent from monks about Uposatha and teaching of Dhamma.
4. Upon violating a rule, the nun shall be punished before the community of both nuns and monks.
5. The nun shall confess any wrongdoing before the community of nuns and monks.
6. The nun shall be ordained before a gathering of nuns and monks.
7. The nun shall not treat a monk badly.
8. The nun shall not teach a monk.
Maha Prajapati Gothami – the name goes on to mean that she would have a large retinue - played an instrumental role in the Buddha’s lay life, by bringing him up following Queen Maya’s death. She was Maya’s younger sister. Dandapani and Suppabuddha were her brothers. She had Nanda and Sundari Nanda from King Suddhodana, hence they became the Buddha’s step siblings.
Bhikkhuni participation
The Buddha always stressed the fact the woman can always achieve Nibbana being a laity. Women entering the monk establishment will lead to more complications. If the monk order has the life span of 10,000 years, the Buddha went on to say, it will go down to 5000 years when women join it. He likened the Bhikkhuni participation as a house full of women being vulnerable for smugglers. It will disturb the peace of the monk's mind and make the path for misuse, mostly.
Suddhodana’s death left no reason for Prajapati to remain laity since she was already a Sotapanna. She was looking out for a chance to approach the Buddha on initiating the nun order.
The Blessed One visited Kapilavatthu to settle the row between Sakyans and Kolyans on obtaining water from River Rohini.
The Buddha preached the Kalahavivada Sutta, and 500 princes became monks leaving their wives alone. Gothami had the support of these wives.
The validity of Gothami’s ordination became an issue because some nuns did not like to become nuns under her. The Buddha interfered and declared the validity of Gothami’s Bhikkhuni status.
Gothami once made an elegant looking robe for the Buddha with a distinctive material. The Buddha refused to accept it alone and suggested it should be given to the whole order. Gothami was feeling down, but then she realised it was to her own benefit – to accrue more merits.
No more re-becoming
Andrew Olendzki translates a stanza from Theri Gatha which is uttered by Prajapati Gotami. The stanza is reproduced along with the translator’s introduction.
The woman who is said to have composed this poem was Prajapati, the Buddha's stepmother and a Queen of the Sakyas. Her younger sister was Maya, married to King Suddhodana only after Prajapati herself was unable to conceive an heir. Queen Maya died in childbirth, and it was Prajapati who raised Gotama as her own son. After his enlightenment, Prajapati also left the palace and became the first of the Bhikkhunis, the order of nuns.
The third stanza suggests that her attainments included the recollection of past lives, by which she was able to verify empirically the truth of continual rebirth —the ‘flowing on’ (samsara) from one life to another. This process, as she mentions in her poem, is fueled by craving and by ‘not understanding’. In the second and fourth stanzas, Prajapati declares her attainment of Nibbana, of final and complete liberation in this very life.
It is remarkable to think that when Maya is remembered in the last stanza, the author has in mind not the icon of motherhood and sacrifice that Maya became in the Buddhist tradition, but a dearly-loved younger sister who died tragically young —without ever seeing what her son had become.
Buddha! Hero! Praise be to you!
You foremost among all beings!
You who have released me from pain,
And so many other beings too.
All suffering has been understood.
The source of craving has withered.
Cessation has been touched by me
On the noble eightfold path.
I've been mother and son before;
And father, brother — grandmother too.
Not understanding what was real,
I flowed-on without finding [peace].
But now I've seen the Blessed One!
This is my last compounded form.
The on-flowing of birth has expired.
There's no more re-becoming now.
The Buddha proved his gratitude by attending to Gothami when she was ill. He preached to her consolation. When it comes to discipline, however, the Buddha seems to have been stricter for the Bhikkhuni by making 311 rules for Bhikkhunis, whereas 227 for Bhikkhus.
