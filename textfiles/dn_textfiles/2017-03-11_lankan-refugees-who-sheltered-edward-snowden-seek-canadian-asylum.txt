Lankan refugees who sheltered Edward Snowden seek Canadian asylum

Lankan refugees in Hong Kong who sheltered rogue National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden are seeking asylum in Canada.
The three families’ lawyers have filed claims on their behalf.
Some city legislators say two Sri Lankans who have travelled to Hong Kong have been targeted by Sri Lanka police.
The refugee families fed and housed Snowden for two weeks when he fled the US after leaking thousands of files.
They are still living in poverty in Hong Kong and unable to work after providing a refuge for the American in July 2013.
Their lawyers say it is “a matter of life and death” if they remain in the city.
Canadian immigration lawyer Marc-Andre Seguin said that over the past few weeks the refugees’ lawyers felt they needed to take additional steps to speed up the process.
“It’s clear that discretionary power should be applied,” he told the South China Morning Post, referring to the ability by Canada’s immigration minister to expedite claims.
Two of the refugees - Sri Lankan nationals Kellapatha Supun Thilina and Debagma Kankanalamage Ajith Pushpa Kumara - have said they are being illegally pursued by Sri Lanka police.
They fear being forcibly returned to Sri Lanka, and that they could face violence and torture.
The refugees also say Hong Kong authorities have questioned them on their ties to Snowden. BBC
