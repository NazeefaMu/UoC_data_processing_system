Citizens' Mail

An election free and fair
This is the most peaceful election ever held in this country following a lapse of six decades. This democratic government created the peaceful environment for the people to cast their valuable vote with political freedom to criticise the government.
A country cannot be truly democratic until its citizens have the opportunity to choose their representatives through elections that are free and fair. Elections provide an important opportunity to advance democratization and encourage political liberalization.
The newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has obtained the majority of these local bodies. That phenomenon, however, should not be misread. The President and his democratic government have not lost confidence in Good Governance. The SLPP is only a party in the Opposition. Long live this government designed for the people by the people.
