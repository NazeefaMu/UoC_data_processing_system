Eighteen-hour water cut in Colombo suburbs

 
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has announced an 18-hour water cut in the Colombo suburbs.
Water supply will be shut off at 9 am tomorrow (April 4) and will be reconnected at 3 a.m. the following morning (April 5).
The areas affected will be the Kos-gas junction, Grandpass, Mahawatte, Thotalanga Baseline Road, Kelani Bridge to Dematagoda Junction and by-lanes.
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board told Daily News Online that the water supply will be disrupted due to an essential maintenance repair at Orugodawatta.
