A person was arrested by Mount Lavinia Police for the breach of trust in connection with the sale of a gemstone valued at Rs. 15 million.
The suspect is a 40-year-old resident of Beruwela, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
A person had brought the gemstone to the vicinity of Mount Lavinia Hotel on April 1. Acting on a complaint that the suspect had taken the stone but failed to pay for it, Mount Lavinia Police commenced an investigation and apprehended the suspect.
The suspect, who was questioned by police, had revealed that the stone had been pawned. Police had later recovered the stone from the pawnbroker. The suspect, currently in police custody, is expected to be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court on April 9.
