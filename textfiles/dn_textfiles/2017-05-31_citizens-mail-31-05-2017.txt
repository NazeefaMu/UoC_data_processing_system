[CITIZENS' Mail - (31-05-2017)]

Doctors’ mafia in action
The Hippocratic Oath taken by doctors becomes a great joke today. To us, it sounds very hypocritical when we look at the trend it is taking today. The elite and erudite class of doctors is fast diminishing in this country and this is accelerated by the actions of doctors themselves who agitate and resort to industrial action disrespecting their own ethics whilst endangering the lives of innocent patients.
This is a great shame.
The time is therefore high for the Government to step in and place restrictions on this new breed of doctors who care a dime for the welfare of the patient. In a new stance, they now try to pressurise the Government into facilitating elite schools to absorb their children. Sri Lanka is reputed for its high standards of education although our universities are invaded by students who do not value the free education offered. Government doctors are also employees of the Government and naturally, fall into the category of Government Servants.
Special privileges should not be given to any class of Government Servants as all should enjoy the same status. The same spoon must serve all. Such a policy must be strictly maintained in order to be equitable and fair by all.
It is also my humble opinion that the Government must devise a means of honouring public servants for their zeal in providing noteworthy and devoted service to the people. Many will strive to secure such prestige and in the process lead to the creation of a good order in society.
