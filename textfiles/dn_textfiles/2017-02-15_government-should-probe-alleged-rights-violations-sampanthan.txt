Government should probe alleged rights violations: Sampanthan

TNA Leader and Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan has pointed out that if Sri Lanka was given more time to act on the Resolution on alleged war crimes and human rights violations, the UN would have to subject Sri Lanka’s progress to the highest scrutiny.
He made this statement to the media when asked about Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s remarks that the country would make a submission to ask for more time to act on alleged war crimes and human rights violations at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva. The 34th UN Human Rights Council sessions are scheduled to take place from February 27 to 24 March. “The government is trying to evade its responsibilities when it comes to investigating into alleged human rights violations and war crimes during the last phase of the war which is also against the accepted principles of Geneva,”Sampanthan said and added that such acts by the government simply earned the government criticism and the displeasure of the Tamil people.
