Kandy SC fails by a whisker

Abu Dhabi Harlequins RC Western Asia club champs:
Last afternoon at the Nittawela rugby stadium in perfect playing conditions, Kandy Sports Club were expected to pull this game off in their favor, but failed in the process due to sheer bad luck as they were beaten by Bahrain RFC by 24 points (3 goals, 1 penalty) to 23 (1 goal, 2 tries, 1 penalty and 1 drop goal) in the Western Asia club league championship.
The teams were well matched with lots of talent and there were several phases of good rugby. Bahrain RFC tried to push and force things, but failed due to some superb team work from the Kandy Sports Club XV.
Kandy SC failed to play constructive rugby in the first half and took time to settle down which made them close the gap towards the end. The intensity wasn’t there as the half time scores indicate Bahrain RFC ahead 24-13.
In the second half, Kandy SC brushed off Bahrain RFC, and never allowed them to score a single point. In the alternate Kandy added ten points with cohesive rugby which proved they are a quality side and produced some enthralling rugby, although they failed to add on the bonus points, which would have helped them to win the title.
The title goes back to last year’s winners Abu Dhabi Harlequins Rugby Club who have a win and a draw.
For Bahrain RFC it was Mark Burnell, Irwin Philips Rich Muncaster who did the scoring and kicks at goal were off the boot of Luke Bradley.
For Kandy SC skipper Gayan Weeraratne, Anuruddha Wilawara (two) scored the tries and the goal, penalty and the drop goal came from the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe.
Referee: Norman Drake (Dubai)
