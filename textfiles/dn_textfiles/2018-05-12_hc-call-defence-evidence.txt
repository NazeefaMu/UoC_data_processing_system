Case against Ven. Dhammaloka Thera
HC to call for defence evidence

The Colombo High Court yesterday decided to call for defence evidence in a case filed against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the court was informed that the prosecution witnesses had concluded their evidence regarding the case. Accordingly, recording of defence evidence was fixed for July 17.
President’s Counsel Prasantha Lal Alwis informed court that he is expecting to submit, a list of defence witnesses through a motion. The Attorney General (AG) had filed an indictment against Ven. Dhammaloka Thera on two counts.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court by Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without valid licence following the amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in 2009.
The indictment has been filed over two counts coming under Section 22 (12) of the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act No.22 of 2009 and Section 5(3) (a) of the Public Property Act.
The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses in the case and three documents as production items in the case.
Wildlife Department officials had taken into custody a two-and half-year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Ven. Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence under the Fauna and Flora Act.
The Attorney General further alleged that the accused had also committed a punishable offence under the Public Property Act since he had intentionally kept a baby elephant without a valid licence.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed this offence on or around January 28, 2015 within the Colombo High Court’s jurisdiction.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Prasantha Lal de Alwis appeared for the accused.
