Vidyartha retains Nillagoda-Banda memorial trophy

The Bogambara Stadium came alive on Saturday as a top class game of rugby was dished out between arch rivals St. Sylvester’s and Vidyartha which was played for the B Nillagoda and P.M.L. Banda memorial trophy.
Vidyartha gave a superb display to outsmart St. Sylvester’s by 31 points (3 goals, 2 tries) to 17 (2 goals, 1 penalty) and retain the trophy. At half time it was 17-all.
The winners played with determination and indulged in a superb team effort but had to fight hard for the win. It was a nail-biting game where both teams went all-out.
Though the first half was a close affair it was the winning team’s superior speed and better handling of the ball in the second half that brought them victory.
Vidyartha’s third row played a good game being in the midst of every move. It was their dynamic forwards who made the breaks in a super game of run and pass rugby.
For Vidyartha M.A.S. Kumara (2), R.G. Alexander, S.N. Kaluarachchi and D.S. Weerasinghe one each scored the tries with C.B. Perera doing the conversions. For St. Sylvester's J.K. Dassanayake scored the tries and V.V. Jayatilake put over the conversions and the penalty.
Referee: S. Madugalle.
