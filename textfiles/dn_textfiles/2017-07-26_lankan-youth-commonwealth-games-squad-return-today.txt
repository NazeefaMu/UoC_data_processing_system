Lankan Youth Commonwealth Games squad return today

The Sri Lanka squad which took part in the Youth Commonwealth Games in Nassau, Bahamas will return to the country on Wednesday morning after a 35 hour flight from Bahamas via Miami, USA and Qatar.
The Lankans failed to live up to expectations winning only two silver medals through Kyle Abeysinghe in the 100 metres freestyle event and 50 metres freestyle event.
The Secretary of the Sports Ministry Dr. D. M. R. B. Dissanayake said that the Lankans competitors got the much needed foreign exposure by taking part in the games and in consultation with Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera he hoped to form Youth pools for all sports and give them the necessary training to improve the standard of youth Sports in the country which would help Sri Lanka to produce medal winning sports stars for the 2020 Olympics.
Although Belfast, Northern Ireland, was due to host the 2021 Youth Commonwealth Games the Government of Northern Ireland is not willing to host the games due to financial problems.
