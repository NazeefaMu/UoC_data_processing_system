Hettipola waste water contaminates Minipe Yoda Ela

The release of waste water from the Hettipola town and several other areas to the Minipe Yoda Ela would have serious repercussions in near future, Matale District Agriculture Committee Officers said.
They revealed the situation at the Matale District Agriculture Committee meeting. Thousands of families from Hettipola to Polonnaruwa and Mahiyanganaya use Yoda Ela for their daily activities. They use water from the Oya to drink and cultivate.
Residents in the areas pointed out that many hotels were set up in these areas and they release contaminated water. Tourist hotels were built up in Laggala, Bakamuna, and Elahera among others and many of them do not release waste water properly.
The Yoda Ela runs over 35 km from Hettipola to Polonnaruwa. Ancient kings had built it to provide pure water of the Knuckles Mountain range to the villages in the dry zones.
They said that if the issue was unattended, it would pose a serious health hazards before long.
They urge the authorities to direct those errant businesspersons to fix waste management systems to their business locations rather than polluting the environment.
