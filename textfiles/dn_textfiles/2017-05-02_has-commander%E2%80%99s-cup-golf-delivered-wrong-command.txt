Has Commander’s Cup golf delivered the wrong command?

The Sri Lankan golfing fraternity was baffled with a recent ruling by the Tournament Committee when the best score winner of the Commander’s Cup 2017, Tyron Perera was not awarded the trophy with a surprise announcement being made by the compere during the presentation ceremony, stating that only members of the RCGC, NEGC and VGCR are eligible for it.
Perera is a fully paid member of the Eagles Golf Links, a club that comes under the wings of the Sri Lanka Air Force, the organizers of the championship.
The event was concluded at the Eagles Golf Links, China Bay, Trincomalee on January 14 where Perera emerged winner with the best score of 36. The trophy was awarded to the runner-up with a score of 31 points. It was revealed that the Air Force Commander had stipulated that all Air Force personnel playing in their own tournament have been exempted from winning any trophy.
As all Air Force and other military men were invited by the Air Force Commander to play free for fun at the tournament, such a ruling may be rational for non-paying military men. But Tyron Perera and some other genuine fee paying non Air Force full time members of the Eagles Golf Links who paid the tournament fees and spent big amounts of money (approx. Rs 50,000 each) to attend the tournament were highly disappointed by this post-tournament ruling, which they claim was highly unacceptable in the sport of golf.
Perera emphasized that according to the rules of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in Scotland (R&A), the authority of international golf, no rule can be introduced after a tournament of golf which did not exist prior to the game, that the players were not informed before the competition began. Further a local rule that modifies an established practice in golf must be authorized by the R&A before it is implemented in a competition.
Perera also claimed such a clarification about eligibility was never mentioned in any document related to the tournament, not in the invitational flyer, nor in the confirmation and final details provided by the organizing committee.
Perera submitted an appeal to the tournament committee which is to be directed to the R&A through a committee member in charge of the competition for a ruling by the world governing body, which he claims as the R&A procedure over a suspected breach of an established golf rule at a tournament. But the tournament committee did not proceed with Perera’s appeal to R&A, instead they autonomously reaffirmed their initial decision in a final verdict, stating the matter is considered closed and the committee will no further correspond in this regard.
In that letter from the tournament committee head, Sirath Kasturiratne, with return address of the Air Force Commander justified their decision with four reasons:
1. As in the previous years, Commander’s Cup 2017 was open only to NEGC, RCGC and VGCR golfers with an authentic handicap.
2. Air Force Commander invited three Forces members with or without a handicap to play free for fun, without being eligible to win and you fell into that category though you are not an invitee, nor a member of an eligible club.
3. Vandalizing the room provided by the organizers for a player during the tournament is irresponsible and unacceptable.
4. Tournament conditions clearly stated that the committee decision related to all matters is final.
Showing the invitational flyer, confirmation of registration, thanking letter for entry fee payment and copy of the accommodation plan, all issued by the Eagles Golf Link secretary, Perera claims he was accepted for the tournament and questions if he falls to the ‘free and fun’ playing category, why did the organizers accept his tournament fees, which they could have refused due to his ineligibility initially. He also emphasized the fact that eligibility restriction was not mentioned in a single official document before the tournament.
Perera expresses surprise over the vandalism accusation which was brought against him after nearly four months if it had happened. He also questioned why the organizers did not take action to recover the damage on the spot or by lodging a complaint with the Police as vandalism is a criminal offence.
Perera says the whole drama is a disgrace to the gentlemen’s sport and he hopes that the Sri Lanka Golf Union and Sports Minister will intervene to do justice and preserve the high standard of golf in Sri Lanka.
