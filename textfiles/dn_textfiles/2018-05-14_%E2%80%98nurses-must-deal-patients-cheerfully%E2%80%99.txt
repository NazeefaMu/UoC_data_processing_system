‘Nurses must deal with patients cheerfully’

Patients interact more with nurses than with medical officers. Therefore, the nurses have to deal with patients cheerfully, Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Deputy Director Dr. Daniel said.
He was speaking at the International Nurses Day celebrated by the Nurses’ Welfare Association at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Auditorium yesterday (13).
The Deputy Director reminded that eight million nurses are serving in 130 countries. “The nurses must live up to their motto,” he said
Statue of the founder of nursing service Florence Nightingale was garlanded and floral tributes were paid to it by the Hospital Matron. Nurses in service for a long time were presented with mementos.
Awards were presented to retiring and promoted nurses and financial assistance were granted to the students who passed the Year-5-Scholarship exam.
