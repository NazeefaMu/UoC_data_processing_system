True SLFPers will attend party convention: Duminda

The attendance of the 65th Anniversary Convention on September 4 will speak voloumes as to who the true SLFPers are, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Commenting to the Daily News on the decision of the SLFP members attached to the Joint Opposition to boycott the party convention, he said the real faces of the JO members have been exposed and the SLFP rank and file should take a decision on them.
“The SLFP Convention is a significant event where the participation of all true SLFPers is expected. Non participation at this event would let down the party supporters. Those who boycott it have put their own personal agendas before the party. It is the party rank and file who would further be inconvenienced by it,” he commented.
The minister however said the Central Committee of the party has not made any decision to take action against those who boycott the convention.
He said the non-attendance of the SLFP members attached to the JO would be an incentive for the true SLFPers at village level to mark their presence at the Kurunegala rally.
Minister Dissanayake further said MP Chamal Rajapaksa called him yesterday to inform that he would try his best to attend the party convention.
“MP Rajapaksa also said that he would never support any move to split the party adding that he would take the leadership in such occasion to unify the party,” he said.
