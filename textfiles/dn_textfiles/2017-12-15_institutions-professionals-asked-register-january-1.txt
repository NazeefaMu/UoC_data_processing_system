Institutions, professionals asked  to register before January 1

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne announced that all private health institutions and health professionals in the private sector should be registered with the Private Health Services Regulatory Council before January 31, 2018, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, all private hospitals, private medical centres, private laboratories, private nurses training schools, private ambulance services and all doctors who are serving in the private sector full time and part time need to be registered with the council from January 1 to 31.
Minister Senaratne ordered the Director of the Private Hospitals Regulatory Unit Dr. Wasantha Dissanayake to implement the law against all private health institutions and doctors who do not follow instructions given to them for registration during the given time. No time will be given for registrations after the deadline on January 31.
Raids and investigations will be carried out after January 31 to detect unregistered private health institutions and doctors. The public will be educated about them once detected.
Minister Senaratne accepted the report on regulating private hospitals formulated by KPMG Company, he added.
