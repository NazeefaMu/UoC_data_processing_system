Buddhadasa’s petition against UDA rjected

A petition filed in the Court of Appeals by former Kaduwela Mayor G. H. Buddhadasa against the takeover by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) of some of its powers delegated to local authorities, was rejected on September 15 sans issuing summons on the respondents cited to appear in Court.
In this petition, the former mayor had cited the UDA, Western Provincial Council and the Western Development Minister as the respondents. Earlier, the Court of Appeals, which considered the petition on September 7, postponed the inquiry to September 15 for a final devision after taking cognizance of time facts.
