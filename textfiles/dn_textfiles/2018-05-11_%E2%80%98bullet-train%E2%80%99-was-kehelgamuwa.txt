The ‘Bullet Train’ that was KEHELGAMUWA

This ‘Bullet Train’ was made and delivered in Gampola. It had the making of hurtling through any obstacles, often times in unpredictable manners that made those in its path to scamper away. It would hurl through at blinding speed , bounce on the track and blind anything and everything that looked at it as it approached. In its infancy , as it was was being made, it had a distinguishing bounce that that even set the tracks on fire. Some called it the Gampola Express, others called it the Dharamaraja Express.
That train was better known as s TIKIRI BANDA KEHELGAMUWA.
The ‘Bullet Train’ grew from a bouncing kid to a daring bowler in the junior teams and continued to realize his dream of hurling that ball at blinding speed and his coaches who watched him run up and bowl saw in him everything that went with the makings of a ‘BULLET TRAIN’ in him.
Batsmen wobbling
And when he made it to the big league in inter-school cricket he made batsmen facing him in Kandy wobble at the legs. When he arrived downhill to play the Colombo schools the ‘BULLET TRAIN’ unleashed his thunder bolts that had batsmen ducking and weaving and preferring to be at the no strikers end.
With a run up like former West Indian speed gun Wesley Hall, he would begin his run up and let fly the ball, that when it contacted with bat, it loosened the hold batsmen had on it. When it beat batsmen, it knocked the stumps and bails they get spread-eagled. Umpires had a time walking up and adjusting the wickets constantly.
It is history that KEHELGAMUWA was admitted to Dharmaraja College by a school teacher named Seneviratne Amaranayake who was amazed after seeing the boy’s speed at delivering even a the age of 8 immediately had him admitted into Dharmaraja College.
Fast bowler’s alphabet
At Dharmaraja there was also another speedster in Sonny Yatawara who watching the 17 year old KEHELGAMUWA’S frightening speed taught him the fast bowlers alphabet, with the bouncer and the toe crushing Yorker that Yatawara was famous for.
‘KEHEL’’ as he came to be popularly called after a successful season was picked to tour India with the Ceylon Combined Schools team and then struck batsmen down long before; ‘white lightning’ Allan Donald of South Africa came to the scene by striking lightning like deliveries knocking down the wickets of Combined College Indian batsmen 8 times and amazingly all bowled and was thus seen as the West Indian Wesley Hall in the making.
Reign as speed gun
In KEHELGAMUWA’S reign as speed king and when matches against international teams were played few and far between most of it ‘whistle stop‘ ones, he bamboozled batsmen of Joe Lister’s team in 1968 which comprised mostly England batsmen returning figures of 6 for 67 which had the batsmen admiring and fearing his tremendous speed. His other best was 4 for 19 against Australia and his name and fame spread among the cricket world.
On KEHELGAMUWA a story England opener Geoff Boycot related to me and Sri Lanka’s BBC Radio Commentator Roshan Abeysinghe was this: while enjoying a cuppa in Wales during the tea break in the Sri Lanka-England Test, I reminded Boycott how he had his off bail sent skyrocketing from a delivery from a guy named KEHELGAMUWA.
He threw me out – Boycott
That question by me made him shudder and his reply. ‘That guy - finding It difficult to pronounce the name said: He did not bowl me out, he threw me out. Meaning that ‘KEHEL’ had thrown the second ball he faced before he could bring his bat to face ball. Abeysinghe will vouch for what he said.
Then he had another of the champion England batsman and one of he most graceful batsmen the world had seen in Tom Graveny. This Gloustershire ace dominated England’s batting in that era with Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington.
Graveny who was watching the terrific pace of KEHELGAMUWA from the non striker’s end was seen fiddling about with his other batting equipment with unease, especially with his ‘box’ making sure he would not be hit a stunning blow which could curtail his career. It was not long when Graveny had his leg stump sent tumbling from a snorter from ‘KEHEL’ and it had relief on his face when making it back to the pavilion.
Slips stand deep
When ‘KEHEL’ begins to bowl, the slips stand much deeper than they usually do because when if the ball is snicked it comes like a bullet from a gun and not easy clinging on to. He had a bowling action that was questionable, but in those days technology was not even thought of.
After stopping learning from books KEHELGAMUWA was’ taken into custody’ by the police. The Arresting officer was one of St.Joseph’s College’s finest cricketers in Niel Weerasinghe in 1962. Kehel joined the police in 1962 when unlike now the services recruited sportsmen and women into their ranks. To these who went for sports people were Harry Goonetilleke the former Air Force Commander and former Municipal Commissioner B.A. Jayasinghe.
At the height of instilling fear on batsmen and when the Gopalan Trophy was much looked forward to, KEHELGAMUWA grabed the wickets of former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar, Buddhi Kunderam, Salim Durrrani and Milkha Singh.
Pockets 500 wickets
In Sara cricket he pocketed over 500 wickets during a 15 year period. In 16 first class games he took 55 wickets. Once he finished his career he was selector for a number of years and also was a manager.
In the police he led them from 1969 to 1971 and catapulting the Police from the Donovan Andree to the Sara Trophy. D.H.de Silva who was Charity Commissioner and a cricket fanatic formed and named a team called Nomads. Leading a set of talented cricketers with KEHELGAMUWA as his spear head they won the Sara trophy in 1965. Elated were Jayasinghe and D.H. de Silva, the captain.
I had the opportunity of facing this speed ‘Bullet Train’ at his fastest when there was no body amour liker today. It was a Sara trophy game between Nomads and Saracens at the Nomads Ground which now stands the Nelum Pokuna.
Had no fear to face him
In that game I made a 60 odd and had no fear in facing the fast man and hitting him for fours. The more you hit him it showed anger on his face and he would come back to try and strike you. A four and the next ball will be blinding bouncer or a toe crushing Yorker. I could sense it and was ready and never cringed.
That Nomads team led by Dr. Sivanathan, had Daya Sahabandu, Skandakuar, Amresh Rajaratnam, D.S.De Silva, A.C.M.Lafir, D.P.de Silva among others and we beat them and to be a bit unassuming I was carried off the ground by the hundreds of elated Saracens supporters.
‘DS’ who is now domiciled in England visited me recently with his charming wife Sharmini and while talking of cricket we played recalled that knock that knocked the stuffings of that strong Nomads team that ultimately deprived Nomads of having a tilt at the Sara Trophy.
