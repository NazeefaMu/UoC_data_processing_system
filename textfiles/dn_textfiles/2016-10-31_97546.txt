West Indies A complete clean sweep

West Indies A led by top order batsman Jason Mohammed completed a 3-0 sweep of the unofficial one-day series against Sri Lanka A when they won the third and final match by eight runs on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss for the third successive occasion in the series West Indies A rattled off an impressive score of 305 for five wickets in a game reduced to 47 overs with centuries from Mohammed and Andre McCarthy who added 163 runs for the fourth wicket after they had got off to a poor start losing their first three wickets for 59 in 15 overs.
Mohammed struck eight fours and three sixes in his unbeaten knock of 105 scored off 108 balls and McCarthy slammed 13 fours and 3 sixes in an explosive innings of 102 off 75 balls. Due to bad weather Sri Lanka A’s target was revised to 257 off 38 overs. They were on target to achieve that total but fell short by eight runs.
Opener Danushka Gunathilaka contributed a fine half-century 58 off 60 balls (7 fours, 1 six) and there was all round contributions from the rest of the batting but it was just not enough to get them over the line. Sri Lanka A finished on 248-7 when the overs ran out.
