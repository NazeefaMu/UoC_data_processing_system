Increasing wind speeds this week

The possibility of increasing wind speed to some extent is still high over the island and surrounding sea areas, particularly in the sea areas to the Southeast and Northwest of the country, the Meteorology Department said.
Fairly strong gusty winds up to 50 kmph can be expected in the central hilly areas and in the Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Northern, North-Central, Southern and Eastern provinces and the Kurunegala district.
Several spells of showers will occur in the Sabaragamuwa, Central and Western provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. Fairly heavy falls about 50mm can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces.
Light showers may occur in the Northwestern province.
