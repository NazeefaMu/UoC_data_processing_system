Fonseka with UNP, named Kelaniya Organiser

 
Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka joined the United National Party (UNP) this morning at Sirikotha. His membership was officiated by the Prime Minister, leader of the United National Party. 
Fonseka was appointed Organiser for the Kelaniya district.
Earlier this week, the former Minister was tipped off to obtain membership to the UNP. Sources said the Democratic Party, of which Fonseka is leader would be dissolved. 
Fonseka was appointed to Parliament on the UNP National List. The UNP Working Committee made the decision following the death of M.K.D.S. Gunawardena, whose seat was left vacant.
