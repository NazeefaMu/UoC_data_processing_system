Corruption case against Fowzie re-fixed for trial

The corruption case filed against State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie, for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre, was re-fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
The Attorney-at-Law, appearing on behalf of State Minister Fowzie, told the Magistrate that his client did not appear before court because he was abroad. The Bribery Commission alleged that State Minister Fowzie had unlawfully used a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015, while he was serving as a Senior Minister during the previous regime. The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs. 19.5 million. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director-General had filed the corruption case against the State Minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Magistrate fixed the inquiry for October 19.
