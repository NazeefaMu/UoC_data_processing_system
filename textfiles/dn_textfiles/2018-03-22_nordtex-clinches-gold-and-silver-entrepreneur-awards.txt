Nordtex clinches Gold and  Silver at Entrepreneur Awards

Nordtex Private Limited, recognized among the leading manufacturers in Asia for tents, sleeping bags and bivi bags, clinched Gold and Silver Awards at the prestigious Sri Lankan Entrepreneur of the Year Awards ceremony. Organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lankan (FCCISL), Nordtex won the Gold Award for Entrepreneurship at the Provincial Level - Western Province and Silver at National Level at the gala event.
The objective of this annual event is to recognize entrepreneurial talents in Sri Lanka, celebrating excellence and encourage new thinking. In 1997, Jayasiri Silva, a first generation businessman began his entrepreneurial journey as a garment manufacturer and in 2001 founded Nordtex Private Limited as a Board of Investment venture in Sri Lanka.
Silva also soon understood the growing demand globally for camping tents, mountain climbing tents and necessary gear, camping tents when outdoors and for jungle trekking, and was able to quickly adapt his manufacturing competencies towards this lucrative sector. Additionally Silva was also able to successfully manufacture military camping gear and equipment for overseas military and carve a niche, winning global recognition.
The manufactured outdoor tents also cater to the varying and demanding weather conditions worldwide. Through the manufacture of temperature-controlled camping tents which have the ability to withstand temperatures of 20-30 degree Celsius, Nordtex products safeguard and sustain customers’ outdoor experience.
Though the company began as a 100% export driven venture, currently Nordtex also supplies its camping gear to clients in the Indian subcontinent and in Sri Lanka. These products are manufactured according to tropical environmental requirements catering to the growing demand seen in the tourism sector. Among the company’s many innovations has been the design and manufacture of temperature-controlled camping tents where despite extremely warm weather outdoors, the interior of the tent remains cool and inviting. “We seek to help those self-employed individuals in the Sri Lankan tourism sector who have a requirement for our gear as we not only look towards increasing our gains and profits,” noted Chairman and Managing Director Nordtex (Pvt) Ltd, Jayasiri Silva.
