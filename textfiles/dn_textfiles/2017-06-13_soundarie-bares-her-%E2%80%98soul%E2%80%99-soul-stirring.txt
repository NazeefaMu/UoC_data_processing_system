Soundarie bares her ‘Soul’: Soul-stirring!

Soundarie’s ‘Soul’ is a quest to win the hearts of men and women. She will sing in god’s abode, far after the last waves of the ocean die upon this earth. Her music will never die and will never be forgotten. And the best is yet to come.

‘Soul’ an evening of Original Music by Soundarie was held recently at Lionel Wendt theatre. It was an evening when we were powerlessly under the spell of Soundarie David. It was a show where every item was personally crafted by Soundarie with great passion and love.
The music and Soundarie were one that evening. It was symbiotic. It could not have been any other way. The music must flow throughout the mind of the artiste and that day Soundarie was immersed in her music. It was a phenomenal performance.
Every music item was choreographed excellently. There was some sort of a force that connected the performers to us, an irresistible force that spoke to our hearts, a force that reached out to us and compelled our attention, a force that was spellbinding and mesmeric. A cocoon of music was created around us.
Right throughout the performance Soundarie had this energy that was so admirable. It was obvious that Soundarie had put in so much effort. That is why she is one of the greatest performers in Sri Lanka. She really cares about her audience and believes in them as much as she believes in her music.
Grace and talent
Always humble, she is a fine example of grace and talent. Though she is prodigiously talented and is able to create some of the greatest pieces of music, she has never let this distract her from the focal point of her music - which is to share the gift of music God has given her. As mentioned before, music is Soundarie’s gift and it is a light to the world.
Her music undoubtedly had meaning. It speaks individually. It offers the audience the message - that life has so much beauty in it. Indeed in a pamphlet issued at the evening Soundarie speaks:
“Whilst classical music has been my training. Over the years I’ve grown to appreciate and love different genres of music. My family, friends, music legends and life experiences have been influential in my development as a musician, and have to a great extent inspired me. ‘Soul’ is my way of speaking the thoughts within my soul that words cannot express. They are simple melodies that anyone can relate to. To all those who have helped me with this concert, especially my sponsors and my amazing event and production team, a heartfelt thank you. To the musicians on stage and off, to my teachers, my family and friends – thank you for being my inspiration,” said Soundarie.
Soundarie’s emotional moment
The evening featured some scintillating performances not only by Soundarie but the artistes who performed alongside of her. Jerome De Silva delivered a rendition of Hamlet. De Silva’s deep voice and the melody played by Soundarie held the attention of the crowd.
Soundarie’s very own girls ‘Soul Sounds’ made it a night to remember. They did their teacher proud as they charmed everyone with their music. Certainly it must have been an emotional moment for Soundarie seeing these girls remaining true to her that evening. Former Stigmata member Andrew Obeysekera and Dushy Perera, both who have made a name for themselves in the music industry, performed alongside to Soundarie, making the performance one of power and a performance of the highest standard. The lighting and the special effects and the brilliance of her companions added to the radiance of the performance.
Bathiya Jayakody a childhood friend of Soundarie’s did not disappoint as he crooned the evening away doing a little dance as well. Shehara Liyanage delivered a performances that may indeed have raised goosebumps. Her voice certainly was magnetic.
It was a performance that showed us there was something bigger than ourselves out there. Truly music is universal and unites people. Because that day the crowd was united in wonderment.
There was a real appreciation of the music.
But more than anything music healed all of us. Soundarie’s music has the potential to heal. That day it really entered our minds and it was like a balm applied. The music was personally crafted by Soundarie, who I am sure is not unaware of the heights her music can lift people up to.
The compering too blended nicely with the evening with the witty Danu nicely introducing his witticisms at appropriate points.
And all throughout the performance there was Soundarie seated at her piano, the center of the performance. Despite the fine performances one could not help but look at her as she seemed to direct the flow of energy.
