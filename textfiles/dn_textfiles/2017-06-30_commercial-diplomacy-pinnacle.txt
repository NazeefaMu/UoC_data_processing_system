Commercial diplomacy to the pinnacle

He most obligingly shared his art of governance with the Daily News, but artfully refrained from revealing the names of his most disliked political opponents!
“Being a politician, I avoid that question. I have three or four who can be named, but I don’t want to do so.”
Ironically enough, as the government went for a Cabinet reshuffle in early May, barely five months after UK’s Banker selected Ravi Karunanayake as the best Finance Minister of the Year, Asia Pacific 2017, he swapped his ‘favourite’ portfolio with that of Mangala Samaraweera!.
“No post is permanent,” he agreed, “But the concern I had was the mannerism in which it took place.” The sudden and abruptness it happened certainly was very much to his surprise and beyond his comprehension, the newly appointed Foreign Minister reiterated.
However, now having established himself as Foreign Minister, Ravi Karunanayake said that his new role would be to ensure that Sri Lanka has a strengthened relationship with the entire world. He is geared up to carry forward the government’s foreign policy- Friends with all, enemies with none.
“Building bridges and moving forward should be our theme. That’s the policy that we would like to pursue with substantial weightage being given to commercial diplomacy that could basically be taken advantage of.” he said. “This would basically mean instead of aiding ourselves, we trade, and ensure that investments are established in the country. And likewise we need to diversify our exports - we need to have market diversification- and this is what we want to carry on,” he emphasized.
New role
Commending his predecessor’s role in correctly projecting Sri Lanka internationally, Karunanayake stressed that his role would be to build further from there onwards with the assistance of the President and Prime Minister.
“So my feeling is we are closer now than what we were and we would certainly strengthen that further.”
Sri Lanka has already assured the UNHRC of her commitment to accountability and reconciliation. Immediately after the August 2015 Parliamentary Election, the government co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 titled ‘Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka’, which was adopted unanimously by the UNHRC, October 1, 2015.
As former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera repeatedly emphasised this decision manifested the “Government’s open, sincere and proactive approach to dealing with Human Rights issues.”
Minister Karunanayake expressed his commitment to reconciliation and rehabilitation in the post war Sri Lanka.
“The Reconciliation process is on at the moment, and you could see a new constitution being looked at, and certain matters which were outstanding which were solved on the political platform are being put to test and also being discussed to be put into action. So my job is to steer clear from those areas and navigate it through all these trying circumstances that are there. But at the end of the day we must ensure that it is acceptable to all communities and also an improvement on what it was. That does not necessarily mean that it panders into the wants of many. It is wants of everybody that has got to be looked at.”
Entry into politics
After having started his career as an accountant, Karunanayake entered active politics in the eighties.
“I was working closely with Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, and in the 1980s he had a passion for getting young professionals coming in. Well, in the process we were discussing many matters. Following his sudden and untimely demise his wife took over the party. And on that basis there was an opportunity which came through the alliance in 1994 where Mrs. Athulathmudali was given the choice of two National List MPs. The vision of Lalith Athulathmudali was carried out by her. So that is the advent into it [politics.]”
However, Karunanayake added that the role he played as a National List MP was a passive one. During a political debate which took place between Karunanayake and the late Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle over the privatization of SriLankan, the latter challenged him that he was a mere National List MP.
“Do the same thing by getting elected, Jeyaraj said. That was an open challenge which was taken up.”
In 2000, Ravi Karunanayake was elected to Parliament from the Colombo District receiving more than 145,000 votes.
He was among the Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) of the Year 1999. He was presented with the award for Young Outstanding Politician of the year in 1999 at the National event organised by the International Jaycees.
“I am happy to receive it and I am sure that they selected me at that moment because I was performing good enough,” he recollected.
As Karunanayake noted, the UNP’s responsibility was thrust upon Ranil Wickremesinghe at a time nobody wanted to lead the party.
“He had been blamed at every given moment that the UNP was in Opposition because of him. But he had the vision, the character, and he didn’t dare the system like other unscrupulous politicians did. So that’s how he is where he is and people have respect for him because of that. But I saw the (leadership) trait in him, that he was able to foresee things as a visionary, while others looked at such things from a personal level.”
Lesser known qualities
Karunanayake calls himself a hard taskmaster.
“I like to get things done and I don’t accept fake excuses. And my answer is why can’t you do this. Don’t tell me it cannot be done, but how it can be done. That basically enables you to have a target that is achieved and if you do not set a target upon yourself you can’t basically ensure the things are going forward,” he said.
Politicians like Lee Kuan Yan, Margaret Thatcher, Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Tony Blair had foresight and aspiration to take their respective countries forward. They provided clear guidelines and development targets for the country and ensured that all targets were achieved at the end of the given period.
Karunanayake said that having role models to look up to will enrich one’s life.
“I consider President J.R. Jayewardene as a role model. And what I have heard of Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike, but not associated. Also Lalith Athulathmudali for sure,” he said.
Karunanayake also noted that sometimes he is at a disadvantage as a politician because he had mostly been projected negatively by his political opponents.
“Well, unfortunately people think I am snooty and unapproachable, but once they meet me, the entire perception changes thereafter. My standpoint is that we have not inherited anything, but we are all self made and on that particular basis if we can do it why can’t the others do it. I want to be a voice to the voiceless. That was when I came into politics,” Minister Karunanayake emphasized.
He sees himself as a friendly person. “I am a very friendly person by nature. Until somebody tries to hit me or stab me from behind, I basically accept them at face value - as being good.”
“Politics is not a bed of roses. It is one of the worst things that can be done. But if everybody says that, then who is going to be there in the system? Owing to the fact we have got an opportunity and the people have confidence in us, we want to challenge our opponents and tell them that it can be done, not that it cannot be done, and why it isn’t being done.”
During his tenure as Finance Minister, he motivated the entire ministry to work as a team.
“When we are working very hard in the Ministry, some people think it is for the reason of corruption, others think it is because we want to have dominance. But there’s also a group who makes the best use of the given opportunity. Through that I could motivate the entire Ministry to work as a team. And instead of a one man show that was there, it was converted from secretary downwards as a team - a family that was working towards achieving targets. And this annoyed many, because they don’t work hard, but they are very willing to basically say there is corruption or inefficiency in the ministry,” he said.
Explaining his new plans as Foreign Minister, in addition to commercial diplomacy, Karunanayake said when it comes to foreign policy he believes that there should be a much more proactive and forward thinking approach.
“And that is what we basically have to have at this particular moment.”
Vision
“Sri Lanka is a gem in the world. And it is being exploited by a handful of unscrupulous guys, selling the country for nothing and we must work together to ensure that we are able to get it to a developed stage which can easily be obtained and that’s the reason why I’d love to see things happening here.”
Karunanayake wants him to be seen as a common person with the people.
“Not above or below, but with them. This is the fallacy that did exist owing to the fact that my political opponents have been projecting me in a wrong way. Out of 24 years, almost 18 years we have been in the Opposition. So when you make political strides they try to hit you down by either malicious practices or malicious media campaigns. I am a victim of such propaganda and to prove otherwise, it takes time. It is only now they see the reality,” he added.
His fervent message/request for the youth of the country is not to throw away the opportunity that is before them.
“You have a bright future. So ensure that you have the confidence and give us the opportunity to deliver this to you,” he said.
“The country has the best opportunity with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe working hand in glove. On the 8th of January there were a few who came along with President Maithripala Sirisena and worked around with the majority UNPers and formed the government. Since then we are a Unity Government in operation. But that does not mean that anybody who came subsequently (who are trying to basically play double games on President Maithripala Sirisena) and trying to bring distrust between the Prime Minister and the President needs to be tolerated. The younger generation have confidence in President Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe,” he added.
As he emphasized the youth needs their own future to be guided.
“They don’t need to be living on subsidies, they have to got to have an economic environment that they don’t have to run after politicians to get their job done. Stand on your own feet is what we want and that’s what we are heading towards. Sometimes sunshine stories are easily sellable, but the quality of that is only long felt thereafter. We have delivered what we said, unlike others who merely talked and not delivered.”
When asked as to why the young are not too keen to take up politics, he said the younger generation despise politicians “because everyone is a bigger rogue than the other!”
“I think some of our political colleagues need to upgrade themselves because the degradation, that has been taking place since the late ‘60s and early 70s has had a spillover effect. “And today if you are known as a thug or a rogue that is a politician! A very few that are in there try to change this. And they are sometimes hammered and character assassinated out of proportion.”
“My overall message to our citizens is we have basically come through the roughest of times and been given an opportunity to spearhead this into a developed nation. This cannot be done in one day owing to the economic ruin that we have inherited. But that does not mean that we have to keep blaming the past. We have confidence that we have the vision, the will and the know how to take us to that developed nation that we want to build. This will not happen in a day, but most certainly we will be able to do it before 2020.”
Life outside politics
Minister Karunanayake is a family oriented person.
“The little time that is available I try to maximize with my family - wife Mela and three daughters.”
“My fervent hope is that whatever I can do for my children, will be done for the country,” he assured.
He recollected his early days in life as the eldest in a family of two boys.
“I have another brother younger to me. We were brought up in the estate environment. My father was a Superintendent of an estate in Ratnapura and then subsequently in Kalutara. He died when I was barely 12-years-old.”
They faced an uncertain future following his father’s death.
“There was a sense of insecurity. And that led into forcefully setting targets to get our jobs done. Well, we had a limited amount of assets that were inherited, but in general we had to strive to survive.”
His mother who was a housewife until his father’s death decided to move to the hotel trade in order to ensure a happy and stable future for her sons.
Karunanayake first studied at St.Thomas’ College and then moved to Royal College and subsequently became a Charted Management Accountant. His brother is currently working overseas in the airline trade.
Other than politics and family, his love for music, sports and reading current affairs keep him occupied! He is an ardent cricket fan as well as a badminton player. “During my school days I played for Royal College. I love music (western music overall and Sinhala Baila), but can’t sing for toffees!”
He prefers Chinese, Indian, spicy food and sweets and his favourite dish is crab curry.
“I don’t drink or smoke at all.” he emphasized. “My father used to drink very heavily, and the repercussions took a heavy toll on me.”
