Baker’s dozen to  Committee of Selection

A much awaited session of Parliament begins today at the Diyawananawa which is scheduled to see the appointment of a baker’s dozen to the Committee of Selection which shall include the leaders of political parties in the House or their nominees to be nominated by Parliament.
The Speaker will be the head of the Committee of Selection. According to Standing Orders of Parliament, the Committee of Selection shall consist of the Speaker who shall be the Chair and 12 members that shall include the leaders of political parties or their nominees to be nominated by Parliament at the commencement of each Session.
The duties of the Committee of Selection are to consider the Constitution, number, functions and quorum of Sectoral Oversight Committees and Ministerial Consultative Committees and to report with all convenient speed their opinions thereon to Parliament, and to nominate Members to serve upon other Committees.
The 12 members of the Committee of Selection will then appoint the Committee on Parliamentary Business. This Committee too is headed by the Speaker. The Committee of Selection will appoint members to the Committee on Parliamentary Business which consists of the Speaker who shall be the Chair, the Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Chairperson of Committees, the Leader of the House of Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, the Chief Government Whip, the Chief Opposition Whip and eight other Members.
The Standing Orders say, “the duty of the Committee on Parliamentary Business shall be to consider and decide on the time that should be allocated for the discussion of such Business of Parliament and such other matters as the Speaker, in consultation with the Leader of the House of Parliament, may refer to the Committee the minutes of meetings of the Committee on Parliamentary Business shall be circulated to all Members.”
We asked officials at Parliamentary Secretariat who will get the majority of the entire membership in the Parliamentary Business Committee. The officials responded, “The majority of the membership is usually given to the government, even if it comes with an alliance.” Government Chief Whip and Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said Monday in Parliament that they shall secure the majority of the entire membership of the Parliamentary Business Committee.
