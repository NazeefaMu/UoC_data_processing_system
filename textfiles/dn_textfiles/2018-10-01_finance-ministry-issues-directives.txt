Easing pressure on rupee
Finance Ministry issues directives

In an attempt to ease the pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee, the Finance Ministry has taken measures, which came into effect on Saturday night, including the halting of vehicle permits issued to members of Parliament for a period of one year.
In a communique, the Ministry said that the issuing of vehicle permits to members of Parliament will be suspended for a period one year.
The importation of vehicles for government ministries, departments, statutory boards, and state-owned enterprises will be suspended until further notice. Importation of vehicles using the concessionary permits issued to entitled state sector employees will be suspended for six months. No letters of credits (LCs) will be permitted to be opened based on these permits during this period.
Meanwhile the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) for hybrid vehicles will be revised from 70:30 to 50:50 basis. Importers of all vehicles other than buses, lorries and ambulances will have to keep a 200 percent cash margin at the time of opening of the LCs. Further, the requirement of 100 percent cash margin has been imposed for the import of refrigerators, air conditioners, televisions, perfumes, telephones including mobile phones, washing machines, footwear and tyres.
The government will continuously monitor the exchange rate fluctuations and will take appropriate action accordingly, the statement said.
