Soil shortage delays Southern Highway construction

The construction work of the Southern highway from Beliatta to Hambnttahas delayed without soil, Project Director K.W .Kandambi said.
He was speaking at the District Development Committee Meeting held at the Adminstration Complex at Hambantota. He said four lakhs cubes of soil were required for the construction work and by 2019 the Highway would be ready for transportation. “But the lack of soil may result in delaying the work,” he said.
