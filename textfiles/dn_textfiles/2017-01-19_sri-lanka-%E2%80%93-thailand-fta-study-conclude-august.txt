Sri Lanka – Thailand FTA study to conclude in August

 
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen in Thailand for the APTA Ministerial Council, met with Thai Minister of Commerce Apiradi Tantraporn who assured him the feasibility study on a FTA between Sri Lanka and Thailand would be completed by August 2017.
Minister Bathiudeen also met with Thai consumer goods exporters, product manufacturers and consultant of the Thai government’s One Tambon One Product (OTOP) project, a local entrepreneurship stimulus programme.
The Minister told Thai exporters of consumer goods (sprats, rice, canned fish, green gram, sago seeds, shoes, and vehicle parts) that his ministry intended to open 80 new Sathosa outlets in Sri Lanka, as well as open 8,000 new franchise outlets and asked the consumer goods exporters to provide him with samples and prices.
Due to the fact that Sri Lankan sugar importers have decided to halt importing sugar from Brazil after cocaine was found smuggled in with sugar containers, Minister Bathiudeen met one of the largest sugar exporting company in Thailand ‘MitrPhol Sugar Corp Ltd’ to explore the possibility of importing sugar from Thailand - the company was asked to provide information on sugar prices and the capacity they can supply.
Minister Bathiudeen expressed interested in Thailand’s OTOP project - the concept of promoting ‘one product for one village’, and asked consultants for their assistance.
The Industry and Commerce Minister also requested technical assistance in the areas of gem & jewelry, food processing, agriculture, electronics, automobile components from his counterpart Commerce Minister Apiradi Tantraporn.
