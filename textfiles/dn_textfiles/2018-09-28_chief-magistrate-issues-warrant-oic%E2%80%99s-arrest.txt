Chief Magistrate issues warrant for OIC’s arrest

Anuradhapura Chief Magistrate Janaka Prasanna Samarasinghe issued a warrant for the arrest of the Anuradhapura Anti-narcotics Division Officer-in-Charge, for failing to appear in court to provide evidence regarding a heroin case yesterday.
The Chief Magistrate ordered police to execute the warrant through the Unit’s Superintendent of Police, Thilina Hewapathirana.
The OIC had been named as a witness in a case against three suspects arrested for heroin possession.
The case was fixed for trial after the suspects pleaded ‘not guilty’ to the charges.
