Govt should take discovery of weapons seriously - Weerawansa

 
National Freedom Front Leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said the government should take seriously the discovery of explosives and weapons from several locations in the North, including the detection of a suicide jacket in Chavakachcheri, instead of hurriedly labeling them as outdated ones hidden during the war.
Speaking to the media in Colombo, Weerawansa stressed that there was a threat to national security and the government should make swift moves to bring the situation under control.
Weerawansa hit out at Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi noting that the comments made by the latter indicates he has taken the findings lightly, which could be a grave mistake.
He said that it was the government's responsibility to conduct a full-scale probe without dismissing the findings as outdated weapons and explosives hidden during the war.
Weerawansa also said that some findings of weapons and explosive have gone unreported.
