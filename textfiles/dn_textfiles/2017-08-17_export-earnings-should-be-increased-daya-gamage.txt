Export earnings should be increased: Daya Gamage

Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage yesterday, stressed the importance of increasing export earnings of the country to escape from the looming debt trap.
He was participating at a function held at ANCL. The Primary Industries Ministry has to overcome the challenge of doubling export earnings by 2020. A proper plan has already been prepared by the Ministry to reach that goal, said Minister Gamage.
The Minister further stressed the importance of adapting modern technologies to enhance the country's production. "Earlier our export income was mainly based on tea, rubber and coconut. But, today we have to focus our attention mainly on cinnamon since there is a huge demand for cinnamon in the international market. Hence, the Ministry plans to enhance the earnings of cinnamon exports from $160 million to one billion US dollars," he added.
