Sri Lanka’s multiplex cinema at Colombo City Centre mall

With the opening of Sri Lanka’s first international mall set to take place next month, preparations are underway to launch Sri Lanka’s first multiplex cinema situated on its 3rd floor, which will be operated by local entertainment company, Scope Cinemas.
“We want to give the denizens of Colombo a cinematic experience on par with the best in the world,”said Anand Sundaram, CEO of Colombo City Centre. “Partnering with Scope Cinemas aligns with our vision of transforming the urban fabric of Colombo, as they have successfully set the benchmark for delivering world-class entertainment in Sri Lanka.”
Spread over 16,000 square feet, the multiplex cinema has been constructed with an investment of Rs. 350 million in order to establish itself as Sri Lanka’s premier destination for audio-visual entertainment.
The multiplex will feature 700 seats divided between 6 screens with 4K projection technology and Dolby Atmos surround sound systems, ensuring a state-of-the-art experience - befitting of the international standards that the Mall at Colombo City Centre operates on. The scale of the multiplex enables the screening of at least 25 interval-free movies per day, and will also leverage Scope Cinemas’ international partnerships to host exclusive screenings of highly-anticipated movies, giving Sri Lankans the opportunity to enjoy global blockbusters a day before their worldwide premieres.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lanka’s first BOI-approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019. The USD 180million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans, and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and rises 47-storeys above the heart of the city. Honored as the ‘Best Mixed Use Development’ by PropertyGuru Asia, ‘Most Promising Mixed Use Development’ by CMO Asia, ‘Asia’s Greatest Brand’ by AsiaOne Magazine and ‘Upcoming Mall of the Year’ among several other accolades by the Golden Globe Tigers, Colombo City Centre is a multi award-winning skyscraper dedicated towards transforming Sri Lanka’s capital into a global metropolis with the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind.
