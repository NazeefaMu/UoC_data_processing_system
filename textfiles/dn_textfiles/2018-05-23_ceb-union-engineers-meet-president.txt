CEB union engineers meet President

Members of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)Engineers Union who had met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, called on the President to initiate action against the regulator for the power sector, the Public Utilities Commission for failing to heed to the President's orders. "The President was irate that even after he had given his directive verbally and in-writing, the PUCSL called for meetings without approving the Generation Plan," said Executive Committee Member Athula Wanniarachchi.
"We too echoed similar sentiments and asked that legal action be sought. Hence, the President has sought the Attorney General's view on the matter for the way forward."
Wanniarchichi alleged that even after the President had given his permission to go ahead with the Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board on April 25, the PUCSL dragged its feet on the matter by repeatedly calling for meetings.
"Even then, the Chairman of the Commission was absent at the meeting and it ended inconclusively," he said, "We have asked for the President to intervene and bring an end to this stalemate."
The CEBEU however had suspended their work-to-rule campaign in the areas affected by the floods.
