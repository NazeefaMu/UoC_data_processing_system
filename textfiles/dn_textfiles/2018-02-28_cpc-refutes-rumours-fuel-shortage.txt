CPC refutes rumours of fuel shortage

The country has no diesel shortage whatsoever, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in a statement issued yesterday said refuting rumours of a diesel shortage spread by certain parties.
The statement said the corporation would take stern legal action against the parties trying to drive motorists into panic by spreading false news about a diesel shortage.
The corporation had received information that a social website and certain sections of the media were trying to destabilise the country by spreading a false rumour about a diesel shortage countrywide, the statement added.
Adequate stocks of diesel, petrol, kerosene and other fuel are held at the Kolonnawa oil installation terminal and the Muthurajawela installations and as such it would request people not to panic.
The corporation has already taken steps to lodge a complaint with the CID requesting it to take firm action against people spreading false information.
