Putting the country’s cricket back on track – Sports Minister has to take the initiative

When iconic cricketers such as Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Muthiah Muralitharan and Roshan Mahanama who have served for over a decade and brought honour and distinction to the country through cricket turned down a formal request made by the national selectors through the Minister of Sports to serve in the capacity of consultants to help resuscitate the country’s dipping fortunes, there has to be a very good reason for it.
The reason these cricketing legends gave was that they had no “trust in the system”.
What that means is that the recent current cricket administration cannot be trusted and as the past two years have proved it has only brought Sri Lanka cricket down to its knees.
Why these players have refused is not that they are turning their backs on the country’s cricket but with a change of administration and with the right people in place they would certainly extend a helping hand. They do not want to tarnish their good name by being tagged with the present set of administrators many of whom have several question marks against their names.
Coming on the heels of that rebut is a letter sent to the Minister of Sport signed by several past presidents of Sri Lanka Cricket urging him to appoint an interim committee to clean up the mess that the country’s cricket has fallen into.
The saddest part of interim committees is that they cannot run for a long period of time as the ICC does not encourage government appointed committees.
Also, when the interim committee has put the administration back on track elections are called for and all the good work done is brought to naught when the elected officials go back and repeat the same mistakes that had led to the appointment of the interim committee itself. This scenario has become part and parcel of the country’s cricket history.
One of the signatories to the letter calling for a change of administration is Rienzie Wijetilleke the first chairman of the interim committee that was appointed in 1999. It has to this day proved to be one of the best that has served Sri Lanka cricket.
But as has been the fate with all interim committees this committee with a wealth of knowledge and experience in cricket and in administration comprising Wijetilleke, Michael Tissera, S Skandakumar, Sidath Wettimuny, Ashantha de Mel and Kushil Gunasekera sadly didn’t see eye to eye with the then Sports Minister SB Dissanayake that led to their resignation.
During their short tenure the Wijetilleke interim committee put forward a proposal that recognised the rights of the stake holders namely the clubs and affiliated associations to elect the office bearers annually. But what was most important was that it recommended in addition the creation of a Board of Governors (BOG) above these office bearers to ensure accountability.
The argument was that it was not prudent to leave it in the hands of honorary office bearers who get elected or rejected annually, the deployment of millions of dollars without sufficient checks and balances.
To be fair by the system it was also recommended that the Board of Governors should comprise partly of men with experience in the management of the game. A minimum of three past Chairmen/Presidents of IC/SLC were recommended to hold office on a rotation basis of say 2 to 3 years. Their familiarity with the affairs of SLC was an obvious advantage. At its end a further three members will be appointed on the same basis while the incumbents step down.
That Board will be further strengthened by a financial head of high standing and a judge of equal repute.
Over a period of time this proportion can be adjusted as required. The honorary office bearers will NOT be permitted to incur any expenditure above a specified limit without the approval of the BOG. All policy decisions will be referred to the Board for concurrence in effect creating a structure of accountability like in the private sector.
The BOG will meet every fortnight with special meetings convened when required and most importantly the decisions of the Board of Governors will be final and the Sports Minister will NOT interfere in their function.
It is doubtful that any radical changes will be forthcoming and quite unlikely that the Sports Minister would give up his hold on the game. What should be considered is a structure for accountability within the current system.
This is food for thought for the present Minister of Sport and one hopes he not only listens but acts meaningfully if he is really serious about uplifting the country’s cricket fortunes that at present is at low ebb.
