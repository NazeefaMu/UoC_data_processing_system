Sigiriya open from 5 am tomorrow

Sigiriya Project Office of the Central Cultural Fund has decided to open Sigiriya for visitors from 5 am tomorrow (September 27) to mark the World Tourism Day.
The Manager of Sigiriya, Project Officer Major Anura Nishantha said the decision was reached to enable both local and foreign tourists to observe the sun rise from the top of the Sigiriya rock.
Several ceremonies have been organised at Sigiriya to mark World Tourism Day where a special new mobile app would be launched. The app would enable the tourists to listen to a recording on the historic importance of different places of interest for tourists visiting Sigirya.
The Central Cultural Fund plans to open a park of herbal plants in Sigiriya.
