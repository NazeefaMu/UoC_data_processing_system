‘Premier will rebuild country destroyed by UNP’

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has commenced an operation to rebuild the country which was devastated by the United National Party for the last three years, said Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga.
Ranatunga stressed the importance of forming a stable government to revive the ailing economy and said the country should go for a snap General Election soon.
He was addressing a meeting organised by the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna, at Galkanda in Minuwangoda.
Ranatunga added that everyone asks why the Prime Minister accepted this post at this time. He said there would not have been a country, if Mahinda Rajapaksa had waited any longer.
He said former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe faced defeats in 27 elections.
“Wickremesinghe wants to stay in the seat for good. He has no concern about the country or the party,” Ranatunga said.
Ranatunga added that the UNP will face a humiliating defeat at a General Election.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is acting in violation of Parliamentary traditions and Standing Orders, he said.
He said the Speaker is trying to portray a picture internationally that the country is in turmoil, with the ulterior objective of becoming the common candidate of the United National Party.
“The country is in crisis as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is dreaming of becoming the common candidate of the UNP at the next election,” he said.
