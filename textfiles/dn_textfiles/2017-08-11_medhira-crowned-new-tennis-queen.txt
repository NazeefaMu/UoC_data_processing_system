Medhira crowned new tennis queen

102nd Tennis Nationals :
In an open women's singles final which featured two Ladies College lasses battling for the crown, number seventh ranked Medhira Samarasinghe created a major upset by beating the number one ranked school mate, Anika Seneviratne in easy straight sets 6/2, 6/2 to bag her first ever national singles title as the 102nd Tennis Nationals continued at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) courts yesterday.
Both Medhira and Anika maintained an unbeaten record till the final, becoming top favourites for the title. Both finalists overcame strenuous semi final battles as they had to recover from first set defeats in their three set semis. Medhira beat the top seed Thisuri Molligoda 5/7, 6/4, 6/3 while Anika had the better of Savini Jayasuriya 5/7, 6/2, 6/3 in semis. Anika was in great form since she climbed to top rank with her recent victory at Colombo Championship but was unable to continue her winning streak to clinch the national singles title. Anika and Jithmi Jayawickrama won the women's doubles title last Wednesday beating Medhira and Amritha Muttiah 6/1, 6/1.
18-year-old Medhira who has an impressive tennis career represented Sri Lankan Fed Cup team several times including this year. She has shown great promise over the years and proved her potential at the national and international levels.
Sanka and Yasitha win men's doubles title
Lankan Davis Cup players, Sanka Athukorale and Yasitha de Silva proved their supremacy by winning the Open men's doubles final beating Inthujan Selvaratnaraja and Udayachandran Srinath 6/3, 6/3. Top seed Sanka and his partner Yasith had no trouble in routing their strong opponents in easy straight sets in yesterday's title clash.
Sanka and Yasith defeated Rustom Ali and Sree Biplob Ram 6/1, 6/3 while Inthujan and Udayachandran edged out Kevin Makandarajah and Amith Weerasinghe 6/1, 6/0 in their respective semi finals.
