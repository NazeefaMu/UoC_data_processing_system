Call to extend PRECIFAC term

The Presidential Commission Investigating alleged acts of Fraud Corruption, Abuse of Power in State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to extend its term by another six months.
The reasons adduced by the Commission for this request is that it needed more time to prepare final reports regarding 18 public petitions of which investigations have been completed.
The other reason is that the Commission is in league with the CID and FCID currently investigating 117 public petitions it had received, regarding mass scale corruption and misappropriation of state funds and assets during the Rajapaksa regime.
