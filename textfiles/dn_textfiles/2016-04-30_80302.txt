TMO introduced at Bradby Shield today

Following the events that led to the suspension of Trinity College captain Rahul Karunathilake a Television Match Official (TMO) will be introduced at the 72nd Bradby Shield encounter between Royal and Trinity at the Royal Sports Complex today. Dinka Peiris has been appointed as the man in charge with Aruna Shantha and Rohan Fernando assisting him.
Wimal Perera, former referee and IRB qualified CMO will be in the box as the first TMO to officiate in the country. Karunathilake was shown two consecutive yellow cards that amount to a red card suspension during the match against S Thomas’ College last week. The Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association Disciplinary Committee on Tuesday carried out the inquiry and examined the video footage of the match in order to make their final decision. – (WAI)
