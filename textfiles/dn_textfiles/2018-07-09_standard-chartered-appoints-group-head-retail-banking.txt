Standard Chartered appoints Group Head of Retail Banking

Standard Chartered has appointed Vishu Ramachandran in the new role of Group Head, Retail Banking, further strengthening a team that is focused on delivering world-class banking services to customers in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Building on the significant progress we have already made in Retail Banking, Vishu will continue accelerating our efforts to digitise our business, enhance our value proposition, and grow our affluent and emerging affluent client base.
He will report to Ben Hung, Chief Executive Officer of Retail Banking & Wealth Management and Regional CEO of Standard Chartered, Greater China and North Asia. He will take up the new role on 16 July 2018.
“His long experience in retail banking, and strong track record of managing different aspects of the business, make him an ideal choice to lead the team as we help our clients around the world achieve their financial goals through simple, convenient, secure banking,” said Ben.
Vishu’s experience across a range of banking roles will help ensure that we deliver transformational initiatives that aim to ensure simple, convenient and secure banking for our clients around the world. These include new digital capabilities such as chat, video banking, voice recognition platforms and new payment options on mobile, disrupting new and existing markets, and partnering with fintech, bigtech and world-class multinationals.
Vishu has three decades of banking experience, including as Standard Chartered’s Head of Retail Banking for South Asia, the Middle East, Pakistan and Africa. His roles at the bank have included Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the retail bank, and he has been the Global Chief Risk Officer for Retail Banking since 2015.
“With retail market pools forecast to double in Asia, Africa and the Middle East over the next decade, we are focused on offering a differentiated customer value proposition in all our markets, delivering cutting edge, convenient banking services to clients in more than 30 countries. We’re also investing significantly in our future – in digital, wealth management and infrastructure - which will ensure that we continue to be a banking partner of choice for clients across our network,” he said.
Standard Chartered banks affluent and emerging affluent clients across Asia, Africa and the Middle East, attracting new customers who favour our respected international brand, cross-border reach and wealth management capabilities.
