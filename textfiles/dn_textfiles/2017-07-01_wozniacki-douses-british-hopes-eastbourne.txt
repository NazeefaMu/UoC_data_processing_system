Wozniacki douses British hopes at Eastbourne

EASTBOURNE June 30: Caroline Wozniacki extinguished British hopes at the Eastbourne pre-Wimbledon event on Friday, knocking out Heather Watson to reach the final after a back injury forced Johanna Konta to withdraw.
Seventh-ranked Konta, who suffered a nasty fall in Thursday's win over world number one Angelique Kerber, pulled out of her semi-final against Karolina Pliskova before Wozniacki accounted for Watson 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 at Devonshire Park.
Konta banged her head and back heavily after a horror tumble during her quarter-final victory over Kerber and has been diagnosed with a thoracic spine injury.
The 26-year-old is Britain's best hope of ending a long wait for a women's Grand Slam champion that dates back to Virginia Wade winning the 1977 Wimbledon singles title.
Konta, who won the prestigious Miami tournament earlier this season, had originally been passed fit to play on Friday but decided to pull out to avoid risking further damage.
“The most important thing for me is to look after my health in general,” said Konta, who because of the backlog of matches at Eastbourne had to play twice on Thursday.
“We made the decision based on the fact I'm still quite sore through my thoracic spine. Next week is Wimbledon but I make decisions for my health. AFP
