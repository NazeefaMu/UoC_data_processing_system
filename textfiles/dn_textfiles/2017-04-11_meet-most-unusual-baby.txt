Meet the most unusual Baby

‘The Boss Baby’ is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated comedy film, loosely based on the 2010 picture book of the same name written and illustrated by Marla Frazee. Produced by DreamWorks Animation, the film is directed by Tom McGrath and written by Michael McCullers. It stars the voices of Alec Baldwin, Miles Christopher Bakshi, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kimmel, Lisa Kudrow and Tobey Maguire. The film grossed $108 million worldwide.
Animation and the director of Madagascar invite you to meet a most unusual baby. He wears a suit, speaks with the voice and wit of Alec Baldwin, and stars in the animated comedy, DreamWorks’ The Boss Baby. The Boss Baby is a hilariously universal story about how a new baby’s arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator, a wildly imaginative 7 year old named Tim. With a sly, heart-filled message about the importance of family, DreamWorks’ The Boss Baby is an authentic and broadly appealing original comedy for all ages. This unusual animated film is bolstered by a unique visual flair with important lessons for children in the audience.
‘The Boss Baby’ is screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.
