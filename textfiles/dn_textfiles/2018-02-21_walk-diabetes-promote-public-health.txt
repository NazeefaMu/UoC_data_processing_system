Walk for diabetes to promote public health

More than 3,000 people participated on day one of the Walk for diabetes. The Walk for health and Run for life campaign got off to an auspicious start with the religious ceremony involving all religions along with the three forces and police in Trincomalee on February 19.
The Run for life campaign was a run involving children from many schools in Trincomalee and the walk to Colombo had more than 3,000 participants. Day one ended after the first 40 km was completed.
This national level campaign covers four provinces in Sri Lanka, namely Eastern, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western. Five screening campaigns are open free of charge to public along the route of the walk.
Public in the four provinces can make use of these facilities to test themselves for diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity as well as get free advice. For those with diabetes, special arrangements have been made to test their eyes and feet by specialist teams. These screening campaigns are organized in Trincomalee, Kandy, Dambulla, Mawanella, Yatiyanthota, Kotiyakumbura and Battaramulla from February 19 to 25.
