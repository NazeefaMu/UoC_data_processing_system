Outward Bound invests in instructor development

The Outward Bound – Sri Lanka (OBTSL) nominated their three senior trainers to undergo the 21-day Classic Course on enhanced Safety Procedures conducted by Outward Bound Singapore and Malaysia from March 13 to April 2, and from December 1 to 21.
The three trainers had successfully completed the programme participating in all activities including water-based activities.
This programme is of importance due to recent unfortunate incidents which occurred during so-called ‘Leadership Training Courses’ conducted by other service providers.
OBTSL also organized a Training of Trainers Programme titled, ‘Technical and Safety Skills Refresher Course’. It was conducted by the Trainers from Outward Bound Malaysia - Lumut.
Yasid Saud, Head of Training and Development Mohamed Nayan – Technical Expert conducted the programme from January 15 to 18.
This is an ongoing part of Outward Bound Sri Lanka’s commitment to the highest standards of participant safety.
