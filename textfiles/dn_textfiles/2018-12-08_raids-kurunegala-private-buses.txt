Raids on Kurunegala private buses

The Wayamba Provincial Transport Authority has accrued over Rs. 200,000 with fines last months.
Over 436 private buses were checked and many of them had no timetables, licences and not in good condition for passenger transporting, officials said. The Authority sources said many buses issue tickets that have no fees printed on them.
