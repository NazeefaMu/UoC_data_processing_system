Parents donate brain dead son’s kidneys to two patients

Parents of a youth from Bibile named K.Y. Lakshan Pramodya (19) of Dewaketiya who was pronounced as brain dead at the Ampara Hospital following a road accident, had donated the boy's two kidneys to be transplanted on two Kidney patients in Kilinochchi and Kurunegala.
The beneficiaries of this kind gesture are a Tamil woman from Kilinochchi and a youth from Kurunegala who had been suffering from the kidney disease. The two kidneys had already been transplanted on the two patients.
Lakshan's father Y. K. Sarath Indrapala said they have five children. The youngest son Lakshan injured in a three wheeler accident was pronounced brain dead at the Ampara Hospital after being transferred from the Bible and Badulla hospitals. He and his wife had decided that their son's kidneys should be donated to give life to two needy kidney patients. They were extremely happy to have committed this meritorious act in the name of their dead son.
Lakshan's mother L.H. Kumudini said she hoped to see the two beneficiaries at their son's three months dana offered in the name of their departed son.
