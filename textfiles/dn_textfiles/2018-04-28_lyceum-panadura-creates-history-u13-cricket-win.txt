Lyceum, Panadura creates history with U13 cricket win

Over the last few years the Lyceum International school chain has established a proud record of having produced some sportsmen/sportswomen in the field of cricket, athletics and swimming.
These sports men and women were able to show their skills in the sports arena in national and international sports events and in the Sri Lankan Schools Under 13 Division III cricket tournament organized by the Sri Lanka School Cricket Association with the sponsorship of Singer Sri Lanka annually.
Lyceum International School, Panadura outshone her competitors in the field of cricket by winning the Singer under 13 Div. III cricket tournament 2017018 recently bringing repute to the school amidst 481 schools in the fray.
It was the first time that an international school in the country has become the champs of a Singer Sri Lanka School Cricket tournament under 13 Division III cricket. The school team was captained by Nathen Liyanage. He scored 90 runs and took 2 wickets in the semi-finals and in the final against Vidura College Thalawatugoda played at Thurstan College grounds he took the man of the match award by capturing one wicket and scoring a patient 24 not out off 82 balls.
During the tournament Lyceum played 13 matches and won all of them to remain unbeaten. Liyanage took 40 wickets and scored 494 runs and was well supported by his vice captain Yeshith Kalupahana who took 23 wickets and scored 701 runs in the tournament. Both captain and vice-captain shared a record first wicket partnership of 303 (unbroken) against Uggalbada Vidyalaya in the knockout stage which is probably the highest for that wicket in division III. Liyanage’s contribution in the partnership was 107 not out and Kalupahana’s 217 not out.
The fast bowling department was well supported by Akmal Fazly and Rahula de Silva. The spin bowling department was led by Dilnaka Daluwatte who took 37 wickets. He was well supported by Rusiru Fernando and Manuja Pothpitiyage.
Liyanage who made his alma mater proud said that team spirit was behind their victory.
