SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament:
Colombo led by Sri Lanka cricketer Dinesh Chandimal qualified for the final of the SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament final when they beat table leaders Kandy by four wickets in a low scoring match played under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Both teams played their final round robin matches. The other finalist will be decided after the outcome of today’s match between Galle and Dambulla at the same venue under lights. Colombo who picked up a bonus points finished on top of the pile with 16 points. Kandy on 12 points has no chance of qualifying unless today’s match ends in a no-result or a tie. In that event Kandy, along with Dambulla and Galle will all be tied on 12 points and the net run rate will come into play to decide the other finalist/
Currently Dambulla and Galle have 10 points each and the winner will qualify to play Colombo in the final on April 30 at the R Premadasa Stadium under lights.
Yesterday’s match was quite in contrast to those played before it where high scores were the order of the day.
The two sides in yesterday’s match could muster only 275 runs and last a total of 56.5 overs out of a maximum of 100. Kandy batting first were bundled out for 136 in 31 overs and Colombo used up 25.5 overs in knocking off the required runs scoring 139-6.
The highest individual score of the match was from Shehan Jayasuriya whose knock of 30 off 48 deliveries (2 fours) and his sixth wicket partnership of 68 off 85 balls with Sachitra Senanayake (22 not out off 9 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) sealed the match for Colombo after they were tottering at 47-5. Jayasuriya had earlier played the part of bowler capturing three wickets for 14 runs with his off-breaks to derail the Kandy batting.
Kandy were also badly placed at one stage at 96-9 before a last wicket partnership of 40 off 42 balls by Amila Aponso (22 n.o.) and Nuwan Pradeep (14) saw them to their final total which in the end proved insufficient to defend. Fast bowler Vishwa Fernando although going for plenty finished with figures of four wickets for 61 runs.
Scores: Kandy 136 in 31 overs (Mahela Udawatte 22, Amila Aponso 22 n.o., Vishwa Fernando 4/61, Shehan Jayasuriya 3/14, Wanidu Hasaranga 2/19)
Colombo 139-6 in 25.5 overs (Wanidu Hasaranga 29, Shehan Jayasuriya 30, Kithuruwan Vithanage 26, Sachitra Senanayake 22 n.o., Amila Aponso 2/34, Sachith Pathirana 2/35)
