Dissanayake challenges Rajapaksa to submit sworn affidavit

Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake challenged Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa to submit a sworn affidavit stating that he did not receive Chinese funds during his Presidential campaign in 2014.
“The often spoken about subject these days is that Mahinda Rajapaksa received USD 7.6 million from the Chinese during the last Presidential election. Why would a Chinese company give such a large sum to Rajapaksa? We never got such money. I ask you, our country was under British imperialism then, is it now under Chinese imperialism? We do not wish any wrong on Rajapaksa. He worked for the country and helped finish the war. So we say, give us a sworn affidavit saying that you did not take this money, then we can trust you.”
The minister said thus at a UNP pocket meeting held in Ragala.
The minister as the National Organizer of the UNP, spoke to the people about the challenges ahead for the party and explained that the UNP - as the oldest party in the country - has for the last 70 years created exceptional leaders.
“The party does not revolve around one family. It is open for all and they can start from the bottom going up to the Presidency.”
The SLPP is fighting among themselves over who should run for the Presidency; will it be Basil, Chamal or Gota; because they will not let any other, from outside of the family contest, he added.
“But we have to come out of this tribal mentality. We will name our candidate when the time is right. We have jockeys who can win. We have jockeys from the upcountry- we have no problem. The Presidency is not limited to one family”.
“Last time, even with a weak electoral campaign, we were able to win 33 percent of the vote. As the National Organizer, my duty is to increase this to 40 percent. I admit there are certain misgivings among the UNP supporters. We need a programme to support our supporters. And we hope to do this in the near future,” added the minister.
