Await stylish steps!

For the first time in Sri Lanka, the Lionel Wendt Art Center will be graced by 14 award-winning dance troupes hailing from all over the island and the world. Kapila Palihawadana, the globe-trotting founder of Sri Lanka’s first contemporary dance company Natanda Dance Theater of Sri Lanka, called the upcoming gala “an exploration of cultural identities, ethnic reconciliation and peace building.” The five-day dance festival is not just about dance, he affirmed, it will be about bringing people together.
Besides the Natanda Dance Theater, the other local talent at the fest include Jaffna’s Jonson Rajkumar, Ratnapura’s Sithija Performing and Dance Academy, Batticoloa’s Batticaloa Theater Lab, Kandy’s Natanda Community Dance and Colombo’s drumming maestros NAADRO. Ali Chahrour of Lebanon, The Aviary Birdgang Dance Company of UK, Lawrence Sackris of Malaysia, Oliver Tharpaga of the USA, Goblin Party of South Korea, and Sanjib Bhattacharya of India make up the international ingredients of this grand event, and were all handpicked very carefully, said Kapila Palihawadana, based on the merit that their dancing has done for the community. Some examples include USA’s Olivier Tharpaga, originally from Burkina Faso, who organizes dance fests himself and volunteered to take part in this Sri Lankan edition free of cost, or Birdgang of the UK who uses dance to elevate children living on the streets, or Sanjib of India who uplifts the elderly with dance.
Although it has been called a ‘contemporary’ dance festival, there will still be that unmistakable infusion of the tradition and culture of Asia’s diverse regions, whether it is in the Odissi steps of Indian origin, in the beat of African drums, or in the storytelling of ancient Kandyan dancing. Thujan Sivasupramanaiyan of the Batticoloa Theater Lab, spoke of how dancing in his troupe meant “placing traditional dance as the base, and then building modern or contemporary dance upon it.” Dance is explored as not just a form of art at the festival, but also a form of reconciliation in a post-war Sri Lanka. Thujan and his colleague Selvaraj Rajiv are tutored under Professor Maunaguru who is a great innovator of the traditional Koothu dance form, and they spoke of how dancing is a kind of “release” from sorrows and tensions. Kapila Palihawadana concurred that dancing together, regardless of race or nationality, engenders respect for one another. “It is something you do with your body,” he explained, and the body is an equalizer among all peoples. Dance somehow then seems to be an interesting tool for dialogue in an evolving Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan dance has a vibrant and deep history - we have 2500 years of dance experience in Kandyan dance alone - and the timeline has reached an exciting peak today, as ‘contemporary dance’ in Sri Lanka is only now truly emerging. Dance, and in the same vein, theater and poetry, are striving to become self-sufficient industries on their own, no longer cowed down by the corporate mantra that art and culture studies are not worthy of pursuing. Kapila Palihawadana, much like many other Asian artistes, had to work against his parents’ advice in pursuing his dream of succeeding as an artist; when asked about this popular Asian mentality about the arts as a career, he said that art is crucial to us in that only art can give people “a sense of living and a sense of feeling”, and only it can swallow up the mistrust and miscommunications that plague our communities.
Dance is a personal, raw means of expression, wherein the body speaks and is incapable of pretense - the Natfest celebration of dance means great things in terms of the creative growth of Sri Lanka’s art scene, and also in our attempt as a nation to discuss our various cultural identities and challenges in a new language. While the concerts will take place in the evenings between November 14 and 18 at the Lionel Wendt Art Center, the public also have the privilege of participating in three-hour workshops with the local and international dancers in the daytime, at Nelum Pokuna for only Rs. 500 per day. Tickets will be available at the Lionel Wendt) from November 1.
