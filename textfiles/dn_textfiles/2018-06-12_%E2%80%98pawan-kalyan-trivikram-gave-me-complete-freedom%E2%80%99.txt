‘Pawan Kalyan, Trivikram gave me complete freedom’

Lyricist-turned-director Krishna Chaitanya speaks about his love for cinema and the making of his next film ‘Chal Mohana Ranga’.
On long break…
My first directorial Rowdy Fellow was released in November 2014. Two years later, I started working on my second film Chal Mohana Ranga (CMR) on November 16, 2016. Trivikram and I discussed the story of CMR and worked on the screenplay for six months. Once everything is locked, we started the shooting before he moved to Agnyaathavaasi. That way, I took a gap of two years but technically speaking, as far as the release date is concerned, I took a break from the direction for four years (smiles).
A light-hearted story
Chal Mohana Ranga is a light-hearted entertainer. It’s a simple story of two young people, who fall in love, part ways and fall in love all over again. Most love stories are similar to identical situations but the way the narrative unfolds makes the difference here. The film has a compelling narrative with memorable and relatable characters. Megha Akash will be seen as a half-Telugu and half-Tamil girl Megha Subrahmanyam, while Nithiin plays Mohana Ranga, who aspires to leave for the US for better prospects. It’s a proper Telugu film with a moderate cross-culture drama in the second hour.
Once in a lifetime opportunity
Trivikram Srinivas liked Rowdy Fellow a lot and he was interested in working with me when I met him with Nithiin post the release of A…Aa. When he offered me this film and said he is providing the story...I took it as a privilege and grabbed the deal because it’s once in a lifetime opportunity. Being a director, we should be flexible enough to direct films penned by other writers. That way, he was convinced that I can do justice to his script.
