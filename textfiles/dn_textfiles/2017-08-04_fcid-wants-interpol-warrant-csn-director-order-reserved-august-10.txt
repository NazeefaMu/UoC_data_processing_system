FCID wants Interpol warrant on CSN  director: Order reserved for August 10

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) yesterday pleaded with the Kaduwela Magistrate to issue warrants on Shadya Karunajeewa said to be a director of the Carlton Sports Networks through Interpol.
The FCID filed the case against the original Director Board of the CSN including Yoshitha Rajapaksa under the Money Laundering Act. Police charged that the suspects have failed to divulge how they originated funds for the establishment of the CSN Network.
FCID officials told court they have received information that suspect, Shadya Karunajeewa is living in Australia and pleaded court to issue an arrest warrant on him through Interpol.
The magistrate after considering submissions made by lawyers on behalf of Karunajeewa into account, reserved the order for August 10.
