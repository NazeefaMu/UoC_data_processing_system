Politics in garbage

The cracks on the walls were too large for Rasika Sanjeewa, 41, to ignore; a threewheel driver by profession and the father of three, he, along with his family, left his home next to the Meethotamulla garbage dump three weeks ago, wanting to spend his New Year in relative safety.
When he came home on Friday afternoon to check on the cracks, he witnessed his home being completely demolished an enveloped by a mountain of garbage.
“We returned to check on our home after having lunch at a friend’s house. We stopped the vehicle on the street in front of the house when my daughter screamed that there was water flooding into the street. When we looked up, the mountain of garbage had collapsed, and the ground shook as it came tumbling down, shifting and burying the houses at the bottom,” said Sanjeewa, who managed to escape a few feet away from his house, which used to stand 30m away from the dumpsite.
According to Sanjeewa, the Meethotamulla tragedy; a disaster which has thus far killed 28, could have been easily prevented.
“The cracks in our homes were quite visible. Three weeks ago, we complained to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner and asked that we at least be given six months’ rent until more suitable accommodation is found or compensation given,” said Sanjeewa.

Their request, however, yielded only partial results as only a few of the affected residents received aid and the rest were told to wait.
Sanjeewa said, “The foundations of our houses were being raised over the last few weeks; the weight of the dump was too much. On 12th morning, we visited the Commissioner again and complained that we could not spend the New Year with children like this. On 12th evening, they called us back and said a solution would be given to us after the New Year. This is the solution we got.”
“The authorities just do not care for our neighbourhood. If they paid more attention, this would not have happened,” he added.
Colombo Municipal council Commissioner V.K. Anura, in the meantime, blamed the recent heavy rains for the collapse of the garbage mountain and added that people had been warned to evacuate the area many times.
“The CMC warned the people to evacuate the place and informed them that it was a high risk area, but they refused to listen. They assaulted the CMC workers and chased them whenever they went to Meethotamulla to clean the canals surrounding the dump so there would be better water flow. The drains were cleaned except the place where the garbage dump collapsed. The people there did not let us carry out our work,” he said.
Anura further said that the people in that area, including the President of the Movement against the Garbage Dump at Meethotamulla Lawyer Nuwan Bopage, were partly responsible for the collapse as they refused to let CMC manage the place.
Sanjeewa, however, said they had tried their best to get the CMC authorities to clean the drains,
“We had to force them to bring their backhoes down and clean it. We never beat anyone up when they came to clean, the authorities just don’t care or come to our neighbourhood,” he said.
Looking for solutions
The issue of garbage is not a new one, and for several decades, consequent governments have struggled with its management.
Prior to Meethotamulla, the site of contention was Bloemendhal where Colombo’s garbage found its way home since 1997. After several disasters and explosions, the Supreme Court ruled in 2009, that waste could no longer be dumped at Bloemendhal and needed to be shifted to another site; they asked the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to assist the CMC in acquiring a land for such a purpose temporarily until a more permanent solution is found. In 2009, the UDA offered two acres of UDA land in Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa, to be used as landfill site for waste from Colombo. The temporary solution, eight years later, refused to budge.
“Over the last eight years, there have been around 60-70 projects brought to deal with the waste in Meethotamulla, but the UDA has rejected all of them. Even the Western Provincial Council Chief Minister’s proposals were rejected," said Member of the Kolonnawa Urban Council Saliya Wickramasinghe as he stressed that the two acres in Meethotamulla was only to be used for two years, but has now extended to 17 acres, eight years on.
He further explained that the UDA, under the previous government, was controlled by then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and it was he who directed the whole project at the time,
“Gotabhaya got the army to clean the surrounding canals and maintain the dump, but they did not stop dumping of the garbage,” he said.
In 2014, the dumpsite collapsed on a minor scale and damaged 20 houses in its wake.
After the present collapse, however, President Sirisena had directed that all dumping in Meethotamulla be stopped and the sites of Dompe and Karadiyana be used temporarily for the next two weeks until a more permanent site is found. Shifting garbage from one site to another, however, has not been easy, and the last time the government proposed a site in Ja-Ela, protests from the public prevented garbage being moved there.
An uneasy CMC Commissioner tasked with getting a new landfill site said that there was no need to specify on a site or where the garbage wash going as long as Colombo City was clean.
“This is a national issue. The President and the Prime Minister are looking for ways to solve this issue. This is not only Colombo garbage. People from all parts of the country come to Colombo. More than 600,000 people come every morning for work and they throw their waste here. We also clean Pettah’s daily supply of vegetables and all the other items to other parts of the country. The waste remains in Colombo,” said Anura.
Solutions offered
As the problem worsened, in 2014, the previous government proposed the solution of transporting the waste generated in Colombo and surrounding suburbs to Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam District by railway transportation. An amount of $107 million was allocated for the project by cabinet. The garbage was then to be used as fuel in the Holcim factory.
In 2015, the new government axed the plan due to various environmental concerns and public protest as a result of the plan. Minister of Megapolis and Western Province Development, Champika Ranawaka, said the Puttlam site’s proximity to the Wilpattu Wildlife sanctuary had caused concern,
“But if there’s no solution, it will be not only Wilpatttu that will be destroyed but Colombo too if the Kelani river on which three million people depend for water is polluted by waste,” Ranawaka said at the time.
Another solution which has been proposed for the last decade or so is the converting of garbage into electricity. In June, 2010, Cabinet approved a proposal submitted by the then Minister of Environment Anura Priyadarshana Yapa to use garbage from Bloemendhal to generate power. The project did not see the light of day.
To make recycling efforts more effective, the separation of waste at the point of collection is important. According to the CMC, 200 metric tons of waste can be reduced at the point of collection, if they are separated. Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, in July, 2016, decreed that all waste needed to be separated if it is to be collected but few local government authorities have implemented the decree of the central government ministry.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in the meantime, announced that in the next three years, the government would have a national strategy to deal with issue of garbage. He asked that priority be given to Colombo and suburbs given the amount of waste generated in these areas.
Accordingly, the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development this year received Cabinet approval to set up Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres to turn garbage into electricity. They also received approval to implement a ‘feed-in-tariff’ (flat tariff for 20 years) of Rs 36.20/kWh for electricity purchases from these centres.
Garbage, instead of being dumped in Meethotamulla, would be moved to the centres to be established inThumbowila, Karadiyana, and Muthurajawela by Fairway Holdings Pvt Ltd and KCHT Lanka Jang Pvt Ltd.
Wickramasinghe, however, pointed out that this plan would not necessarily tackle the existing garbage in Meethotamulla,
“The new centres will only deal with new waste that is generated. Ranawaka has no plan for the existing garbage,” he stressed.
Minister Ranawaka, however, yesterday declared that dumping of garbage on lands owned by the UDA would be banned from 1 May.
He added that the municipal councils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and government institutions would have to bear the expenditure of disposing garbage themselves.
According to Ranawaka, a Cabinet paper was issued in February by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, which clearly stated that the CMC should refrain from dumping garbage in Meethotamulla, and they were advised to find alternative places.
Tug of war
For Wickramasinghe, who has seen the mountain of garbage rise every year in his electorate, the lack of solutions come from the inability of the central government to work with the local government to solve the problem.
A government official who wished to remain unnamed said that interference from the ministries attached to the central government, especially when it came to garbage management, was the main reason for the issue to remain unresolved over the years.
“Whilst the Provincial council has the authority over waste management, different ministries come up with their own proposals. The Provincial council is responsible for the final disposal of garbage,” he said.
He claimed that over the years, ministries often asked that local government authorities implement their plans, rather than that of the proposals put forward by the provincial council.
“This is a clear violation of the law. In the meantime, certain ministers disregard the initiatives taken by the provincial council in trying to implement their own plans. The provincial council needs to be strengthened,” he added.
He noted that waste management was a subject which needed to be constantly adapted to local situations and needed flexibility when implementing,
“The proposed projects will take another two to three years to implement, but what are they going to do with today’s waste?” he asked.
He further questioned that if the UDA and the Government did not want garbage dumped at Meethotamulla anymore, what did they propose to do with the existing waste at Meethotamulla?
The Western Province produces 60 percent of the total waste produced in the country. The same procedure cannot be adopted in all the provinces as the type and the amount of waste generated differ from each province, said the official.
He suggested that if the ministries were to take initiative to deal with the garbage issue, they should rather focus on industrial and clinical waste while letting the provincial councils manage the municipal solid waste. “Municipal waste is not as hazardous as the industrial and clinical waste, so the Central government would be better suited to handle more hazardous waste,” he said.
Sri Lanka has 18 municipal councils, 37 urban councils, and 256 Pradeshiya Sabhas. These local government authorities are responsible for waste disposal in their respective areas and employ more than 8,000 employees to operate 172 special dumping trucks, 618 four-wheeled tractors, 205 two-wheeled tractors, 1,152 hand carts, and 83 other equipment for waste collection (Colombo Municipal Council, 2012). The question now is where are they heading with our garbage?
