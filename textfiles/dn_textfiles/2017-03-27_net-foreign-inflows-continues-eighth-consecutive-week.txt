Point of view
Main share price index closed at their lowest in nearly 12 months on Thursday, dragged down by Diversified, Banks & Telecom shares, as anticipation on rate hike weighed on sentiment.
The main share index declined ~68 points by Thursday to close below 6000 mark for the first time since Mar’16 to end at 5979.85 before bouncing back on Friday to close at 5996.28 points.
Average turnover levels, however increased to 0.85Bn, ~56 higher than last week’s average turnover of LKR 0.55Bn and ~20% higher than the year’s average turnover levels (LKR 0.69Bn) boosted largely by HNI & Institutional investors.
Large parcels in JKH (37% of the crossings), Serendib Hotels (27% of the crossings) & Melstacorp (13% of the crossings) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover as total crossings accounted for 59% of total market turnover.
Foreign flows into the Bourse meanwhile was positive for the 8th consecutive week to end at LKR 1.32Bn, (~ 250% higher W-o-W) bringing the total net inflows for the year to LKR 3.26Bn. Markets in the week ahead are expected to recover from this week losing streak.
CBSL hikes rates to curb inflation and credit growth
The CBSL raised policy rates by 25bps this week (SDFR: 7.25% SLFR: 8.75%), reversing its stance over the last 8 months of holding rates steady.
Policy rates, were last raised in July last year, and the CBSL cited that tightening of monetary policy was necessary as a precautionary measure to curtail inflationary pressure and possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressure through excessive monetary and credit expansion.
CBSL believes current high inflation levels (CCPI 6.8% in Feb’17 cf. 5.5% in Jan’17) which is largely due to both supply-side pressures (weather disruptions and tax revisions) and demand driven pressures stemming from the growth momentum in economic activities particularly in construction related activities and services related activities (financial services insurance and telecommunication) to revert back to mid-single digit levels in the near term unless disrupted by adverse inflation expectations.
Simultaneously CBSL is also cautious of the slower than expected deceleration in monetary and credit growth that could result in demand side pressure in the near term, which also resulted in tightening of the monetary policy stance.
(Private sector credit growth which overshot the target of 20.0% Y-o-Y to end at at 21.9% Y-o-Y by Dec’16 despite higher market rates (rates increased > ~500 bps in since Oct’15) slowed down marginally to 20.9% Y-o-Y in Jan’17)
