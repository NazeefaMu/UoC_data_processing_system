Country suffered 181 b loss from H’tota Port, airbus deal- PM

The country suffered a loss of Rs.46 billion from the construction of the Hambantota Port. The highly questionable purchase of eight long distance airbuses caused a loss of Rs 135 billion. The total loss from these two alone is Rs.181 billion,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe added.
The Prime Minister speaking at a public event in Hatton yesterday stated that the corrupt deals behind Bond sales from the years 2007-2015 are far more serious than the questionable bond sales currently being investigated.
The Prime Minister vowing to investigate into corruption charges of the previous Governments said two Parliament Select Committees would be appointed to look into the allegations on the projects of Uma Oya and Hambantota Port.
The Premier went on to say that the media too had toed the line and journalists such as Lasantha Wickrematunga and Prageeth Ekneligoda, who dared to expose the corruption of the previous regime, were killed or abducted.
