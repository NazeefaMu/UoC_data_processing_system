Pakistan to resolve SL betel exports issue

Pakistan recently assured Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen that it will help resolve the growing crisis faced by 5,000 Lankan betel grower families.
“We will give favourable consideration to the betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters,” said Pakistan's Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra on July 31.
Minister Bathiudeen was meeting Dr Sipra on the import tax issue faced by Lankan betel leaf exporters to Pakistan.
On June 21, 2017, the Government of Pakistan imposed a Pakistani Rs 200 (SL Rs 291.00) per kg of new regulatory tax on betel leaf imports from Sri Lanka.
This was on top of the existing Pakistani Rs 343.00 (SL Rs 500) per Kg of Pakistani customs duty imposed on Lankan betel leaf as of June 21.
“Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera has informed me of the plight faced by Sri Lanka’s betel leaf growers” said Minister Bathiudeen. “Pakistan has imposed a new regulatory tax on Sri Lankan betel imports. This has affected more than 5,000 farmers and their families in Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Puttalam Districts. Pakistan is the only country where Sri Lanka’s betel leaves are exported to. Sri Lankan betel also the main betel leaf type imported from Pakistan. Lankan growers have informed us that there is a big yield in betel harvest this year but due to the new tax by Pakistan, they are unable to recover even their export duty costs. We need you to intervene and resolve this immediately. I am also talking about this with the Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage. This issue can impact on our bilateral trade volumes as well.”
“We will definitely give due and very favourable consideration to the issue of betel tax faced by Sri Lankan exporters,” said Dr Sipra. “The regulatory import tax imposed by Pakistan on betel leaves is not only for Sri Lankan betel leaves but for betel leaf imports from all countries as well, across the board. We want you to send a written official representation so that I can take it up with my government now and during our September Joint Economic Commission talks in Pakistan as well. There will be no immediate issue for Sri Lankan betel market in Pakistan since we believe the market will remain stable for the next five years.”
Minister Bathiudeen also instructed the officials of the Department of Commerce to promptly follow up and submit necessary official requests through him.
Betel exporters present said that they are prepared to provide full details of their harvests and their export trends regarding the Pakistani market.
According to the Department of Commerce, Sri Lankan betel leaf exports to Pakistan saw a high of US$10.5 million in 2013. In 2014 it was at US$ 10.46 million then declined in 2015 to US$ 9.01 million and in 2016 to US$ 7.38 million.
However, this year the exports bounced back - in the first six months of 2017 alone totaling US$ 10 million.
