Record revenue from fines on errant traders in Matara

The Matara District Consumer Affairs Authority Branch Secretariat has collected a record income of Rs. 85,500 as court fines from errant traders through sudden raids and mobile inspections carried out in the Matara district during April this year.
The branch has carried out 45 raids in April covering all divisional secretariats in the district, investigation officials said.
Displaying and selling food items unfit for human consumption, selling consumer items and electrical appliances above fixed rates, altering set prices on labels, selling expired food items, not displaying price lists, hoarding essential consumer items, violating orders, rules and regulations were some of the offences committed by errant traders, CAA officials said.
The errant vendors were prosecuted in the Matara, Deiyandara, and Morawaka Magistrates’ Courts.
