Midas touch in music

Hitha Kohedo Gihin credits
Lyrics - Saman Kularathna
Melody & Music Composed by Sandaruwan Jayasinghe

Magnus, meaning "great" in Latin, was sometimes used as a first name among Romans. Our Keerthi Pasquel is our ‘Magnus’ of Sri Lankan Music – Magnus Keerthi Paquel. He is an amazing balladeer and has no equal in Sri Lankan Sinhalese Music. Pasquel recently launched his music video – Hitha Kohedo Gihin. It is one of the finest musical creations in our culture up to date. Pasquel who recently launched his music video at the National Film Corporation spoke to the Daily News about his music video and his collaboration with the beautiful and talented Yvonne Roshini Bandara. The music video is stunning in its portrayal of beauty. The choosing Yvonne Roshini Bandara was one of the best things that could happen because of her personality.
“I do have many people to thank. I met Saman Kularatna in Australia who penned this song and handed it over to me. At first glance I felt the lyrics were relevant to all ages and requested Sandaruwan Jayasinghe to compose the song. He did a beautiful job and I immediately fell in love with the song. I got my Lawyer Niranga Nanayakkara to listen to it, who suggested that we must make a music video and she undertook the task. She was of the view that we must produce a music video that is of high quality and a music video that can be enjoyed by genuine music lovers. A video that proves that commitment, vision and effort is as important as genuine talent,” said Pasquel.
Channa Wijewardana needs no introduction. Involving him in the video contributed towards making it a success as he is irreplaceable because of his knowledge and experience when it comes to dance.
“I requested Vet. Dancer Channa Wijewardana to choreograph the entire act, who thankfully agreed to my request. It was Channa who introduced me to Saminda Wathawanawithanage and Buddika Wijerathne the directors of 360 Production Group. I was so blown away by their talent and skill and had no hesitation in immediately entrusting them the task of producing the music video. In my honest opinion both Channa and 360 did a marvelous job. I must thank the entire 360 Production team who gave their 100 percent to this production. Channa was instrumental in putting this entire concept together and I have no words to thank him for his professionalism and love,” explained Pasquel. Bandara was extremely amenable and listened well to what was requested from her. Working with her was an extremely enjoyable task as he displayed great resilience and spirit
“Yvonne is a frontline dancer of Channa Upuli Dance troupe. I must say this young girl has a great future ahead of her. She was so obliging and took directions so well. It was amazing how she conducted herself in the mountains and the bravery shown by her,” pointed out Pasquel. Pasquel has always been loyal to his fans who have made him what he is today. He always wants to do something special for his fans. A man of great humility he understands that the devotion of his fans needs something special in return.
“I’ve always wanted to present something novel to my fans. My goal was to present something that can reach young hearts too, and at the same time give the message that we can make a quality production with tasteful visuals and win the hearts of our fans instead of trying to gain more views by using tasteless scenes. I feel I just did that. Creating a tasteful music video with an absurd storyline usually destroys the song itself,” stated Pasquel.
This is a music video which is the result of love and friendship. It is an example of what happens when a group of dedicated people who mutually respect each other get together, doing what they love doing. “It was the 360 production team who suggested that we turn this video into 3D Stereoscopy. They did not charge me an extra penny for converting the video into 3D but the time and effect spent on it day in and day out was priceless. When it comes to selecting the right location the 360 team selected a venue Called Madulsima. Mountainous village 20 km off Passara. Passara is about 25 km from Badulla and at Light of Asia Foundation, Nugadeniya Road,” said Pasquel.
Pasquel truly can be called Magnus in Sri Lanka. The mention of his name is enough to give someone Goosebumps as they recall his songs. The mention of his name immediately brings a silence to the room as everyone wants to hear of his latest accomplishments. He says that out of his 600 singles – Hitha Kohedo Gihin is one of the best ever. He points out that he has done about 15 music videos and his favorite songs are Neela Ahase, Rantharu Payana, Sadalatha, Nil Upuli, Sinhala Raja Kale, Kadula, thawa Dawasak and Sitha Kohedo Gihin
“I always want to give something new to my fans. At present I am working on forming a trust to set up a BNT center for the benefit of Cancer patients in Sri Lanka. I hope to give my fullest to this project,” said Pasquel.
