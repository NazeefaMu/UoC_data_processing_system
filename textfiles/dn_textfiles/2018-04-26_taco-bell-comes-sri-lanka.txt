Taco Bell has introduced its iconic Crunchwrap to Sri Lanka! available in a choice of three fillings, Fajita Chicken, Mexican Chicken and Pinto Beans, the Crunchwrap is served with Taco Bell’s signature warm nacho cheese, a wholesome layer of crisp lettuce, succulent tomatoes, cool sour cream and a crunchy tostada shell, with one tortilla to bind them all!
