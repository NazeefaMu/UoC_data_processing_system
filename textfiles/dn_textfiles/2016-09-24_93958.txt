Lian helps Thomians

Lian Tirimanne, batting confidently and making some good ground strokes and running very well between the wickets, supported by the hard hitting Lishan De Silva, who made some great hits helped a S. Thomas’ Preparatory to gain a first innings win over Isipathana College last week.
The pair gave the Prepites a good start and made a quick 50 runs in the first 8 overs. After Lishan’s dismissal, the Thomians lost two quick wickets. However, they recovered well by the arrival of the skipper Dineth Perera, and Devin Abeywardena. Lian Continued to look good at the crease, and was well away scoring a valuable 50 runs, and went on to score a brilliant century.
For the Prepites, Dhiren De Silva, bowled very well to get a match bag of 7 wkts, supported well by Lian Thirimanne, and Devin Abeywardena, the others got a wicket.
S. Thomas’ Prep : 249/5 Declared (Lian Tirimanne 100 N.O, Devin Abeywardena 55 N.O, Dineth Perera 27, Lishan De Silva 22)
Isipathana : 54 (Dhiren De Silva 4/16, Devin Abeywardena 2/6, Lian Tirimanne 2/16) and 54/6 (Dhiren De Silva 3/31, Devin Abeywardena 1/0, Sathira Fredrik 1/4, Lian Tirimanne 1/5)
