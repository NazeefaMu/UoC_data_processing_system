Teen dies of injuries sustained in suicide attempt

A 14-year-old girl who was allegedly gang raped at Tissamaharama recently died at the Hambantota hospital yesterday due to injuries sustained following a suicide attempt.
The girl, a Grade 09 student of a school in Magama, had attempted suicide last Wednesday.
But she had been rescued by some villagers and later admitted to the Hambantota hospital where she had been under treatment for the last three days.
She had been allegedly raped by three boys from the same area.
Following the rape incident, she had tried to commit suicide by hanging herself after writing a letter about the harassment she faced.
The three youth who had allegedly committed the offence had been caught by the villagers while hiding in the Yala forest reserve.
They had been handed over to the Police, who are investigating the incident.
