CR-Army match should be a thriller

The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between Army Sports Club and the CR and FC in the Dialog ‘A’ Division league rugby match at Havelock Park should turn out to be a thriller today.
A mammoth crowd is expected at 4:00 pm to witness this grand game in the 2017/18 League Rugby Tournament.
Today’s match should turn out to be a battle between Army’s power-packed forwards and CR & FC’s speedy three quarters.
CR’s forwards especially seasoned campaigner and rolling maul expert Supun Warnakulasooriya, who is an excellent player in the loose along with Shemal Weerasekara, Charana Chamikara, Sashika Ashan, Udara Gayan and Omalka Gunaratne have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy.
In the set scrums CR’s hooker Warnakulasooriya will have the edge against Army hooker Sameera Wickramanayaka while the line outs should be shared between Army’s Nalaka Maduranga, Sampath Rosa and the CR duo of Shemal Weerasekara and Sashika Ashan.
CR have a fine set of speedy three quarters but their halves combination have to hit it off smoothly as they are playing together their second match for the season.
Also they should punch holes in the Army SC defence and to do that their full back Chanaka Chandimal should join the line to form the overlap.
The biggest threat to Army will be posed by winger cum captain Kavindu Perera with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Red Shirts have to make the maximum use of the ‘good ball’ that comes their way through their halves combination of Avishka Heenpella and Tharinda Ratwatte and they must not delay their passes for their two hard running centres in strongly built Kushan Indunil and Rehan Silva to hit the gaps without being ‘nailed’ by their opposite numbers.
They should also come up with a much better display than their first round game against Army as they have two strong runners in winger Reeza Rafaideen while on the open side wing they will have the services of diminutive captain Kavindhu Perera who has impressed with his sizzling runs in addition to an attacking full back in Chandimal.
Army SC beat CR by 24 points to 10 in the first round game at Longden Place and another thriller is on the cards today.
