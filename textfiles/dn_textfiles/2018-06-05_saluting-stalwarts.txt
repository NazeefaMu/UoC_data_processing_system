Saluting stalwarts

Cinema artistes of yesteryear had a memorable experience on May 15 when they gathered at the National Film Corporation (NFC) to acknowledge their increased monthly allowances.
The allowance these senior artistes received was increased to Rs 5000 through an order given by Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
A set of senior cinema artistes representing the fraternity had the privilege of receiving their allowances from President Maithripala Sirisena who graced the occasion with the ministers Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Higher Education and Cultural affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
In 1987 President J R Jayawardene introduced the concept of offering an allowance to senior cinema artistes. The amount was increased to Rs 2000 in 1998. This was further increased to Rs 5000 on May 15, 2018 after 20 years.
Alexander Fernando of ‘Saradiyelge Putha’ fame was the first to receive his allowance pack from the President. He gestured with joy to his fans in the audience while being escorted back to his seat. Joe Livera of ‘Karate Joe’ fame who has gracefully aged was next in line and he was followed by the rest of the artistes.
Alex and Joe both were wrestlers before entering Sinhala cinema as actors. Alexander Fernando has represented Sri Lanka as a wrestler at the Commonwealth Games held in Perth, Western Australia in 1962.
Film songs ‘Usi Usi None’ (‘Hithamithura’) and ‘Yanavita Parae’ (‘Yakadaya’) blended with Alex’s performances are still very much popular among people in the country.
These senior artistes who sweated to add value to Sinhala cinema for decades were happy to mingle with their fans after the event.
Prior to the event the President unveiled a photograph of the late Dr D B Nihalsinghe who was the first CEO/General Manager of the Film Corporation when it was commissioned in 1972 by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
With Nihalsinghe’s leadership towards implementing the Government’s Cinema Act, the local cinema industry thrived at that era.
NFC Chairman Sitendra Senaratne in his speech expressed regret for the long delay in unveiling a picture of Dr D B Nihalsinghe at the NFC premises. He commended Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara’s initiative of increasing the monthly allowance for the cinema artistes of yesteryear.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe under whose purview the NFC now functions said with the blessings of the President he is determined to implement the committee report submitted to the President by stakeholders of the Sri Lankan cinema to uplifting local cinema.
“Artistes are unofficial legislators. After Shakespeare did ‘Merchant of Venice’ the whole of Europe, India and our country was compelled to change legislation for the betterment of the people and a just society. Artistes are magically endowed with such power,” said the Minister.
He said any country must protect its artistes.
“NFC must evolve to develop the local cinema industry. A long term strategy would be to fine-tune school and university curriculums to encompass means of appreciating art,” he added.
