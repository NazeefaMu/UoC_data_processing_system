Singer revenue grows to Rs 37 bn in first 9 months

The Singer Group announced results for the nine months ending September 30, 2017 with revenues increasing to Rs. 37 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year, demonstrating resilience by growing competitively and consistently in tough market conditions.
During the quarter a major milestone occurred with the majority shares of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC being purchased by Hayleys Group from Retail Holdings (Sri Lanka) B.V., thus making Hayleys the new parent company of the Singer Group.
Both companies together have ensured a smooth and seamless transition where Singer will continue to pursue its programmes and strategies to retain its market leadership in consumer durables. Additionally, synergies with Hayleys and its associate companies augurs a brighter future for the Singer Group and its stakeholders.
Group Net Profit for the first nine months was Rs. 789.2 million, a reduction of 37% compared to the prior year (excluding the one-time gain during first nine months of 2016). Operating Profit decreased marginally to Rs. 2,874 million from Rs. 2,966 million compared to the previous year.
Company net profit also decreased 32% for the first nine months to Rs. 544.9 million.
The third quarter was largely affected due to a reduction in harvesting incomes. As a result, the third quarter revenue increased at a slower pace of 8%.
Net finance cost for first nine months of 2017 increased by 44% to Rs 1,494 million largely due to an increase in interest rates. The lower margins and higher interest rates have both impacted group profitability.
Challenging market conditions, notably the continuous drought in the dry zone, reduction in customer purchasing power due to currency devaluation, increased value added tax (VAT) and higher interest rates and floods in the wet zone contributed to the decrease in the demand for consumer durables.
As a result of the adverse conditions, the company too could not increase prices, and gross margins reduced to 29% in the first nine months compared to 31% last year. The increased mix of smart phone sales, which have lower margins, also impacted the overall group gross margins.
However, the group was successful in lowering selling and administration expenses from 22.6% last year to 21.7% in the current year.
