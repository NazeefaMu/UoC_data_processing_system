Fight for democracy

It was the common practice to assume any intervention by America in the developing world to be reactionary. Sama Samajists in particular condemned the intervention in Middle East, South East and Latin America.
There were campaigns within the United State which supported third world agitations implying imperialism. However in the last few years US interventions to protect minorities and human rights violations indicated a change in the system. Most certainly within US and Europe internal agitations and subsequent pressure, has made leaders to change the attitude. In particular with the victory in South Africa and rise of Obama, this positive change made right wing leaders in the developing world to accuse US for interference to defend rebels, and support human rights activists.
Recently one right wing Lankan critique said ‘no one should be surprised at outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshap’s comments on the Lankan political situation and potential presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Apparently Keshap had told former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that ‘the US and other western nations do not welcome the prospects of his brother Gotabhaya becoming president and are opposed to such a move. US would not permit Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to renounce US citizenship at this juncture, which would make it illegal for him to contest as per the restrictions enshrined in the 19th Amendment.’ Apparently, Gotabhaya ‘needs to clear himself of allegations against him over war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally.’ one could laugh that ‘Here we have a representative of a country which was build on and sustained by war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations now fighting against such crimes.’
American imperialism
One does not need to read Noam Chomsky’s ‘What Uncle Sam really wants’ to understand the attitude of American imperialism about world matters. Anybody interested can look at the Palestinian–Israel problem and how the UN rulings were violated without any concern. Obviously one should not get too excited what a US President, Secretary of State or Ambassador talks about democracy.
Chomsky’s book traces how for decades US intervened in all parts of the world with the use of subversion and force, for economic and political hegemony. Also, Chomsky shows, to achieve the various ends the USA often supported violent regimes and dictatorships. Thus he exposes, for all the bleeding-heart talk about democracy, good governance and peace, how the USA has had no qualms over propping violent in any part of the world. Having said that we have to accept it is Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American, philosopher, social critical and political activist who make use of democracy to expose this villainy of America.
Sometimes described as “the father of modern linguistics”, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.
He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of over one hundred books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics Chomsky vocally opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, believing the war to be an act of American imperialism. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled “The Responsibility of Intellectuals”.
Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on Nixon's Enemies List.
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.
Economic inequality
Having said all that we have to answer the question how such a person do all that in US; the centre of reaction. Not only Chomsky but also people such as Bernard Sanders and other radicals ‘play hell’ as conservatives say.
He is an American politician serving as the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007.
The longest-serving independent in congressional history, he was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 and has caucused with the Democratic Party since, which has entitled him to congressional committee assignments and at times given Democrats a majority. A self-described democratic socialist and a New Deal-era American progressive, Sanders is pro-labor and emphasizes reversing economic inequality.
So these people are powerful because of the strength of the American proletariat or the working class. This power of modern proletariat is spread throughout the developed world where democracy function one form or the other.
This power compels western radical politicians to fight for democracy and human rights in the developing world. UN human rights and social rights organisations are at least partially controlled by the power of modern proletariat in the developed world.
While we speak on bad effects of imperialist countries we have to admit the constant and consistent pressure of the left and the workers organisations in those developed world who are conscious, educated and active.
Hence it is not just bad and oppressive but also vigilant and conscious of rights of all sectors in the world.
