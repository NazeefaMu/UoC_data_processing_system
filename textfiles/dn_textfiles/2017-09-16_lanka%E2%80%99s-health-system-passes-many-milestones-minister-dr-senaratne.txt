Lanka’s health system passes many milestones: Minister Dr. Senaratne

Sri Lanka achieved notable improvements in the health system, such as receiving certification for the eradication of Malaria, adoption of a migration health policy, and the multi-pronged fight against NCDs by improving access to NCD screening and care through Primary Care, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the 70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South East Asia held in Male, Maldives recently, the minister said providing cardiac stents and intraocular lenses free of charge for those being treated at government hospitals and the reduction of the price of 48 commonly used drugs facilitating equitable access to medication among notable improvements.
Addressing another event, the minister said Sri Lanka as a country which has enjoyed universal health coverage for almost six decades, has managed to achieve impressive health indicators, especially in the areas of maternal and child health and addressing communicable diseases, supported by nearly 100 percent immunisation coverage.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka has been successful in achieving polio free status way back in 1993 followed by lymphatic filariasis last year.
The country is targeting on the elimination of Rabies, mother to child transmission of HIV, measles and congenital rubella by 2020. Sri Lanka has a fairly low viral hepatitis burden below two percent.
The country can continue with this scenario by strengthening the routine immunisation programme which includes three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine, soon to be boosted with a birth dose of the vaccine based on expert opinion, he said.
