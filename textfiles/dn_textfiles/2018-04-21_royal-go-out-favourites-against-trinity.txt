74th Bradby Shield first leg at Royal Sports Complex :
Royal go out favourites against Trinity

Royal College, Colombo will go out as clear favourites against Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in the first leg of the 74th Bradby Shield rugby encounter at the Royal Sports Complex at 4.15pm today. The junior game for the C. E. Simitharachchi trophy will be played prior to the first XV encounter.
The two teams look almost even but Royal has a firm edge due to having remained unbeaten thus far with Trinity managing to win only two games after four matches the two sides have played so far this season. Royal also have the advantage of playing in front of their home crowd in Colombo.
Nevertheless, Trinity will make every effort to beat them in their own den. The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning the first leg of the Bradby Shield in this much looked forward to encounter.
The outcome of this first leg would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball. Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and it is no exception this time. If the Trinity forwards could secure good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Royal will face a tough task.
Nevertheless, Royal has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul as usual. When one talks about the success of Royal forwards, it goes back to that invincible side of Royal 2015 with their unsung hero (highest try scorer in the league that year) and rolling maul specialist number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya who scored four back to back tries in the second leg at Royal Complex. Incidentally he is the present Royal rugby team manager.
Going down memory lane Royal had its best pack in 1988 when burly number eight Lasitha Gunaratne (Bonza), coached by Dr. Fred Perera (one of the best school’s rugby coaches produced by Sri Lanka who captained the Reid Avenue school in 1971), produced a champion unbeaten side where Royal won the Bradby, inter-schools league and the inter-schools R.Premadasa Trophy knockout by beating Isipathana (13-0). They also went on to win both their games against Hong Kong school side and a Combined Schools team in Hong Kong during their tour of the island nation. That year they lost only the Schools rugby 7s to Sudesh Abeysinghe’s Isipathana College.
Experienced wing three quarter and play maker Sabith Feroze will captain Royal which will make every effort to humble the Lions in Colombo to go one step forward to retain the Bradby Shield for the fourth consecutive year. But everything will depend on how Royal granite hard forwards will play today.
Royal has enjoyed a fabulous season this year having won all their matches against Kingswood College Kandy (29-3), St. Anthony's College Kandy (55-13), S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia (55- nil), St.Joseph’s College Maradana (18-13) in the ongoing 2018 ‘Singer’ league rugby championship.
In contrast, Trinity had their best team in recent times in 1987 as the Lions remained unbeaten under Tyrell Rajapakse coached by Alex Lazarus, where they only conceded a solitary try to the opponents in the entire league tournament and former Havies, CR and national flanker Pradeep Lakshantha having the honour of scoring that superb try for Isipathana against Trinity that year (which clearly showed the different skills laid out by their head coach Lazarus that famous year). The forte of Rajapakse's undisputed team was that they had a speedy back division led by playmaker cum one of the best fly halves the country has produced todate in Shah Doole (now domiciled is USA) that injected superpower into the 1987 Trinity outfit.
Leading Trinity in the 2018 Bradby first leg will be full back Avishka Lee.
Trinity has a slightly low record this season being placed fourth in the 2018 ‘Singer’ league. Trinity has two wins to their credit winning against arch rivals St. Anthony’s College Kandy (15-11) and S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavina (34-24), and losing to St.Joseph’s College Colombo (32-25) and Kingswood College Kandy (23-21).
The Bradby Shield encounter is considered the most prestigious match in schools rugby, even surpassing any of the tournament matches. It has a rich history which is second to none when it comes to the sport of rugby. The series is played in honour of former Royal principal, the late E.L. Bradby, since 1945. However the Royal-Trinity inter-school rugby series had begun way back in 1920, long before the Bradby Shield was introduced and turned out to be a ‘two-leg’ affair.
Of the 73 encounters to date, Trinity takes the lead with 39 wins to Royal’s 32 and there were two ties in the series in 1992 (3-3) and (0-0), in 2016 (22-17) and (13-18).
Over the years, it has produced many top Sri Lanka players and traditions that could only be witnessed at the ‘Bradby’ Shield encounter.
Whatever the outcome of the game may be, one guaranteed factor is that the thousands of rugby fans who will fill the Royal Complex grounds to capacity are assured of a game of fast open rugby.
Ex-Trinity winger and 1981 triple champions Havelock centre Bharatha Mendis who scored that spectacular match winning try in the dying moments of the Bradby first leg game in 1979 at Bogambara grounds (Trinity won 4-3) said: “It was a fantastic feeling to get the Lion spirit going in that memorable day in 1979 which I still cherish in my memory. In the upcoming Bradby 1st leg today, Royal has a very good and a balanced side and Trinity will have to pull out something really extraordinary to spring a surprise in order to keep Bradby hopes alive. As a Trinitian my heart and soul wants Trinity to win, however may the better side win today.”
Rohantha Peiris, former Royal and CR & FC rugby captain as well as the present Royal College rugby advisory committee chairman said: “We are not taking Trinity lightly and we want a potential Bradby special. This Trinity side is a balanced one even though they lost two games this year. I am sure they will do well in this match. Our team will not take it easy and wants to play better to win this game. We will execute our plans in a formal manner. I wish both teams well.”
Ex-Trinity College vice-captain, coach, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka captain cum present champion Kandy SC head coach Sean Wijesinghe said, “The Bradby is a different game, a weak team can come out well on the day. Royal looks superior but as per my view Trinity is not short of talent. The team that handles pressure well on that day will be on top at any given time. Trinity is going as under dogs today and physically we have seen many times even at international level, the clear favourite losing to them. As a Trinitian I definitely want to see Trinity winning today because for me I have one school, one club and one nation in life.”
Present Royal College head coach (former Royal College rugby vice captain, CR and Sri Lanka national captain) Dushanth Lewke said, “The Bradby is a whole different ball game and it's a tough match for us hence we are looking forward to the rivalry as well as camaraderie, which is a big part of the Bradby Shield.”
Today’s game will be refereed by Dinka Peiris, who will be doing his fourth Bradby game on the trot since 2015.
Sujeewa Cooray, the Royal captain of 1981and former CR & FC wing three quarter will be the chief guest at today's first leg.
