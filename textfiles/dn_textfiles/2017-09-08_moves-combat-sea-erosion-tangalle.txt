Moves to combat sea erosion in Tangalle

Action will be taken to combat sea erosion in the Tangalle Mawella beach and provide relief to fishermen who had damaged their boats and suffered inconvenience due to erosion, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He gave this assurance at a special discussion on the sea erosion issue held at the ministry auditorium recently.
The State Minister directed Fisheries Director General Christylal Fernando and Coast Conservation Department Director General V K Prabath Chandrakeerthi to initiate quick action to restore the section of the Mawella beach subjected to sea erosion and take preventive measures.
He also directed officials to provide assistance to affected fishermen towards repairing damaged boats and reinstate them in their traditional vocation without delay by providing other amenities.
