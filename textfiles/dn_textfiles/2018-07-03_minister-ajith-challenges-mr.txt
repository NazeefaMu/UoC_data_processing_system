Minister Ajith challenges MR

Power and Rnewable Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should file a case against the New York Times if the allegations leveled against him through its report are false.
He was responding to a journalist at a media conference held yesterday at Isurupaya.
South Asia correspondent at The New York Times, Maria Abi-Habib, has written a controversial article titled ‘How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port,’ claiming that China provided nearly 7.6 million US dollars Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign.
“At least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbor’s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksa’s campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation.
The document details China Harbor’s bank account number — ownership of which was verified — and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out,” the New York Times reported.
The State Minister further said that the Chinese Government has not directly denied that the former President obtained money from China.
