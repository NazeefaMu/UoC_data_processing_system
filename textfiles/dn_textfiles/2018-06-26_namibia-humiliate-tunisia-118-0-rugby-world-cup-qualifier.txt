Namibia humiliate Tunisia 118-0 in Rugby World Cup qualifier

JOHANNESBURG, Sunday: Namibia scored 18 tries to humiliate Tunisia 118-0 in a 2019 Rugby World Cup Africa qualifier this weekend while Kenya upset Morocco 28-24 in another second-round match.
Seeking a sixth consecutive appearance at the four-yearly rugby union global showcase, Namibia top the table with a maximum 10 points from two matches.
Kenya come next with five points from a bonus-point victory in Casablanca, followed by Morocco (three) and Zimbabwe (two) while Uganda and Tunisia are pointless.
The table toppers after the round-robin competition go to the World Cup in Japan while the runners-up get a second chance in an inter-continent repechage tournament. Lesley Klim, who plays for English second-tier club Doncaster, and Johan Corne Greyling scored four tries each for merciless Namibia, who led 52-0 at half-time. Chrysander Botha got three, Wian Conradie, Johan Deysel, Pieter-Jan van Lill, Damian Stevens, Johann Tromp and Max Katjijeko one each and they were awarded a penalty try.
Cliven Loubser kicked eight conversions, PW Steenkamp four and Botha one at a Windhoek stadium named after current Namibian state president Hage Geingob.
Namibia coach and former Wales lock Phil Davies said: "I am in the process of building a competitive team and our flowing passing game in the second half was impressive." AFP
