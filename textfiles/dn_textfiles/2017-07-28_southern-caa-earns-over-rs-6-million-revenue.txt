Investigation officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) of the Southern region, have amassed a huge revenue of over Rs. 6 million from fraudulent traders by way of Court fines in mobile raids and inspections made throughout Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts during the last six months of this year.
According to the Investigation officials, the total number of raids carried out in the Southern region during the period were nearly 2,000.
Accordingly, errant traders were prosecuted in Magistrates’ Courts in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts. These vendors were indicted on counts of sale and display for sale food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling foodstuffs which were decayed and consumed by rats, weevils and insects, deceitfully altering the set prices marked on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sales of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority.
According to the CAA, complaints on frauds, malpractices and corruptions committed by unscrupulous traders are now pouring into the Authority. Under these circumstances, the CAA has enhanced its raids and mobile inspections against fraudulent traders throughout the Southern region, Investigation officials said.
Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being held for school children, members of voluntary organizations, people and also the trading community by the Authority.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, the CAA Investigation Officers are conducting these raids and inspections covering the Southern region, they further added.
