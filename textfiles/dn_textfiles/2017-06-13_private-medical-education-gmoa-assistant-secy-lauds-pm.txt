Private medical education: GMOA Assistant  Secy lauds PM

Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge appreciated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's views on private medical education.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Head Office in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said the Prime Minister, during a discussion with Sri Lanka Medical Council representatives, had stated that he did not approve selling medical degrees and private medical faculties should operate as non profit institutions in the country. Dr. Aluthge said Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne should take steps to extend Prof. Carlo Fonseka's term as the President of the SLMC.
His term ends on June 30. He should be reappointed for two or five years depending on the Sri Lanka Medical Ordinance, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the minister should not appoint anyone who gets paid from SAITM as a lecturer or any other professional.
Several such persons are eying on the position of the President of the SLMC, he said.
