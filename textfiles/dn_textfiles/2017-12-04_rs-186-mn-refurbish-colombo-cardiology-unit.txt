Rs 186 mn to refurbish Colombo cardiology unit

The refurbishment of the Cardiology Unit of the Colombo National Hospital will be over in 90 days, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said. He observed that the refurbishment was essential as the unit was not maintained properly since it was established in 1960s.
Rs. 186 mn is spent for the refurbishment. “We had to temporarily stop operations at the unit as refurbishment was essential to stop the unit from malfunctioning.
There were detections of fungi in the operation theatre and necessary precautions had to be taken. These buildings have not been maintained for years.”he said. Asked as to why the refurbishing process is delayed, Minister Senaratne expressed his dissatisfaction over the delay.
