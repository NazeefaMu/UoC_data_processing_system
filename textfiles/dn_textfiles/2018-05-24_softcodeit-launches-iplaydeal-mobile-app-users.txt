Softcodeit launches iPlayDeal  for mobile app users

Softcodeit, a leading software development company in Sri Lanka, has launched iPlayDeal, a platform built for mobile app users, mobile app developers and merchants to interact and benefit from each other.
Launched in January 2018, iPlayDeal is a unique creation of Softcodeit and their first product for the Sri Lankan market. It is an activity-based rewarding platform built on a point generation system and is available for both Android and iOS devices.
These points are called IPD points which get accumulated in a pre-created user account every time an individual uses an app that is connected with iPlayDeal. The platform currently has a user base of over 7,000 with 60% of them being monthly active users earning IPD points. They spend these accumulated points to grab deals and discounts offered by the platform’s growing number of partner merchants.
To celebrate the launch of iPlayDeal, Softcodeit organized a competition spanning several months for its mobile game users. During the course of the competition, participants were given prizes on a weekly basis and at the end, all users who scored 5000 IPD points and above were eligible to win three exciting prizes.
Softcodeit conceptualised iPlayDeal as a “rewarding platform for everyday behaviour” with several objectives in mind. Firstly, it is a pathway for the company to encourage mobile app developers in Sri Lanka to enhance their skills and develop mobile apps that will be widely downloaded and used.
Secondly, it provides smartphone users the opportunity to get tangible rewards for their daily behaviours, be it playing a mobile game, using a messaging tool or even checking email through the apps available on the platform.
Thirdly, it provides merchants who sign up on the platform the chance to market their products and services directly to an active target market who are guaranteed to utilise the IPD points by patronizing their outlets.
Expressing his views about iPlayDeal, Damitha Jayarathna - Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Softcodeit stated, “Nowadays, people are highly-depended on their smart mobile devices. They use them for different purposes such as browsing the Web, sending emails and messages, listening to music, watching videos and playing games. The only reward one gets from these activities is the contentment of having their work done conveniently and virtually anywhere. However, Softcodeit has been able to take this a step further.”
Established in 2004, Softcodeit is a software development company specialising in a wide variety of services which includes dedicated teams, custom software development and mobile solutions.
