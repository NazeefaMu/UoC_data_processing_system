A real delight when uptight cops are polite

For almost four decades or more a succession of police top brass have crafted initiatives aimed at improving community relations, usually coinciding with a public outcry over discourtesy or police brutality.
In responding to and addressing the question of conduct, of how cops ought to behave towards citizens, the police hierarchy claims they lose sleep over concerns about the manners of members of the department. They say the importance of good manners and courtesy has been instilled in every member of the force before and after recruitment.
For most law-abiding citizens, direct encounters with the police are rare occurrences or intermittent at the most. The vast majority of Sri Lankans will never be arrested. But when passing encounters with the police go wrong, they can leave a lasting impression on the civic mindset and can do as much damage to police-public relations as much as a highly publicised case of police brutality.
Process-orientated standards
There are scores of causes why the police find it difficult to interact with the community they are supposed to ‘serve and protect.’ The police have to deal with the public at diverse levels. They do so individually, as a group organisation and as public players.
When it looks as if law enforcement stands for the security of the area which they police, there is bound to be common accord. But when the coppers do not correlate to such thinking there is bound to be disgruntlement and discord. Rude and dismissive behaviour by the police shows a great disdain toward the public whose personnel are expected to have sworn to serve and protect. Many fear that such disrespectful behaviour can potentially lead to more harmful acts against the public.
A breakdown in relations between community members and police can lead to feelings of distrust, resentment and fear. Programmes are vital to help build the trusting relationships necessary for long-term change. People from diverse backgrounds develop trust, understand each others' experiences and work together on solutions.
Clearly it is the responsibility of the police to ensure the safety of citizens by working towards preventing criminal acts and enforcing the law. They are accountable to the community and its evaluation of police accomplishments and failures in thwarting, combating and solving crimes. They are also expected to be frank, polite and transparent when dealing with the public and the media in all spheres of their operations, excepting of course divulging sensitive information requiringsecrecy based on national security needs.
Different schools of thought view police procedure contrastingly and have varying concepts of the priorities and objectives of law enforcement and the criminal justice system. The cops are also expected to adhere to a wide variety of process-orientated standards.
These include certain key aspects such as integrity, which in effect means avoidance of corruption and abuse of power for personal gain. Also fairness is a key issue in treating people equally or equitably, regardless of race, sex, or social standing. And of course there is civility because treating people with respect is vital for its image.
Unfairly blamed
Another much overlooked factor is police presence and response, which stresses on the significance of being available and accessible to provide services in a timely fashion. A feature that has been often been the cause of contentious debate is the appropriate use of force, where cops are expected to use only as much force as is necessary to accomplish their legitimate goals.
Still, as the old Gilbert and Sullivan operatic lyrics go it is true that ‘a policeman’s lot is not a happy one.’ For cops on the street, keeping their composure is not always easy. Few personnel find themselves regularly in situations where they face the brunt of other people’s wrath such as when a policeman is trying to intercede in a family dispute, or calm someone who has been attacked.
Citizens may think the police are prejudiced and resort to unfair policies at times. On the other hand officers who attend to their work with commitment and responsibility may feel they are being unfairly blamed for all kinds of social problems, and many think they do not receive proper credit for doing their jobs with fearlessness and dedication.
The whole issue has raised an interesting question with certain analysts as to whether good manners translate into effective policing? Some disagree with the politeness idea, contending that in certain instances police officers, frankly, have to drop the niceties to get their jobs done more effectively. Clearly, police work is one of the most stressful occupations anywhere. Whether people are willing to acknowledge it or not, policing does become a contact sport in unpredictably explosive situations.
The cooperation and assistance
Lawmen are often in the thick of danger routinely handling some volatile confrontations in situations that dictate that they do not have time for pleasantries. That is only natural when one comes face-to-face with desperate and armed hardcore criminals.
Certainly the safety of law enforcement officers must be acknowledged as a fundamental concern of both the department’s hierarchy and the general public. No sensible citizen would expect a police officer to risk his or her life needlessly or recklessly. It should be in everyone’s interest to campaign for the adoption of policies and practices that afford maximum protection to officers and citizens.
This onus of responsibility for fighting crime carries with it the obligation for the police to recognise and respect the rights of citizens. But make no mistake about it, the police would never be able to accomplish even a fraction of their crime fighting success rate if not for the cooperation and assistance of the community. When police fail to respect the rights of residents and their leaders fail to hold those who engage in misconduct accountable, the police public relationship is put in dire jeopardy.
There are at times a good deal of disquiet about accountability is in the handling of complaints concerning misconduct. The Department’s head honchos must explain to the public how adequately their personnel will be held accountable for misconduct.
Every police officer must play his or her role with discipline, courtesy, good manners and with proper conduct and accountability. Good work must be rewarded, while erring personnel must be dealt with strictly. A more responsive system of rewards and punishment should be implemented.
Police work is one of the most personal of all public services. It deals with human beings in life and death situations. The cops and the people they serve must be as near as possible and where possible must know one another.
Such understanding can generate the police-citizen cooperation necessary for the involvement of the whole community in community protection.
