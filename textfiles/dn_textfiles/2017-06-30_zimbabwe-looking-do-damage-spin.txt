Zimbabwe looking to do damage with spin

GALLE: Zimbabwe will be looking to do some damage to Sri Lanka’s batting through their spinners during the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka starting at Galle today.
“We rely heavily on our spin department which we hope if there is a bit of spin in Sri Lanka we can exploit that. With our spin dominant team we can do some damage tomorrow,” said Zimbabwe skipper Graeme Cremer at the pre-match press conference.
Leg-break and googly bowler Cremer leads the group of spinners that also includes off-spinner Sikander Raza and slow left-arm orthodox bowlers Wellington Masakadza and Sean Williams.
Masakadza is doubtful after getting injured during practice on Wednesday.
“Wellington has to go to Colombo for a scan but it’s not looking great at this stage. By the end of today or tomorrow morning we will know his exact situation once he has the scan,” said Cremer.
Zimbabwe is also confident with their batting which runs deep.
“After the last Scotland and Holland tours we found that we have a lot of batting depth. It’s just worked up with the combinations we are trying to play. We bat all the way upto no. 10 hopefully we can use that,” said Cremer who is recovering from a bout of ’flu which he picked up on his arrival in Sri Lanka.
“It was a long trip and I had a bit of flu that’s kicked in the last few days. Feeling a bit better today hopefully by tomorrow will be 100 percent,” said Cremer.
Apart from the captain three other team members was also hit by the bug. “We got medication yesterday think everyone will be alright by tomorrow.”
Cremer expects his team to struggle against the hot conditions they will experience in Sri Lanka.
"Obviously it’s a bit hot and especially after our last two tours to Scotland and Holland which was very different from here. Two days to get used to this condition is quite tough and we will find it tough tomorrow,” said Cremer. “A few of our guys have toured here before so we know how to handle it. I think we will be okay.
“It’s always tough touring Sri Lanka because of the conditions here and the wickets aren’t what we are used to but yesterday and today luckily we got wickets out in the centre which we think is similar to the actual match pitch. It’s been good preparation. I think we will be able to adjust,” Cremer said.
Cremer is confident his boys will be able to counter the threat posed by fast bowler Lasith Malinga.
“He is a world class bowler but luckily a lot of us have played him before. We know he is an asset to Sri Lankan cricket we just need to deal with him as best as we can,” said Cremer. “He’s got a lot of variations and he is a lot different to other bowlers but we are lucky that we have played him before so it will be a lot easier facing him.”
Cremer said that it was disappointing to see his team not be in the top eight of the ODI rankings. “West Indies is also in the same boat it’s just one of those things. We can’t delve too much on that but we need to put in some good performances over the next couple of months and try and qualify for the World Cup. That’s a stepping stone and that’s where we want to be. We know we just need to win games to get into that top eight,” said Cremer.
