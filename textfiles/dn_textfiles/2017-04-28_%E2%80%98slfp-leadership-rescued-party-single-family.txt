‘SLFP leadership rescued party from a single family

The current SLFP leadership rescued the party from the clutches of a single family and its cohorts and has opened its high positions to the common man and revived the five-fold forces, the Maha Sangha, physicians, teachers, farmers, and workers, Central Provincial Councillor and newly appointed Kandy District SLFP organiser Linton Wijesinghe said.
He said a large number of people who knew the heartbeat of the common man in the village have been appointed as SLFP organisers today and true democracy had been established in the party.
Addressing a meeting at Menikhinne on April 26, he said the party leadership is now re-organising the party to enable it to win any future election.
The SLFP had given true meaning to this year’s May Day rally by further strengthening the party, he said.
