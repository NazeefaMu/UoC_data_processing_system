Siddle to play in PM's XI game against New Zealand

Test paceman Peter Siddle will gain valuable match practice ahead of next month's series against New Zealand from his selection in the Prime Minister's XI, Cricket Australia said Friday.
Siddle, who has been snubbed by Victoria for their domestic one-day campaign so far, will be given the opportunity to play against New Zealand in two games in Canberra next week.
Siddle, 30, who has played 57 Tests for Australia, has been named along with former Test batsmen Mike Hussey in the PM's squad.
The full squads for the PM's XI and CA XI matches at Manuka will be announced early next week.
"We believe it is important to field a strong squad against what we know will be a very competitive New Zealand side in these tour matches," chief selector Rod Marsh said Friday.
"Peter performed well at The Oval in the final Ashes Test (against England) and as part of his preparation for the summer we want to give him some high-standard match practice.
"These tour matches and the first round of the Sheffield Shield give Peter important opportunities to impress ahead of the Test series."
Siddle said he looked forward to playing in both matches next week.
"It's truly an honour to be selected in the Prime Minister's side," he said.
"I haven't played in that match before and I'm really looking forward to it and the following two-day tour match.
"This will give me a good opportunity to experience the pink ball as well as face-off against New Zealand.
Former Australian Test players Greg Blewett and Ryan Harris were this week confirmed on the coaching staff of both the PM's XI and CA XI.AFP
