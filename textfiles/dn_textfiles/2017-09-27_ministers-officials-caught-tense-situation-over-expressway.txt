Ministers, Officials caught in tense situation over expressway

A tense situation arose on Monday evening when government officials and ministers met to discuss issues regarding the Central Expressway at the Nailiya Viharasthanaya in Kurunegala. The officials and ministers had to be escorted out of the premises under police security as negotiations turned into a protest.
The discussion was with regard to the section being built from Pothuhera to Kurunegala. Around 200 residents from the areas of Amunawatte, Henmulla, Weherabanda, Gattuwana and Boyagana had come for the discussions and they complained that they would lose land to the Expressway.
On behalf of the Government, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi, Kurunegala Divisional Secretary Mahinda Ekanayake and officers were present.
Sooriyarachchi tried to explain matters regarding the Central Expressway, but the residents of the area kept interrupting him and protesting. The discussions heated up. The residents strongly insisted that the expressway be built on columns to avoid effects of flooding, to pay adequate compensation and to make transparent the system of compensation.
Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe tried to address the gathering, but due to the crowd shouting at the minister, a heated exchange took place. The residents having prepared a petition with their demands had handed it over to the Deputy Minister and asked that he in writing assure them that their demands would be met, but the Deputy Minister had pointed out that he did not have the authority to meet such demands.
As the situation worsened, police decreed that the government officials leave the meeting. As the officials left, the residents in the area booed at them in protest.
Those who participated in the discussions then proceeded to march towards the Boyagane-Malpitiya junction, a kilometer away from the temple and they blocked the Kurunegala-Colombo main road. This caused heavy traffic congestion in the area for over three hours.
The situation was resolved when the Kurunegala ASP, who came to the place, promised to get them a meeting with the Transport Minister and the Prime Minister to resolve the issue.
