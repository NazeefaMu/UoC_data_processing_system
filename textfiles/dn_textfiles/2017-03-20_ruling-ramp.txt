Ruling the ramp

The modeling industry is normally ruled by the ladies. However Daniel Rene de Zilva Wijewardena ruled the ramp when he took part in the 11th edition of the Mister International pageant 2016, which was held in Thailand last month. He was placed in the top 16 at the event. The 23 year old also won the Mr Teleginic mini title which would boost his opportunities in entering the acting and commercial fields.
Apart from becoming the overall winner at Mr International Sri Lanka 2016 he has also bagged the title of Mr Personality. He has appeared in several commercials and was on the catwalk for the EKKO Fashion Show and The Royal Turf Club Runway show. Daniel’s ambition is to become a pilot. He had done his first flight training in Canada and is continuing his studies at Kolping Kolleg in Germany and resides in Freiburg.
Q: How did you prepare ahead of the Mister International pageant?
A: There are so many things that had to be prepared but I mainly went to the gym almost every day, watched my diet practiced my walk and watched the old Mister International shows.
Q: What is the best and worst moment at Mister International for you?
A: I think the best thing about the pageant was meeting so many people from different parts of the world. I made a lot of friends there.
Of course the final show was also a highlight at the event. (Grinning) The worst moments were probably waking up after only three hours of sleep every day.
Q: What are your thoughts on winning the Mr Telegenic title? Isn’t this mini title a new addition to beauty pageants?
A: Yes, it was a new addition to the pageant. I am really glad I ended up winning since acting is one of my biggest passions. We had an amazing crew to work with which made it easy for us to perform so it is not only my work that made this happen.
Q: If you could have picked another contestant to be named as the winner of the competition, who would you have picked? Why?
A: It’s a tough question since there were so many great guys but for me personally I would have picked Mister Australia, James Carne.
He has a personality that I have never encountered before. His is a really loving and caring person but at the same time one of the craziest/funniest guys to hang out with. He would have represented Mister International very well.
Q: Is this your first ever international pageant? How did you feel representing Sri Lanka at the event?
A: Yes, it was my first International Pageant. It was a crazy experience from sleepless nights to people screaming to take a picture with you. I am very proud to have represented Sri Lanka at a pageant like this.
It’s a great honour that has been given to me.
I would like to thank my parents, my sister Nathalie, my aunt Sriyani de Zilva and cousin Bishani Nawatathne who flew out to Thailand to support me for the event.
I am also grateful to Brian Kerkoven, National Director for Sri Lanka, Kamil Hewavitharana for all his help and guidance, my aunt Pauline de Zilva, Arvin Rasa, Lalantha Watadura and Tharushi Dabare of EKKO, Lakshman Guruge of Pettah Tailors and Hiran Wijesekara for the beautiful National costume which was greatly admired by the other contestants.
Q: What made you decide to become a model?
A: It mainly happened because of one man - Brian Kerkoven. He was the one that saw my potential first and got me onto the stage and believed in me.
Without him I wouldn’t have done any of this. He is an amazing person and does things for people without expecting anything from them except believing in them to give it their all.
Q: Who was your role model as a child and how did that help in you become who you are today?
A: I had a lot of people that I looked up to as a child, but I never had one specific role model. For me people who believed in themselves and never gave up on pursuing and doing what they love no matter the odds, no matter what field they are in is a role model.
Q: How do you cope under the pressures of being a model?
A: Actually I love the pressure of going on stage. When that adrenalin rush kicks in or you are about to do a shoot and you know now that you need to perform no matter what is a great feeling. It gives you a feeling that is unexplainable. It makes you feel alive!
Q: Five things you can’t live without.
A: My family, my girlfriend, my friends, chicken and the gym. (LOL)
Q: What appeals to you about flying?
A: For me flying means freedom. As a kid my biggest wish was to be able to fly. I remember dreaming about having the superpower to fly and waking up being devastated to realize that it was only just a dream. Every time I take a seat in the cockpit I know that this is the place where I should be. It is the most amazing feeling to have the ability to fly for so many reasons but the biggest one is because I love doing it.
Q: What are your guilty pleasures foodwise?
A: Oooh... Chocolate, burgers and fried chicken. Yum!
Q: Who are your fashion icons?
A: This might sound boring but I don’t really have fashion icons.
I like people who come up with their own styles but if I had to really choose a person who is very fashionable it would be Lewis Hamilton.
I am a big fan of Formula 1 and every time I see him, his style is on point.
Q: A word of advice to aspiring male models.
A: Stay true to yourself and always keep your loved ones close.
Q: Have you already got some offers to act? What kind of roles and films/teledramas would you like to do? Are you considering a career or a part time career in acting?
A: I haven’t got any offers that seem interesting enough so far. Since I am studying fulltime in Germany from September onwards it will be hard to pursue a career in acting but if I had the chance I would love to do a remake of the series ‘Fresh Prince of Bel Air’. (Laughs) But I am pretty open minded to roles. I believe that a great actor should be able to fit himself into any kind of role.
Q: What are you upcoming plans?
A: Finishing my studies is my main goal. Then I will see what offers are in store for me. I will continue doing what I love and see where it takes me.
