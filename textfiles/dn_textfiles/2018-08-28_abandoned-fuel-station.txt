Abandoned fuel station

A fuel station that was set up at a beach in Addalaichenai, had been abandoned for a long time.
The station, which was constructed along with a health resort by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), was never opened for public use. Residents said that it had been erected under the Tsunami-Affected Areas Rebuilding Development Project.
They urged the relevant authorities to take immediate measures to address the issue.
