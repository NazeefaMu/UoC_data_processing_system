Lavanka Property Developers wins Shramabhimanee Business Excellence Award

Lanka property Developers won the Shramabhimanee Business Excellence Award 2017 at the recently concluded ceremony held at the BMICH.
This award ceremony is organized once a year to reward Business and Social community who serve the betterment of the country.
“To give into to the adage that the Customer is always right!, in not enough, it is a must to make the Customer happy and content!” is the fervent belief of the owner-driving force of the 2017 Shramabhimani Award and Certificate-winner in Land Development business - Lavanka Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd., a medium-scale enterprise from the suburb of Colombo, Homagama.
A good humouredly amicable person, S.A.D.D. Harshanath, launched this land sales enterprise Lavanka Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd., with a meager 40,000 Sri Lankan Rupees. His keenness for effecting sales is always sharpened by the dictum, “always keep your customer and content!”
By the by, his experience convinced him that in land sales the buyer invariably wish for the full gamut of infrastructure facilities – clean water, electricity power, a proper drainage and storm drain system and the roadways and a reliable public transport, at least”. Smiling his atmosphere-relaxing smile, Harshanath said, “We, with our 15-strong dedicated team exert ourselves to please the customers who come to us, to ensure that we ensure that they are given these basic facilities that they covet so much.”
