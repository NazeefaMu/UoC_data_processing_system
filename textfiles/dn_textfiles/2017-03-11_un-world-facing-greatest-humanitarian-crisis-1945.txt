UN: World facing greatest humanitarian crisis since 1945

 
The world is facing its largest humanitarian crisis since 1945, the United Nation's humanitarian chief said as he pleaded for help to avoid "a catastrophe".
Stephen O'Brien told the UN Security Council more than 20 million people are facing starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria.
Unicef has already warned 1.4m children could starve to death this year.
O'Brien said $4.4bn (£3.6bn) was needed by July to avert disaster.
"We stand at a critical point in history,"O'Brien told the Security Council on Friday. "Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations."
"Now, more than 20 million people across four countries face starvation and famine. Without collective and coordinated global efforts, people will simply starve to death. Many more will suffer and die from disease.
