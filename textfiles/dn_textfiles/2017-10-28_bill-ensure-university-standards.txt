Bill to ensure university standards

A Bill will be brought to Parliament to ensure the standard of State and private universities, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
According to Minister Kiriella, the standard of State universities in Sri Lanka is low compared to international standards. Universities in countries in the same region such as India and Bangladesh, have higher standards than Sri Lankan universities.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration of the Fifth International Conference on Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Traditional Medicine in Colombo, yesterday.
According to Minister Kiriella, universities gain higher standards and climb up in world ranking by establishing international links. Universities should recruit foreign students.
However, only a few Sri Lankan State universities follow instructions given to them to recruit 10 percent foreign students.
Minister Kiriella said it is the United National Party which introduced free education in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it will never do away with free education. Three more State medical faculties will be established soon. Local State universities go down in world ranking due to demonstrations staged by university students.
A large number of local and foreign delegates were present at the conference. The conference will end on October 29.
