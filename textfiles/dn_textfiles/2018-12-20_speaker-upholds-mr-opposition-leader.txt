Speaker upholds MR as Opposition Leader

As the Speaker yesterday held his decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as final, Tamil National Alliance MPs, R.Sampanthan and M.A.Sumanthiran became vocal about it.
Sampanthan criticised Speaker Karu Jayasuriya’s decision yesterday in Parliament for recognising former President, former Prime Minister and senior Parliamentarian Rajapaksa as such.
He said the Speaker had taken his decision in haste and that it was in violation of the Constitution.
Sampanthan said the Speaker has not removed him from his post as the Opposition Leader although he had announced on Tuesday the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader.
However, TNA leader R.Sampanthan did not take the Opposition Leader’s seat in yesterday’s Parliament.The Opposition Leader’s seat was vacant as Mahinda Rajapaksa was not present during the sessions.
SLMC Leader Rauf Hakeen said here that Sampanthan’s challenge has given vent to chaos in Parliament.
TNA and SLMC members said Rajapaksa is not a member of Sri Lanka Freedom Party and added that he is a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, and therefore he is a stranger in Parliament, and that may be proven before a Parliamentary Select Committee.
UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said that Rajapaksa had not resigned from the UPFA and that a Select Committee deliberation is uncalled for and unnecessary.
