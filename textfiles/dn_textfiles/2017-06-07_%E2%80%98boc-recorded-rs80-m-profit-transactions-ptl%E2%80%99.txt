‘BoC recorded Rs.80 m profit from transactions with PTL’

The Bank of Ceylon(BoC) has recorded a Rs.80 million profit from transactions that it had done with the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited between March 2014 until February 2015, it was revealed yesterday at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
The transactions between the BOC and the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) have mainly been on repurchase agreements and bond swaps. A repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing for dealers in government securities. A bond swap consists of selling one debt instrument in order to use the proceeds to purchase another debt instrument.
The Commissioner Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioned the former Chief Dealer of the Bank of Ceylon as to why the BOC brought all the transactions they had done with the PTL into a halt when the BOC has gained such a large profit as such.
"If the BOC has done nothing wrong when bidding on behalf of the PTL on 27 February 2015, why take such a decision," Justice Chitrasiri questioned.
Former BOC Chief Dealer J.D.K.Dharmapala said, the social agitation that revolved around the Treasury bond issue may have been the reason as to why the BOC discontinued all transactions with the PTL.
Asked as to who decided in this regard, Dharmapala said he received this piece of instruction in the verbal form from his Assistant General Manager.
Dharmapala said he was transferred to another department after the bond scam allegation.
Dharmapala further said the BOC has done transactions with the PTL to the tune of Rs.106 billion before the BOC halted its transactions with the PTL after questions were raised on the February 27,2015 Treasury Bond issuance.
Asked if the BOC is allowed to bid on behalf of Primary Dealers in the Treasury bond market, Dharmapala said, the BOC Operations Manual does not forbid doing so.
Justice Chitrasiri requested the witness to be confident and fearless to speak the truth before the Commission.
J.D.K.Dharmapala is to testify before the Commission today as well. Senior State Council Dr.Avanti Perera lead evidence for the day.
