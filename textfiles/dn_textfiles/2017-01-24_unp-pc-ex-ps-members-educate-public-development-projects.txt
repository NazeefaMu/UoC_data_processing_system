UNP PC, ex-PS members to educate public on development projects

Provincial Council members and former Pradeshiya Sabha members belonging to the UNP will receive special attention by the party and entrusted with the duty of educating the people about on going development projects as well as projects planned by the government, State Enterprise Development Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said.
He said the party is now in the process of creating an awareness among those members about the task entrusted to them.
“Once this is completed, they would be called upon to spread across the countryside and educate the people about the job opportunities and other massive benefits which will accrue to them from the development projects envisioned by the government,” he said.
“They would be called upon to ensure people to people contact and spotlight people’s problems needing urgent attention as well. This will also entrust a great responsibility on the Provincial Council members to ensure the progress of the party,” Hashim said.
