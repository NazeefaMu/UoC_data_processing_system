WORK ON HEDA OYA RESERVOIR
When considering the location and physical background of Pottuvil and Lahugala Divisional Secretary Divisions in Ampara District, it is evident that though it has a high potential for agriculture and animal husbandry, its land and water has not been duly managed for the benefit of the people. Moreover, when compared with other areas it can be identified as an area with minimum common amenities. Around 6,500 hectares are being cultivated by tanks in Heda Oya, Wila Oya and Karanda Oya valleys. Paddy fields in the banks of Heda Oya are being affected by floods in Maha season while the lack of water in the Yala season impacts on cultivation. The proposal by Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa to implement the Heda Oya Reservoir Project at a cost of Rs. 11,000 million, for controlling floods and providing water for cultivating both seasons, to ensure a continuous drinking water supply for Pottuvil, Lahugalla, Siyambalanduwa and Panama areas and provide water for additional 5,300 hectares by constructing a reservoir in the Heda Oya basin, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

A decision was made to provide confiscated sand and timber for construction works in religious places for free and at concessionary prices. 1,008 cubes of sand were released to 146 religious places and 1,043 cubic feet of timber was released to 16 religious places. Religious places of worship have requested to extend this concessionary period and government institutions such as schools, hospitals and the three armed forces have also requested to obtain confiscated sand and timber for their constructions.

It has been proposed to construct 4000 houses in the Uva and Central Provinces during 2016-2019 under Indian grant assistance, according to the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the governments of India and Sri Lanka. As its first phase 1,134 houses are being planned to be constructed in 2016. The proposal made by Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister U. Palani Thigambaram to provide infrastructure such as drinking water, electricity, access roads, earth retaining walls, and drainage systems for these villages, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

THERAVADA BUDDHIST PIRIVENA IN SANCHI
The practice of Theravada Buddhism is declining in India, where it widely prevailed in the past and there is no established institute in India to teach Theravada Buddhism.
The proposal by Prime Minister RanilWickremesinghe, to make necessary arrangements to establish a Pirivena in Sanchi to teach Theravada Buddhism in collaboration with the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, and to commence preliminary negotiations with the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh during the upcoming visit of the President to Sanchi, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

METHODOLOGY TO MEET SEED PADDY REQUIREMENT
It is required to produce 4.1 million Metric Tons of paddy to supply rice for the current population of the country. 1.2 million hectares are cultivated in one year during the Yala and Mahaseasons, while average paddy harvest per hectare remains at 4.2 MT.
Quality of the seed paddy could be improved if farmers themselves produce the seed paddy from registered seed paddy. Production of seed paddy by using parachute trays is a low cost method. It has estimated that a kilogrammes of paddy can easily harvest 100 kg of paddy.
It will be adequate to cultivate 2 1/2 acres in the next season. The seed paddy requirement can be reduced by 75% through the parachute method and there is a possibility of minimising the use of agro chemicals in weed controlling. Furthermore, the labour requirement for planting could also be reduced by 90%.
The proposal by Agriculture, Minister Duminda Dissanayake to facilitate 180,000 farmers in paddy cultivating districts under this programme, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
