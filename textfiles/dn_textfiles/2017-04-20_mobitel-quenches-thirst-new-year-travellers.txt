Mobitel quenches thirst of New Year travellers

Providing a vital social service to tired travellers en-route to their hometowns located across the country for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Mobitel initiated a project that provided these travellers access to clean drinking water for the second time at key points in their journey. Distribution points were set up at the Fort Main Bus Halt (opposite the Bo tree) on April 11 and at the Fort Railway Station and the Maharagama Expressway Bus Halt on April 12. This initiative that provided travellers relief from the heat was especially appreciated by those who carried a limited supply of water as they embarked on their journeys.
