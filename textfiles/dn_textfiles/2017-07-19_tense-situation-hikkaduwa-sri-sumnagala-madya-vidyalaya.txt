Tense situation at Hikkaduwa Sri Sumnagala Madya Vidyalaya

A tense situation arose at the Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala Madya Vidyalaya on July 17 when a group of its past pupils opposed a national coexistence festival arranged at the school for the day.
Nearly 200 students from four surrounding schools had arrived for the festival. Sumangla Vidyalaya Principal GH. Mohotti had invited teachers and students of the Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya as well for the festival.
Sumangla past pupils said it was improper to hold co-existence festival at the school founded by Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. They said even a Vesak festival or a New Year festival were not held at the school to date.
The principal saidt the festival was held following a co-existence lesson found in the year 8 class text book as instructed by the Education Ministry. But the old boys and parents said a festival of this nature should be held in a Muslim school but not in the historic Sumangala Vidyalaya.
They said students of Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya were to attend the event but if they come, they have to worship the School’s Buddha statute offering flowers. The principal said they held the coexistence festival sans Zahira Vidyalaya students.
