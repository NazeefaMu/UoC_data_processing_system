UNP 70th anniversary next Sunday

The 70th anniversary of the United National Party will be celebrated on January 7 2018, at Campbell Park at 9.00 am.
The anniversary celebration will be held under the headship of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The party anniversary which was to be held last September in Ratnapura was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions at that time.
