Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera files writ petition against CEB

Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera yesterday filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order preventing authorities from taking further steps in the procurement process relating to the development of a 300 megawatts combined cycle power plant at Kerawalapitiya.
The petitioner stated that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has invited interested local and foreign companies to submit proposals for the aforesaid project. "Therefore initially over 30 interested companies have obtained the Request For Proposal from CEB. However, only eight bidders have submitted proposal when the deadline for submissions expired on April 21, 2017," the petitioner added.
The petitioner further stated that among over thirty interested parties only eight bidders submitted proposals which would ultimately minimise the competitiveness for an enormous project. The petitioner further said that the CEB as the procurement entity has personal interest in the procurement process that will have a huge impact on the transparency of the procurement procedure. The petitioner cited CEB, members of National Procurement Commission, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy and several others as respondents. This petition was filed through counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeep Associates.
