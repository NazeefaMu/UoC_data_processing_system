The remains of a person buried at the Avissawella Public Cemetery, was exhumed yesterday as the death was recently suspected to be a homicide.
The remains of R. Anura Gamini Kumara was exhumed before Homagama Additional Magistrate Seetha Handunnetti and Colombo Judicial Medical Officer Channa Perera, yesterday.
The deceased was buried on June 26, following the assumption that he had drowned in the Kelani river. His remains had been found floating in the Yakabemma area in Hanwella.
The relatives of the deceased had later lodged a complaint with the Mirihana Police Special Crimes Division, alleging that his wife and her paramour had committed the crime. Police had subsequently arrested the couple.
The nine-year-old daughter of the deceased had said that her mother and the paramour had assaulted her father before forcing him into a three-wheeler after gagging him. Upon interrogations, the wife of the deceased confessed to the crime. The suspects were later remanded until August 3. Mirihana Police are conducting further investigations.
