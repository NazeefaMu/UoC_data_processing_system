Yan Oya reservoir project : Resettlement programme expedited

The resettlement programme of families evacuated from the landscape getting submerged due to the proposed Yan Oya reservoir is accelerated.
Irrigation Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soyza said at a meeting at the Yan Oya project office that the resettlement programme that should have been finalised before work on the project started, has been neglected until the eleventh hour. Eighty one families in the Horowpothana Divisional Secretariat division and 135 families in Gomarankawada DS division are granted housing gratuity of Rs. 228 million.
The families are provided lands for house construction in Mailawewa and Kajuwaththa at Gomarankadawala in Trincomalee and in Issnawewa and Omaradaka in Horowpothana in the Anuradhapura district.
The resettlement scheme is supervised by Horowpothana Divisional Secretary M.Mubarak and Gomarankadawala Division Secretary Chandana Samarakoon.
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M.Wanninayake said those whose lands are taken over for the Yan Oya reservoir project will be paid compensation for their lands.
