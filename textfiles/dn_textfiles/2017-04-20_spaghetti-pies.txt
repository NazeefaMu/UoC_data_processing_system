Spaghetti  pies

A new, progressive type of doughnut has arrived on the scene. Good news, right? Doughnuts are soft and lovely, so a new one is surely welcome?
Well. These doughnuts are made of something very different to the usual doughy happiness. They're made of spaghetti. Yes. Pasta. They're pasta.
A US restaurant is behind the invention. It combines a classic Neapolitan dish known as spaghetti pie with the very American circular snack.
Pop Pasta, in Brooklyn, New York, released the spaghetti doughnuts late last year, and they're selling well. In the last week, they've taken off on social media.
Creators Luigi Fiorentino and wife Emy Gargiulo say on their website: “In the Neapolitan tradition the spaghetti pie is a dish prepared with pasta leftovers combined with eggs and cheese and then fried.
The pair say the dish is the “perfect food to bring to picnics or to the beach, and it isn’t messy like pizza!”
Each pasta doughnut is baked, and flavours include the aglio e olio, with olive oil and garlic, a carbonara version with pancetta, and the bolognese, made with ground beef.
