JAT Sri Lanka Open Golf 2016: Overnight leader Saqib shines with a Hole in One

 
An eventful Day 2 of the Jat Sri Lanka Open Golf Championship 2016 witnessed another record when overnight leader Saqib Syed Ahmed from Bangalore holed his drive in one shot on the 288 yard par 4, sixth (6th) hole at the Royal Colombo Golf Club course yesterday.
The Hole in One at the 6th hole at the RCGC is the first occasion a player has holed out from the tee. What is most impressive is that the Hole in One was achieved in a Professional golf tournament.
Saqib added to his first round 6 under to lead the field after round 2, on a 7 under total of 135. Multiple winner of the Asian Tour, Rashid Khan carded a 68, three under par to be 4 strokes off the lead.
Lalith Kumara placed second with 5 under on day one had a disastrous round and is off the leader board. However, seven-time winner of the Sri Lanka Open Anura Rohana returned a two under card to be tied in 3rd place with defending champion Thangaraja who was again 1 under par. The best score of the day was 68 (3 under) shared by Rashid Khan, Tissa Chandradasa and Vijitha Bandara.
Two-time winner Prabagaran carded a quiet 1 under to lie in joint 8th place with Vijitha Bandara. Khalin Joshi returned a two under 69 to be tied in 5th place. Mithun Perera, Sri Lanka’s leading player on the Asian Tour had an indifferent day to be tied in 10th place with M. Dharma of India. Waseem Rana of Pakistan, the best of the Pakistan challenge was tied in 13th place on 146.
The field of 90 players was pruned down to 38 with the cut-off implemented at 156. A total of 38 players made it to the final two rounds to be worked off on Thursday and Friday.
The JAT Sri Lanka Open 2016 seems poised for a great finish with just 9 strokes separating the leader and 10th place. The title sponsor JAT Holdings and co- sponsor UTE CAT are highly commended for making it possible to distribute a prize purse of Rs.2.5 million, laying the platform for a Sri Lanka Professional Golf Tour by 2017.
