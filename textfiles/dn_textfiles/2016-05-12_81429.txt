'MR invited for gathering of dictators'

 
 Rathnapura District UNP MP Hesha Withanage commenting on the Uganda tour of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said Mahinda was invited for a gathering of dictators.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Withanage said the former president maintained healthy relationships only with countries such as Swaziland and Uganda ruled by dictators.
He couldn't maintain healthy relationships with the western countries, he said.
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said the former President left for Uganda to attend the fifth swearing-in ceremony of the Ugandan President Yoweri Musaveni while President Maithripala Sirisena left for UK which is a powerful country.
