THIRD TERM FOR PRESIDENTS
The latest controversial talk given much publicity in both press and electronic media is whether a President who has served two terms of office as President could recontest for the third term. The controversy, as I see is after a break, whether they are eligible.
The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka states in CHAPTER VII – THE EXECUTIVE – The President of the Republic – 30-[2] No person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the people shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people.
Can anyone more knowledgeable enlighten the masses, giving weightage to the words NO PERSON and THEREAFTER as we are being misguided by politicians and those who have had special favours during a President’s regime.
