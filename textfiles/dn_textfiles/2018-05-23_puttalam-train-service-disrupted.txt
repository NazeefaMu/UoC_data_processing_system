Puttalam train service disrupted

The train service on the Puttalam line has been disrupted by floods, a spokesperson for the Sri Lanka Railways said. He added that trains are operated from Colombo up to Lunuwila and back since the track has been submerged by flood waters between Nattandiya and Thummaodara.
