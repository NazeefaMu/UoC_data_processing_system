Virtuous fragrance before rain

With a heritage of glorious history from Buddha’s times, this gives a unique opportunity to thousands who wait eagerly to gain merit by partaking in giving along attending to the daily needs of the Sangha during the vassana season. The early Buddhist monk was a mendicant and he depended on the generosity of the laymen for his existence
Ayan Vassana Kalo! This is the vassana period believed to be the highest merit bestowing religious ceremony performed in the Buddha Sasana coming down from the days of Thathagatha the Perfect One, the supremely enlightened one. We see Buddha Dhamma and Sangha indivisibly together during this period. There is no other time that the Triple Gem is venerated by the Buddhists so much.
We have no doubt one who sees the Dhamma sees the Thathagatha and vice versa. The Buddha has already passed away into Parinibbana. But his teachings still remains. It is nothing but Dhamma.
Loving kindness
“Boundless are the virtues and goodness of the Buddha, Boundless is the excellence of Dhamma, Boundless are the virtues of Buddha’s enlightened disciples – the Sangha with their mission to teach the multitude of Buddhists”. This awakened awareness endlessly generating loving kindness and compassion in them is very well seen during the vassana period.
With a heritage of glorious history from Buddha’s times, this gives a unique opportunity to thousands who wait eagerly to gain merit by partaking in giving along attending to the daily needs of the Sangha during the vassana season. The early Buddhist monk was a mendicant and he depended on the generosity of the laymen for his existence.
This became all the more important during the rainy season during which time they are confined to the temple. According to the Buddha, those who have become Bhikkhus, having given up worldly pleasures are free to devote their full-time energy, effort to concentrate on Dhamma. They meditate during vas time as the achievement of Sila is what is expected of them. There was also the belief that merit could be acquired by the laity by making offerings to the Sangha venerating Dhamma and finally the Triple Gem.
Sacred religious event
Binara full moon poya day occupies a significant place in the history of Buddha Sasana. It is on this day, Bhikkuni Sasana was founded. Vinaya Pitaka and Anguttara Nikaya make mention of setting up of the monastic order for women. At one time when Buddha was in Kapilavaththu, his step mother Maha Prajapathi Gothami asked for permission to go forth into the homeless life. The Buddha refused saying: “no Gothami do not wish for women to enter homeless life in this doctrine and discipline of Thathagatha”. She made the same request on two other occasions and she was disappointed as the Buddha gave a negative answer each time.
On a later occasion when the Buddha was residing in Vesali Maha Prajapathi Gothami Rahula Matha and a large group of Sakyan ladies cut their hair, dressed in ascetic clothes and traveled a long distance to Vesali to show their profound determination. At this juncture, Thera Ananda made a new request on their behalf. The Buddha now gave permission to Maha Prajapathi Gothami to enter the order on condition that she would accept the “Eight Great Conditions”.
Hence they got the opportunity to follow [the “Noble one, who is steadfast, wise, learned dutiful and devout. one should follow only such a Noble Man who is truly good and discerning even do the moon follow the path of stars”– The Dhammapada].
