Three former Lankan cricket captains condemn violence

Cricket legends Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena condemned the acts of violence reported following the tense situation in Kandy area. They requested the public to stay vigilant and ensure harmony among all ethnicities.
Former Sri Lanka Cricket Captain Kumar Sangakkara posting a video on Twitter requested everyone not to be blinded by hatred, ignorance and fear and urged everybody to say no to racism.
“To my fellow Sri Lankans, Have we not learned anything from our past? Have we lost sight of basic human decency and love? Are we morally corrupted that we cannot see our mindless acts are endangering our common future? We are responsible for the safety and well being of our neighbours. We are our sisters’ keepers. We are our brothers’ keepers. We have to make sure that in Sri Lanka anyone and everyone feels safe, loved and accepted regardless of ethnicity or religion.” Sangakkara said.
“When we look into the eyes of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters, we should not see a Sinhalese or a Tamil or a Muslim or a Burgher. We must see ourselves in eachother. We must see the hopes and dreams in their eyes. And we must see the same deep love for our country and for one another. Let’s not allow their eyes, our eyes and our vision not to be blinded by ignorance, hatred and by fear. Together, let us say no to racism.” he also said.
Sangakkara in a Tweeter message further said that “No one in Sri Lanka can be marginalised or threatened or harmed due to their ethnicity or religion. We are one country and one people. Love, trust and acceptance should be our common mantra. No place for racism and violence. Stand together and stand strong.”
Former Sri Lankan captain and former politician Sanath Jayasuriya requested the public to act intelligently and demanded the culprits be brought to justice.
“Disgusting and sickening to see the acts of violence in Sri Lanka,” he tweeted.
“I condemn strongly and request to bring the involved culprits to justice. I request people of Sri Lanka to be wise and stay together in these tough times.” the twitter massage further said.
Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardena vehemently condemned the recent acts of violence and demanded everyone involved to be brought to justice regardless of race, religion or ethnicity.“I grew up in a civil war which lasted 25 years and I don’t want the next generation to go through that,” he tweeted.
