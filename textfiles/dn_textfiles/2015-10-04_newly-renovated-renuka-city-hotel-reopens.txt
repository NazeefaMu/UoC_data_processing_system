Newly renovated Renuka City Hotel reopens

Colombo’s rapidly developing hospitality sector witnessed its latest advancement recently when Renuka City Hotel relaunched after a complete refurbishment.
Patrons can expect to find the same familiar charm that they’ve grown accustomed to over the years but set in a brand new ambience owing to a LKR 300 million revamp of the hotel’s interiors. Following an eight-month period of extensive refurbishment, the newly rebranded hotel will reinforce its status as a star-class hotel in Sri Lanka’s capital city.
With tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka up by 26.1 per cent, year-on-year since May 2014 and a 16% increase when comparing 2014 and 2015 arrivals to date, the revamping of the hotel’s accommodation facilities is well-timed. The project is an integral aspect of the company’s rebranding process, with Hotel Renuka and Renuka City amalgamating to become Renuka City Hotel. The new brand reflects Renuka Hotel Group’s continued commitment to meeting the changing needs of a global traveller today; a traveller that seeks the best accommodation and efficient service at a reasonable rate for a memorable stay in the heart of the city.

Renuka City Hotel is located on prime real estate in the centre of Sri Lanka’s cosmopolitan commercial capital. Since it was founded in 1972 the hotel has catered to those visiting the city for business and/or leisure. The bright and airy interiors, plush furnishings, attentive staff and every accommodation made for the modern traveller such as free Wi-Fi connectivity throughout the hotel, a fully functional business centre, well equipped fitness centre, rooftop infinity pool and meeting/conference rooms makes it the ideal choice for accommodation in the city. In addition conveniences such as the hotel’s 24-hour room service, same day laundry service, a range of in-room amenities and plenty of free parking make for a comfortable and hassle-free stay.
41 of the 100 rooms at the hotel as well as the banquet hall have been completely redesigned and refurbished by DDN Design and Sanken Construction Pvt Ltd over an eight-month period.
The hotel’s gym, pool and lounge areas were also fully renovated as stage one of the project prior to the main refurbishment process. The banquet hall equipped with deluxe interiors and state of the art lighting is ideal for celebrating any special occasion, hosting a corporate function or conference. It has the flexibility to accommodate audiences from 250 to 20 people. The multi-functional banquet hall has inbuilt partitions creating individual rooms to meet each client’s requirements.
Guests and visiting diners may indulge their palettes at the hotel’s newly refurbished restaurant The Palmyrah, which specialises in authentic Sri Lankan cuisine with an emphasis on Jaffna fare for over 40 years. The new menu offers a variety of international favourites while specialising in the best dishes Sri Lanka has to offer.
