Police seek AG’s advice in Malaka case

A case involving an incident where Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had allegedly assaulted on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Colombo has been referred to the Attorney General for his advice, police informed court.
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) conducting investigations into the incident had informed Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding two counter cases. Police further told that they were yet to receive Attorney General's advice regarding the incident.
At a previous occasion, court decided to name Scotsman James Francis Casserly as a suspect in a case where he had allegedly punched Malaka Silva in the face during the scuffle at a nightclub in Colombo 3, in 2014.
Further magisterial inquiry into the two counter cases fixed for May 30 next year.
Seven suspects including Malaka Silva, son of former Minister Mervyn Silva were arrested over an alleged assault on a Scottish couple at a nightclub in Duplication Road, Colombo 3 on October 31, 2014. Police complaints were subsequently lodged by both parties claiming they had been assaulted.
As a part of the investigation regarding the Scotsman’s complaint, police had arrested and produced in Court seven suspects including Malaka Silva. They are currently on bail.
Malaka Silva's lawyers alleged that police had failed to take legal action regarding their complaint that Malaka Silva was severely assaulted by Scotsman and even had a scratch on Malaka’s nose.
Taking into consideration the evidence placed before Court, the then Additional Magistrate decided to name James Francis Casserly as a suspect.
