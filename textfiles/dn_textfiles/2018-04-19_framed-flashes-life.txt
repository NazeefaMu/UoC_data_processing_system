Framed flashes of life

‘Rendezvous in Colour’ at Alliance Française de Colombo
Where you feel passion, you are driven to strive and create. With burning enthusiasm, these artists splashed colour on their canvases, always reassured by the guidance of a trusted teacher.
Driven by their passion for art, many beginners have turned to Veteran artist Royden O. Gibbs throughout the years, for his tutelage. The final works of one such group of artists were displayed recently at exhibition ‘Rendezvous in Colour’.
The creations of the diverse group of 12 students were displayed at the Alliance Française de Ceylon, popularly known as Alliance Française de Colombo. The artists were, namely, Lal Chandranath, Veeranthi Wijemanne, Keshani De Silva, Renuka Mendis, Hansaja Devnith, Malinka Samarasinha, Dharsha Samarasinha, Wasantha K. Siriwardena, Manel Ratnayake, Dianthi Uragoda, Gamini Fernando and Lilani de Silva.
The exhibition spoke to its curious audience through a number of impressive paintings –from water colour still life to portraits of persons, from urban scenes to enthralling flashes of nature.
Green scenes of nature
Dianthi Uragoda’s sceneries drew in the viewer’s attention in an unfailing grip. While standing in the quietness, contemplating her work, one would feel enveloped in the green forest view. Her work ‘Serenity’ captured light pouring through the green into a stream of water and each ray of that light had been made to look radiant. If you lingered long enough, you would feel the coolness pouring through the scenery. Her painting ‘Cascading Water’ pulled in the viewer with equal strength, making one imagine the sound the gushing body of water, while ‘Morning Glory’ enveloped you completely in the cool shades of green.
‘Seascape in Galle’ by Wasantha Siriwardena revealed a calm sea of emerald green. The atmosphere of the painting captured the viewer instantly. The colors were maneuvered neatly to create gentle waves and the picture was a framed scrap of nature to remember.
Above ‘Seascape in Galle’ hung ‘Light House – Beruwela’ by the same artist as if to remind us that every adventurer who sets sail out in the ocean eventually seeks the welcoming light of land.
Portrayal of wild animals
Uragoda had captured the adoring mischief in the eye of a young leopard in her painting ‘Leopard Cub.’ The feeling of adoration evoked by the painting was felt in contrast with the danger and subtle fear, felt when standing across the room, in front of Siriwardena’s ‘Leopard.’ The latter showed a full grown beast with lurking danger, powerfully portrayed in its eyes. ‘Leopard’ was done with pen and ink and the monochrome background surrounded the animal, creating an image of night time.
The same unafraid, daring sense was captured by Hansaja Devnith in his painting of two wild elephants. The fearlessness of the eyes of one elephant looked at the viewer through the painting and they spoke of unmistakable danger that hides in the wild. Gamini Fernando’s ‘Tiger in Rantharbhore’ similarly captured a tiger with scrutinizing eyes. The softness of its hair was portrayed skillfully.
The painters had succeeded in portraying emotion in the faces of their subjects. A close observer would notice that even wild animals could communicate through their features.
From ancient ruins to urban scenes
Ancient ruins and the quietness that surrounds them were skillfully portrayed in Devnith’s ‘Veherakanda – Kotte’ and Keshani de Silva’s ‘Beyond Serenity.’ The unmistakable pink and red flush of drooping young leaves of ironwood (na) trees portrayed in the latter revealed the skill of the painter.
Taking the viewer into more structured, urban scenes were ‘Urban Conviviality’ by de Silva and ‘Slave Island’ by Siriwardena. The exhibition was gracefully adorned with these brief flashes of views from everyday life, looking into the scrutiny of the viewer.
Veeranthi Wijemanne’s ‘Tranquility’ and de Silva’s ‘A Bright, Breezy Day’ showed sun-stained paths that stretched among big trees.
The open spaces between the portrayed objects conveyed the quietness of the scenes, though, if you were curious enough to step into the sunny day in your mind’s eye, you would observe the sound of the breeze, rustling through the soft trees. The colours were maneuvered deftly to make the sunshine look natural. The method of painting realistic light was prominent in these works, too.
Delicate painting
Lilani de Silva’s paintings, titled ‘From the Garden Fence,’ ‘A Drop of Nectar’ and ‘Hidden in Shells’ showed a graceful beauty that was soft and gentle. The flowers, the feathers and the delicate egg-shells –it all, very quietly, spoke of how gentle her brush strokes were, and her careful choice of colours.
More works of art
Manel Ratnayaka’s ‘View from Kadugannawa’ showed impressive scenery and it was evident how the painter succeeded in placing the viewer at a high point, looking into the vast greenery below.
Lal Chandranath had portrayed ‘Disappearing Brick Kilns of Kaluaggala’ and ‘The Parson House in Canada (built 1886-1888),’ each painting capturing the rural surroundings of the two countries excellently. The chosen colours –green and brown prominent among them– blended nicely into the rest of the watercolour-washed art of the exhibition.
Among other chosen media were also oils, pastels and lead pencil. Uragoda’s ‘Portrait of Amma’ was done completely in lead pencil and was remarkable among a number of similar works.
The collection was, overall, impressive. It was clear that Gibbs’ students did not fail to do justice to the media with which they chose to create their works of art.
