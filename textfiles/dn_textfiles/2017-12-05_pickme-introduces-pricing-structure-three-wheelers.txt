PickMe introduces pricing structure for three-wheelers

In a strategic move to bring greater benefits for drivers and patrons, homegrown taxi hailing service PickMe reduced its three-wheeler fares to Rs.33 per kilometer, from a previous fare of Rs.35 per kilometer.
The decision was made following a comprehensive study done on the trip patterns of local tuk-tuk (three-wheelers) passengers which brought to light the reason for most taxi-riding grievances of both driver and passenger. While some passengers needed to get from A to B as soon as possible, others used taxis for more accommodating needs such as to get their shopping done or for sightseeing.
“When calculating the new fare, we also considered a driver’s opportunity cost -that is the potential amount a driver could earn while he spends his time on a ride than staying idle - and on this account we increased the ‘waiting time’ fare from Rs.2/= per km to Rs.3.50/= per km so that a driver would be fairly compensated for the time spent waiting for a passenger while on a hire” said Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe.
Expressing his views on the price revision PickMe Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, “At PickMe, With prices much lower than a common metered three-wheeler in the streets now, PickMe is now more affordable and convenient for our users. Drivers will also benefit from the lower fares because when the demand increases there will be less idle time between trips, meaning that the drivers have a better chance in converting their time into income.
