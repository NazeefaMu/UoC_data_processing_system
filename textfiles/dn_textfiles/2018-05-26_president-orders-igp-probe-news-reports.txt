President orders IGP to probe news reports

President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the Inspector General of Police to conduct an immediate investigation into several fabricated news articles which has appeared in the mainstream Sinhala newspapers yesterday.
Two Sinhala newspapers had published separate articles titled ‘Civil Aragalayakata Pasubima Hadana Kisidu Kriyawakata Ida Notabanna’ (Do not allow any move to create backdrop for a civil unrest) and ‘Rata Bedana Wada Gana Arakshaka Ansha Seeruwen’ (Security forces on alert to avert on any separatist agenda) respectively.
It is understood that the news reports have been fabricated by individuals or an organization with vested interests who had later circulated this report to media institutions for publication.
