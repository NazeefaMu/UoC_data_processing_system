Kandy SC should have it easy

Defending league champions and current table leaders Kandy Sports Club will host the Air Force Sports Club on Saturday in what is expected to be a one sided game. This is going to be the fourth game of the season for the two teams.
In this match they are all out to secure the highest score of the season as the team has got into top gear with brilliant performance, some excellent rugby for the host team. Buwanaka Udangamuwa was the player of the last match with some barging runs and excellent defence, breaking from the scrum and feeding the three quarters to run in the open. They are sure to play up smart rugby and get the result the way they want.
Head-to-head,the difference between the two sets of forwards will be interesting as both play crucial roles for their respective sides, especially in the first half. They are impressive ball carriers and will be expected to get their teams over the advantage line with some strong runs. Airmen who beat Police SC in their last outing, will be hoping to give a better display. Whatever the Airmen will try to do, today the defending champions would dominate,
Kandy Sports Club, of course, will dominate the game from the kick-off unless the Airmen stage a huge surprise but Kandy are always a wild card at the game, having knocked all the clubs they met in the tournament. The have an insatiable hunger to win every game they play. Until the pretenders to the throne can match that desire, they cannot be beaten at this venue by any team. Kandy Sports Club’s attacking style of play helps drive their ability to demolish opponents, and they are blessed with some of the best rugby brains in Richard Dharmapala, Dhanuska Ranjan, A. Wilwera, Jason Dissanayake, Thilina Wijesinghe and Lavanga Perera to name a few.
The way Kandy Sports Club play rugby it is obviously an expensive game that many other teams don't advocate, it makes them more flexible to go out there and score quick tries if needed. It certainly helps playing that brand of rugby and having the belief that it is not over till it’s over.
Kandy's attacking style of play helps drive their ability to demolish any opponents. No one in the Kandy SC set-up is more important than the players. They maintain an iron-clad grip on the game at all levels, towards this end it is important to give credit to the rugby Chairman Lasantha
Wijesuriya, Coach Sean Wijesinghe, Manager Kapila Silva, Saliya Kumar for guiding these players to what they are. Of course, nothing happens without the able encouragement, support and motivation by their Trustee Malik Samarawickrema.
