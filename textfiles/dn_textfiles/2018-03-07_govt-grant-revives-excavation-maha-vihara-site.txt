“Under the revived programme, we have restored the once-dilapidated Wali Maluwa around Maha Saya and the main Buddha shrine in Salapathala Maluwa.”
“The excavation and restoration of the ancient rampart from Thuparama to Sri Maha Bodhi is about to begin. We also wish to excavate the area between Sri Maha Bodhi and Maha Saya as we believe there Buddhist monks’ cells here.”
The alms hall and the image house opposite Maha Saya is to be restored, while reconstruction of the chapter house of Lovamahapaya is being planned at the request of Atamasthanadhipathi Ven.
