And the rest is uttered in detail

Prologue of First Utterance
The story of three men, deemed mad in a dystopian world, who shirk reality for dreams, music for silence and sanity for peace. Plunge into the myth and mystique of Mirage as the collective fate of these men brings a nation to its knees and heralds the end of time itself.
I am your lover for this eternal night;
In return for spiritual wage, I will offer my body whole to you:
My mouth for your hurried piety;
My bosoms for your gentle devotion;
My legs for your sanctification; and my womb for your seed
As you pour yourself whole - I long to be your grail this eternal night;
The mother of your patriarchs whose duty shall be to show them the one truth:
That in all colour and sound,
And in the eternal rhythm they are fated to march to,
You lie - and I am
Your Cosmic Mistress, your lover for this eternal night,
When our bodies moved in sync to primordial song;
But remember this as you take your leave now:
Your name will be banished to the mountain of lost memories,
While our progeny, this bastard blood line of yours,
will forever call me Mother Mirage.
He is a debut writer though with a strong presence online. Theena Kumaragurunathan enjoys a privileged audience which most budding English authors in Sri Lanka are deprived of. First Utterance, his maiden literary work, was submitted to a number of leading publishers only to be turned down. It fell out of the Gratiaen recognition as well.
Kumaragurunathan was not the one to give in that easily.
He initiated the arduous expedition of self-publishing. The publishers’ interests centred on well-liked themes such as ethnic conflict and Sri Lanka’s postwar struggle cum situation. Theena had not even got closer to such a coverage. That was quite a challenge – apart from being an English writer with a first appearance - in this small isle, but Theena’s links with the corporate world came in handy. He chose the team he wanted, and things began to smoothen. The team of the right people worked on three aspects: cover, layout and the rest. Kumaragurunathan’s efforts were not in total vain, as the Fairway National Literary Awards 2016 recognised his work in its English Fiction category. It came to be featured on Huffington Post and other online platforms that matter.
First Utterance is a novella of short stories, three poems and a play ultimately connected to each other. Theena baptises that connection as Mirage. The reader is taken to the task of exploring the initial stages of Mirage.
Writing, especially in English, is not so professional in Sri Lanka. Most writers have a bit of a difficulty in striking a balance between their day job and writing as a profession. Hardly anyone would dare consider being an author as a profession. Kumaragurunathan shares an otherwise opinion. Being a son of a poet-turned-printer, Kumaragurunathan is a professional by day and a storyteller by night. Where does he derive inspiration for writing?
“Because I love stories - be they literary, visual or musical. The storytelling skill that I have some degree of talent for is writing. That’s why I write.”
Striking a balance between night and day had been exhaustive. He almost left his day job in order to focus intensely on the pet project. Today he is happy that he did not. The busy schedule sharing time between his day job and writing the First Utterance only made him proactive on the path to become an established scribe.
That idea to write the First Utterance was born somewhere in September 2009. Then it took years to develop the fictitious region and its citizens. Until 2012, he had been struggling with the structure and its characters. That cast a huge challenge, as it was his first book. But then at one moment, he got the right idea on how and where to pilot his project. He did not let go of that moment of illumination. He logged out of Internet and had hours dedicated for writing, rewriting and editing. Following a number of minor revisions that his editor had suggested, the book finally made its way to the print in 2015.
“A writer’s first publication is an announcement to the world that he has completed the first part of a long journey; he is gone from reader to writer to author. Long journeys are rarely undertaken alone – this is true both in the real world and in imaginary ones. Mine was no different,” notes Theena at the end of his long-awaited pet project.
His path from reader to writer was very much inspired by a few books such as One Hundred Years of Solitude, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Heart of Darkness, House of Leaves, The English Teacher, Ficciones, The Glass Bead Game and Watchmen. Like any prolific writer who also happens to be an avid reader, Theena finds himself lost in the list as he can go on naming hundreds of more titles.
“I read fairly extensively both fiction and non-fiction. I probably read more non-fiction. It is curiosity mostly. And everything else is detail,” Theena observed his passion for reading and writing.
And who is his worst critic? Probably himself. “But that’s a terrible cliche so I won’t bore you with it,” he added.
Looking back, does he feel as if he could have edited his first book?
“If you mean editing it more than I have already, before having it edited by two different editors thereafter, of course not. That would have only driven me crazy,” he mused.
Theena Kumaragurunathan identifies the literary awards, like the Fairway National Awards, as a good platform for writers to announce themselves to the world. It will be nice to have validation for months of sacrifice from your peers. “What I am concerned with is ensuring that literary storytelling continues to hold an important place in our cultural fabric. Those are the writers who have inspired me to take this journey that I am on,” Kumaragurunathan said.
One interesting trivia in Theena Kumaragurunathan is that he cannot drive. Probably that’s good for him, as it always provides him with an opportunity to read something when he is seated at the back of a tuk-tuk.
Theenathayalan Kumaragurunathan’s First Utterance was published on Marcy 27, 2016 as a paperback of 84 pages. It may not be the title you will likely come across in the traditional bookshelf. “I don’t think the book will have suitable extracts for you to reproduce,” the author warned this writer before passing the portable document format of the copy. His writings may look almost utopian, or probably not. But that is fully up to you, the reader.
Find out what this up and coming writer, Theena, rejected by Gratiaen and a couple of publishers yet recognised by the Fairway National Awards, has to say in his maiden work. You will find a whole new world uttered in curiosity fused with detail.
Response from the Goodreads Readers
Theena’s first book is a beauty. The density of its content, despite the succinct wordplay throughout, bursts through each word compelling you to invest all your attention in it. Multi-tasking or reading-on-the-go won’t work with this, but given that you can finish it up nicely within two hours (three at the most, if you’re a slow reader), the time isn’t hard to come by.

Rarely I think has an author’s first utterance come off as well as this, the first Miragian Cycle. Theena in his debut dares to tackle not simply fantasy or scifi or drama, but the realms of speculative fiction, magical realism. “Genres” mined to great depths by greats like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and depths to which ‘First Utterance” clearly aspires to. Does it reach them? Yes. I think it does far more than it does not.

I was told to read the book without looking for a plot, and that’s exactly what I did, letting the words wash over me, and leaving one story as I go into the next. Was I in awe? No. But that is probably because I have issues with any material that involves prophets and religion as a fact (and I have no issue believing in Thestrals and Hippogriffs. Go figure). I liked this for the language. For the way parts of the book read like poetry. I liked this for the way different threads were seemingly left around, only to be tied at the end.
