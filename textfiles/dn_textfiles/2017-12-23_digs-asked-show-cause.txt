Election law violations:
DIGs asked to show cause

Senior DIG (Administration and Elections) C.D. Wickramaratne has asked the relevant DIGs to show cause as to why the law was not implemented in relation to seven political processions that were held against the law on Thursday, said Police Media Spokesman, SP Ruwan Gunasekara said yesterday.
He added that the Senior DIG took this measure following media revelations about such processions.
Gunasekara said that the Police have also been instructed to take action against those people responsible for organising such processions.
The Police Media Spokesman was speaking at the Election Commission premises following the second discussion between the Police and the Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya.
SP Gunasekara said Rs.30 million has been allocated for the Police to employ labourers and for the welfare of Police personnel until December 31 of this year in relation to Local Government election activities.
He added the allocations from January 1 up to the election date would be approved in due course.
SP Gunasekara further said the Police decided, following yesterday’s dicussions to establish a separate Hotline at the Child and Women’s Bureau to hear the concerns and complaints of the female contestants at the Local Government election.
He added that a Hot Line number would be published within a few days.
He also said the main cause for election violence is that the contestants or their supporters’ canvassing from door to door. There was no proper provisions in the Ordinance regarding this.
“During such a situation, the Election Commission can take a decision on it, if the Police requested for the Chairman’s instructions,” the Police Spokesman said.
“The Election Commission Chairman following discussions with Party Leaders and the members of the Election Commission, would decide the number of supporters that could go on door to door campaigning,” he added.
According to the Local Government Election Law, cases can be filed regarding most issues with the approval of the Attorney General. Therefore, during discussions, the Election Commission Chairman agreed to request the Attorney General to appoint a Counsel to attend to these matters to expedite hearings.
He added that the Police expressed support for the conducting of a free and fair election.
SP Gunasekara said that the Media was not a subject of discussion. However, there were provisions in the law in relation to the media which would be implemented accordingly.
The Police Spokesman added that processions were held in violation of the ban. Police had initiated investigations into them. The Senior DIG (Elections) had inquired in to the activities of the respective Police officers who had failed to commence investigations in relation to the seven such processions.
DIG Ravi Peiris (Election Commission Coordinator) and several other senior offices and officers of the Election Commission led by the Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya participated in the discussion.
