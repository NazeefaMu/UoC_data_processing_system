Habits of The Richest People in the World

There is one secret that almost every rich person knows. This secret is very important because it's the reason they are rich in the first place. This big secret can be summed up in the words of the mighty Aristotle: "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."
Rich people have gone through the painful process of forming rich people's habits, and you can become financially prosperous as well if you make up your mind to do the same. Together, let's examine 10 habits of the richest people in the world to help you make up your mind to make these habits yours, too.
1. They are goal setters
Rich people set goals that make them rich. People don't become rich by accident. Rich people are very deliberate: they set goals to become rich and they eventually achieve those goals. The act of goal setting itself is a very rewarding exercise because it helps you to see and feel the money you want to have even before you get it.
2. They focus on one thing at a time
A laser beam can cut through very hard objects-it can cut through almost anything, in fact-and this is because of its unusual ability to concentrate all its power on a particular spot on the object until it begins to melt. Rich people are usually like laser beams. They set outrageous goals, but they stay focused on that one goal, directing all their activities and efforts towards achieving that goal until they accomplish it. Average Joes, on the other hand, often have no focus; they just tend to do whatever comes their way and take whatever life hands them. If you want to be rich, be goal oriented and stay focused.
3. They have great respect for time
Brian Tracy said that rich people think in terms of what they earn hourly rather than monthly or annually.
Because they think hourly, whenever they are spending time on unproductive activities, they think about how much they are losing with every passing moment. Rich people don't spend too much time on social media or watching TV. They work around the clock and cannot afford to waste any minute of their day.
4. They spend less than they earn
As simple as this may seem, it is the secret to getting wealthy: always spend less than you earn. The problem with poor-thinking people is they increase their expenses as their income increases. They buy better cars, bigger houses and they remain poor or average. Think about this in terms of percentage; if you want to be rich then follow the motto, "Save 10% of whatever you earn." But be smart about it. As Warren Buffet said: "Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving." I also advise that you work with a budget and that you keep an income and expenditure statement.
5. They work very hard
Except for people who inherited great riches, I have not seen any lazy rich person. Rich people work very hard and they also work constantly. People that work hard can't be behind, they are always on top of their profession whether they are business people, self-employed, or even employees. They always do things that ordinary people cannot do.
6. They continually learn and grow
The more you know is the more you earn. Your learning power determines your earning power. As much as it is important to work hard, hard work alone will not make you rich. Before money can be earned, value must be given in return, and the only way to add more value to your clients is by first adding more value to yourself. This can only be done through continuous learning. Make up your mind to develop new skills and gain more experience every day.
7. They keep rich company
Rich people don't have poor friends. As the old saying goes, "Show me your friends and I will tell you who you are." Let me tell you something: you may not have so much money right now, but as long as you keep walking with rich people or those with the potential to become rich, you will someday become very rich yourself.
8. They are persistent
Rich people don't give up. About 90% of rich people today did not become rich the way they originally thought or intended. They tried, they failed, and they rose up again many times before they eventually succeeded. You may lose a lot of money in the process, but you'll keep getting better by learning from your mistakes and experiences until you get the financial independence you desire.
9. They take calculated risks
Rich people are fond of taking risks. Once they decide they want to get something, they will give whatever it takes to get it, even if it means risking their lives sometimes. If you want to become rich, don't be afraid of taking risks. Be bold and courageous, but also be calculative. Know what each decision will cost you and never put all your eggs in one basket.
10. They are generous
Rich people are very generous. If you look at the lives of the richest people in modern history, you will discover that a lot of them are great philanthropists: people like Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, to name a few. Make giving one of your habits today and you will become very rich someday, too.
