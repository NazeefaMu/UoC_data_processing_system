Siritunga Jayasuriya seeks interim order

The United Socialist Party (USP) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission.
This is from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Sri Jayawardenapura - Kotte Municipal Council. United Socialist Party Secretary Siritunga Jayasuriya filed this petition in the Supreme Court through President's Counsel Srinath Perera naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others respondents.
Jayasuriya is seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte Municipal Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by USP's authorised agent to elect members to the Municipal Council.
The USP nomination papers had been rejected on the ground that the papers did not contain the required number of candidates.
