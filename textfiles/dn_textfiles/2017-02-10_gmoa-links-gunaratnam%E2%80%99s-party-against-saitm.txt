The Frontline Socialist Party and the GMOA would launch a joint struggle against the granting of official recognition to SAITM, the two organisations pledged at a joint press conference yesterday.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said that members  of their Association would dedicate themselves towards providing a safe and quality service to the patients while guaranteeing patients rights. The GMOA and the Frontiline Socialist Party held a meeting on February 8 and decided to launch a joint struggle against SAITM.
Dr.Ananda said The Publicity Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party Duminda Nagamuwa said that even though the JVP agreed that SAITM should be closed down the actual JVP stand on this matter was unclear. The Frontline Socialist Party would stand for the abolition of SAITM.
