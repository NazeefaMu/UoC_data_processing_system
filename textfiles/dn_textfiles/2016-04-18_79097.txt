SLC rectifies statement on Lasith Malinga

Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to respond to the concerns of the media with regards to Lasith Malinga's current status with the Mumbai Indians.
Lasith Malinga has not informed Sri Lanka Cricket of his travel to India, nor his intention to play for the IPL.
There is no bar on Malinga travelling to, watching, or participating in practice or training of cricket anywhere in the world. However, his ability to play is contingent on receiving a No Objection Certificate from SLC for which;
1.) SLC appointed expert panel of Medical professionals must clear his injury status.
2.) He must be declared 'Match Fit' by physio, trainer, coach and selectors.
Therefore, Malinga will present himself before the SLC panel of expert doctors on Wednesday (20th) and depending on the outcome of the said medical examinations, be required to face a match fitness grading after which SLC will take the next appropriate steps.
We also wish to inform you that there will be explanation called from Malinga with regards to his statements to the media in the recent days, and suitable action will be taken forthwith.
