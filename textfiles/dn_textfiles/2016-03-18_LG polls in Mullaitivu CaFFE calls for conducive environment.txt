LG polls in Mullaitivu: CaFFE calls for conducive environment

 
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) on March yesterday, sent a letter to the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faiszer Musthapha calling for elections pertaining to two local Government institutions in the Mullaitivu District to be held and calling for the creation of an environment conducive for political parties to be registered.
The letter also mentions that due to the postponement of Local Government elections in Muhudubadapaththu and Pudukuduirippu in the Mullaitivu District, even though it is nearing seven years since the war ended, a Local Government by people's representatives had not been established. Since the end of the war, these two pradeshiya sabha jurisdictions remain the only ones where Local Government had not been put in place.
It is in no way a democratic practice to hold a Local Government election based on nomination lists accepted over five years back.
On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that related court proceedings were a tactic by a pradeshiya politician to prevent the Tamil National Alliance from gaining power owing to the political environment prevalent at that time.
Elections could be held under new nominations in the aforementioned Local Government authorities through an Act of Parliament.
Even though various parties on many occasions have highlighted the need for a draft of a Bill with regard to this, nothing has taken place yet in this regard.
Due to various elections being held at various times, as of present for over 10 years now, no new political parties have being registered.
This has resulted in the creation of a wholly unhealthy environment for multiparty politics.
This situation has curtailed the ability for many groups who conduct themselves with a genuine political identity to act as a political party.
The responsibility of formulation of the laws necessary to solve both these issues fall on the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. The said Ministry led by the Minister has to take the responsibility for not only holding the elections on time, but also providing the facilities required to hold elections.
This is because Sri Lanka's State accepts multiparty democracy and also holds free and fair elections.
CaFFE requests that the drafts of Bills essential for the holding of the Local Government elections in Muhudubadapaththu and Pudukuduirippu, be presented to Parliament without further delay and steps be taken to present to the Parliament the suitable legal amendments which would allow for new political parties to be registered.
