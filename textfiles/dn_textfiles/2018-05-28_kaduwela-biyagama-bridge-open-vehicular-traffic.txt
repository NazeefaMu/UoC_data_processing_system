Kaduwela -Biyagama bridge to open to vehicular traffic

The bridge connecting Kaduwela and Biyagama has been opened for vehicular traffic, Road Development Authority officials stated. About four days back, heavy rains led to soil erosion below the Kaduwela - Biyagama bridge at its intersection with the Kelani Ganga bank, putting one side of the bridge at risk.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) officers of the tri-forces took immediate action to restore the bridge. They said the soil erosion was not very severe.Both lanes of the bridge have now been opened for vehicular movement.
