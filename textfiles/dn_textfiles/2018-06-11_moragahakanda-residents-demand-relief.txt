Moragahakanda residents demand relief

The All Ceylon Agrarian Federation charges that people who returned to their lands near the Moragahakanda reservoir did not receive relief and they are undergoing severe difficulties now.
Federation National Organiser Namal Karunarathna at a special media briefing said on June 7 that unless relief is not provided for the people who sacrificed their homes, lands and property for the welfare of the country, they are ready to begin a struggle along with the people.
Karunarathna was addressing the gathering after establishing an Agrarian Organisation for Laggala, Ma Oya residents who gave away their lands for the Moragahakanda Reservoir.
The residents said they were given land for farming but water. They complained that a few water bowsers are provided to manage all their needs.
Lack of facilities for transport, and higher education have put them in immense difficulties, and they have not received compensation, they alleged. They said the dry rations, rice and sprats being provided to them are not fit for consumption.
The villagers charged that the Mahaweli Authority does not permit them to go near the Moragahakanda reservoir area to sell their products to the people who come to view the reservoir.
Karunarathna said the people who sacrificed their homes, lands and property to develop the country must be treated well.
He said the people were managing very well before they gave up their properties for the Moragahakanda reservoir.
