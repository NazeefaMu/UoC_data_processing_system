Photographic exhibition marking Australia - Sri Lanka relations

A free photographic exhibition showcasing the history of cooperation between Sri Lanka and Australia will be held from April 21 to 23 at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, Colombo. The exhibition marks 70 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
The exhibition was launched by the Australian Minister for International Development and the Pacific Fierravanti-Wells.
“It’s a chance to learn about the history of our development partnership and the amazing Sri Lankan men and women that we have worked with, as Sri Lanka has changed and grown. Many of our new development programs are focused on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more quality jobs for all Sri Lankans,” said Minister Fierravanti-Wells.
Some of the newest partnerships are featured in the exhibition such as the project that provides economic opportunities for war widows in Vavuniya, a release from the Australian High Commission stated.
There are now over 200 women growing export grade papaya in their home gardens, which they pack in a processing factory they own before shipping to Dubai.
Other photographs highlight the Australia-Sri Lanka partnership through sport, education, infrastructure, de-mining and agriculture, the release added.
Over the last 70 years, Australia and Sri Lanka have built a strong friendship across many fields. Australia has been a consistent and reliable partner in support of Sri Lanka’s development. From sending relief supplies during the floods of the 1950s to, recovery from the tsunami and conflict, and recent investments in public education that have touched the lives of thousands of students, Australia has been a key partner in Sri Lanka’s development, the release stated.
