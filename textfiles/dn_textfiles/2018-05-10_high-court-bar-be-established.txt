The Supreme Court last month determined that Sections 12 A (1), 12 A (2) and 12 A (7) are inconsistent with the Constitution and need to be either amended or passed with a two thirds majority.
The Government amended those sections as advised by the Supreme Court and passed the Bill with a simple majority.
The Bill gives powers to the Permanent High Court at Bar to try a number of offences, including theft, dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servants, banker, merchant or agent and dishonestly receiving stolen property etc. Cheating, forgery, making a false document, making or possessing a counterfeit seal, plate etc, with intent to commit a forgery and offences of money laundering can also be directed to these separate courts.Bribery of judicial officers, Members of Parliament, Police officers, peace officers and other public officers also has been listed as an offence that can be tried in the permanent High court. Corruption, conspiracy and abetment to commit the offences under the Bribery Act are also an offence listed in the Bill.
