Fashion forward

Fashion is an attitude towards how a person represents himself or herself. And when people discover they have similarities in how they represent themselves that unites them in thought.
Mod’Art International and LIFT (Sri Lanka Institute of Fashion Technology) in partnership with the Embassy of France will be unveiling the collections of international graduates from difference nations who will be showcasing their designs.
International Graduate Fashion Spectacle (GIFS) is an event that welcomes fashion graduates from across the world to celebrate their talents and success representing their individual nations on one platform. The inaugural event will take place in July 2017 during the French Spring Festival in Sri Lanka. The designers from many countries, will show their first collections as new designers, launching themselves to the Fashion industry, graduating from many universities across the world. This year we have designers from France, United Kingdom, Germany, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,” said Managing Director LIFT / Mod'Art International Sri Lanka, Niroshani Leanage.
Leanage pointed out that the objective of IGFS is to bring together international designers to join hands in future entrepreneurships in design and share talents and technical expertise from each country to serve the industry better in the future.
Cross cultural links
“IGFS is conceptualized and organized by Lanka Institute of Fashion Technology and Mod’Art International Sri Lanka branch in partnership with the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka. Through IGFS we focus on developing cross cultural links, exchanging ideas, and technical knowhow of various countries. We encourage young designers to build partnerships and create international businesses with new concepts. In a fast moving world, fashion impacts many people and is changing the environment rapidly. We hope opportunities like IGFS will bring value to the Fashion Apparel Industry and the consumers of fashion. We hope that new designers breaking the boundaries and joining hands internationally with one another, celebrating design & fashion will open new avenues to experience fashion with value in the world,” she said.
Leanage also added that with the arrival of participants on July 5 they will be welcomed by the French Ambassador at a reception at his residence. Cultural & Cooperation Counsellor Embassy of France, Jean-Philippe Gavois said that the French Embassy is proud to have a strong collaboration with LIFT (Lanka Institute of Fashion Technology) throughout the years.
“LIFT is a key player in the fashion scene in Sri Lanka. LIFT is working with Mod’Art International and has leading expertise in this sector. This partnership between LIFT and Mod’Art is a great example of successful cooperation between our two countries. This year we are happy to partner with LIFT and Mod’Art for the sixth edition of the French Spring Festival in Sri Lanka. Every year the French Spring celebrates culture in Sri Lanka with music, exhibitions, Literature, street art. This time LIFT and Mod’Art will bring French and International fashion into Colombo. France is known in many fields- gastronomy, art and tourism. It gives us many options for our cultural programs throughout the year. But French culture would not be the same without fashion. We have great designers and brands, and fashion plays a very important role, in our economy and culture. It is natural for us to partner with LIFT and Mod’Art, to offer an event dedicated to fashion. This event will showcase the talent of young creators from Sri Lanka but also from many other countries including France. It will also showcase the excellence of French Fashion. During this event you will also enjoy a performance by the French jazz band, invited by France for the French Spring Festival. I hope that you will enjoy this original and unique fashion performance by young talented and promising graduates,” said Gavois.
Commercial experience
Manager Creations Noyon Lanka Pvt Ltd, Sitharie Medagama, stated that Noyon Lanka warmly welcomes the young designers for this event. “We welcome you to Noyon Lanka and also to our sister companies. We are very proud to expose you and give you the experience of the work that we do and also to share with you our commercial experience of your industry. We take this opportunity to expose you to the technologies and the other industries that we have already explored, where we have successfully brought in new talent into the industry as well as harnessing and providing entrepreneurship in a very commercial manner.
At Noyon Lanka we have a design team who design laces to all the top world renowned lingerie brands in the world. All our designers are multi-skilled. We have Sri Lankan, French, Spanish and English designers working for our company. I am sure when the graduates come they will find it very interesting to interact with our people. We have put out two seasonal collections and our latest collection will be launched next week in Paris. We will be very proud to take the Sri Lankan design laces into France as well. We believe in grooming young talent for the apparel and textile industry. And we work very closely with fashion schools like LIFT providing internships and industrial training. These opportunities will enable the young graduates to find the right path in careers in fashion,” said Medagama.
