The Institute for Development of Community Strengths (IDCS), Matara has initiated programmes to safeguard children in the Matara district.
Matara IDCS Director Condred Ranawake said the programmes are underway in the Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Weligama, Matara, Devinuwara, and Dickwella.
Participants in the programmes will be educated about the ways to protect their children from abuse, sexual diseases, anti-social acts and other offences.
They will be provided with leadership training as well. Divisional Secretaries, childcare officers and grama niladaries would participate in the programmes as resource personnel, he said.
The United States Agency For International Development funds the programmes, Ranawaka said.
