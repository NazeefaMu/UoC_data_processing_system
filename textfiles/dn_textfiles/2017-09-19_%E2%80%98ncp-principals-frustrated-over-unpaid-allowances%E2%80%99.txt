‘NCP principals frustrated over unpaid allowances’

“The North Western Province Education Ministry did not receive funds to pay the allowances to the principals in the Kurunegala and Puttlam Districts so far although many requests were made to the authorities to release the funds," NWP Education Minister Sandya Kumara Rajapakse said at a meeting yesterday at Nikaweratiya, Kurunegala.
He said provincial school heads complain that National School principals were receiving recently increased allowances but provincial school heads were not paid the allowances yet.
"My Ministry has not received required fund so far. Therefore, I cannot address the reasonable appeals of the provincial school heads. About 1,250 principals in the NWP are frustrated now. Nearly 12,000 school teachers of the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts must receive salary arrears for nearly two years," the Minister said.
"Steps would be taken immediately to pay allowances with arrears when the funds are released by the Ministry, he said.
