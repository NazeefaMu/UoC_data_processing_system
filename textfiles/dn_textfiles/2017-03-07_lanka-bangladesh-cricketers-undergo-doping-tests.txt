Lanka-Bangladesh cricketers  undergo doping tests

Urine samples of four Sri Lankan players namely Rangana Herath, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis and Niroshan Dickwella along with four players from the Bangladesh team were collected yesterday morning during practice sessions at the Galle International Stadium in an out of competition test that is usually carried out at random on sportspersons at any given time.
The samples were taken by Dr Seevali Jayawickrema, director-general of the Sri Lanka Anti Doping Agency in conjunction with WADA at the request of the ICC.
It was during one such test carried out in August 2015 that Sri Lanka cricketer Kusal Perera was accused of being tested positive which was later proved to be untrue.
