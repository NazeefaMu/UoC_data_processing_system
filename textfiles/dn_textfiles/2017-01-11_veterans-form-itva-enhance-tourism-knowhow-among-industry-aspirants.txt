Veterans form ITVA to enhance tourism  knowhow among industry aspirants

A group of tourism and hospitality experts have joined to form the International Tourism Volunteers Association of Sri Lanka (ITVA).
The aim of this body is to put forth an educational platform for individuals from rural backgrounds with a helping hand and the right exposure on how to become better hosts and further bring beneficial change into their livelihoods.
Even at the recent Human Capital Summit which took place at the Taj Samudra for the first time in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who graced the event, delivered a talk with highlight on the topic ‘Sri Lanka as a Talent Capital'. He reiterated the need to further develop and enhance three major entities affecting the economy in Sri Lanka; water, energy and human resource. The human resource angle is currently a major issue especially in the hospitality sector. The Prime Minister also emphasized the need to strategise accordingly with the aim of enticing our Sri Lankan expats abroad, to come back to the country.
This might entail mainly dealing with small scale businesses such as homestay owners for example. But, not only will small enterprises get to benefit from this scheme as any other tourism related establishment seeking out a platform of awareness can approach ITVA and gain firsthand knowledge from veterans in the field who will take time to come forth and lend in their knowhow and expertise when it comes to hospitality.
Among the members involved in initiating this association is one of Sri Lanka's best assets in the field of tourism and hospitality and who is also being noted as the world's best trainer in his field, Dilip Francis De Silva and currently attached to the International Labour Organization (ILO). Along with him is Ajit De Silva who is the CEO for Direct Food Ltd. based in Bangladesh, Senior Vice President for Aitken Spence Hotels, Gemunu Goonewardene, Malinda Ratnayake who also happens to be the Vice President of the very first 5 star resort to have been setup in Ahungalla and U. C. Jayasinghe who is a Former Director of Aitken Spence. This group of hoteliers have been instrumental in instigating and evolving the concept of tourism in villages.
Other founding members also include an advisory committee based in Australia and comprises of Rohan De Silva Jayasundera and Rohan Dias Abeysinghe. The Chief Coordinator for ITVA is Former Human Resource Director for Aitken Spence, Amal Nanayakkara.
Commenting on his stance with ITVA, Goonewardene said, “Entrepreneurs who run establishments such as homestays tend to lack in technicality and we merely hope to establish a platform which will help small entrepreneurships to understand tourism as a whole and how to be the best host out there.” The revered members of ITVA do not look at remolding but to work ahead to fill the gaps in the industry.
The Association had dispatched renowned hoteliers and veterans from the sector to areas such as Kalutara, Batticaloa, Polonnaruwa and Jaffna to conduct workshops for staff working at resorts as well as small hotel enterprises.
ITVA's approach would center on a cost-sharing basis where this association would not look to profit from any memberships and any funds generated would go back into the organization and help fund scholarships for youth towards a career in tourism and hospitality.
The volunteers will engage in seminars and workshops depending on the demand and how much a community is willing to embrace experienced know-how from veterans in the field.
