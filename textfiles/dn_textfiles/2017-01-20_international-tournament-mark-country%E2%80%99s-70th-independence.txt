International tournament to mark country’s 70th Independence

Sri Lanka Cricket is making plans to host an international cricket tournament to celebrate the country’s 70th year of independence which falls on 2018.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that they will propose this tournament to ICC for approval during the forthcoming ICC Council Meeting in Dubai.
“India has already been invited for the tournament and SLC has yet to finalise the other countries they are going to invite. The Sri Lankan government has also pledged its support to the tournament and President Maithripala Sirisena has invited India to take part during a discussion with Indian Premier Narendra Modi. Modi has accepted the invitation,” said Sumathipala.
“India will celebrate their 70th independence this year and if BCCI conducts a similar tournament, Sri Lanka will take part in it,” he said.
