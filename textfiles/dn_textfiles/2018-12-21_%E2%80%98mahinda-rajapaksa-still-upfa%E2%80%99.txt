‘Mahinda Rajapaksa still in UPFA’

SLFP MP Dr. Ramesh Pathirana said yesterday there is no legal impediment to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa becoming Opposition Leader as he is still a member of the UPFA. This has already been conveyed in writing to the relevant authorities by UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
Dr. Pathirana was speaking at a media briefing at the SLPP Headquarters in Battaramulla yesterday.
However, some politicians who opposed the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader have proposed the setting up of a Parliamentary Select Committee to probe the former President’s suitability for the post. But, the Speaker has no powers to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee on such a matter. Such a Parliamentary Select Committee can only be appointed if the UPFA General Secretary conveyed the request in writing to the Speaker,” he said. The SLFP MP said the Parliamentary Select Committee cannot abolish the membership of an MP in Parliament.
“There is no legal basis for anyone to form a national government in this situation. However, we have received reports that the UNP and SLMC are in discussion to form a national government to increase the number of Ministerial portfolios. This is illegal and the mainstream political party cannot form a unity government with another single party or group,” he said.
“During the short period of just 51 days, we have been able to form a broad anti-UNP coalition and also provide numerous benefits and relief to the people. For the first time in history, a massive paddy harvest has been reaped from the 700,000 hectares of land across the country, due to the fertilizer subsidy, MP Dr. Pathirana said.
MP Roshan Ranasinghe said for the last 30 years, an Executive President has not been elected from the UNP. UNPers cannot engage in political conspiracy anymore when there is a President elected by the people.
In a letter to the Speaker, UPFA Secretary General Mahinda Amaraweera had said that MPs who contested under the alliance and won the election will continue in Parliament in the capacity of UPFA MPs.
“Rs. 3,000 is cut from our salaries for the SLFP party membership every month. However, we have been requesting for SLPP membership for some time. Although we have applied for the membership, we did not receive membership cards. However, our party leader said the MPs who oppose the unity government can stay in the Opposition and that is why we stay in the Opposition,” he said.
