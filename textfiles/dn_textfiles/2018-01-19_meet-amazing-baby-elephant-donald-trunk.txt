Meet amazing baby elephant Donald Trunk

The Galle Art Trail launches on January 24 with nearly thirty amazing artists from all over the world coming together in pop up exhibitions inside the Galle Fort and around the area. So drop everything, pack your trunk and book a ticket for the exciting Donald Trunk book launch and amazing elephant exhibition, which is being held at the legendary boutique hotel Jetwing Lighthouse from 3.30 to 5pm. This amazing high tea, with adventures of Donald Trunk cake and book reading, is the start of the action packed five day Fairway Galle Literary Festival and inaugural Art Trail- a fantastic event that brings together authors and artists from all over the world to talk, debate and discover exciting new things, like the fact that elephants can swim.
Donald Trunk, not to be confused with the whistle blowing Donald Trump book, is a new style children’s tale of the unexpected with stunning illustrations by artist Janet Anderton. It is an in depth story that reflects a deep respect for Sri Lanka’s amazing wildlife, rich and historic culture, and most importantly, despite all the country has been through in recent history, its wonderful sense of fun. Like all young people, Donald is a mischievous baby elephant who wants more from life than a 9 to 5 job. He is born on a cinnamon plantation in Galle, and is misled by his friends into believing that the real paradise is somewhere else, The Great Nicobar Islands. Slinky Satarnia, a sly cobra and just one of the many colourful characters in the book, slithers up to Donald, not unlike the story of the Garden of Eden, to tempt the youngster into running away from his family, “So you’re thinking of swimming away are you, you great hunk? You can take it from me, if you swim east across the sea from Trincomalee, you will find paradise where everything’s free.” Donald was seduced at once by her rhyme and because the thought of lugging wood for the rest of his life caused his trunk to sag and drag uncontrollably he set about planning his escape.
This children’s story is the first in a series of books that tries to bridge the growing gap between the philosophies and ways of thinking between the East and West, and in the process it is hoped that the storyline will inspire deep respect from young people who travel through this amazing island. It is also aimed at Sri Lankan children to help them appreciate how lucky they are to be born in Sri Lanka and teach them to celebrate and protect the unique and very privileged eco biosphere they come from. The aim of the launching team is to make the book a game changer. It is also hoped that it will become a film that will further our understanding of the largest land animal, the elephant, which is highly revered in Sri Lankan culture and indeed advice was gathered from several wildlife experts, ranging from when elephants start to grow tusks to how they protect themselves from the tropical sun. You can learn more about this by coming to the exciting action packed launch and high tea at the Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel, Galle on January 24 at 3.30pm to 5pm. Tickets are on sale for adults at a cost of Rs. 2,000 and two children can come along free.
Astronomers, I learn, suggest that our birthplace is not a question of luck but destiny and Sri Lanka as an island is rich in this way of thinking and so they believe it is no co-incidence this book has come out at this auspicious time. In complete contrast to the way the West has, from the industrial revolution to the computer era, developed in its thinking of what is truly important. In many ways, the West has left behind the natural world from where we all come from, replacing farming with interactive phones and iPad games on manufacturing virtual food and is struggling, as a result, to find its purpose, having lost its direction and its ability to create or be in tune with other planets’ magnetic forces. The book is the result of a series of incidents in 2017, when not one but two Sri Lanka elephants hit international headlines when they were found by the Sri Lankan Navy, swimming out in the ocean about 10 to 15 kilometers off Trincomalee. Inspired by this phenomenon, an English artist called Janet Anderton, amazed by this extraordinary series of events, decided to illustrate the amazing adventures of Donald Trunk, Sri Lanka’s swimming elephant with grandiose dreams of escaping to the Nicobar Islands, the ‘real paradise’, or so he thinks.

Janet Anderton who is from Bolton, a place that celebrates the importance of the elephant by putting it in its coat of arms, received a B.A. in Fine Art from Loughborough Art College in 1985 and, while Janet works primarily in watercolour and ink, she also creates paper cuts and collages using unloved books. She puts every written page to good use and shows the importance of recycling and the art and power of books on the minds of children.
Janet reads to kids in the local library and seeing the world through their eyes helped her to create 28 amazing images for this book, including a map showing the voodoo of the location. Some say the power of her work comes from her day job, which is being a librarian and having a Mary Poppins-like following of readers. Janet’s 2016 exhibition, Fairy Tales and Fantasy, composed entirely of paper cuts, was on show at Leicestershire’s Sock Gallery.
The work explored her deep love of children’s stories, which she feels are key to any persons ability to dream big and use their imagination in innovative and interesting new ways. She is really looking forward to doing some art talks with the kids in Galle schools during her week promoting the book and learning more about an island she has totally fallen in love with.
Janet’s paintings have always been described as illustrative, so when she had the opportunity to depict the story of Donald Trunk, Sri Lanka’s very own swimming elephant, it felt like a natural extension to her fairytale work. Her paintings leave people utterly entranced. Janet has beautifully illustrated the array of wonderful characters of all shapes and sizes – a butterfly-like Jiminy Cricket, a scary matriarch of the elephant herd, an Eden-like sly cobra, a singing mermaid called Donna, the unique Nicobar pigeon, a blue whale, dolphins, tropical dancing fish – all within the context of Sri Lanka with its incredible festivals of colour and beauty, and its sense of community.
The Donald Trunk book launch sponsored by Jetwing Hotels will be in the Anchor Bar at Jetwing Lighthouse, Galle on Wednesday, January 24 from 3.30pm to 5.00pm. Email [email protected] to book a ticket or call the Jetwing Lighthouse.
The Galle Art Trail exhibition from the book will go on for the whole week of The Fairway Galle Literary Festival and Art Trail from January 23 to 30.
