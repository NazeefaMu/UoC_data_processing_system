The journey of  ‘Vada Chennai’  began in 2003

Actor-filmmaker Dhanush, who awaits the release of Tamil gangster drama ‘Vada Chennai’, said the film’s journey began in 2003 and that he is blessed to have been part of this project even though it took long to materialise.
‘Vada Chennai’, directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran and produced by Dhanush, is gearing up for release on October 17. The film chronicles 30 years in the life of a gangster from North Chennai.
“The journey of ‘Vada Chennai’ began in 2003 even before Vetri and I did ‘Pollathavan’. We wanted to work again after ‘Pollathavan’ and I suggested we do ‘Vada Chennai’. Vetri understood neither did we have a market nor the budget to make such a film. Instead, we worked on ‘Aadukalam’,” Dhanush told reporters.
Recalling how the project eventually fell into place, he said, “After ‘Aadukalam’, we thought of working on ‘Vada Chennai’, but Vetri suggested we take a break from each other and join hands later. A few months later, Vetri called and told me that he wants to make ‘Vada Chennai’ with Simbu and I was happy for them.”
The project never took off with Simbu for reasons unknown. It came back to Dhanush.
“When Vetri came back to me with the project, I told him I can’t do it immediately. But I suggested we could work on some other script and we even discussed a film called ‘Soodhadi’, but it never materialised. Meanwhile, Vetri suggested he wanted to work on another film and that was ‘Visaaranai’,” Dhanush said.
Finally, ‘Vada Chennai’ went on the floors in 2016.
