Greener underneath coconuts

We hear the term ‘biodegradation’ or ‘biodegradability’ more often now than ever for all the reasons you can imagine. The term often used in tandem with recycling although the latter does not directly involve biological mechanism for the degradation. Biodegradation is the degradation mechanism related to living materials involved with microorganisms such as bacteria over a certain period of time. These materials are then used as growth materials for fresh life forms, biogenesis, e.g. plants, animals etc. On the other hand recycling is the reuse of produced materials individually or collectively by way of processing to different components, which may or may not be degradable. However, to our interest we will explore the biodegradability or biodegradable materials produced with related to coconut or coco as it is referred to as opposed to recycling or recyclable materials.
In Sri Lanka we have an established coconut-based industry largely for the consumption of its milk and oil as food, a Sri Lankan dish without them is almost inconceivable. The coconut tree is sometimes attributed to the ‘tree of the heaven’ (Surathura) by our ancestors, as the whole coconut tree is used for many different applications and none is being spared as waste material in daily life.
Historical aspect of coconut
In the bygone era Sri Lanka has been one of the few tropical countries whose history intertwined with coconut fibre or coir products especially in the rural areas for the local market such as floor mats, doormats, brushes, ropes and mattresses. This is largely due to its mass availability thus the cost effectiveness. However, with the dawn of the country’s open economic policy in the late 1970s the end products based on coir have been gradually replaced by the cheap alternative yet mass production of petroleum based product commonly known as plastics. The plastic find was revolutionary yet with some dire consequences, notably the non-degradation of its processed object. The global impact on non-degradation of plastics has been alarming in modern times, hence the lookout for plastic alternatives, in the form of biodegradation. In other words the world is looking for damage limitations. As a blessing in disguise we are deemed to reconsider what our ancestors did before with a hint of science and technology smeared with engineering over it.
Advances in coconut products
As coir consists of considerable strength that can be applied by itself or reinforced with other suitable materials. Scientists have shown various properties of coir, the mechanical properties and degradation of the fibre over time subsequent to different processing techniques, but we do not intend to investigate such techniques in detail as that would be of academic relevance. However, as we embrace science and technological development in the contemporary world, the other significant uses of the coconut have been explored and discussed too, especially for advanced applications as a potential biodegradable material. In such matters the coir of the coconut becomes a pivotal part of the ongoing research and development across the board both academically and commercially. As with research studies pointing positive health impacts related to coconut milk and oil it is also noteworthy to look at some of the brighter side of the coir products as a separate entity, an emerging green product development.
It would be a tough task to throw away any of the components that derive from coco due to its versatility as discussed before. However, all these components have to be dissected carefully in order to produce a material that is of significance. In terms of coir, this can be processed to fabricate many commodities with considerable strength and biodegradable factor.
Products of coir
In some parts of the developed world the coconut coir logs are used as a biodegradable erosion control option for hills, banks, shorelines, and other erosion prone areas. The logs can be effectively used in restoration projects, stabilization areas, and construction job sites due to its moisture retaining properties. Ease of Installation, providing nutrients to surrounding areas, allowing for deep rooting of plants, helping to build into existing contours, requiring no chemical treatment, high air and water permeability, environmentally friendly, safe for surrounding wildlife, biodegrades over 2-5 years, effectively holding seeds and saplings in place are some of the benefits of these coir logs. In addition to finely made coir logs, mats, blocks and wattles can also be named as some of the products for erosion control purpose.
Biodegradable chairs and flower pots
Coir can be made as different layers to blend with latex and to stack them onto each other for desired stiffness and fibre density. Dutch designer Jorrit Taekema has fabricated a biodegradable chair out of such layered coco fibres. It appears as if a proper sofa type chair though its durability, strength and sustainability have not been evaluated. Moreover, biodegradable flower pots are widely made for the gardens.
Biodegradable erosion control blanket
100% chemically untreated coir fibre blankets can be fabricated. They are woven in different threads and sizes. Since they are of high amount of lignin (cellulose containing), coconut fibres are decomposition resistant. They last far more than other blankets and are tear resistant. For all these reasons, when the germinating period of a plant lasts for more than a vegetative season, Coir fibre blankets are used in bioengineering methods for superficial stabilization. These blankets are used in slope and bank covering, slopes with erosion control problems and complete biodegradation is estimated within five years.
Decorative pots and hanging bowls
Appropriate decorative pots and hanging bowls can also be created using coir and latex with better air circulation, water absorption with high water and fertilizer retention properties. Weed prevention disks & mats can be made to provide continuous soil cover to retain moisture and prevent soil erosion while preventing weed growth.
Scope of coir products
In an ideal world there could be plenty of limitations around us but in a world with many creators and innovators the limit for the coir products is endless.
As with the advancement of science and technology we can expect more fascinating objects to materialise upon us that would not destroy and clatter our beautiful world but eventually leave just like us one day.
