Bakery owner fined for using rotten eggs

A bakery owner in Chilaw was arrested by Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) recently for using eggs smeared with chicken feces in baking cakes.
The suspect was using the eggs in cakes for sale during the festive season when the PHIs arrested him. The 300 eggs were discarded, while 100 eggs were produced before court as case production. The suspect was ordered to appear before the Chilaw Magistrate’s Court on January 3.
