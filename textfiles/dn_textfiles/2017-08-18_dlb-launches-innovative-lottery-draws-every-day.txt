DLB launches innovative  lottery with draws  every day

Development Lotteries Board (DLB), renowned for launching innovative ways to satisfy customers has introduced a new lottery ticket titled ‘Ada Kotipathiya’ (Today’s millionaire) that has revolutionized the market. The draws for the new lottery will be held on all seven days of the week.
The new lottery ticket, was launched on August 15, will conduct its inaugural draw on August 31. The array of prizes offered are also innovatively designed starting with a mammoth jackpot of Rs. 50 million. A collection of other prizes ranging from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 1,000,000 are also offered.
The unique format in the new seven-day lottery has a combination of 75 numbers combined with letters from the English alphabet on 26 balls to choose the final lucky winners.
What is even more unusual is that each ticket gets two chances to win. Soon after the main draw, there will be a second draw for the balance balls to select four numbers from the same machine. The prizes will be given as follows - Rs. 20/- for 2 numbers, Rs. 500/- for 3 numbers and Rs. 50,000/- for 4 numbers.
Profits from the Development Lottery are credited to the President’s Fund and Mahapola Scholarship Fund enabling many students to achieve higher education. The objective of Development Lotteries is to continue to uplift the development services provided to the nation.
