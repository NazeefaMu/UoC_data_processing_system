Former St. Anthony’s College Wattala, St. Benedict’s College Kotahena, Ceylon Combined Schools, Sri Lanka Air Force (Adastrians) and Defence Services cricketer Anuruddha Witanachchi spoke to the ‘Daily News’ about his cricket career at his residence at No. 20, “Kaushulliya” Upostharama Road, Pinwatta, Panadura.
 What is your full name, date of birth and something about your parents and your family?
A - My full name is Anuruddha Witanachchi and my date of birth is on 6th April 1946 and my father is Robert Witanachchi, an ardent cricket lover from Baddegama and my mother is Gladys Silva from Moratuwa. I have one elder brother and sister and two younger sisters. As my father was employed at the Department of Irrigation, Colombo he took up residence at Wattala.
What is your first school and how did you commence cricket?
A - I was admitted to St. Anthony’s College, Wattala in 1953 to grade one and as usual I played softball cricket with my neighboring friends and with my class mates.
I attended under 14 cricket practices and I was selected and later I played for the under 16 team. I captained both these teams and also represented the first eleven cricket team in the 1962/63 cricket season. I am a left-arm medium fast bowler and right hand bat.
How did you join St. Benedict’s College?
A - My father was keen that I come up in cricket and he arranged for my admission to St. Benedict’s. Along with me another first eleven cricketer Harold Sirisena too joined St. Benedict’s and presently he is domiciled in America after a very successful cricket career at St. Benedict’s.
Did you get a place in the Bens team?
Y – Yes, both of us got selected during the 1963/64 cricket season under Sunil Fernando, our coach was R. B. Wijesinha. The same year we were unbeaten and we became the best team and were awarded the Lifebuoy Shield. I was awarded college colours. In that team Ranjith Fernando also played.
You said that your school was unbeaten and what are the schools that you played against?
A - My first match for Bens was S. Thomas’ and we beat them outright at Kotahena. Then we defeated Royal College, St. Anthony’s College Kandy, St. Peter’s, Ananda, Nalanda and St. Joseph’s after a lapse of 47 years. Our last match was with St Sebastian’s at Moratuwa and I think our team was over confident and the match was drawn in favor of us. Not only in cricket anything in life you must never be over confident.
Did you play for Combined Schools?
A - I played for three successive years from 1963. During this period there were no foreign tours or any visiting teams to Sri Lanka.
I represented the Schools side in the Robert Senanayake Trophy where Govenment Services, Defence Services, Mercantile and the Rest teams participated. Anura Tennekoon of S. Thomas’ led the side and his deputy was Harendra Dunuwila. I shared new ball with Nihal Samarasekara of St. Sylvester’s. In the finals we lost to Mercantile led by Thomian Claude Reid, The great coincide is both captains happened to be Thomians. Later I was awarded College colors in 1965 and 1966.
When did you enlist at the Royal Ceylon Air Force?
A - 2nd June 1967. A former Air Force cricketer and umpire Errol Seneviratne used to officiate our school matches and he asked me whether I liked to join the Air Force and I agreed. He took me to the then Recruiting Officer Fl/Lt Aubrey Ebert and I was taken to the Air Force and I was sent for my Combat and Weapon Training at Diyatalawa for six months.
How do you get in to the Air Force team?
A - K. M. Nelson led the Adastrians to victory in Division Two in 1965/66 and played under Donald Perera in Division One 1966/67. He was not given the captaincy of division one in 1967/68 team too and he left the Air Force and joined Maharajas and played for Bloomfield Cricket Club. He was the main strike bowler in the Air Force and during his absence I fitted into the Air Force side.
What is your first Sara match in 1967/68 cricket season?
A - My debut match in Sara Trophy was against Bloomfield and in our group there was SSC, Nomads, Colts and Moors. We had return matches also. We beat formidable Bloomfield by an innings and 24 runs. Batting first they were skittled out for a paltry 96 runs and I claimed 6 for 14. I shared the new ball with former Richmondite Hemasiri Fernando. We replied with 196 and in their second essay they collapsed for 76 and I captured 4 for 24 to finish with a match bag of 10 for 24. In the same tournament we beat Moors on first innings. That season I headed the Air Force bowling with 29 wickets and I was awarded colours.
Did you play for the Defence Services?
A - First I played for Inter Services and then for Defence Services for four successive years. I am very happy as a schoolboy and as a serviceman I played in the Robert Senanayake Trophy tournament.
How many years did you play for the Air Force?
A - From 1967 to 1973 I played for the Sara team and later in the Donovan Andree Trophy and in the Daily News Trophy. Throughout my career I represented the Inter Unit cricket and I led the Admin team of Katunayake and Diyatalawa team. I also played for Diyatalawa in the Badulla tournament. I toured Gan Islands with the Air Force team in 1969 and I was rewarded with Air Force colours for three years.
Have you any connections with your alma mater and with the Air Force?
A - We were the All Island School champions in 1963 and we celebrated the Golden Jubilee of that Championship in grand style. If there are any functions at school or in the Air Force they inform me and I used to attend. In the Air Force too I am a regular member for our get-togethers and on 3 June 2017 we had a Get-together of past cricketers and past officials at the Air Force grounds Colombo.
Who is the best batsman you came across during your school career and at the Air Force?
A - No doubt it was Anura Tennekoon. The best bowler was Tony Opatha; the best fielder was David Heyn and the best wicket-keeper Ranjith Fernando. In the Air Force the best batsman and wicket- keeper was Keerthi Caldera and the best bowler was Mohamed Faleel.
There were two good all-rounders during my time Sarath Fernando and Dilwin Mendis.
Did your children take upto sports?
A - I have three daughters and one son and they all are married and settled down. I live with my wife at home. My son Ashen Chathura Witanachchi played cricket for Sri Sumangala College, Panadura.
What is the advice you can give to the present day cricketers?
A - Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. You must always be a team member and play the game hard. At the same time you must be highly disciplined.
