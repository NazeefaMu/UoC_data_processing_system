Ceylinco General Insurance premium up to 2Q tops Rs 8.7 bn

Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd., announced excellent results for the period ended June 2017, indicative of yet another outstanding year of growth.
Ajith Gunawardena, the Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance, elaborating on the excellent performance of the company, said: “ The company recorded a premium income of Rs. 8.7 billion (Rs. 8,738 million) up to the 2nd quarter in 2017,with an impressive growth of 11.4 %, which signifies an increase of almost Rs. 900 million over the same period last year, which I would say is an exceptional achievement.
Moreover, the company recorded an after tax profit of Rs. 431 million with an increase of 286 %, for the period ended June 30, 2017 whilst the profit before tax stood at an exceptional Rs 611 million. As a result, Ceylinco General Insurance has maintained its unassailable lead. This is in the midst of stiff competition. This strong growth trend will no doubt help us to end the year on a resoundingly successful note”.

Staff of Ceylinco General Insurance acted promptly to pay compensation within 14 days to all of its policy holders with flood cover who were affected by the devastating floods we experienced in May and June this year.”
