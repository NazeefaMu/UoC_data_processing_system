A league of their own

His smile has won as much fame as his prowess as a batsman. It has brought a ray of hope to the team and fans even during the gravest situations of a match. At 50 Hashan Tillakaratne has done his bit and more on behalf of the passion of his life: cricket. Being a member of the legendary 1996 Cricket World Cup winning team has been the feather on his cap. He has also been a former test captain and is the current batting coach for the Sri Lankan cricket team. His love for the sport has spread onto his family. All three of his sons follow in their father’s footsteps. 22 years of married life has moulded Apsari Tillakaratne nee Singhabahu too into a cricket specialist. She was recently appointed as the Convener for Sri Lanka Women’s Cricket.
The cricketer
Cricket is in Hashan’s blood. It is his main passion and he lives and breathes for the sport. He will do anything for cricket. One phrase he keeps on chanting daily is that he has attained everything that he has got today because of cricket. Dedication and lots of hard work got him into the national team. He attended practices regularly. He has always been fully involved in the game.
The family man
Hashan loves to maintain a beautiful home. One way of relaxation for him is redoing our home in Piliyandala. Even these days he is renovating our house. He has removed some of our old doors and is replacing them with antique doors. He loves antique items and wants to change the outlook of the house now and then. He also looks into the household chores. We have three sons: Duvindu Sachin and Ravindu Sachin who are twins and Rajindu Irya who will be 12 years in September. The twins are named after our favourite cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. They are 21 years old and employed at MAS Ratmalana. Kumar Sangakkara and his wife, Yehali, named Rajindu. He is playing in the under 13 A team at S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia.
Best qualities
Hashan is a very down to earth and simple person. Though he was very famous during his stint he has never had any ego issues about it. I realized that he is quite a family man from the first moment we began chatting. Hashan has always been close to his parents and brother, Yasas. This was the first quality which attracted me to him.
The meeting
I was employed as a cabin crew member for Emirates. The Sri Lanka cricket team had flown to Dubai for a tournament in Sharjah. One of my close friends, Eshantha, was living there with his partner. He called and invited me to dinner at his place adding that the Sri Lankan cricket team will also be there. I said ok at first but later began to have second thoughts about attending since I was wondering if I had to go for the event merely because the Sri Lankan cricket team will be attending. I was clueless about cricket then. I was not a cricket enthusiast either. So I refused the invitation politely. I shared my apartment with two Indian girls. I happen to mention Eshantha’s invitation to them and they became so excited and begged me to take them along to meet the cricketers. I was forced to call back and notify them that we were attending after all. During the event Eshantha began to talk about Hashan in particular with me for some reason. He also introduced me to him and we began chatting. Hashan invited me to come and watch the matches. I watched a match for the first time in my life in Sharjah in 1995.
The marriage
The Sri Lankan team returned to Sri Lanka after the Sarjah Cup. I had to fly to Bangkok next. I got a call there and it was Hashan calling me in Bangkok from Sri Lanka! I was surprised and inquired how he found out the number and he gleefully told me that he has many friends working at Emirates. He proposed to me then stressing that we have similar tastes and that our ideas match. The proposal came about a week after our first meeting.
I was the breadwinner of my family during that time because my father was ill. I related this to Hashan and I asked him to meet my parents when I return to Sri Lanka. My parents liked him. They felt that he was like their own son when he addressed them. My parents requested me to take a decision relating that I have done a lot on behalf of them and my sister.
Though I continued to fly, I soon realized that I had to be with Hashan. He was representing the country which was a national duty and he was at his career peak then. I decided that I had to make the sacrifice of giving up my job. It was a very difficult decision to make because my job offered a lot of benefits and a high salary. Our wedding ceremony was held on April 9.
Happiest moment in life
Winning the 2006 World Cup is no doubt Hashan’s gloriest moment in life. Even today he says he wakes up hugging the World Cup and goes to sleep in the same gesture. I was pregnant but not even three months when I flew to Pakistan to attend the World Cup finals. My doctor was against me flying but since I am used to flying I knew I could stomach the journey. The last few stages of the match were very emotional. The whole team was awestruck. Some of us were even in tears when the final overs were on. I was with Romesh Kaluwitharana and Arjuna Ranatunga’s wives. All the Pakistani fans were cheering for us and their cheers still echo in my ears.
Double celebrations
Post winning the World Cup I stumbled upon the fact that I will be expecting twins. I was about five months gone then and it was just after we returned from a tour in USA where the team was invited to play a few matches. I felt a slight pain on the side of my stomach. My mother took me to Homagama Hospital where our doctor examined me and said that I am fine and it must be due to fatigue. However a matron who is known to my mother advised me to get a scan done. I went to Navaloka with our friend, Ajitha, since Hashan had practices at that time. The doctor smiled and told me that he can see one but not the other. I was surprised and asked what he meant. He informed me that he had heard two heartbeats and that is why he wanted us to do a scan.
Soon after we returned to NCC Grounds Ajitha rushed up to Hashan and related the incident to him. We were overjoyed but we also felt like our duties have been doubled as well.
Seeing double
I have taken the twins on almost all the tours that Hashan has taken part in when they were small. Once in UK when my passport was being checked at the airport they were confused about their pictures. Both photos were identical and they believed that it was one child’s photograph which has been copied and used to represent the other. They even measured the length of the face in the pictures to spot a difference but found out that all the details were identical! Then there were incidents like I would get them confused and try to feed medicine to the same child twice. We had to tie a band on Duvindu’s hand to recognize one from the other during their childhood.
Greatest strength and greatest weakness,
Hashan is very honest. He does not steal. However he trusts a lot of people and that has gotten him in hot water at times. He also gets a bit excited when one of the children falls ill.
Most difficult period
Just after the 1999 World Cup the selectors decided to drop four of the team members: Arjuna, Roshan, Aravinda and Hashan, stating that they are making way for youngsters. Hashan had a good batting average at that time. Therefore he did not expect that he would get dropped. It was a very disappointing phrase for him. He played domestic matches for NCC for two years and made a comeback. He had his career best performance then. He also captained the team in 2003/4 before retiring.
Favourite travels
Hashan loves wildlife. We visit a small lodge we own in Yala Park when we have a holiday. The kids too look forward to these trips. Hashan also loves to visit ancient religious places in rural areas.
An alternative profession
Hashan’s parents have told me that he was very studious during his school days. He has engaged in politics for a brief period. I think he would have continued to be in politics if he did not get into cricket.
Nickname for her
I have three names: Deepika Sandamali Apsari. Everyone knows me as Apsari but Hashan is the only person who calls me Deepika.
