Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub:

A Rs. 160 million (1 million Euro) conceptual and feasibility studies on the Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub, funded through a grant from the French Treasury, was launched yesterday.
The feasibility study will be conducted by the French consultancy firms AREP and Egis, and SNCF Hubs and Connections.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, addressing the launch at Shangri-La hotel, Colombo, said this would be a key gateway to Colombo and provide coordinated access to the Colombo city.
Pettah, envisioned to be a business district with access to the Colombo Port City, has a huge issue with handling transport and traffic. Passengers, traveling from one system of transportation, cannot switch to another without undergoing many difficulties, said the minister. The aim of the programme is to provide a comfortable and efficient public transport system.
The Multimodal Transport Hub will also complement the needs of other projects in the area, such as the Beira Lake development project and the Ocean City 2035 project. Nearly 280,000 people a day are estimated to travel to and from Pettah by 2025.
The minister urged the officials of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), Road Development Authority (RDA), Colombo Municipal Council and others to share their ideas with consultants to integrate all plans into one. The consultants too were asked to look into the needs of the people in the area.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry’s Pettah Multimodal Transport Hub Project Director Srimantha Fernando, meanwhile, observed that it was imperative that the project gets off the ground as many other projects such as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system, and the upgrade of railways and the elevated highway into Pettah had to be put on hold until the basics of the hub were decided.
Given that the feasibility study would take a year to complete, the ministry has taken steps to concurrently start work on other projects connected to the hub.
The Colombo Plan developed by the UDA, Beira Lake development and the multipurpose project at Chalmers Granary in Pettah have been thus given the green light to proceed.
Minister Ranawaka said in addition to the hub, his ministry was also developing mini hubs in other cities in the Western Province such as Battaramulla, Kottawa, Kadawatha, Katunayake, Moratuwa and Piliyandala. The proposed LRT funded by public-private partnerships is to travel through Kadawatha, Kolonnawa, Homagama, Kottawa and Piliyandala.
AREP Team Leader Andreas Heym, addressing the gathering, explained that the hub would first be an intermodal pedestrian platform to connect people with one form of transport to another. “The essential part here is the pedestrian. They will be able to move from the bus, train, car park and LRT seamlessly,” he said. Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe said they would work together with foreign experts and local professionals to synchronize and get a good product in the end. Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary D. S. Withanage said more options of transport from urban areas to the city centre would help reduce travel time for the public and it would encourage more to switch to public transport to reduce congestion and pollution in the city.
