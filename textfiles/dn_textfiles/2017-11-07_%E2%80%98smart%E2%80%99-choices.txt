‘Smart’  choices

The modern world has embraced technology like never before and the advancement of technology has given light to innovations in many spheres, especially in the entertainment sphere.
While the world becomes smaller and smaller due to internet based communication, markets are enhancing tremendously for products and services related to this factor.
Cinema, teledrama, fashion, food, e news, and e books are broadening their landscapes via internet and smart phones.
Sri Lanka’s premier telecommunications network provider, Dialog Axiata PLC, a company well known for its innovations, has embarked on yet another innovation by producing the teledrama, ‘Thrimana’ that could be watched via a Mobile App.
Thrimana is presented via ‘Vinode Mobile App’ of Dailog ViU. To download ‘Vinode Mobile App’ the customer has to visit Google play or App Store, download Dialog ViU and open Vinode.
Dialog ViU allows users to watch countless hours of local and international movies, teledramas and Sinhala and Tamil TV shows.
The premiere of Thrimana happened at the Dialog Iconic auditorium recently.
Thrimana, directed by Lake House journalist turned seasoned teledrama director Chamara Janaraj Pieris of Ayal fame revolves around a love triangle with a difference. The story sheds light on the creative environment of an advertising agency and a lone creative director whose love life involves a young and beautiful colleague of his.
Chamara uses unique tactics by means of story, dialogues, cast, locations and camera angles to add freshness to his creation. The cast includes; Eranga Jevantha, Iresha Asanka, and Milinda Madugalla in the lead roles with many other talented and versatile artistes.
“Thrimana has 10 episodes each with duration of 45 minutes. We are setting a trend in Sri Lanka by showing Thrinama via a Mobile App. Smart phones have now become the magical tool that brings entertainment, let alone business to our doorsteps. This device will be a great rival for television channels sooner than we think”, said Thrimana director Chamara.
“It was a great opportunity to join hands with Dialog Axiata to use this latest technology for Thrimana tele-drama and I am very happy to bring a production of this caliber to Sri Lankan audiences”, he added.
Actor Milinda Madugalla said, “I have teamed up with Chamara for many of his earlier teledramas. However being able to contribute to Thrimana in terms of style and other factors provided me a special platform to connect with a newest set of audience. Thrimana takes my performances to the next level.”
Dialog Axiata global and content services/ global business senior general manager, Mangala Hettiarachchi said, in today’s context the usage of Smartphones is rapidly increasing and fifty percent of Dialog customers use smartphones.
“Technology gave light to 3G and 4G technology and now we talk of 5G. With the increase in usage of smartphones consumer attitudes towards entertainment has changed in a revolutionary manner. ‘Entertainment, Anytime…Anywhere’ is the trend now. For the new generation of viewers, entertainment should be at their finger tips. Dialog catered to this need by producing the teledrama, Thrimana using mobile App, Dialog ViU. This App could be downloaded by anyone from anywhere in the world to watch Thrimana as well as other productions of Dialog”.
He added, “This innovation will be a great opportunity to artistes, since Dialog has developed the market potential enormously for local tele-dramas via ‘Vinode’ App. The local teledrama sphere will now become highly lucrative”.
All Dialog customers are entitled to ‘12 month subscription-free offer’ while customers from other networks will be entitled to two months free subscription.
