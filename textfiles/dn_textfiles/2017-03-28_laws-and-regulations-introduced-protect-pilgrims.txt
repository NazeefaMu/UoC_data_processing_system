Laws and regulations introduced to protect pilgrims

Laws and regulations pertaining to the safety of people going abroad on pilgrimages have been introduced by the Buddhist Affairs Ministry and the Department of Buddhist Affairs.
If the investigations into the recent deaths of three pilgrims in India proved that the institution that organised this particular pilgrimage had breached these laws and regulations its registration will be cancelled, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe.
The minister said a fair investigation would be made into the three deaths after obtaining information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi.
Minister Rajapakshe said several important factors are taken into consideration before granting registration to institutions involved in organising and conducting pilgrimages abroad.
Although their performance and compliance to these laws and regulations can be closely observed locally, it was difficult to observe whether they strictly adhere to them after taking pilgrims abroad.
However, steps would be taken to conduct a proper investigation into the three recent deaths, he emphasized.
