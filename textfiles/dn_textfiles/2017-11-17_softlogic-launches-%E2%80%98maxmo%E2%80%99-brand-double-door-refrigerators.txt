Softlogic launches ‘Maxmo’  brand double door refrigerators

Softlogic Retail has announced the launch of its own brand of refrigerators in Sri Lanka, targeting the ‘White Goods’ segment where it already has a strong presence, with a sophisticated product at an unbeatable price in the form of ‘Softlogic Maxmo’ refrigerators.
The Softlogic Maxmo Direct Cool Double-door Refrigerator is custom designed and engineered for local conditions and usage, and is backed by a 10-year warranty on its compressor, the company said.
“This is an exciting new product category for the Softlogic Maxmo brand, which is fast becoming a household name as a result of the range of other appliances already in the market,” said Mr Shehan Zahir, Assistant General Manager – Product Development at Softlogic Retail.
“The brand has also built a reputation for quality and design aesthetics making it a strong competitor to international brands.”
Elegantly turned out, the spacious 212-liter Softlogic Maxmo refrigerator features toughened glass shelves that are free from heavy metals -- making them safe for food storage -- and are capable of supporting the weight of heavy items.
It uses the environment-friendly R600a refrigerant, a gas that is non-toxic, has zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential), very low GWP (Global Warming Potential) and delivers excellent thermodynamic performance.
Direct Cool technology saves energy, thereby reducing operating costs, and cools with a highly efficient natural convection process.
An attractive 15-month interest-free hire purchase scheme, one of the best in the market with the lowest monthly instalments,and credit card interest-free monthly payment facilities with all leading banks are also available for buyers.
The Softlogic Maxmo Double Door Direct Cool refrigerator is available at over 230 Softlogic and Softlogic MAX showrooms in Sri Lanka, an island-wide store network that covers all major cities and towns in the country.
Besides the 10 year warranty on its compressor, the unit is covered by Softlogic’s trusted one year comprehensive warranty and has the backing of the company’s unmatched after sales service.
The Softlogic Maxmo brand portfolio currently encompasses small kitchen appliances such as pressure cookers, electric kettles, blenders, gas cookers, hand mixers, sandwich makers and rice cookers as well as irons, pedestal fans and ICT accessories such as Bluetooth speakers.
