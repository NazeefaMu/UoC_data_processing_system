STF deployed to combat Matara crime wave

The STF has been deployed to combat the rising wave of crime in the Matara District, Matara SSP G. H. Marapana said.
Although there is a decrease in crime in the district, the severity of the limited crimes committed had led some people to think that the crime rate has increased. He said the untoward incident at Matara had led them to reconsider security lapses and deploy the STF to prevent threats posed to the Matara city by outside elements and protect life and property. SSP Marapana said the narcotic drugs menace had been curtailed and the price of drugs had escalated due to a decrease in supply.
The recent robbery at Matara caused due to lack in security had led them to rethink the security arrangements.
