The European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) hosted a European Networking Night to honour the new EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tung Lai-Margue.

The new EU Ambassador made a policy statement on the current EU-Sri Lanka relations and stressed the importance of further consolidating existing relationship between EU and Sri Lanka. The invitees had an opportunity to listen to a speech by Dr. Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister with responsibility for Economic Diplomacy, on the current economic development activities andon the impact of GSP+ on the Sri Lankan economy.
The Minister specifically spoke about the trade union action and protests on the streets and highlighted that there must be a specific venue for such protests without inconveniencing the public. He went on to say that unlike the previous regimes the incumbent government would not resort to shooting at protestors.
The speech by the EU Ambassador Tung Lai-Margue and Dr. Harsha De Silva provided an insight into the driving forces behind the future shape of Sri Lankan economy. The event was also graced by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake despite his busy schedule.
The ECCSL believes that the event provided an opportunity for local businessmen to network with the top-end participants and invitees. The ECCSL has an exclusive mandate to promote trade and investment opportunities between Sri Lanka and 28 European Union member countries. As the leading European business organisation, the ECCSL helps the members and non-members to network with other businesses and maximise the business potential.
