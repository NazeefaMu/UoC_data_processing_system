Mega Show celebrates 40th anniversary!

Exactly 40 years ago, Sri Lanka’s flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, thought that it should introduce an award show for the country’s budding schoolboy cricketers who perform well at under-19 level. That was an era in which there had not been an organized inter-school first XI cricket tournament; forget about school cricket awards show altogether!
There wasn’t a single inter-school under-19 tournament some 40 years ago. The inter-school first XI cricket matches were only confined to friendly encounters. Yet, the Sunday Observer thought that it should initiate an awards show to inspire the outstanding schoolboy cricketers at the end of each season.
With that in mind, the Sunday Observer, together with its sole sponsor Haliborange, conducted the country’s first ever inter-school cricket awards show at Nawarangahala, Royal College in 1979. Coincidentally, it was the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle who was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in its inaugural year.
The maiden selection ultimately turned out to be the most perfect one as Madugalle went on to captain NCC and Sri Lanka with distinction. Even now, his name is a household one in international cricket as he continues to serve as ICC’s Chief Match Referee.
Besides Madugalle, the contest has produced many legendary cricketers including Sri Lanka’s World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga and the world’s highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharn. In addition, several past recipients of the prestigious award had played many other leading roles as coaches, umpires, match referees, managers and cricket administrators.
Several past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners too had served Sri Lanka cricket in different capacities.
Some of the past award winners paid glowing tributes to Sri Lanka’s first ever School Cricket Awards show that celebrates its 40th anniversary.
Former Sri Lanka captain and current ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, who was the first ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1978/79, said most of the top award winners had came from Colombo and its suburbs in the past. “But, now the outstation schools have come in a big way and it’s a good sign for the game. The Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complimented for keeping the show going for all these years. Sponsors are essential. May the show continue for many more years” he said.
Sri Lanka’s World Cup-winning captain turned Cabinet Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, who had also served as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket won the main title in 1980 and 1982 rated the mega award as the 'most memorable' in his career. “You may go places and win many other awards at higher levels subsequently, but an award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in any cricketer’s life. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life. Those titles had given me tremendous inspiration and confidence when I stepped into the international arena,” the ‘captain cool’ said.Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-ICC Match Referee, Roshan Mahanama, the first to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer title on successive years in 1983 and 1984, feels that it is a great encouragement for any schoolboy to be adjudged the best schoolboy cricketer for the hard work during a season. “I was privileged to achieve one of my dreams. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year on successive years was a memorable one. It was my stepping stone. Becoming the best schoolboy cricketer made me even more determined to work harder to reach greater heights,” the former Nalanda captain said.
Mahanama’s back to back titles had inspired his Nalanda teammate Asanka Gurusinha to focus on a rich 1985 season. “When Roshan Mahanama won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that - work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career, said Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup star who is now functioning as the manager of the Sri Lanka national team.
The winner of the Most Valuable Player award in Sri Lanka’s victorious 1996 World Cup, Sanath Jayasuriya, said the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer outstation award that he won in 1988 as an emerging schoolboy cricketer from St. Servatius College, Matara was of the best thing that had happened in his early cricketing career. “Playing for St. Servatius had brought me immense joy and winning the title gave a tremendous boost and inspiration. Schoolboy cricketers must be motivated,” the former Sri Lanka captain and ex-chairman of selectors said.
Former Sri Lanka star cricketer turned ICC Elite Panel Umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, said the schoolboy cricketer title he won in 1989 had been a big inspiration for him. “It helped and encouraged me to work hard to win my Sri Lanka cap I must congratulate ANCL and the Sunday Observer for keeping the show going for over 40 years. Lake House has taken the lead to help budding schoolboy cricketers. Development of youth is very important as they will be the ones who will take the country forward,” he said.
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-national coach, Marvan Atapattu, was of the view that the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title he won in 1990 was a ‘certification or a guarantee’ that he would win the national cap. “It was prediction to say that I would play for Sri Lanka. When I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future national prospect. Although I too felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to represent Sri Lanka with distinction. So, when I won the title, it gave me the guarantee that the chance opened to join that select band,” the former Ananda skipper said.
The world’s highest wicket taker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan, the 1991 Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winner said the mega awards show means a lot to young cricketers. “When I was picked as the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, it gave me lot of satisfaction and highly motivated me. I became an international cricketer through inter-school cricket and the encouragement that I had got as a schoolboy cricketer. Lake House and the Sunday Observer should continue its good work for the benefit of the budding school cricketers,” the spin wizard said.
Former Sri Lanka star and the winner of the prestigious award in 1994 and 1995, Thilan Samaraweera said that his progress as an international cricketer was because of the encouragement he had got at school level. “The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer awards show motivated us. I won the main award twice, in addition to the Best Batsman and Best All-rounder awards. That was a tremendous boost for us at that level,” he said.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer award winner in 2012, Niroshan Dickwella, who is serving in the current Sri Lanka national team, said that he was privileged to step into the big league through the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show. “It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for four decades. This has produced a bunch of great cricketers in the All Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients are doing well in their chosen professions may be cricket or otherwise, the former Trinity star player said.
Meanwhile, the voting coupons-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest are being published in the Lake House national newspapers - Sunday Observer, Daily News, Dinamina and Thinakaran. The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Mega Show is sponsored by SLT Mobitel under the blessings of its CEO Nalin Perera.
