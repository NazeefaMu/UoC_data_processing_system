No English teacher at Bandaragama Primary School

There has been no English teacher at the Bandaragama Primary School in Galgamuwa, Kurunegala, for over a year. There are about 79 students at the school.
Appeals had been made by the School Development Society regarding the matter, but so far, no teacher had been appointed to fill the vacancy.
R.M. Sarath, a member of the School Development Society, told the Daily News that English teachers were in excess at schools in the Kurunegala town, adding that however, they were reluctant to join remote schools.
