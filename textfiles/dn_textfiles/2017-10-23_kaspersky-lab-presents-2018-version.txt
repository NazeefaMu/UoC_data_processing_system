Kaspersky Lab presents 2018 version

Kaspersky Lab together with Avian Technologies presents Kaspersky Internet Security 2018 version with Multi Device Protection.
The make-up of the modern home is changing, bringing with it a new era of household, which on average, cares for 2.4 people[i], 0.3 pets[ii] and now also 6.3[iii] connected devices per home. With devices playing such a prominent role in today’s average home, Kaspersky Lab launched the updated versions of Kaspersky Internet Security, to help people care for their devices as much as they care for their pets and those living under their roofs.

The launch for Sri Lanka took place recently with Avian Technologies, sole distributor for Kaspersky in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Altaf Halde, Managing Director, South Asia said, “Our new versions of Kaspersky Internet Security is taking forward our commitment to keep our users safe and secure. Kaspersky Internet Security delivers award-winning, easy-to-use security technologies – to help you protect your PC, Mac and Android phone and tablet against the very latest viruses, attacks, spyware, cybercrime and more.”
Commenting at the launch, Directors Ranil Francisco and Buddhika Liyanage said, “Avian’s journey with Kaspersky has been empowering and successful. With our goal to maintain the most robust, reliable services and solutions for the industry, Avian Technologies has unique offering such as a 24/7 hotline for professional sales and technical support, and a distribution network of over 300 re-sellers island-wide. The launch of the 2018 version is yet another milestone for us.”
The average household today spends a huge part of its awake hours online, and the more people surf the web, the greater their risk of falling victim to a malicious program or website. Addressing this concern, Kaspersky Internet Security includes anti-phishing technology to prevent users from falling victim to fake or spam emails, fake websites and fraud.
In addition, connected households also worry about losing the information that’s stored on their devices, with photos being the most precious forms of data. In fact, Kaspersky Lab research has found that for many, the loss of their digital photos is more stressful than a breakup with a partner or a pet’s illness.Because their data is so precious to them, 56% of Internet users are concerned about the prospect of having their data held at ransom, concerns that are expected to rise following the recent WannaCry epidemic.The Kaspersky Internet Security includes the company’s anti-ransomware feature, which has been updated to fight even the most complicated ransomware.
Another addition,the App Lock feature for Androidoffers an extra layer of protection with a secret code for users to prevent specific apps like instant messaging services, social media, email, and other confidential information from being seen by others when they are accessing a user’s phone.
Users can also benefit from the Kaspersky Secure Connection service, integrated with Kaspersky Internet Security, which encrypts all user traffic when using insecure Wi-Fi or sensitive websites. Vulnerable family members, children, are increasingly connected to the Internet.
Developers at Kaspersky Lab have thus included the company’s renowned parental controls in the latest version.
These allow parents to specify time limits for specific devices in the household, restrict the applications children can use and prevent access to pages with adult content, obscene language or information about drugs, and more, all within the Kaspersky Safe Kids service.
