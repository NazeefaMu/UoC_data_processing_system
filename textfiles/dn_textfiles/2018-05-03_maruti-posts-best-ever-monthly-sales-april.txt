Maruti posts best-ever monthly  sales in April

Automakers began the new financial year on a strong note led by market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) which posted its best-ever monthly wholesale figures in April for the domestic market.
Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors also reported robust double-digit sales growth during the month while Hyundai clocked single-digit growth.
MSI said its domestic sales stood at 1,64,978 units in April, up 14.2% from 1,44,492 units a year earlier, fuelled by strong sales of compact segment cars.
Sales of Swift, Estilo, Dzire and Baleno jumped 31.8% to 83,834 units. Utility vehicle sales, including for Ertiga, S-Cross and compact SUV Vitara Brezza, increased marginally to 20,804 units.
M&M reported a 19.34% increase in sales in the domestic market to 45,217 units last month.
“The company has achieved good growth both in the personal and commercial vehicle segments,” M&M president, automotive sector, Rajan Wadhera, said.
Tata Motors reported a 34% jump in passenger vehicle sales to 17,235 units in April.
“While there were challenges in market, strong demand for new generation products like Tiago, Tigor, Nexon and Hexa led the growth,” Tata Motors passenger vehicles business unit president, Mayank Pareek, said. Hyundai Motor India posted a 4.4% rise in domestic sales to 46,735 units.
