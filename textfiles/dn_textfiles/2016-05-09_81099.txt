VAT: The public feel the pinch

As government revenues slide and debt piles up, the decision to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 11 to 15 percent has become a polarising issue in our community. Though the government has exempted water, electricity, essential items, education and healthcare from VAT, the ordinary citizen is finding that an increase in the tax burden a bitter pill to swallow.
Kushan Pushpakumara, 21:
I work at the railways. The phone bill charges have been affected by this VAT increase. It is always the average citizen who is affected by these taxes. I also eat all three meals out given my work schedule, now that too would cost more.
H.G.N. Priyantha, 39:
I do not think that the VAT increase from just 11 to 15 percent would have a huge impact on our pockets. The government also has excluded some of the essential items from VAT, so it should not be a big problem.
N.C.S Wijesinghe, 41:
This is completely unfair. This is not what the government said it would do when they promised us relief. What relief is this They have money to get down Benz cars for MPs and ministers but no money to run the country.
A.K. Hassan, 48:
Everything in our shop has gone up in prices. All the items we sell are now more expensive because of this VAT increase. A kilo of sugar which we used to sell at Rs. 85 is now Rs. 110 -115. This only affects the poor people. Business has dropped, people do not have money to spend anymore. This is not what we expected when we voted in for a new government. We thought business would improve.
H.A. Gnanathilake, 58:
There are just two parties which govern the country and each of them simply gets the country into greater debt each time they are in government. These VAT increases will not impact the rich but it will certainly impact us. Now they say the phone bills are to go up, we all use phones, how are we to cope
N. Vishnukanthan, 38:
These increases in taxes just make an already desperate people even more desperate. Those who impose these increases have to realize that. How can they say that the government has no money On what have they spent it all on During the war they had an excuse and they could say that the war was taking all the money but what is their excuse now Those in power need to go to the villages and see for themselves how the people live. There are no proper roads, infrastructure, schools, housing…the problems are endless.
Nirosha Bandara, 35:
We live on rent and that is costly but we have no choice but to continue with it. We have to spend on food, other goods, children’s expenses, the list is endless. With all these expenses, we cannot afford to save for a house. On top of that they are now adding tax after tax on the people. We pay all these taxes but we cannot get anything done in this country without a letter from a minister, whether it is to get a house or job. There is no way out.
Hemamalini Abeyratne, 43:
People do not only live on essential items. A household needs more than that and after May 2, all these have gone up in price. These taxes only impact the average person who lives on a minimum wage. It is fine if the government increases taxes if our salaries also increase on par but we don’t see that happening.
Then they take all our tax money but we don’t really see them using that for our own benefit. It does not come back to the people. Instead of improving our industries, the government just tries to run on our tax money. This applies to every government which has been in power in this country.
P. Somaratne, 50:
With the increase in VAT, the prices of all our imported items have gone. We import most of our items to be sold here in Pettah because the local market just does not produce enough or items with right finish. These days the price of denim has really gone up. Naturally, sales are dropping.
We have no option but to import. We bring a lot of Indian t-shirts into the country, they have these printed photos on them which are very popular here. Why can’t we have people here doing that Our t-shirts are not that attractive.
Tourists tell us that Sri Lankan t-shirts are of better quality but it is not as attractive or fashionable enough for the market. We don’t want to send our money out but we just have no choice.
Ishara Paranawithana, 33:
We don’t see any great developments taking place so it is hard to understand where all the money in the government is going to. Yes, they did increase our salaries but then they are also increasing all the taxes like VAT, so there is really no point in getting a higher salary at the end of the day. What are they using our money on
All Ceylon Bakery Owner’s Association Vice Chairma Jivantha Perera:
There will be a definite increase in bakery goods with the increase in VAT but we will try to minimise the increase so that it does not affect our customers too much.
It is not only VAT which has burdened us but also the recent salary hike of Rs 2,500 for all also has impacted our cost of production. My business alone has a staff of over 100. It is a combination of many factors.
Poultry Producers’ Forum President Yakooth Naleem:
Chicken prices are being controlled by the government and this VAT increase has impacted both small and big farmers, making it difficult for us to keep producing chicken at a reasonable cost. In the last three years, there has been no increase in chicken prices.
With the latest increase, the government will now earn close to Rs 15 per kilo of VAT on every chicken. The industry has been greatly impacted by this and it is not only us but also the farmers who supply us with raw material who will have to bear the full brunt of it.
We are the only meat industry which pays the government Rs. 6 billion in government revenue every year. This is a serious problem which will affect all those in the food chain.
