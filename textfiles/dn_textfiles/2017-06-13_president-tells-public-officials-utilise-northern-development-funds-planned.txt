President tells public officials: Utilise Northern  development funds in a planned manner

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that public representatives and public officials should have a proper plan to spend the money allocated by the government annually for the development of the Northern Province.
The President pointed out that it was the duty of the public representatives and the public officers to use the money allocated by the government in a given year for the benefit of the people in the province. President Sirisena made these observations after inquiring from the government servants in the North as to how the funds allocated by the government annually are utilised for the benefit of public, at a meeting in Jaffna yesterday. The President also reviewed the progress of development activities in the Northern Province and discussed about future development programmes.
The President directed the officials to fulfill the essential requirements of the people in the Jaffna district,such as,health, education, drinking water. When a politician pointed out that they face difficulties when sand mining for housing construction, the President directed the relevant authorities to allow sand mining if it does not cause any adverse impacts on the environment.
The President added that he would instruct the authorities concerned to finalise the matter within the next few weeks.
Following the discussion, President Maithripala Sirisena met a group of parents of disappeared children at the Governor’s Office where they handed over a letter to the President.
