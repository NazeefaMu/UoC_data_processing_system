Additional Magistrate chides FCID over alleged property belonging to Yoshitha

While ordering to release Daisy Forrest, 89, the grandmother of Yoshitha Rajapaksa on bail over a money laundering case into a 31.5 perches  of land with a house valued at Rs. 36 million in Ratmalana, alleged to have been purchased by Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala reprimanded the FCID for failing to arrest real culprits involved in the incident.
The FCID conducting investigation into an incident where a property had been purchased by Rajapaksa under his grandmother’s name for Rs. 24 million, complained to Court that Forrest did not appear before the FCID on six occasions and further sought a Court order directing her to be appear before FCID today.
However, the FCID informed Court that they have already concluded investigation into the incident and expected to refer the investigation reports to the Attorney General for his advice.
The Additional Magistrate observed that the investigation conducted by FCID failed to arrest any other person or name as suspects other than an elderly woman who could be a witness in the case. The Additional Magistrate reprimanded the FCID, stating that it is obvious that Forrest had been used by someone else in this transaction and she may be a witness in the case.
The Additional Magistrate further observed that there was a possibility of releasing the suspect from the case owing to shortcomings of investigations if the FCID acted in an irresponsible manner. Forrest was ordered to be released on cash bail of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of Rs. 1.5 million.
Meanwhile, Court refused to accept Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a surety.
The Additional Magistrate observed that when perusing the documents before Courts, Rajapaksa could be considered as one of the persons responsible for the alleged offence.
The suspect was released on bail after being appeared before Court through a motion.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the suspect.
