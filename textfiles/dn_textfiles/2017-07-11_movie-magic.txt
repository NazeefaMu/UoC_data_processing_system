Movie magic!

Sri Lanka Telecom, together with their mobile phone service partner Mobitel hosted ‘A Night at the Movies’ at the Ballroom of the Hilton Colombo recently .
Sri Lanka Telecom and Mobitel’s entertainment extravaganza was produced and conceptualized by Classic Funtime, who are well known for producing unique, high end events.
The evening commenced with cocktails, while the show itself saw some of the biggest names in the western music industry.
The ambience and feel of a movie theater , coupled with a one hour performance of entertainment customized and choreographed especially for Sri Lanka Telecom and Mobitel, ensured that this was indeed a truly spectacular night and one that would go down in the annals of superior Corporate entertainment .
