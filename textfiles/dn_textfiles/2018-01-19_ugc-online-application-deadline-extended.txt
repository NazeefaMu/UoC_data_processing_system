UGC Online application deadline extended

 
Online application deadline for university admission for the 2017- 2018 academic year has been extended until February 2 by the University Grant Commission (UGC).
The decision was made due to a technical fault in the website.
The closing date for accepting applications was previously scheduled on January 26.  
UGC Secretary Dr Priyantha Premakukara urged the applicants to read the University Admission Handbook meticulously before to submitting the on-line application.
