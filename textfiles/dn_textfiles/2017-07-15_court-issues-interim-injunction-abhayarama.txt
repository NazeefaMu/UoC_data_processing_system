monk contests viharadhipathi title:
Order effective until final determination of lawsuit :
The Colombo District Court yesterday issued an Interim Injunction preventing Chief Incumbent Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera from utilising Narahenpita Abhayarama temple property for political, commercial and trade union activities.
This the order will be effective until the final determination of this lawsuit.
Colombo District Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka made this order consequent to a lawsuit filed by Ven. Pathberiye Wimala Gnana Thera of Kirulapana Purvaramaya. The lawsuit had been filed by Ven. Pathberiye Wimala Gnana Thera who cited Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera as the defendant.
The plaintiff stated that he has the hereditary right to claim for the post of Viharadhipathi at the Abhayaramaya temple. The plaintiff said he has already filed a case in the Colombo District Court against Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera claiming his hereditary rights for the Viharadhipathi post in the temple.
The petitioner alleged that the properties of the Abhayarama Temple including the buildings and premises are being used by political parties and trade unions to gain political advantage in a manner that brought disrepute to the temple.
He said all these activities have taken place with the consent and blessing of Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and thereby he sought an injunction order preventing Ven. Ananda Thera from utilising the temple property for political, commercial and trade union activities.
