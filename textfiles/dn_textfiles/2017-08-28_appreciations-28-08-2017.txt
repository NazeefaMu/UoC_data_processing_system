[APPRECIATIONS - (28-08-2017)]

Lakshman Jayakody
He was an icon
Politics, which was considered pure, has now transmuted into just another profit-making enterprise with the advent of consumerism.
'Everything for money' is now the moto of so-called socialists, liberals and democrats, but there are some persons of character and integrity who have managed to retain their moral integrity in public life in the face of these forces.
When speaking of Lakshmans in Sri Lankan politics, we meet these exemplary two figures: Lakshman Kadiragamar and Laksman Jayakody.
Taking them as an examples, anyone entering present day Sri Lankan politics can resolve to provide an exemplary political service for a better future.
LJ won the Divulapitiya Electorate in the general elections held in July, 1960 and in 1970, won under the Samagi Perumuna and entered Parliament as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Minister of Defence.
He provided yeoman service to the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. As Deputy Minister of Defence, he was a pillar of strength to Sirimava Bandaranaike.
He was successful in providing a human face in defeating the internal conflict that began in 1970.
The role he played in rehabilitating misguided youth without letting them get destroyed speaks well for him as a person who has provided a community service beyond his traditional political role.
His memory as a great humanitarian still lives on in the minds of those who had been involved in the youth revolution of the seventies. He was extremely fluent in English as he had been educated at Trinity College, Kandy.
As Deputy Foreign Minister, his efforts at updating Sri Lanka’s foreign relations was admirable.
He was able to face the challenges to the United Front Government because of his fluency in English and Sinhala.
He was a humble and silent personality even though he hailed from a aristocratic family from Siyana Korale. Only a handful of pro people politicians are born from such political backgrounds.
Lakshman Jayakody, whose elitist background became a stumbling block in entering people’s politics, was able to overcome this obstacle. However, due to his practicality in managing two frontline ministries, he left an indelible mark in Sri Lanka’s political landscape.
His organizational skills speak volumes in his handling of the Non-Aligned Conference held in 1976. He was instrumental in popularizing the vision of the world’s first female Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranayake.
His political life is characterized by his admirable example of not using any public property for personal gain or use. His daughter, Erandathi and son, Chandana are witnesses to this fact.
By reading the character of Laksman Jayakody, we can learn immensely on how to live while in and out of power. The services he provided to Siyana Korale and the country as a whole will never fade away from people’s memories and will live on forever.
Dr. Lionel Mendis
A versatile exponent
Dr. Lionel Mendis was a legendary in cricket coaching in our era. Both Lionel and his brother Nelson were pioneers of cricket in Sri Lanka.
This bold statement cannot be denied by any cricket-loving Sri Lankan.
Both brothers disciplined and nurtured school cricketers of their respective schools as masters-in-charge of cricket at Ananda College and Nalanda College, respectively.
As an opening batsman of Richmond College cricket team where my late father too played long before, Dr. Lionel Mendis showed his class along with Dr. Nandisiri Jesanthuliyana; another world figure who served as the Deputy Director-General of the UN Atomic Energy Agency.
Dr. Lionel Mendis' exceptionally brilliant and comprehensive book on Cricket named ‘Cricket Huruwa’—‘Discipline and Practice of Cricket’ in English—speaks volumes of his knowledge, philosophy, mind power and the salient points of cricket.
Incidentally, at the book launch, which was held at St. Joseph's College auditorium, I was given the keynote address. The book contains lessons which were not written before by anyone in the world. It not only enlightened teachers, coaches and players of the game, but it was also an invaluable contribution of his insight, depth of knowledge and philosophy.
The manner in which he disciplined most players, including captain Arjuna Ranatunga since his school days towards bringing glory to our motherland, was testimony to his dedication. His strict principles helped many students to develop their careers.
Dr. Lionel Mendis hailed from a very reputed family from Ambalangoda and started his career as a teacher. He also once joined the Army Voluntary Force.
A teetotaler and vegetarian, he lived an exemplary life. He resigned from teaching and decided to train children and youths at his cricket academy and in no time, it became a famous coaching camp in the country.
The manner in which Dr. Lionel Mendis enrolled a newcomer to his academy was remarkable to witness. At interviews, he not only encouraged cricket, but also tested the individual's mathematics and English. His procedure of handling trainees was exceptional.
He was keen on dress codes as well and made sure that everything was clean. Due to these qualities, almost all reputed professionals were keen on sending their children to his cricket academy.
As a humble, but forceful personality, he treated all alike and gave his best advice to even strangers. He took a bold task to go and train the Northern Province players during the war-torn period where no other person dared to venture on such a dangerous assignment. He had faith in himself and did not hesitate to serve when required. Every year, he took his trainees to India to play with Indian cricketers to broaden their horizon of cricket and diplomacy. Nonetheless, before handing over his duties which he carried for more than three decades to a new coach at the NCC Cricket Academy, he gave a memorable speech to all the trainees, where I was also present. Though sadly, he had been suffering on the inside, he gave no sign of sickness. He expressed invaluable remarks and teachings at his last coaching service.
May you, Dr Lionel Mendis, enjoy the supreme bliss of Nibbana at the end of your journey in the cycle of sansara.

Victoreen Hassan
She was a guiding light
It has been nine years since God called Victoreen to eternal rest. Victoreen passed away peacefully on the August 25, 2008. God’s fingers touched her and took her last breath, closed her eyes and slipped her away to the land of no more pain.
Victoreen was loving, caring and was the greatest blessing in my life. She gave life to our children and when I needed hope and inspiration, she was strong. We loved each other dearly and it broke my heart to lose her. Vicky, the day I first held you and kissed your sweet face are precious memories time cannot erase. You’re gone so far away and left me alone, my days and nights are turned so lonely, dear, since you’ve been gone.
I recall your tender smile and the lovely things you said when you and I were partners in life. I still remember what Victoreen told me when we decided to get married. What she told me was “Kamil, marriages are made in heaven and if God wants our marriage to take place, no one can stop our marriage, even if anyone tries and that would be the day God unites us and we will be one.”
With God’s blessings, we got married and spent almost forty long happy years together and then God gave her rest. What we shared together will not be forgotten and it lives in my heart. Although I am in sadness that Victoreen is no longer here, her influence still guides me every minute, every hour, and every day. I still feel she is beside me caring and guiding me.
We thanked our lucky stars we found each other. Hand-in-hand, we faced tomorrow with no fears. Now I face each day with hope and happy memories we shared together.It broke my heart to walk beside you on that fateful day, the day you were laid to rest. You gave me years of happiness; then came sorrow and tears. You left me with beautiful memories we shared through the years.
For long as my love and my memories live, my sadness goes on, as in my heart you are still living as every passing day goes by. You have gone from my sight, but not from my heart. The memories of you will remain forever. No words I write can ever say how much I think of you every day. I pray for you in silence every day and hold you close in my heart. You were my ever loving wife and your memory will always be with me.
Vicky, all I have are memories and your photo in a frame. For all you gave through the years, your time, your love, your prayers and your patience, caring and sharing and for all this and more, “I still love you.”You gave me something time can never take from me; a light to guide me when it gets dark and I can't see. These special memories of you always bring a smile to me. You will never be forgotten as long as I am living, as I carry you safely tucked within my heart and your light will always shine forever.
Finally, thank you Victoreen for the wonderful and generous sacrifices you made for me, our children, and all the loving care and affection you showered on us. I remember not what I did for you, but I was for you and you were for me. Thank you for loving me and being what you were.
Darling Vicky, our special years when you were with me will not return; but with the love within our hearts, you will walk with me forever.
Till we meet again; sadly missed by your loving husband.

A.R.M. Mansoor
Dedicated to his work
I take this opportunity to issue this message of deepest condolences over the irreparable loss of former minister A.R.M. Mansoor, also the Ambassador for the State of Kuwait and committed social worker who passed away on July 25 in Colombo. ‘Janaza’ was buried in his own soil of Kalmunai.
I have had the privilege of associating with Mansoor from my school days when both of us received our secondary education at Shivananda Vidyalaya, Batticaloa.
Having had an illustrious career as an Attorney-at-Law, he entered politics representing the Kalmunai constituency and then was made the District Minister for the Mullaithivu District in 1989 and became the Minister of Trade and Commerce in 1990. Ultimately, he entered the Diplomatic Service as the Ambassador for the State of Kuwait in 1995.
I am proud to note that I had the opportunity of serving as his co-ordinating secretary during the period 1991 to 1994 when he was a Minister of Trade and Commerce.
I am personally aware of the sense of dedication with which set about attending to his tasks.
The people in the East are aware of the supreme role he played in establishing the National College of Education on May 10, 1992 at Addalaichenai, which opened up new vistas in the field of Education to the members of the younger generation in the country.
Mansoor also made use of his career as Ambassador for Kuwait in getting the assistance of many philanthropists in Kuwait to contribute liberally towards the renovations or constructions of several mosques in the East. Although he reached the highest pinnacles of success in his chosen careers, he did not forget his alma mater.
In keeping with my kind request, he saw to it that Shivananda Vidyalaya, Batticaloa, received Rs. 10 million through government assistance for the construction of the Swami Vipulanandaji memorial hall.
I was also serving as a consultant in administrative matters at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka, Oluvil.
May almighty Allah bless him with ‘jennathul firthous’ in the world hereafter.
A. L. Ibralebbe,
Retd. SLAS Divisional Secretary,
Addalaichenai
Navarathne Cabraal
A law-abiding citizen
At a time when forthright and fearless decision makers were few, Navarathne Cabraal rose to prominence and performed a yeoman service at all the institutions and organizations civil, as well as military he was destined to occupy.
A product of Piliyandala Central College, one of the educational institutions that came into being due to the Free Education Policy of the father of free education C.W.W. Kannangara, he completed his secondary education. Thereafter, he graduated from the Sri Jayawardenepura University.
He was a stritct disciplinarian which might have prompted him to join the Cadet platoon of Piliyandala Central College during his school career. He then moved on to reach the rank of a Captain in the Sri Lanka Army.
During his military career at the Sri Lanka Armed Forces, he won several awards in recognition of his dedication and commitment to the service.
The Presidential Inauguration Medal, Riviresa Campaign Medal and Volunteer Service Medal were some among the many he won. For a brief period of time after his graduation and his stint at the Government Teachers' Training College, he was attached to the Ministry of Education as a trained graduate teacher and then taught at Ananda College, Colombo, holding the post of Cadetting master.
Born into a respectable family of Piliyandala, he extended his helping hand to almost everybody who sought his assistance and drew satisfaction when their goals were achieved.
His demise took place at a time when it was least expected, exampling the fragile nature of life. With his demise, we lost a steadfast relative, a disciplined and law-abiding citizen and above all, a very good friend.
He leaves behind his beloved wife and three sons.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
K.D. Jayatissa,
Piliyandala
