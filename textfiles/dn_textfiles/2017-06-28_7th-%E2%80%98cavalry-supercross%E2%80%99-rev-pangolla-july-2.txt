7th ‘Cavalry Supercross’ rev off at Pangolla on July 2

The 7th ‘Cavalry Supercross’ organized by the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps in collaboration with Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR) will be worked off at the Pangolla ‘Ironside’ track in Kurunegala on July 2. CEAT Sri Lank, who sponsored the inaugural Cavalry Supercross in 2010, continued their main sponsorship for the seventh year.
The seventh edition will comprise 12 motor car and 12 motorbike events, where the Best Driver will be awarded the Armoured Corps Colonel Commandant’s Challenge Trophy while the Best Rider will be presented the Sonna Vander Hoeven Memorial Challenge Trophy.
Cavalry Supercross 2017 is the third event of SLARDAR’s Sri Lanka Super Series 2017 and the performances at this event will be considered for year end overall Super Series Best Driver and Best Rider titles. SLADAR president Nishan Wasalathanthri said the Cavalry Supercross is a milestone event of the Sri Lanka Super Series 2017 where the overall Best Driver will be awarded a Kia Picanto car, courtesy of Vision Care and Kia Motors while the Best Rider will ride home a Honda Hornet bike sponsored by Stafford Motors.
Ushan Perera crowned the Best Driver while Ishan Dassanayake was adjudged the king of two wheels at last year’s Cavalry Supercross.
Cavalry Supercross was inaugurated as a fund raising event for welfare projects of the war hero families and development of Regiment’s infrastructure facilities. The event is a brain child of present organizing committee head, Brigadier Indunil Ranasinghe who is the Vice Chancellor (Security and Administration) of the Kothalawala Defence University and over the years, 18 houses were donated to disabled and fallen war heroes’ families by the funds generated from the event. Funds were also distributed to build holiday homes for soldiers while ongoing projects of three new holiday homes and a training centre for all regiments will be completed in the future. The ‘Viru Daru’ project is one of the main charity funded by the Cavalry Supercross.
Brigadier Ranasinghe said that they are very happy with the constant progress of the event over the years and they hope to upgrade the event to the international standard, broadening horizons to give much exposure to Lankan drivers and riders.
