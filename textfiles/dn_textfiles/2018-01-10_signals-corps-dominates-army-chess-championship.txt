The competition was conducted under six categories as men’s, women’s, men’s group, women’s group, men’s (injured) and men’s group (injured). Around 120 players from 20 regiments took part in the event and preliminary matches were held at SLSC Regimental Headquarters auditorium and Pangolla ‘Abhimansala 3’ from December 29, 2017 to January 4, 2018.
SLSC clinched the championship trophies in both Men’s, Women’s individual and group categories while bagging the runner up titles in individual events. ‘Abhimansala 3’ secured the injured War Heroes’ championship in both individual and group categories.
