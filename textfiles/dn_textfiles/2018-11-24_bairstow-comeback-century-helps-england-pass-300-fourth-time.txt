Sri Lanka left to rue early use of DRS
Bairstow comeback century helps England pass 300 for fourth time

England gave further demonstration of their dominance over the Sri Lankan spinners when on a dry turning track they displayed a technique that was successful in encountering spin so that by the end of the opening day of the third and final cricket Test at the SSC grounds they were strongly placed at 312 for seven wickets by stumps.
It is the fourth time in five innings in the series that England has passed the 300-run mark and the way the Lankan batters have performed against the England spinners so far the total looks more than sufficient for them to go ahead and complete a 3-0 whitewash.
At the wickets are two spinners who can bat and cause further damage to Sri Lanka – Moeen Ali on 23 and Adil Rashid on 13, by extending that total to one of match-winning proportions.
Moeen in the 74 minutes he was at the wicket had a charming life being dropped behind the wicket by Niroshan Dickwell at 2 off Lakshan Sandakan and in the slips by Dimuth Karunaratne at 17 and then successfully reviewing two lbw decisions against him at 19 and 23 – all of them off the luckless Dilruwan Perera who ended the day with expensive figures of one for 107 off 30.1 overs.
Sri Lanka only made things difficult for themselves by exhausting their two reviews as early as the 22nd over with England on 82-2 for after that they were at the mercy of the umpire to have a decision given in their favour.
Ben Stokes who went onto score 57 off 88 balls (5 fours, 2 sixes) survived two lbw decisions at 0 and 26 which the umpire negatived but on replay was out with the ball clearly hitting the stumps. However Sri Lanka’s poor judgement of calling for the DRS and exhausting it so early cost them wickets as they were to later rue.
Sri Lanka’s bad luck with the toss continued as Joe Root won it for the third time in a row in the series and had no hesitation in choosing to bat first as they had done so in the first two Tests and won so convincingly by 211 runs and by 57 runs at Galle and Pallekele respectively to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series.
In each of the two Tests England had a centurion – Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings at Galle, and Joe Root at Pallakele.
Yesterday it was Jonny Bairstow’s turn to take the limelight when he became England’s fourth centurion in the series stroking his way to a remarkable century – 110 off 186 balls with nine fours and a six.
Root had given a pre-warning of what Bairstow could do when he has a point to prove at the pre-match press conference. The England wicket-keeper who lost his place in the series to Ben Foakes due to an ankle injury, came out with all guns blazing to prove a point and by doing so may have solved England’s teething problem of finding a permanent no. 3. Moeen Ali was tried out in the first Test and Ben Stoakes in the second without much success.
“One thing we all know about Jonny is that whenever he’s got a point to prove, or he is up against it, he generally comes out and does something pretty special. Hopefully we see that determination and drive to really hammer that spot (n. 3) home for himself this week,” said Root.
And so it was as Bairstow went onto complete his sixth Test hundred and his third against Sri Lanka in four Tests stitching together partnerships of 100 with Root (46) and 99 with Stokes (57) that laid the foundation for England’s total.
Although Sri Lanka kept on chipping in with wickets England scored freely maintaining a run rate of between 3½ and four an over.
Lakshan Sandakan playing his first match of the series ended up as the pick of the Lankan bowlers with figures of four for 91.
Both teams made two changes with Sandakan and Dhanushka Gunathilaka replacing Akila Dananjaya and Kaushal Silva for Sri Lanka and, Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow coming in for James Anderson and Sam Curran.
