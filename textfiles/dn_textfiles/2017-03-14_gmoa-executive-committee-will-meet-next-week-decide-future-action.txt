GMOA Executive Committee will meet next week to decide future action

 
The Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will meet next Thursday (16) to decide stern future action to be taken in connection with the attacks on medical students and other students who protested against SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today (14) he said that the GMOA vehemently condemn the attack on innocent unarmed students.
“It is the sole responsibility of the Government to prevent such brutal attacks and similar incidents’, he said. Dr. Zoysa, said it was the Cabinet Ministers who were preventing the President from solving the issue, and that they should take the responsibility of the attack.
"After holding several discussions with all stake holders, the relevant Cabinet Ministers have failed to implement those decisions made by the Presidential Committee appointed to solve the SAITM issue," he alleged.
"Under this situation, it is absolutely normal for students' unrest to develop in connection with the issue.
‘This issue still prevails since relevant Cabinet Ministers have not implemented the decisions made by the Presidential Committee’, he said.
