EKHO ROYAL LAKE TOUR

Juliet Coombe goes bird watching early morning on the Sea of King Parakrama, one of the largest man-made lakes in the world and as the early morning mist lifts like a magic curtain she is rewarded with birds dancing over the islands where the royal summer palaces sit.
EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa overlooks the huge tank of water built in the 12th century and on the other side of the hotel is the medieval capital dating back to the 6th Century. King Parakramabahu The Great reigning from 1153 built this giant lake that has made the area so famous and an excellent way to see it is to go fishing and bird watching on what can only be described as a vital source of water to the surrounding farms.
A few stylish indulgences
Today this splendid man made lake built by King Parakrama provides water for the worlds largest elephant gathering in the dry season, many species of birds including the cormorants and the playful monkeys that live inside this historic site, now very well known due to the highly successful Walt Disney film, as the Monkey Kingdom. Built as both a moat to protect the royal citadel from intruders and to provide an advanced irrigation system with one aim to make the area totally self sufficient and an example to the world on many different subjects from medicine to engineering.
EKHO Lake House say it is no wonder the royal wish of Queen Elizabeth 11 on her visit in 1954 shortly after being crowned Queen was to stay here, where King’s audience halls, council chambers and bathing ponds are within eyesight of this wonderfully situated property.

With EKHO Lake House wings named after past kings of this ancient city, Parakramabahu, Nissankamalla and Vijayabahu, it is reminiscent of how surrounded by Royalty you are when you book the hotels top selling room the Royal Suite. From the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty, which ever room you book, and nothing is too much trouble for this dynamic and inspiring team. So pick from the portfolio of 14 elegantly re-furbished rooms and enjoy the magic of this lake civilisation to the full by staying four or five days.
Of course for that special event nothing beats the room Queen Elizabeth herself stayed in, which overlooks the lake on two sides and still has the royal bathtub in dull gold, and now half a century later the group has added a few stylish indulgences like an outdoor Jacuzzi so you can sip champagne under the stairs and enjoy the lake in all its glory at anytime of the day.
A great chance
The best way to see King Parakramabahu’s fabulous garden city is at water level by going out with the fishing community in a rowing boat. You can either enjoy bird watching early morning combined with seeing some of the ruined palaces on the islands dotted around the lake or spend a few hours doing a spot of fishing on a catamaran, which can be combined with learning to cook royal dishes in the plot to plat special experience for those that love hands on foodie experiences.
After the fabulous boat ride around the lake you will be taken around Dishan’s fishing village on the opposite side of the lake, see a Catholic church, buy some fresh fish to cook in the evening from one of the local singer fishing bike sellers, and eat breakfast fit for a King and freshly prepared in a typical home garden setting. It is a great chance to ask about life around the lake, ancient traditions, and just how do the community live along side the wild elephants that drink from the lake daily early morning and late afternoon. One fisherman amused us with stories of how one elephant smelt wood apple and swam out to get some from his boat. He was terrified as the elephant loomed over his fishing vessel larger than life and thought his number was up, but luckily not that day.
Whether you end up playing cricket with the staff on the beach below the hotel as the sun sets over the lake, or indulge in a unforgettable cream tea while sitting on the rocks where they made the columns for the royal palaces. Every curated experience is excellent and includes unique personal touches like a flute player serenading you from a boat in the evening, live piano music while you enjoy a four course fine dinning experience in the restaurant named Rasa Musu. This simply means a blend of perfect aromatic spices and ingredients like lake fish sprinkled with flawless finishing touches. Soul satisfying cuisine that is not only delicious but feeds the mind with the beauty of the lake that is poetically described as “…of such a width that it is impossible to stand upon one shore and view the other side”.
