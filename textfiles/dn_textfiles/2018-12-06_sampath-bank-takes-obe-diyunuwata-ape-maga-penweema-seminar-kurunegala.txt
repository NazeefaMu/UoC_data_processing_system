The latest edition of “Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema”, the interactive seminars hosted by Sampath Bank for representatives of the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector, was held at the Kandyan Reach Hotel in Kurunegala recently.

Addressing the representatives of the SMEsector from Kurunegala and surrounding areas who were present at the event, Ayodhya Iddawela Perera said, “Small and medium enterprises contribute immensely to the development of this country. This is why, Sampath Bank, since inception, has supported these industrialists and provided them with the financial assistance they need to develop their businesses. These workshops, which we are now rolling out island wide, are yet another step we have taken in this direction. On behalf of the bank, I take this opportunity to show our appreciation to all these entrepreneurs from the SME sector for their efforts and dedication in aiding the development of our nation.”
The Bank’s Trade Services Unit has been conducting the “Obe Diyunuwata Ape Maga Penweema” knowledge sharing sessions since late 2017 and has already conducted seminars in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Negombo with plans to hold such forums in key business centers around the island this year.
