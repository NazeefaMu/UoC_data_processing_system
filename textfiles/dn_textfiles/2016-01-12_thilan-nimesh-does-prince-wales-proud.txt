Thilan Nimesh does Prince of Wales proud

Prince of Wales College first eleven cricket captain Thilan Nimesh has been selected for the Sri Lanka under 19 World Cup Cricket team which will play in Bangladesh later this month.
This is the second instance that this ace left arm leg spinner has been selected for the under 19 cricket team to represent Sri Lanka. Last month he played in the triangular series where England and India was involved.
He is an unanimous choice for the under 19 World Cup team as he has proved his credentials in an earlier occasion and in recent inter school matches.
When contacted by the Daily News Sports the Principal of Prince of Wales J W S Siriwardena said that he was very happy that Thilan has brought honour and glory to the school which has produced several cricketers in time to time.
Due to this tour he will miss a few inter school fixtures.
incidentally in the 2014 World Cup Cambrian Kusal Mendis captained the team.
