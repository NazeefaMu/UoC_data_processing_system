Traditional ways of food preservation highlighted

Drought is expected to create a future food shortage, Therefore, it is imperative for the people to be vigilant about this threat and begin to prevent unnecessary wastage of food, Hambantota Inter-province Assistant Director of Agriculture Nalika Rubasinghe said. She said it behoves housewives particularly to ensure that only the required quantity of food items are prepared for the household meals without cooking in excess which will go waste. The immense wastage of food currently taking place could be adduced by looking into the dustbins placed in workplaces, canteens, hotels and restaurants, she said.
