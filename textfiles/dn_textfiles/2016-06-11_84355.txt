Plans in place to salvage fallen SLTB

A restructure plan for the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) would be introduced to salvage it, while retaining its ownership by the Government, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the SLTB has a debt burden of Rs 16 billion, adding that the efforts of the Government was to find this money without burdening the general public with more and more taxes.
He pointed out even though the Treasury had been doling out money to the SLTB for many years, it had failed to pay the due EPF payments to its employees. He made this observation as a response to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena questioned whether there was a plan to privatize the SLTB, to downsize its staff by 12,000 and to sell the lands belonging to the SLTB. Responding to the question Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva emphasized that the SLTB would not be privatized, but a restructure plan would be put in place to rebuild it.
“The SLTB's daily income of Rs 69 million was not sufficient even to cover up the day-to-day expenses. The Treasury had been doling out Rs 1,350 million each month. If not for this money, the SLTB was unable to even pay the salaries of its employees,” he said.
He said for the last five years from starting from 2010, employees EPF contributions have not been remitted to the Treasury even though that amount had been deducted from the salaries of employees. “EFP arrears stood at Rs 10,250 million when I assumed duties. Now we have brought this amount down to Rs 8,900 million. Since September 2015, EPF contributions of each and every employee of the SLTB have been paid. However, it has faced a severe financial crisis,” he said.
He said no employee had been forced out of the institution, but said a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) was now being implemented at the SLTB. “We had obtained Cabinet approval in this regard. The VRS is not open for drivers, technicians and bus conductors. At an average, the SLTB has 6 workers for each bus. Therefore it has become hugely inefficient,” he said.
The Minister also said the number of depots would be brought down from 120 to 70. He said the lands owned by the SLTB had not been sold to the private sector, but they had been vested in companies fully owned by the Treasury. He also said the Finance Ministry had facilitated Rs 2,500 million to repair 1,000 SLTB buses.
