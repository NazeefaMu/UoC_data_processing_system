From crisis to sustenance – Part 17: Test of exemplary leader is whether he can set an example and build commitment

In any organization, the team members will get highly frustrated when their team leader says one thing at their meeting and then does something quite different later. It is quite natural. When you think about leadership the words: trust, credibility, relationships, communication, and consistency come to mind to name a few. The importance of connecting your words with action is critical in developing into a respected leader.
We were talking about Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner last week. We have learnt last week that James Kouzes and Barry Posner, authors of The Leadership Challenge, identified “modeling the way” as one of five practices of exemplary leadership. In fact, it is said to be the most critical leadership practice.
What does it really mean? It means, the leader doing what he or she expects the followers to do. If you expect people to speak respectfully to each other, speak respectfully to them. If you expect people to be on time for meetings, as the leader, always be there a few minutes ahead and begin exactly on time, every time, no exceptions.
Leaders model the way
Modeling the way means leaders go first. Transformational leaders set an example and build commitment through daily acts that create progress and momentum. They create a program of excellence and then set the example for others to follow.
To model the way, leaders need to have a philosophy, a set of high standards by which the organization is measured, a set of principles concerning the way people should be treated, and the way goals should be pursued that make the organization unique and distinctive.
These leaders show by example that they live by the values they advocate. They believe that consistency between words and deeds builds their credibility as transformational leaders
Leaders set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with their organization’s shared values. They accomplish this by:
Clarifying their own personal values. People expect their leaders to stand for something, and to have the courage of their convictions. Leaders who lack core values are likely to change their position with every fad, and will be judged eventually as inconsistent and “political” in their behavior. Values are the standards that help us determine what we will and will not do. They influence every aspect of our lives: our moral judgments, our responses to others, our commitments to personal and organizational goals.
Building a consensus of shared values. Leaders represent groups. For the people to be mobilized in unity, they must all share the same values. Thus the leaders must gain consensus on a common cause and a common set of principles, thereby building a community of shared values that will form the solid bedrock of an organization’s vitality and effectiveness. This takes time since the people must truly own the values; unity is forged, not forced.
Auditing their actions. People pay more attention to the values their leaders actually use than to those the leaders say they believe in. Effective leaders must set good examples, establish high standards for themselves, and personally practice what they preach. A profitable exercise in this regard is to list the values you preach and then systematically compare them with those values actually reflected by your calendar for the last month.
Seizing opportunities to teach. Critical incidents present opportunities for leaders to teach important lessons about appropriate norms of behavior. Leaders will watch for these opportunities, and use them to illuminate and reinforce the organization’s values.
Lived values
We do what our leaders do. Consciously and unconsciously, we commit when our leaders commit. We walk the talk when we observe those we deem credible walking the talk. We risk our personal investment when they risk and personally invest.
So, what does this mean? If you are a leader, if you have the right values statement, you will be giving hundreds of opportunities to your subordinates every day to “model the way.” For example, if you say: “If I am accountable for successes and for mistakes, others around me will do the same. If I am open to receiving feedback, and acting on the feedback I receive, it will be easier for those around me to be open to feedback. If I communicate in honest and direct ways, I will likely receive the same, in return. Values on the wall are nice to have and they sound impressive. “
Lived values, values “in-use” are what will really change culture, one person at a time. Personal credibility is one of the most critical personal traits of a leader. Leaders promote two principles in this practice: find your voice to clarify values and set the example.
Find your voice to clarify values
What do guiding principles look like? How do you clarify your personal values into guiding principles and shared values with your team? As an emerging leader, what would comprise a personal credo?
Often, guiding principles revolve around how you will act in term of: accountability, coaching, collaboration, commitment, communication, compassion, competence, expertise, humility, mentoring, passion, respect, responsibility, or trust. The process of discerning your personal values and guiding principles is the foundation for your moral compass.
Personal credo
A personal credo is a simple outline of your personal and professional beliefs, (“credo” is Latin for “I believe”). The beliefs you identify and describe are the beliefs others should respect and follow because of what you stand for. I have a personal credo that I shared with my staff when I was a corporate executive, and I now share with my subordinates.
* I believe I must be fiercely passionate about my work.
* I believe in the rigorous use of methods and techniques to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.
* I believe that being organized in my work habits, which frees my mind for higher achievements.
* I believe that disciplined written and verbal communications creates a framework for concise and precise communications with my team and colleagues.
* I believe in Excellence in the delivery of my and my team’s work.
* I believe my choices are made through a highly focused and directed personal will to achieve only the very best possible results.
Exemplary leaders lead the charge. You do this by setting the example. On a daily basis, you must be committed and engaged in action that demonstrates your beliefs are worthwhile living. Your first action is a collaborative approach where you build a consensus around the shared values of your team and organization. As Kouzes and Posner have said” “The leader's belief in and commitment to the vision were the sparks that ignited the flame of inspiration.”
Setting the example
Itemize the challenges you face in leading each project. Is it budget and funding? Is it the consultants who are domineering or the staff who are resistant to change? Is it the inability to share and collaborate, i.e., break down the silos? Is it an institutional history that says the last initiative was a failure, so this one will likely be so as well? Is it the lack of executive sponsorship?
Now take an inventory of your current team members. Are there other significant stakeholders you should include? How will each team member and stakeholder measure success? What are the critical success factors (CSFs)? Are you dreading this project, or are you enthused and emotionally charged? Outline why you think the project is important to you, the stakeholders, and your organization.
Find a method to log your values and other team members’ values. Are there common, clear, shared values you could use to help the team converge on a goal? Discuss your values with those of the team. Locate shared values that can be articulated. If you find there are none, I suggest finding some way to get yourself off the team, since it is a train wreck waiting to happen.
Communicate the shared values outside of the team. Create a “team credo” that suggests guiding principles for the project. As the leader, make sure you daily act in congruence with the values identified for the team. A team with visible values and principles is a team that works and plays together well, and will have a higher probability of success.
Summary
We will summarize what we discussed above. Leaders establish principles concerning the way people (subordinates, peers, colleagues, and customers alike) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are not sure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory
The most important personal quality people look for and admire in a leader is personal credibility. Credibility is the foundation of leadership. If people don’t believe in the messenger, they won’t believe the message.
Leaders are supposed to stand up for their beliefs, so you should have beliefs to stand up for. Leaders must be clear about their guiding principles. They must find their own voices, and then they must clearly and authentically give voice to their values.
Modeling the Way begins with the clarification of personal values and involves building and affirming shared values that all can embrace.
Next week we will discuss the practice and principle: inspire a shared vision by envisioning an uplifting future.
