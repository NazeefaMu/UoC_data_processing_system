Microsoft announced that Team Titans from Sri Lanka had been selected as one of seven teams to represent South Asia at the Microsoft Imagine Cup World Finals in July this year.
The selection was made at the inaugural Imagine Cup Southeast Asia Finals held in Manila, Philippines.
Addressing the issue of treating asthma in children, Team Titans Dimuthu Kariyawasam, Buddhi Ayesha and Keet Sugathadasa from the University of Moratuwa developed ‘INHALO’, a product aimed at motivating children to carry out proper breathing practices and continued inhaler-use.
The product comes with a Headset that identifies breathing patterns of the user, and a Mobile Game, that motivates children to use the inhaler and get healthier as they play. The game also supports single player and multi-player features.
Conferred the title of “Worldwide Finalist” for their innovation, Team Titans will take their journey to the next level at the Imagine Cup World Finals.
Held in Seattle this July, the World Finals will gather more than 50 students teams from all over the world, all vying for the top prize of USD $100,000, mentorship opportunities with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, as well as Azure grants and credits to bring their winning solution to the market.
