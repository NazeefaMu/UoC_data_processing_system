The FCID sought Attorney General’s (AG) advice on future legal action to be taken against five suspects including Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa for their involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.15 million.
When the case filed under money laundering charges came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya, the FCID said that the preliminary investigations regarding the incident have been concluded and sought AG’s advice in this regard.
Accordingly, further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for April 26.
Four suspects Namal Rajapaksa, Sudarsha Bandara Ganewatta, Nithya Senani and Sujani Bogollagama were present before Court.
They are currently out on bail.
Meanwhile, the Court was informed that Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa who had evaded court since the inception is living in Australia.
The Court had issued warrants through the Interpol for the arrest of Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa.  
The FCID commenced investigation into a complaint that MP Namal Rajapaksa had purchased Hello Corp. Pvt. Ltd for Rs.100 million using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation and NR Consultation Pvt Ltd, allegedly owned by Namal Rajapaksa.
The FCID informed Court that investigations revealed that MP Rajpaksa had been allegedly involved in money laundering to the amount of Rs. 15 million at NR Consultation Pvt Ltd and another Rs.30 million in Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd, in 2012.
The Attorney General filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against Namal Rajapaksa and five others who are alleged to have money laundered to the amount of Rs.30 million at NR Consultation.  
Police alleged that money laundering transactions had been taken place through a company named Boston Capital, allegedly owned by Rohan Iriyagolla and he has revealed everything on this regard.
