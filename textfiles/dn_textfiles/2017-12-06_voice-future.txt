Voice of the future

The English literary world has been strewn with an exotic bouquet of roses in the form stories, plays and poems. Many have been translated into languages spoken around the globe.
However, a few have not read and heard about works of H G Wells, Herbert, George wells born in 1866 passed away in 1946. He was an Englishmen. Parents were simple but with a vision of making their son a visionary expert. Herbert had a normal education in Science School. His vision in the study of the planet and its inhabitants made him a writer who gave his generation a glimpse of the future, human lifestyles, religion and history. Wells was a novelist, teacher and journalist.
His books gave the reading world a fantastic glimpse into the future. His stories wafted into the future. He was called ‘The Voice of the Future'.
Futuristic mortal
His first book ‘The Time Machine’ was out of this world. Literary giants were awed. Who is this futuristic mortal with brains to delve into the future of a planet?
A teacher who brought tomorrow to the present. Our very own late Martin Wickremesinghe says that Wells takes us to the void between the present and the future or two ages. It reminds him of his own presentations that spoke of two generations or lifestyles ‘Gamperaliya’, ‘Madul Duwa’, ‘Kurumini Saththu’, ‘Karuwala Gedera’ and ‘Yuganththaya'.
H G Wells was with his readers long before the Ionosphere was invaded by man. Man conquered space for the future longevity of man and also to terminate his existence with ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. But our gentle author strived to unite an ailing world with his stories – ‘Time Machine,’ Invisible Man’ and ‘War of the Worlds’ and also many more.
His masterpiece ‘Outlines of World History’ takes him to the very pinnacle in giving us a concise glimpse of what happened how it happened and when it happened to our mother earth and her occupants from the beginning of time until the author’s existence.
There are two volumes, divided into a number of books. He speaks on many topics, were inventions, authors, religion. He speaks about celestial teachers. He does not go deep into the teachings of these Divine Masters but takes us how where, when and the aftermath of the preaching by them. He makes our mind to go back with time to be with our beautiful, Divine Gurus.
Different postures
The photographs in these. Volumes help. The book on the birth and the spread of the Teachings of Buddha is mentioned with photographs of the enlightened one in different postures as found in many an Eastern Country. Our Ceylon takes pride of place with the Bo Tree, Kandy Temple, the Sacred Tooth Relic and our ordained priests. He calls the words of the Buddha, gentle and often generates a smile He speaks of the everlastingly resplendent Bo Tree at Anuradhapura.
Next, he says that the greatest monarch in the world King Asoka. He conquered Afghanistan up to a part of now Chennai. He conquered Kalinga lying along the coast of Chennai, up to the tip of India. Then came repentance. He was abhorred in seeing the massacred on the battlefield. He throws away his sword and begins to spread the word of Buddha. His edicts are for all time. He helped the downtrodden and sent his son to our land with the words of the Buddha. Later his daughter with a sapling of the Bo Tree. He also sent missionaries to China. As a Christian, I am proud to relate these gems to him.
Once, late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera had told his good friend late Rev. Fr. Tissa Balasuriya, that HG Wells should be honoured by the Buddhists of Lanka.
Wells did not go into the essence of the Buddha's Words, but his writings speak a lot about the great strides taken by the Buddha to heal the world. The late unforgettable Thera had said “Tissa, we have come to speak about our Masters.
Who was with his in trying to heal the world, but H G Wells has made the letters of the English Alphabet to join together in speaking about Buddhism by an English writer. He should be honoured'. He had said, as said in the Outline of History, Book IV Pgs. 246-248 (unquote). The pictures in this chapter make us Christians to look up to him and meditate. He also speaks of the teachings of Prophet Mohamed. His teachings on submission, giving alms and seeking knowledge from cradle to grave.
Long stills
The writer ends his immortal stories and articles with ‘The War of the Worlds'. The world is conquered by aliens. Their spacecraft stand aloft on long stills. The world is awed. The fighting forces and weapons cannot subdue these visitors from outer space.
Wells wants mankind to see the intervention of the celestial teachers in whom they believe to be with them. All in prayer. Then suddenly, a .......... man, who was about to be annihilated by aliens see their invaders falling. Dead, scientists probe into the reason.
Our tiniest of micro-organisms that had been with the man in good times and bad giving us diseases, curd and yoghurt had killed the aliens. The space invaders had never encountered bacteria. Their anatomical system faced a diabolical alien. Fascinating don't you think.
Atom bombs, nuclear missiles, the gunfire could not stop the invaders, but they were conquered by our tiny bacteria. Yes, a bacterium was able to save the world and mankind.
A lovely story by H G Wells:
Says Fredrick Forsythe the modern maestro in storytelling quite. Herbert George Wells was at times looked down by many for his very authentic declarations about man's leanings about religions. Also about the Origin of Man.
His story ‘war of the worlds’ says Forsythe, ‘wants to show us that faith could, at times, be with the man, taking many shapes making life to waft happily till death.
Many I most humbly request my dear readers who have had neither the time nor the opportunity in reading the works of the wells to spare some time in reading H G Wells Outline of World History.
