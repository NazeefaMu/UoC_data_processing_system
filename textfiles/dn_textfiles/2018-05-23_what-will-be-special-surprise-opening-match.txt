FIFA World Cup 2018 :
What will be the  special surprise in the  opening match?

The FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia will come up with a lot of surprises. The opening match too is no exception.
The competition was open to amateur players aged 13-16 and the winners were chosen by players of the Russian national team. The results were announced earlier in the week.
“Everybody screamed. We experienced unbelievable emotions. Probably, it is the biggest dream for football players to attend the World Cup. We are speechless, simply speechless,” said Yulia Shustova, the team captain.
The opening match will take place between Russia and Saudi Arabia on June 14 in Moscow.
