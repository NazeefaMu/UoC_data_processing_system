Transcendence 2017 unveils at the BMICH

Transcendence 2017, the latest concert and project organised by the Interact Club of Ananda College, will be held on March 11 at the BMICH from 5.30 pm to 10 pm. The concert was inaugurated last year, cited back then as the Best Finance Project in the Interact Movement.
Tickets can be purchased at the following outlets: Sarasavi Book Shop Nugegoda and Maharagama, Vanapetha Bookshop Dehiwala, Yamaha Music Centre, Ranfer Tea Shop Colombo 03, Abans Main Showroom Colombo 03, and www.ticketslk.com.
The Interact Club of Ananda College has a veritable history behind it, having been formed in 1981. To date, it has contributed more than nine District Interact Representatives and seven District Interact Secretaries. In 2003, it became the Best Club in Interact District 3220, walking away with 14 awards. In 2008, it clinched the first Governor’s Shield for Interactors.
It has also organised a horde of other, as acclaimed projects: “Morning of Friendship” (which celebrates the fellowship of Interactors everywhere at one venue, date, and time), “Hope” (which took the form of blood donation and health camps throughout the country), “Building Bridges” (where it got together with a school in India), “Nethra”, “and “Project IR”. These have not gone unacknowledged: “Hope” was cited as the Best Community Service Project for seven consecutive years, while “Project IR” was cited as the Most Innovative Club Service Project of 2013/14.
“Transcendence” will see Bathiya Jayakody, Umaria, Chitral Somapala, Sanuka Wickramasinghe, Daddy, NAADRO, Voice Print, and Infinity perform a set of colourful melodies and tunes which will make it a night to remember. The funds collected will be used for a key Interact Community Service project at Ananda, “Epitome of Rejoice”, as well as to build a school in Kurunegala.
