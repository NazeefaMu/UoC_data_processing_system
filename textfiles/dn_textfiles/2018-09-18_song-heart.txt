Song from the heart

“I follow the winds that bring the cold. I light a fire in your soul, the lightest touch of feathers falling, my love may be invisible but I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby” - Satellite by Above and Beyond
A memory, a story and a lesson is behind the ‘soul’ in her singing. Life is journey where she has not limited herself to one genre of music. Melodies speaks to Hirushi Jayasena who sings with a heart full of gratitude towards those she has touched in life, and who in return have placed a song in her heart.
“I’d like to dedicate my journey to everyone who gave me a story, memory, or a lesson that is the reason behind the songs I sing, the lyrics I write, and the tunes I play. Singing has always been an experiment and I simply cannot limit myself to a type!” said Jayasena
Music is a powerful force in anyone’s life that can uplift, hearten and transform you. It can move you emotionally in a powerful way. The effect it can have on an audience is irresistible. The effect it can have on you is instantaneous helping you relate to its lyrics.
“If a musical note is a letter, then a bar is a sentence, and the melody is a story. Despite what divides us, music is a universal language that taps into what’s in the heart. I always wanted to be an agent in changing hearts for the better,” added Jayasena.
Jayasena does original vocals, film playback singing and instrumental covers, but she hopes to give priority to her own projects in the future. The future is certainly bright for Jayasena who is very busy these days writing the next chapter in her life.
“I have a few tracks in line but right now it’s all about launching the “Hanguman” music video, audio produced by Pasan Liyanage and written by aunty Malini Liyanage. I am super excited about this! If you ask me which songs means the most to me, I think Hanguman is an important one for me. Because for the first time in my life I sang a song that I can entirely relate to in my reality. I have done live performances over the decade, but the one I got most positive feedback was for the live show “Sihinayaki Re” telecast on Rupavahini. That was a different kind of experience for me as well,” pointed out Jayasena.
Life has been a journey where she has found herself musically and where she has found out who she is! It has been a process of self-discovery both career wise and personally.
“Freddie Mercury’s Bohemian Rhapsody taught me the importance of breaking free of a flawed past that wasn't you, and seeking the future to find yourself. Learning the lives of musicians gives me so much hope and I feel free to face life. But inspiration in general is unlimited. It'll keep coming. I have many favorites ranging from Beethoven to Big Sean!” explained Jayasena.
Constantly comparing herself to others is not Jayasena’s cup of tea. For her success is relative. What is important to herself is how happy she is in her heart. She loves what she does and lives life on her own terms.
“The main tip for success is to admit that success is relative, and it’s mainly about what you feel within you. Do what you love, Love what you do. I adapt to any kind of situation and I am a tomboy at heart. I always aspire to live the truth,” pointed out Jayasena.
From her small days music has had a strong effect on her. You could say that it was in her blood. She took part in as many competitions as possible. Since she was six it has been a continuous process of making the best out of every opportunity. She has welcomed challenges in her life. And she credits part of her success to never stepping away from a challenge.
“I loved singing since I was six! Represented schools, universities and clubs for different kinds of competitions and events. Challenges were a requirement for me and it never left. And I’ve come this far because of them,” added Jayasena.
Jayasena attributes her success to a strong support system. She thanks her loving parents, her studio family at Redfox, friends, significant ones for believing in her, and thanks all artists and professionals who supported her in the industry. And last but not least her loving fans who have been incredible. Jayasena is in no rush to go anywhere taking life as it comes. However this does not mean she has no goals. She is looking forward to the future having set specific objectives and goals academically and artistically. She is taking it one day at a time.
Her favorite lyrics are - “I follow the winds that bring the cold. I light a fire in your soul, the lightest touch of feathers falling, my love may be invisible but I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby” - Satellite by Above and Beyond.
There is no number 1# performance that makes her happy because she is always looking at tomorrow and what she enjoys doing. There will be so many hits in the future. So many worlds to conquer!
“I think that’s something I can’t measure because it’s all in the delivery. Maybe there is a #1 out there of mine that I never thought about. There were times when I won or achieved things, but the best moments are when you meet amazing people who eventually turn into family. They are very simple times which didn’t have a spotlight or wasn’t published,” said Jayasena
