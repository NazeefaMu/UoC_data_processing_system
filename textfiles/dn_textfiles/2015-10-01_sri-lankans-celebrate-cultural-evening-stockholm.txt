The 'Channa Upuli Dance Troupe' kept the audience spellbound with their inspirational performance of traditional Sri Lankan dancing that was unique to the European audience. The dance troupe also performed at the TUR Travel Fair held in Stockholm, from September 26 to 27, 2015.
A dance performance accompanied by Tamil songs conducted by the Bharatha Kala Kendra in Stockholm further emphasized the multiculturalism that is cherished in the country.
A documentary on Sri Lanka was also screened at the programme, highlighting Sri Lanka as a travel destination as well as the benefits to consider Sri Lanka as a country to conduct businesses and attract investment.
The three pronged approach was to promote Sri Lanka as a tourist destination in Sweden, forge further cooperation between Sri Lanka and Sweden and to build a closer rapport among the Sri Lankan Diaspora living in Sweden. The programme also succeeded in generating curiosity and much interest among the Swedish and other foreign nationals concerning Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan food items served with a cup of Ceylon Tea to the invitees helped create the atmosphere of a truly Sri Lankan ambience for the evening of September 24 ,2015 at the Vällingby Theatre in Stockholm, said the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Stockholm.
