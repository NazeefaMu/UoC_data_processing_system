SriLankan cautions public on fake survey

SriLankan Airlines says that there is a fake airline survey currently circulating on the internet and social media including messenger apps, mentioning that SriLankan Airlines were offering free tickets. This is not a SriLankan Airlines promotion.
“This is a malicious and false site that is attempting to prey on our valued customers, the airline said. SriLankan requests not to access any sites that are not directly linked to SriLankan Airlines web page. The airline is currently offering a “Partner Flies Free” promotional offer that can only be accessed via www.srilankan.com. SriLankan Airlines will not undertake any responsibility with regard to promotional campaigns not carried out directly by the airline. General public are advised to log onto www.srilankan.com for any promotional offers and refrain giving personal information to any other websites mentioning SriLankan Airlines.
