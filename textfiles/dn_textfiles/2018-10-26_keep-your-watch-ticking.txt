Keep your watch ticking

While most mechanical timepieces come with guarantees of durability, the intricate machinery with which they operate can still be subject to some degree of wear and tear. With regular and expert care however, your luxury wristwatch will keep ticking for years.
Multi-brand luxury watch boutique Chatham Luxury Watches is long reputed as the most established purveyor of original, luxury Swiss timepieces in the country.
Providing an all-encompassing suite of watch services and repairs to ensure that all watch needs have been completely catered to, the Chatham Service Centre and its technical team of trained experts is ideally positioned to service or repair that timepiece; whether it requires a simple battery replacement, or a complete restoration. The boutique’s in-house service centre tends to the needs of watches designed by any brand housed in-store.
Chatham’s state-of-the-art watch workshop -located at its flagship boutique in Galle Face- is equipped with strictly only manufacturer-approved tools and machinery. The company’s brand-certified watchmakers are, not only highly skilled in Swiss techniques of watch repair and conditioning, but are also passionate about their craft.
The technical team at Chatham Luxury Watches has received intensive training individually from each of the brands gracing its shelves. As is the case with quintessential watchmaker Rolex, for instance, only after a rigorous process of assessment at the manufacturers of these respective brands for specific watch models, are they certified to handle each respective model.
