Sydney photographers give Christmas present to homeless family

 
AUSTRALIA: Wildlife photographers Chris and Jess Bray had just landed on the tarmac at Sydney Airport when they got an email from Dick Smith.
The couple, from Avalon in Sydney's northern beaches, keep in contact with the businessman and philanthropist as they travel around the world taking photos. They were almost home after running a photo safari in the Galapagos Islands and the Amazon when Mr Smith's email proposed a new adventure: go to India to find a homeless family he saw from a train several weeks earlier.
"Chris looked at me and said 'do you want to go to India'? I was like 'sure'," Mrs Bray said with a laugh.
Smith, the 71-year-old businessman who has become known for his philanthropy, was on a trip to the Indian state of Gujarat with his wife Pip early in December when his train was stopped for around 20 minutes under a bridge in the city of Vadodara.
From the carriage, he watched as a family who lived there went about their daily life. He was drawn to an eight-year-old girl who wore nothing except a pink bracelet.
Taking out his phone, Smith took a photo of the family, a picture of a nearby billboard, and noted the location on Google Maps so he could help the family some time in the future.
After his email, Chris and Jess Bray accepted his challenge.
The pair travelled to India, arriving on December 15, and set aside a week to search for the little girl who was quite literally one in a billion.
The photographs detail how the couple emailed ahead and asked friends of friends for contacts in the area who could help locate the family.
With the help of a local bank manager and a professor from a nearby university, they managed to find the bridge and locate the young girl on their second day in Vadodara.
They learned Divya, whose name means 'divine light', was born under the bridge where she lives with her parents Krishna and Naresh and her two younger brothers. Though Naresh worked hard as a plasterer, his wage wasn't enough to rent a house, and they had lived there for 12 years.
When Naresh arrived home from work, the photographers made their generous offer: to pay for the family to move into a house, deposit rent money into a bank account for at least two years, and give them school supplies, tools and clothes.
The family agreed.
Over the next two days, Mr and Mrs Bray opened a bank account for Divya, depositing the equivalent of three months' rent ($417), and drew up a contract saying it could only be used for rent and education.
Then they took the family shopping for clothes, shoes, school supplies and plastering tools which would help Naresh earn more money.
On Facebook, they described the experience as "amazing" and "life-changing". For his part, Smith said he was "amazed" the Brays were able to find the family he briefly saw weeks earlier.
"In the past I've tried to help people in developing countries but we've never been able to get anywhere because it's almost impossible to find the people or to find a way of assisting them," Mr Smith said.
"It was extraordinary that they actually found the little girl who lived under the railway bridge, purely because she had a pink band on her right wrist."

Divya was attending school erratically while she lived under the bridge, but her family said with stable accommodation she would attend every day from now on.
The search for the family was covered by The Times of India, after someone who helped with the search suggested it might inspire others to be similarly generous.
After their whirlwind trip, the Brays arrived back in Sydney on December 20.
Mr Smith said it was wonderful to help the family out just before Christmas. He has pledged he will support them for at least two years and has offered to pay for tutoring for Divya if she needs it.
"It's so wonderful that the girl's family now have a chance of some definite income, and instead of having to remain under the railway bridge to be able to get into some reasonable accommodation," he said.
"It's wonderful that we've been able to help this young family at Christmas time, because it's a time of giving and helping people."
