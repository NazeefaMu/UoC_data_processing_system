Sri Chandrasekara were unbeaten thoughout the season winning all four matches in the first round and
three matches in the second round. Now they have booked a berth in the third round.
Kaushalya had 16 hits to the rope and shared an unfinished sixth wicket partnership of 176 runs with Chathushka Chamod who contributed an unbeaten 53 runs.
Batting first homesters were all out for 123 runs with Maneesha Madumina capturing 4 for 33 and at stumps visitors were 216 for 5.
Sri Chandrasekara is coached by Sajith Raveendra and Akila Weerasinghe as his deputy.
The secret behind Chandrasekara Vidyalaya's success is the support and guidance they are receiving at all times from their Principal Mrs. K. U. Kanchanee Wimalarathna and Mrs. Priyanganee Ranasinghe the teacher in Charge of Cricket.
Most of the expences are borne by the parents of the cricket team.
