The Bank of Ceylon’s Annual Report 2015 won the “Best Presented Annual Report Award” in public sector banking institutions category becoming first in the SAARC Region at the South Asian Federation Accountants (SAFA) awards ceremony held in Dhaka Bangladesh recently.
“Being a public owned Bank we ensure that we maintain all our reporting at the required standards so that they represent the manner we maintain our reputation and integrity.” General Manager D.M. Gunasekara said.
South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) is an apex body of SAARC and an acknowledged accounting grouping of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The awards are granted on the basis of improvement in transparency, accountability and governance in financial reporting. SAFA Awards recognizes organizations in the region that achieved excellent standards in accordance with the framework stated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in preparation of financial statements.
The Bank’s 2015 annual report was themed as “Taking Charge of Change” as it was the time where BOC took bold and conscious steps towards digital inclusive transformation.
BOC always maintains its financial reporting standards to comply with the standards set by regulatory bodies and international reporting guidelines for financial institutions such as banks.
