Caltex enhances Havoline Super 4T motorcycles oil with C.O.R.E. Technology

Caltex Havoline, marketed locally by Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC, has launched an enhanced range of motor-cycle engine oils across Asia, which will improve the performance of the region’s two-wheel vehicles. The product has been upgraded to address the needs of the growing use of two wheelers in urban areas and covers the popular viscosity grades requested by both manufacturers and riders.
The new formula will benefit Sri Lanka’s large and fast growing two-wheel vehicle population, which stood at 4 million units at the end of 2017. Over the last few years there has been a shift in the use of two-wheel vehicles from rural areas to urban roads which has resulted in an increasing demand for better performing engine oil to deal with the heavy traffic conditions in the city.
It is a common fact that a cleaner engine runs more efficiently, and hence delivers better overall performance and fuel efficiency.
New Caltex Havoline motorcycle oils are formulated with C.O.R.E. technology and ZOOMTECH booster for enhanced performance, containing a motorcycle-specific formulation which combines high quality base oils with a tailored additive package to deliver excellent engine performance and reliability for all riding conditions.
The newly launched Caltex Havoline 4T motorcycle oil range powered by ZOOMTECH booster, delivers a 13% improvement compared to the old formulation to enhance acceleration. Oils formulated with ZOOMTECH improve clutch grip for better power transfer, to enhance acceleration at a twist of the throttle.
The product can be used in air- and liquid-cooled four-stroke motorcycle engines, motorcycles with back torque limiters, motorcycles with exhaust catalytic converters and motorcycles with combined engine and transmission units, or separate gearboxes where a multi-grade JASO MA or JASO MA2 engine oil is specified. In Sri Lanka Caltex Havoline Super 4T is offered in 10W30, 20W40 and 20W50 viscosity grades to facilitate the customers to use the correct OEM recommended viscosity grade.
The relaunch of Caltex Havoline Super 4T is supported by Chevron’s regional “Ride Strong” campaign, communicated via Above the Line, Below the Line and digital media to create awareness.
“It is customer focused innovation that separates us from the competition. The enhancements made to our range of superior engine oils will ensure Sri Lankan riders have a smoother and worry-free rides, through the better performance of the engines. We are focused on continuous improvement and will continue to upgrade and bring new products to our loyal customers,” said Eenaz Salie, Head of Marketing for Caltex Sri Lanka.
