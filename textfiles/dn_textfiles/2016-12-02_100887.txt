Dinesh hints of ‘shock’ if election not held soon

Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader and Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said they will give a shock to the government if it does not hold an election urgently.
“The electorates have been demarcated. The Commission report on respective boundaries and the Survey Plan have been completed. The government can now hold an election,” Gunawardena said. He was speaking at a press conference in Maharagama.
“If the government’s election withdrawal symptoms persist, we are all keyed up to deal with the situation by rendering a “shock” to the government,” Gunawardena said.
It would take only 24 hours for the government to set things into motion about conducting an election as things stand presently, he said.
“We did not ask for a poll from them yet,” he said, “What we will do is going to shock them like a shot from the start from 2017,” Gunawardena said.
