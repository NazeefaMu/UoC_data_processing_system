COZA Ceylon Mount Lavinia to get three star status

The newly opened COZA Ceylon Mount Lavinia will be reinvesting Rs. 30 million to add six more rooms and introduce other facilities.
A joint venture between two entrepreneurs from Sri Lanka and Japan, A. L. A. Subahan and Asami Morita are joint Chairman of the property.
Having started as an employee at a Kandy hotel, Subahan then gained employment at Dubai and later moved to Japan. “I then worked for twelve years in a five star hotel in Japan and subsequently started my own Restaurant ‘Kiri Pani’ inTokyo.”
“Due to the love for the country I came back to Sri Lanka and invested around Rs. 70 million jointly with Asami Morita to start COZA Mount Lavinia with an investment of Rs. 100 million.
The hotel now offers 6 rooms and a roof top swimming pool. In addition the hotel is looking at obtaining three star classification from Sri Lanka Tourism. “We have already applied and inspections have been completed,” A. L. A. Subahan said.
He also said that they have six luxury rooms with all modern facilities and most of the equipment has been imported from Japan. “During the season we were overbooked and due to this we are now looking at adding six more economy rooms by next year,” he said.
Subahan said that they are also offering a special two hour Spa treatment as a part of the hotel package even for guests who check in on a bed and breakfast package and this is very popular.
In addition, the hotel also offers special Yoga classes for outside guests as well while Asami Morita conducts special Japanese Reiki healing therapy treatment for women.
He added that most of their guests are European and Japanese and also they have a very steady local outstation clientele who patronize the hotel. COZA Ceylon also arranges city tours, airport pick and drops and excursions to all over Sri Lanka.
The roof top pool area is also given out for corporate get-togethers and special private parties and could accommodate nearly 50 guests.
