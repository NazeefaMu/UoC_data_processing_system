When the Going Gets Tough...

Recently, I saw a friend for the first time in a couple of years. We caught up over tea at her place and talked a lot. During our conversation, I realized I was telling her the same kind of stories about my life as I had in a totally different period, four years ago. I had lived in a different place then, wrote to a magazine and not the newspapers, but the issues I faced were more or less identical.
My problems tend to revolve around a lack of direction. I’m passionate about my work, but writing and supporting the causes close to my heart doesn’t feel enough. No matter what I’m doing, the sense that I could be doing more, creeps back up.
In discussing this with some of my other friends, I learned I’m not alone. They might not struggle with an abstract problem like mine, but, they have problems too; financial difficulties, finding the perfect home, or a great partner. Apparently, we all have challenges in our lives that we could not overcome.
Of course, as all positive thinking gurus say, there’s no version of life in which we are not struggling with something daily. A productive, progressive life involves conquering the challenges the universe sends our way, and always being ready to embrace and learn from the next one.
It was Billy Ocean who immortalized the proverb, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going” through his song, in 1985. This may be true for some of us but, for others, hardship can be too much to overcome. When the going gets tough, we simply let our life fall apart. What is it exactly that separates those of us who thrive regardless of adversity and those of us who don’t? Is it genetics, luck, or pure willpower?
Consider that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison before he became the first democratically elected president in South Africa. Abraham Lincoln failed in business, had a nervous breakdown, and was defeated eight times in elections before becoming president. The opposite happened to Charles Manson. As a boy born to a teenage alcoholic and an absentee father, Mason found himself in trouble throughout his childhood, and grew up to be an American criminal.
Granted these examples are extreme, they yet demonstrate the different routes people may choose when facing major obstacles in their lives.
As Justin Harmon says in his article ‘How to Endure and Overcome the Worst of Life’s Hardships,’ “maybe your job doesn’t bring in the kind of money you need to do anything more than survive, so when you suffer a setback, you really struggle. You not only struggle with the financial issues, but you also struggle with your emotions. Not having the amount of money you need to live without the fear that comes along with being broke, is hard indeed”.
Harmon also says, you can be feeling great mentally and physically and able to perform at your best, but if you are struggling financially, there’s a good chance you’re causing more harm to your body with the stress, worry, and anger that comes along with it. This also plays a role in your personal life as well, doesn’t it?
When faced with difficulties like financial frustrations that affect ourselves and the personal relationships around us, Harmon suggests we are left with two options. One is change: we can change our circumstances to get out of our unwanted situation. It can be difficult to do this, especially when nothing but negativity surrounds us, but if we decide willingly to change your circumstances, we can. It’s just a matter of knowing how.
The second option is to force ourselves to change. It’s human nature to need to be constantly growing, evolving, and changing. So, if we were to learn the process a little better, we could really help ourselves when it comes to understanding how to endure and overcome the very worst of our life’s hardships. Knowing that there is a specific reason we are in a hardship will help us to learn how to get through it in a positive way vs. a negative one.
So what’s the process for being able to endure and overcome, you might ask? “Well, as you probably already know, no one process will work for everyone, just as there is (usually) no quick-fix solution for the various hardships that come into our lives. There are, however, certain ways we can choose to perceive the realities we are hit with”, he advises.
One thing we can do is change our perception. Perception is in the eye of the beholder, so if we are perceiving our life in a negative way, we are more than likely going to be dealing with all the emotions and thoughts that come from that perception. In other words, thinking negative thoughts—in any situation—is going to bring out negative emotions. This can get us stuck in a tailspin, and we will find it very difficult to get past emotions such as anger, sadness, and low self-esteem, which go along with negative perceptions.
This, however, doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t want to feel these negative emotions—they are a valuable part of progressing and moving forward in our life. The negative emotions are there so we can overcome them.
We can change our feelings of suffering when hardships hit into a new perspective on our life, which will allow us to endure when there is suffering, and overcome when it’s time by doing the following: Accepting. It is very important to accept what is, both in terms of the external reality and your internal reality, with thoughts, emotions, etc. Next is feeling. Allowing ourselves to feel, and also allowing ourselves to listen to what comes through while we are allowing our emotions to go through their natural process. The third is listening.When was the last time you truly sat down with no distractions, (cell phone,Facebook, e-mail, television, etc.) and listened? Take a moment each day to look inside yourself and hear what your higher consciousness has to say. Don’t think, don’t wonder—just listen.
After you’ve taken the time to sit back, reflect, and gain clarity on your current circumstances, it’s time to start moving forward. You can do this by finding inspiration in your life– Inspiration brings hope and desire, which also bring positivity. Once you have a positive attitude and desire inside you, it’s the perfect time to come up with an escape plan from your current situation. When you see the vision of where you want to be, you can start to fill in the details with a direction to start moving in.
Finally, if you really want to overcome your problems, not just endure, you need to start changing. Discover and pursue a life that brings progress and positive changes to your world. Surround yourself with people who care about you, want the best for you, and believe in you.
Remember, life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s learning to dance in the rain.
Next time it rains, come, let’s dance.

Tips to achieving a positive mindset
1.Start the day with positive affirmation.
How you start the morning sets the tone for the rest of the day. Have you ever woken up late, panicked, and then felt like nothing good happened the rest of the day? This is likely because you started out the day with a negative emotion. Instead of letting this dominate you, start your day with positive affirmations. Talk to yourself in the mirror, even if you feel silly, with statements like, “Today will be a good day” or “I’m going to be awesome today.” You’ll be amazed how much your day improves.
2. Focus on the good things, however small.
Almost invariably, you’re going to encounter obstacles throughout the day—there’s no such thing as a perfect day. When you encounter such a challenge, focus on the benefits, no matter how slight or unimportant they seem.
3.Find humor in bad situations.
Allow yourself to experience humour in even the darkest or most trying situations. Remind yourself that this situation will probably make for a good story later and try to crack a joke about it.
4.Turn failures into lessons.
You aren’t perfect. You’re going to make mistakes and experience failure in multiple contexts, at multiple jobs and with multiple people. Instead of focusing on how you failed, think about what you’re going to do next time.
5. Transform negative self-talk into positive self-talk.
For example, let, “I’m so bad at this” become “Once I get more practice, I’ll be way better at this”. “I shouldn’t have tried” should become “That didn’t work out as planned—maybe next time”.
6.Focus on the present.
Most sources of negativity stem from a memory of a recent event or the exaggerated imagination of a potential future event. Stay in the present moment.
