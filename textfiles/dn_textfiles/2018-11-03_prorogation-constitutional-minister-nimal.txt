Prorogation constitutional - Minister Nimal

President Maithripala Sirisena prorogued Parliament with the powers vested in him in the Constitution, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said President Sirisena has the powers to prorogue Parliament for two months, but Parliament was only prorogued for two weeks.
Minister Silva was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters, yesterday.
He added that President Sirisena had acted democratically.
“The President has acted in terms of the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, nobody can challenge the decision of the President. He exercised the powers of the Constitution to prorogue Parliament,” the Minister said.
“If the President has violated the Constitution, any citizen or political party can seek redress by way of fundamental rights petitions in the Courts,” he said. The SLFP Central Committee has endorsed the President’s action to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and pledged full support with a vote of appreciation been passed unanimously for the action taken by the President.
“Besides, it was decided to call a SLFP All Island Executive Committee meeting on November 8 and to convene the National Committee of all representatives before December 31. The President then highlighted the need of maintaining law and order in the country,” Minister Silva said.
“Everybody should respect law and order in the country and be dedicated to ensuring a peaceful atmosphere,” the Minister said.
He said that the SLFP has both Parliamentary power and the peoples’ power.
“As Finance Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa will forward a Vote on Account before he presents a budget after two months,” he said.
He added that the Speaker has accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country.
“Once all party representatives met the Speaker, we requested from him that all facilities and privileges accorded to the Prime Minister, be given to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as he was duly appointed in terms of the Constitution by the President.
Then the Speaker agreed to provide all the due facilities stating that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will be accommodated in the Prime Minister’s seat,” the Minister said. “According to Parliamentary norms and regulations, only a No-Confident Motion,brought before Parliament can remove that recognition,” he said.
When asked whether they have the support of the required number of Parliamentarians to get a majority, he added that a significant number of Parliamentarians will come forward to extend the support to them in due course.
Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the Government has decided to ease the burden of the people by reducing the prices of several commodities and fuel prices.
He said that the Prime Minister in his capacity as Finance Minister will forward a Vote on Account to Parliament instead of a budget.A Vote on Account is nothing new in the history of our Parliament they have been preseted in Parliamnent on a number of previous occasions.But, within a budget will be present to the House within three months.
Minister Samarasinghe added that only the President can prorogue Parliament and reconvene it. Before presenting a Vote on Account, the government took measures to reduce the prices of consumer items while cancelling the fuel price formula. People will receive more relief and benefits in future with the presentation of the Vote on Account.
Minister Samarasinghe said the government representatives have briefed the international community, including UN officials about the present political situation in the country. Besides, it has been planned to brief the financial institutions about the present situation.
“After briefing the international community, President Sirisena has taken all these political steps in accordance with the Constitution. Accordingly,the appointing of the new Prime Minister and prorogation of Parliament are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Further, two Gazette notifications will be issued relating to these two steps,” he said.
“But, if one wants to challenge those measures, there is provision to go to the Supreme Courts on the allegation of fundamental rights violations. Only the Supreme Court can give an interpretation on this. But in accordance with the Constitutional provisions, only the President can ask the Supreme Court for an interpretation,” he added.
