Froome faces public ‘trial’

Cholet, Monday: The roadside spectators who booed Chris Froome at the Tour de France presentation and those who cheered at the stage 1 finish line when he fell will have the perfect opportunity to target the champion on Monday’s team time-trial.
A leaked dope test signalling too much salbutamol last September -- but which anti-doping authorities WADA dismissed -- has made Froome a target as he and Team Sky in their white team shirts progress along the 21-day course. AFP
