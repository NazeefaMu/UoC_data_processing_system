Thera with two IDs arrested

Ven. Arambepola Rathanasara Thera who was sought in the case for threatening Myanmar refugees located in a UNHRC facility in Mount Lavinia was arrested by a special police team yesterday.
The suspect who was dodging the police for several weeks was taken in to custody along with two National Identity Cards in possession.
One of the two NICs was issued to Rathanasara Thera presenting him as a lay person and the other as a clergy. Accordingly, one NIC has been issued on December 9, 2011, which says Rathanasara Thera was born in 05.12.1992 and resided at 226, Purwaramaya Road, Kirulapone, Colombo 05. The other NIC says that the ID holder is Thennakoon Mudiyanselage Chamara Thennakoon, born on the same birth day, resided at Dhoowa Temple Road, Kaluthara South. This NIC has been issued in 05 July 2017.
A few days back, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara introduced two mobile phone numbers to the public through which the IGP could be directly contacted. A passenger has called one of these numbers (0718591902) and informed that Rathanasara Thera was traveling in a bus from Kandy to Colombo.
IGP Jayasundara has immediately deployed a special Police team to take Rathanasara Thera in to custody. Following preliminary questioning, Rathanasara Thera had confessed to having two NICs. The Police is investigating on certain incidents where Rathanasara Thera may have used the fake identity card.
The Police is also looking into the possibility of Rathanasara Thera getting passports allegedly using the fake ID and any involvement in crime using the said documents.
Police Media Spokesman Superintendent of Police, Attorney at Law Ruwan Gunasekara said the Colombo Crime Division will continue questioning the Rathanasara Thera with regards to who prepared the fake documents on behalf of the Thera.
The Thera was to be produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday.
