MR ought to have retired gracefully after two terms: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an obvious response to a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, said that Rajapaksa too could have retired from politics gracefully after two terms if he did not bring the 18th amendment to the constitution.
Rajapaksa had told a rally in Nugegoda on Friday that although he had intended to retire from politics after the defeat at the last Presidential election,he had reversed the decision due to the continuing harassment against his family members.
President J.R.Jayewardene introduced the Executive Presidential system of government to enable a President to hold office for two terms and retire from politics. After President Jayewardene, President D.B. Wijetunga retired after a single term. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also retired after holding office for two terms, he said.
The Prime Minister said this addressing an awareness programme attended by UNP activists in the Anuradhapura district at the Anuradhapura Youth Resort auditorium.
“Since former President Rajapaksa did not follow that tradition the opposition fielded a common candidate against him and the people defeated Rajapaksa and forced him into retirement,” the Prime Minister said.
All attempts by opponents of this government to disrupt the country’s economy by resorting to strikes, protest campaigns and various other threats will be defeated at all costs, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister said Rajapaksa and his joint opposition clique which pledged to take over the reins of government in January had reneged on that pledge and were now saying that they did not want to do it but would wait and watch.
They later deceived the people saying several ministers and MPs of the good governance government would turn up at their Nugegoda rally. Let alone ministers and MPs not even a pradeshiya sabha member supporting the government turned up at the rally, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
President Rajapaksa had ruined the economy dashing the hopes of the people who expected an economic recovery after ending the war. He had no cure for the country’s economic ills at all and the country has to repay the debt burden imposed by the Rajapaksa regime till 2026, he said.
The government had the tact and ability to restore the country’s sagging economy left over by the former regime, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the National Consensus government had two important duties to perform - one was ensure a good income to the people and the other to ensure a bright future for the young generation.
The Prime Minister said he has undertaken this responsibility as the Prime Minister of the National Unity Government and as the leader of the UNP.
The government is busy placing the economy on the correct track. Now it was ready to go forward by resolving the people’s burning problems, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government would set up industrial zones in other parts of the country as in Hambantota.
Youth from areas such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa would be able to seek employment in them. Steps would also be taken to set up an oil refinery and a Naval Dockyard in Hambantota, he said.
He said he did not know the earthly reason why Rajapaksa and his clique opposed these moves which would ensure a bright future for the people.
Giant development projects would be implemented in the Colombo City. The Port City project launched by the previous regime would be converted into a financial city. Giant industries would be launched in Wayamba too. A car assembly factory was opened in Kuliyapitiya. Another company had applied to start a car manufacturing plant in the country. When these projects come on line people would be able to purchase a vehicle at an easy price, the Prime Minister said.
The Eastern Coastal area would be developed as a Tourist Zone. Anuradhapura would be developed as the centre of the Cultural Triangle. The Moragahakanda Project had now been inaugurated. Thereafter the government would undertake the Malwathu Oya Project. Self - employment opportunities would also be made available at village level, he said.
The Prime Minister said he had not forgotten the torment UNP supporters underwent at the hands of the previous regime.
“They would be looked after in the future and their problems including those relating to political victimisation would be resolved in due course.” He said he had instructed the UNP General Secretary to give first preference to resolving problems of political victimisation relating to UNP supporters.
He said he had also instructed the UNP Chairman and General Secretary to reorganise the UNP into a powerful party so that anyone who tries to run riot and disrupt the country’s economic development and national unity will have to contend with a might of the UNP which would defeat such attempts with full force.
