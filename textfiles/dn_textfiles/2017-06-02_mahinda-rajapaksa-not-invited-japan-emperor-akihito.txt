Mahinda Rajapaksa not invited to Japan by Emperor Akihito

 
Despite reports to the contrary, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was not invited to visit Japan by Emperor Akihito, Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka and a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said.
Rajapaksa and a delegation of fourteen, including Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Lohan Ratwatte, left for Japan on Wednesday night, but neither the government of Japan nor the Emperor invited him.
According to the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rajapaksa was invited to participate in a function at the Muryoko-in Buddhist Temple in Koya, Wakayama by the Japan-Sri Lanka Buddhist Organization for International Cooperation.
Rajapaksa is scheduled to return to Colombo on June 10 aboard Sri Lankan Airlines flight UL 455.
