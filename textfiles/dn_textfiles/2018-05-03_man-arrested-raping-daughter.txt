Man arrested for raping daughter

A father who had raped and impregnated his 15-year-old daughter, was arrested by Kalpitiya Police on April 30. The arrest was made following a tip-off provided via an emergency line.
The girl had confessed to the police that she was abused her father on several occasions; most recently, during the local government elections, while her mother and brother were away from home. The victim had been directed for a medical examination, the Police told the Daily News.
About 34 sexual abuse cases related to children were reported to police and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) during the past six months from both, the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province, a senior police chief in Kurunegla told the Daily News yesterday.
