A hundred percent locally manufactured product, Diva Detergent Powder marketed by Hemas Manufacturing won the Silver Award for Product Brand of the Year at the Brand Excellence Awards Ceremony held by Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) recently, demonstrating that innovative marketing strategies coupled with empathy with the consumer bring positive results and recognition. The SLIM Brand Excellence Awards celebrate brand excellence at a national level and reward the outstanding efforts of marketers. The Awards endeavour to encourage best practices in branding and raise local brands to global standards enhancing the image of marketing in the country.

Diva was introduced to the market 14 years ago in 2003 with the objective of transforming the lives of consumers. Diva Detergent Powder has continued to introduce new fragrances with improved formulations that make washing clothes easier and quicker, leaving the washed clothes pleasantly fragrant. In addition, Diva consistently endeavours to make dreams come true for its consumers, especially by its long standing iconic ‘Idame Wasanawa’ consumer promotion.
