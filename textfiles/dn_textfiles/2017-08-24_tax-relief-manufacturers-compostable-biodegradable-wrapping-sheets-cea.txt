Tax relief for manufacturers of compostable, biodegradable wrapping sheets - CEA

With the ban on polythene to become effective on January 1, 2018, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) assured polythene manufacturers that a tax relief will be granted by the Government for those who start manufacturing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.
CEA, Deputy Director General, Eng. Upali Indraratne told Daily News Business said the ban will be strictly implemented from January 1, 2018 and requested the general public to use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which is the only solution to create an environmental-friendly society in the country.
According to CEA, the compostable sheets degrade within a period of three months unlike polythene which harms the environment
Deputy Director General Indraratne further said although the ban of using polythene was imposed long ago, most manufacturers were unable to comply with the Government’s decision due to various reasons. 
“Now the CEA has taken a firm decision to discuss with manufacturers about their grievances and help them to start manufacturing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets from 2018,” he said.
He said currently about six manufacturers in the country are producing compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and many manufacturers are exporting them.
“Our aim is to encourage all manufacturers to produce environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets.”
When asked about the purchasing of necessary machines that need to manufacture compostable and biodegradable sheets, he said the CEA will discuss with manufacturers about the problems they face.
Referring to a recent meeting conducted by the CEA at Gampaha Divisional Secretariat with the participation of polythene manufacturers, industrialists, sellers and hotel owners about the ban, Indraratne said Sri Lanka is the 48th country in the world to ban polythene products.
He said he informed participants that CEA is always ready to help them to produce environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable sheets.
CEA Waste Management Unit Director Ajith Weerasundara said using environmentally friendly compostable and biodegradable sheets is the only solution.
According to Director Weerasundara, over 1.5 million polythene lunch sheets and two million polythene bags are currently used by Sri Lankans every day and if we do not stop manufacturing them now, the country will face high environmental pollution after five years.
