‘Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa’ honours 40 alumni this year

The annual ‘Sri Jayawardenepura Pradeepa 2018’ to be held on October 17 at Water’s Edge, Battaramulla for the third time will be awarding 40 alumni who have contributed to mother Sri Lanka through various mediums of art. The award will be presented by President Maithripala Sirisena for the third consecutive year.
The Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa can be best regarded as acknowledgment of those worth of an age-old legacy. The history of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura can be dated to the inception of Vidyodaya Pirivena by Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera in 1873. While the Thera is remembered for his contribution for the independence struggle of Sri Lanka, he is often regarded as an unsung hero of the struggle to set up public education in the country.
While we are aware that he along with Rev. Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera rekindled the Pirivena tradition of the country, it is a little known fact that it was he who encouraged Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott to establish Ananda College and several other notable schools. Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott, upon reading the translation of the ‘Panadura Debate’ conducted by Rev. Migettuwatte Gunaananda Thero is said to have visited Sri Lanka. He paid a special visit to meet Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, who was a chief contributor of facts during the ‘Panadura Debate’.
As the intellectual bond between the two grew, Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera together with Rev. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera encouraged Colonel Sir Henry Steel Olcott to establish Ananda College. At the time, there were only four Buddhist schools in the country catering to 246 students, while there were 905 missionary schools catering to 78,086 students. With the establishment of Ananda College, there was a great revival of spirit that led to set up150 Sinhala Buddhist schools. The schools he helped establish; the Pirivena he established developed and supported the nation through education. He created a generation of well-versed scholars who would aid the nation in their future.
He dedicated his life to develop this nation and his example was followed by many such as Anagarika Dharmapala and the founder of Vidyodaya University known to us today as the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera.
Rev. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera was indeed a visionary; he made sure that his vision will continue by being a role model to many, and as mentioned, Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera took the initiative he began by developing Vidyodaya Pirivena to become Vidyodaya University in 1959, becoming the first University of the Independent Sri Lanka and the Second University of the country.
The Vidyodaya Pirivena was promptly shifted from Maligakanda to its present location, Gangodawila when it was decided to be given university status. The vision was to expand it to provide students with better opportunities and a host of new subjects. The land necessary for such expansion was donated by the Sunethra Devi Pirivena; a pirivena established by King Parakramabahu the Sixth of the Kotte Kingdom for his mother - Sunethra Devi. In essence, with the present glory of the university, we are still paying tribute to one of the most significant kingdoms of the country which brought about the golden era of Sinhala literature in those days of yore.
Though decades apart, the Vidyodaya Pirivena and the Vidyodaya University was set up with the unified vision of servicing the nation with an educated population. The Vidyodaya University was born out of the necessity to provide higher education in Sinhala, a gap that needed to be filled upon the passing of the Sinhala only Act in 1956. The concept of providing the university status to a pirivena was at times looked down upon, even laughed at by many, but Rev. Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera took upon the challenge and delivered effectively.
The pirivena he began with just seven students has become one of the largest universities in the country with seven faculties committed to the vision of its founders to produce young scholars who will develop the nation. The University of Sri Jayewardenepura has continued to expand over the years and is the only university that has been able to increase its intake by 500 students with each passing year.
Today the University takes a student centred approach in creating young intellectuals, thereby ensuring that the students are not only intelligent but are independent. The students of the university are given exposure and industry training to develop their soft skills and personality to befit the needs of the industry and the nation.
Having revisited the history of University of Sri Jayewardenepura and its present status, it is made evident that providing service to mother Sri Lanka is the legacy it has continuously kept true to.
‘The Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa’ acknowledges and awards individuals produced by the university who has continued to uphold this legacy by providing their services to Sri Lanka with the hope of developing it.
The ‘Sri Jayewardenepura Pradeepa’ is an annual event that awards alumni of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura who are working in different sects of the country. The selected alumni are awarded a miniature replica of the statue of Rev.
Welivitiye Sri Soratha Thera, which was established in the university premises in 2013 by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne. Prof. Ariyaratne, alumnus of the university and an eminent artist, will not be awarded at this event as he has graciously agreed to be among the panelist that chooses the alumni who best deserve this award for their remarkable service to their motherland.
While being unable to award, the university fondly pays tribute to the memories of the artists such as: Somaweera Senanayake, Simon Nawawattegama, Rev. Hiripitiye Pragnakeerthi and many others who were also once sons and daughters of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
