Abans success - now a case study at Harvard Business School

Aban Pestonjee, founder chairperson of Abans, was invited to be interviewed by Professor Geoffrey Jones, the faculty chair of Harvard Business School's Business History Initiative on the topic 'Creating Emerging Markets'. This is a singular honour not only for Pestonjee and Abans, but for Sri Lanka.
The Harvard Business School is the graduate business school of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, USA and is one of the world's most prestigious business schools from which global corporate leaders receive their MBAs and Doctorates.
The two-hour long video interview was a sit-down discussion between Professor Jones and Pestonjee and was conducted at the Sapphire Room of Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.
The full transcript of the interview will be kept in the archives of Harvard Business School's Baker Library and will become a part of the library's historical collection and the ‘Creating Emerging Markets’ website and will be available to students for research and case studies.
The interview which received comments of wide acclaim from those present at the recording covered many topics such as 'The process of innovation in business'; 'The acquisition of international technologies'; 'The role of family'; 'The issue of succession'; 'The recruitment of professional management'; 'Relationships with government, NGOs and international organizations'; 'Responsibility for society and natural environment' and the 'Challenges and opportunities of globalization including globalizing brands'.
The phenomenal success of Abans from a small retail shop selling used home appliances to the market leader in electronics and household appliances with 30 independent companies in diversified fields of business and services and a network of over 400 showrooms, dealers and service centers islandwide is a remarkable achievement.
Abans newest venture is the multi billion rupee Colombo City Centre, a mixed development project on Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Colombo 2, overlooking the picturesque Beira Lake. In keeping with its policy of always looking to introduce new technology to Sri Lanka, Abans has ventured into developing the first-ever lifestyle mall and mixed development project, the likes of which are hitherto found only in highly developed countries like Dubai, USA and Singapore.
The mall will feature attractions for tourists as well as locals who can come and spend an enjoyable day with their families.
Being an impressive piece of innovative architecture and engineering, the 48-storey lifestyle centre will feature a contemporary lifestyle retail mall, an upscale hotel operated by Next Hotels - the flagship brand of Silver Needle Hospitality and opulent apartment residencies.
The high-calibre retail mall will feature a range of global brands that will promise a never-before-seen shopping experience to Sri Lankans.
The centre will also feature a six-screen multiplex with the best movies throughout the day, an international food court and various unique entertainment and leisure activities that will provide a radical take on how Sri Lankan families and tourists could spend the whole day relaxing and enjoying.
