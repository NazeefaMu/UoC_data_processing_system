Parliament website indicates no PM since November 14

The official Parliament website has been updated to indicate that there is no Prime Minister in the country since November 14.
The website indicates that Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister from August 24, 2015 to October 26, 2018 and Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Prime Minister from October 26 to November 14.
Adding a special note under these details, the website provides the numbers of the Gazettes Extraordinary issued by President Maithripala Sirisena declaring the removal of Wickremesinghe from the position of Prime Minister and the appointment of Rajapaksa to replace him.
The end date of Rajapaksa holding office as Prime Minister has been updated in keeping with the Hansards of November 14 and 15. The Parliament website in its section of ‘Handbook of Parliament’ features all Prime Ministers who held office since 1947.
The Parliament website has been updated on the instructions of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Several UNP MPs previously brought to the attention of the Speaker that the Parliament website referred to Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister even after the passage of the No-Confidence Motion on November 14.
