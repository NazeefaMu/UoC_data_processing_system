Farmers reject paddy transplanting machines

The paddy transplanting machines sent to Hambantota for distribution among farmers will be sent back to the Department of Agriculture according to the Ridiyagama Ekabadda Govi Sanvidanaya in Ambalantota.
Sources at the Govi Sanvidana said the farmers requested for paddy transplanting machines with the gap of nine inches but the Department of Agriculture has sent paddy transplanting machines with a gap of eleven inches.
The sources said each paddy transplanting machine costs Rs. 600,000.
Taking into consideration the request of the Govi Sanvidana, Hambantota Agriculture Director G. H. C. A. Gunawarden made arrangements to return the paddy transplanting machines to the Department.
