Higher benefits for Security Forces

Members of the Security Forces will be offered higher benefits and dividends soon, according to a decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to look after their interests, recently.
These benefits and dividends would be provided to the security forces personnel after obtaining Cabinet approval, a release by the Presidential Secretariat said.
Accordingly, monthly salaries and other allowances paid to war heroes who died or were disabled in action in operational areas, will be extended to those who died or were disabled in action in non-operational areas as well. When the service pension of war heroes who have left the service due to disability is amended as 85 percent, they will be provided with the disability pension denied to them.
Another proposal is to restore the pension bonus to officers and other ranks who had retired or left after less than 10 to 12 years service after being disabled due to the war. The other benefit proposed is to restore membership in the pension scheme to members of volunteer forces who had retired or died without being able to state their preference to obtain membership in the widows and orphans pension fund.
Apart from this, the government after assuming office had taken steps to offer more benefits to security forces personnel.
These include the increase of the consolidated salary in five stages with effect from 01.01.2016, provision of the Rs. 15,000 allowance paid to executive grade public servants to senior security forces personnel above the Lieutenant Colonel rank and the provision of the Rs. 15,000 professional allowance to legal officers in the security service.
Similarly, members disabled in the war who had retired without monthly salaries and allowances after completing 5-12 and 20 to 22 years service due to less than 50 percent disability, have been given an opportunity to go before a medical board once again and those whose disability was above 20 percent had been given monthly salaries and allowances.
Approval had been granted since 5.1.2017 to pay them arrears of pay and allowances with effect from the date of retirement or leaving service. Rs 6.3 billion have been allocated for the payment of these arrears.
Steps have also been taken to restore service pension rights to officers and other ranks who had retired or left the service with less than 10 to 12 years service after being disabled due to the war. Approval has been given to pay their pensions from 11.11.2016 with effect from 17.12.2014.
Approval has also been given from 01.01.2017 to make the 85 percent pension paid to spouses of deceased war heroes and war heroes who had left the service on medical grounds due to disability in the war as 100 percent by paying them the balance 15 percent as the Ranaviru Care allowance until the death of the beneficiary.
Steps have also been taken to pay a bigger pension with effect from 01.07.2015 to the security forces personnel who retired before 01.01.2006 by amending their pension according to the 6/2006 (iv) salary code.
