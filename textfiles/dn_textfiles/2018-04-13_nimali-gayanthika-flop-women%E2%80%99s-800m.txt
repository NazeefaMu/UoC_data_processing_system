Nimali, Gayanthika  flop in women’s 800m

Two Sri Lankan women athletes Nimali Liyanaarachchi and Ganyanthika Abeyratne competing in heat number one and three were complete disappointments for Lankan fans here in Australia who made their way from faraway places of Australia to witness these athletes in action. None of them showed any impressive performances in the women’s 800 metres heats and failed to qualify for a place in the final.
Nimali and Gayanthika who have between them shared the national women’s 800 metres record could finish seventh and eighth respectively in their heats.
Gayanthika trailed behind the lead pack for the entire race and finished with a time of 2:04.72 which was far below her personal best of 2:02.55 which is the current national record for the event.
The winner of the heat Caster Semanya of South Africa who is a favourite for the gold clocked 1:59.26.
Nimali also suffered the same fate as her team mate failing to keep pace with the rest of the field and finished with a time of 2:08.52. Kenya’s Emily Cherotich Tuei won the heat with a time of 2:00.58.
In fact the two Lankans were unable to achieve their personal best during the heats which can be considered one of most disappointing performances. Gayanthika speaking after the event said that she was not satisfied with her own performance and noted that up to around the 600 meters mark she was keeping well but soon felt the heat as the other runners piled on the pressure.
She said that she would in future concentrate on running in the 200 metres for the forthcoming Asian Games.
Gymnastics
At the time of going to press Rhythmic gymnastics were in progress for the second day in Coomera Indoor Stadium. Sri Lanka’ only competitor for the this event Anna-Marie Ondaatje who did well last night to aggregate a total of 44.300 in the Individual All-Round Final is set to continue her best form during the ongoing events scheduled for the evening at the same venue.
