Court cases hampering Samurdhi officers’ pension issue – Minister

“If protest campaigns will help resolve the outstanding problems of Samrudhi officers, I will also join such protests,” Social Empowerment Minister P. Harrison said.
Addressing a meeting attended by Samurdhi officers at the Weligama Town Hall, Harrison said his ministry had held discussions with all parties concerned towards resolving the problems of Samurdhi officers.
The solution has been held up due to several legal issues before court, he said.
There are two cases pending in the courts regarding the employees’ problems. The Attorney General had told them to wait for the court rulings before taking a final decision on resolving the issues.
The minister said the problem confronting Samrudhi officers who have completed 20 to 23 years service was about their future.
“They were not entitled to pension benefits and did not receive a proper salary. Previous governments had made Samurdhi officers their political tools to achieve their ends without resolving their problems and their future aspirations.”
Harrison said only three months had passed since he took over the Social Empowerment Ministry.
He had held discussions with all relevant institutions including the Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry, Pensions Department and the Wages Commission and submitted five Cabinet papers regarding the issue because in his view, Samurdhi officers should receive priority over the issues of Samurdhi beneficiaries.
He would resolve these problems and ensure pension rights to Samurdhi officers before he relinquished office as the minister in charge of Samurdhi, he said.
