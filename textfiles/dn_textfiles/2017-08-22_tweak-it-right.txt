Tweak it right!

Tweaking your eyebrows the right way can make you look younger. Extra filling in your eyebrows can bring a huge transformation to your look.
Uneven brows: Create symmetry to find three main points -the start, the arch and the end of the eye brow. Use a micro-pencil liner to fill in the details between the middle of the brow and where they start to curve.
Patchy brows: For those with brows that have thick hair in some spots and less in some places, use a brow tint that matches your hair tone. This will help frame the eyes and slim the sides of the face.
Untouched brows: Never ever plucked, waxed, tamed or preened the brow? Then you need to first trim the hairs that go past the hairline. To make it fuller and give it structure, use a pencil.
