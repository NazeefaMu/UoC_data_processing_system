Ninewells Hospital celebrated ‘World Prematurity Day 2018’ recently; drawing attention to the importance of taking steps to reduce preterm births and caring for prematurely born babies In order to avoid future complications. The event which was held at the hospital premises was attended by families with Premature Babies, the Ninewells Hospital Board of Directors, Doctors, Nurses and other Staff Members.
Premature births are considered to be a serious health concern and is one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five around the world. Compared to babies born on time, prematurely born babies may face long-term health problems that affect their brain, lungs, hearing or vision if they do not receive proper care.
“A preterm birth is when babies are born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy and such a condition can have serious health implications on the child in the long run. Globally, preterm births are on the rise and therefore, the need to create awareness to avoid this condition and awareness about the importance of providing proper care to prematurely born babies to avoid future health complications is extremely vital,” said Dr. Nalin Gamaathige, Consultant Neonatal Paediatrician. “As a hospital that specialises in childcare, Ninewells Hospital is equipped with the best caregivers and facilities to ensure that prematurely born babies receive the optimal medical attention.
The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Hospital provides specialised care to prematurely born infants.The babies receiveoptimum care till they are out of danger and are ready to be reunited with their families,” said Dr. Vibash Wijeratne, Medical Director – Ninewells Hospital.
‘World Prematurity Day’ is a global movement which is celebrated in November to raise awareness on premature births and on avoiding itsdevastating impact on families.
Some common reasons for preterm birth include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and genetic influences. Often, however, no cause is identified.
