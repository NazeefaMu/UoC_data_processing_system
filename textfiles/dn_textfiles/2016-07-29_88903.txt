The awards ceremony will take place at the H M Weerasinghe grounds in Ampara at 5pm on August 7.

Organizers believe that this even will be a milestone in Sri Lankan motor acing history which will be the first step in conducting an APRC event in Sri Lanka. With the sucess of this skeleton event the second step will be a Candidate Rally which will be a crucial event to win APRC recognition. They hope that the third tier will be FIA sanctioned leg of the APRC. Running an APRC event here will be benificial to many sections of the local community, generating direct and indirect job opportunities while surely be a huge boost for tourism industry.
