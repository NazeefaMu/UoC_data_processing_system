Dennis Lillee the best fast bowler produced by Australia

Dennis Lillee had his Test debut in 1971 v England at Adelaide played in 70 Tests, took 355 wickets at an average of 23.92, best bowling figures were 7 for 83, he had 23 five-wicket and 7 ten-wicket hauls. According to Ian Botham, in his book “My Autobiography’, Lillee was the best fast bowler; he has ever played against, and credits him being a master craftsman and says he had everything.
He was the hardest working cricketer ever; his commitment to the cause was incredible. In Dennis Lillee’s book, “My Life in Cricket”, he states that during Australia’s tour of England in 1981, he had a period of personal tension and ran into trouble at Lord’s. He was desperate to get in some net practises with Allan Border and John Dyson, who had stayed down while the team went to play Northamptonshire. But Lillee has found in the past it was no easy matter getting facilities for practise at Lord’s. Several times before, he had been thwarted when he telephoned the ground and asked to use the nets. Some official told him that nets were not available, only to find out for himself later that he could have been fitted in quite easily recalls Lillee. When he phoned that time, he was put through to the room attendant who said there was a game in progress between Eaton and Harrow (the two top schools in England). The attendant has said that they would not be able to use the nets, but that they could change somewhere else in the ground.
He has also stated that there will be a bit of activity near the net area, but Lillee had said that they wanted to use the nets and will not get in the way, so the three of them went to the ground. They had contacted Jeff Thomson who was playing for Middlesex at that time to make arrangements to borrow some of his gear (theirs was with the team in Northampton) and he agreed that they could get some of his gear out of the Middlesex dressing room (the home team at Lord’s). They got some balls from the room attendant and some towels for a shower afterward’s and then they went to get Thomson’s gear, the boys using the room had told them, they were quite happy for them to use there dressing room, which they did. Lillee goes on to state that they duly had their net practises and by the time they had finished the Eton-Harrow game was over, and therefore Allan Border and he had run a few laps of the ground - to the accompaniment of some terrible jeering from the Eton-Harrow supporters still drinking and eating away up in the private boxes and in the grand stands.
Lillee recalls when Border and he arrived at the dressing room; they were confronted by Jack Baily the secretary of the MCC. He had kicked John Dyson out of the room, when he saw him said rather venomously, “What are you doing here?” Lillee has said ‘we have been practising’. ”Who said you could practice,” was the sharp retort. “Surely we are allowed to practice and determine ourselves when we do that” Lillee replied quietly. Bailey’s voice rose each time Lillee opened his mouth. This time ‘who said you could practice here?’ He shrugged, ‘nobody said we could practice here, but we thought we could come down here and if we could not practice, we could have a run around and do some exercises.’ His reply brought Lillee’s blood to the boil, ‘but you can’t do that without official consent.’
Lillee then through clenched teeth murmured, ‘I have a few things to say to you,’ and said to Bailey that he is sick and tired of going through those channels only to be told one thing and find out another.
‘We thought we would take the chance and come down here today - if there were no facilities we would have had a run and gone back to the hotel.’ By now, Lillee was nicely warming up to the occasion. ‘We got to practise somewhere,’ Lillee added, upon which Bailey repeated his edict about requiring official permission. ’That’s so much like you people,’ Lillee said and ‘you sit at your desk with your suit and tie on and try to control guys like us who are trying to get out and do something. In Australia, if your people wanted to practice before a Test, they would be treated like kings.
We always knew that the English people by and large are “Toffee nosed, till you get to know them well.” However, the Australians are friendly folks who greet you and treats you well.
Denis Lillee was a diehard fitness fanatic, who took everything front on, battled through several severe injuries and came up trumps, to become the great bowler he was.
