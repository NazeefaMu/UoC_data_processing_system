99X Technology clinches gold at NCE Export Awards

A testament to its pioneering efforts in the export of IT services, 99X Technology was awarded Gold in the Business and Professional Services category at the National Chamber of Exporters’ Export Awards 2017.
Through this annual assessment, the Chamber seeks to recognize Sri Lankan export entities that have excelled in export performance and have contributed to the national economy through foreign exchange earnings.
“As a forerunner in Sri Lanka’s IT industry, we strive to innovate and truly make a mark in the global marketplace with our software solutions that we now export to Europe, the US and Australasia.
To have our efforts recognized by an esteemed body such as the National Chamber of Exporters is immense encouragement and we hope to further enrich the country through greater export earnings in the years to come,” said 99X Technology Co-Founder and CEO Mano Sekaram.
This is the third consecutive year where 99X Technology has won Gold in this category, having previously been awarded Gold in 2012 and 2014. The National Chamber of Commerce too felicitated 99X Technology at its National Business Excellence Awards last year in recognition of its excellence in business and contributions towards the economic progress of the country.
NCE’s Export Awards follow a stringent evaluation process that consists of a multifaceted analysis of the company’s operations in addition to its export performance. The criteria include market expansion and product development, value addition, statutory compliances, effective management efforts, implementation of quality management and environment protection systems, market innovation and more.
