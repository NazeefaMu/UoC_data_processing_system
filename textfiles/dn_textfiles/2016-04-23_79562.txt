HERATH the quiet EXECUTIONER

There comes a time in a sportsman’s career where he must come to terms with the amount of punishment his ageing body can take and having reflected back on that decide what is the best course of action for him if he is to sustain his career a bit longer.
Rangana Herath, the best left-arm spinner produced by Sri Lanka and arguably one of the best in the world has done just that. At 38 he has decided that playing Test cricket is the best way for him if he is to serve his country for a further period. Different cricketers chose different formats to sustain their careers some give up Test cricket and concentrate on the shorter formats – 50 overs and 20-20 where there is less time spent on the field but the demands on the body is more and the pace is hectic.
Herath has found that his left-arm spin is best suited to the longer game of Test cricket where he has proved more useful to his country as a match-winner than in the other two formats. Incidentally he has the best figures in a Test by a left-arm bowler in history – 9 for 127 against Pakistan in August 2014. It is not that he has not bowled brilliantly in the shorter format (how can one forget his sensational spell of 5 for 3 against New Zealand in 2014 when he single-handedly spun Sri Lanka to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup which they went onto win) but his match-winning performances in Test cricket outweigh the other two and he has come to be identified as Sri Lanka’s main strike bowler in this format since the retirement of the legendary Muthiah Muralitharan in 2010.
Herath had said that he would take a call on his career at the end of the 2016 World T20 and it was no surprise that he has finally made this decision.
“There are about ten Tests lined up for this year and I’ve decided that I can manage myself and my knees playing in that format rather than the hustle and bustle of one-day cricket,” Herath told the ‘Daily News’.
About four years ago Herath had the cartilages of both knees cleaned up when he underwent arthroscopic surgery.
“It was fine for the first few years or so but with the extra work load of playing international cricket the pains to both knees started to come back especially when I am running,” said Herath.
“I have managed to continue playing by taping my knees. I was not 100 percent certain of being fit to play in all three formats, that’s why I decided to stick to Test cricket, a pace which I can manage my legs, I am lucky that I didn’t end up as a fast bowler because my career wouldn’t have lasted this long,” he said.
Herath made his Test debut at the age of 21 in 1999, but it was not until the retirement of Muralitharan that he found himself a permanent fixture in the national side.
“When I was dropped from the Test side I never gave up hope. I knew I had the skill to play for the national team and kept on performing at domestic level,” said Herath.
“The national selectors thought that I was good enough and persisted with me for virtually all the matches played by the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team. That gave me hope that one day I would be considered to play in the senior side.”
The turning point of Herath’s career came in 2009 in the home series against Pakistan when he received an SOS from Sri Lanka Cricket to join the team for the three-Test series when Muralitharan was ruled out with an injury.
Herath was then playing was playing in the Staffordshire League in England to maintain his bowling form as ‘A’ tours were few and far between. Herath ended up taking 15 wickets at 26.93 from three Tests and helped Sri Lanka win the series 2-0. His Test career was revived and he has not looked back since.
Herath said that he has not taken a decision on how long he intends playing Test cricket, but at his age he said that he would review his career series by series and see how fit he is to continue.
“I have not set any goals for myself. Whenever I have played for my country I have always wanted to see how best I could contribute to win. That has been my approach all the time. It would be a big achievement if I can get to 300 Test wickets but after that I don’t see any goals that I can pursue,” said Herath.
The spin wizard needs three wickets to achieve that milestone and it could come in the upcoming three-Test series in England. Only two Sri Lankan bowlers have reached that target so far Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and Chaminda Vaas (355).
Although Herath played in 71 ODIs and 17 T20Is he never played in a World Cup final until 2014 when Sri Lanka beat India to lift the World T20 title in Bangladesh. On two other occasions he played in the semi-finals helping his team enter the final, but was agonizingly left out of the most important game. One instance was the 2011 Cricket World Cup in India when he took one for 31 off nine overs against New Zealand and the other the 2012 World T20 in Sri Lanka where he returned his second best figures of 3/25 against Pakistan. Both matches took place at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Herath believes that Sri Lanka has plenty of good spinners around like Dilruwan Perera, Tharindu Kaushal, Sachitra Senanayake and Jeffrey Vandersay but they need to be given a consistent run in the national team. “That is how they will gain the confidence to bowl under pressure and under different conditions and situations and win matches for us.”
“You don’t need one bowler to run through the entire opposition. We still have quality fast bowlers and spinners who can take 20 wickets to win a Test match,” was how Herath surmised the national team in its current context.
Herath has not thought of what he would do once he hangs up his boots for the final time.
“I am still employed with Seylan Bank and have some years to serve with them,” said Herath who is presently their business promotions manager.
“I am lucky to have an employer like Seylan Bank who has never questioned my position even on occasions when I had not been part of the national team. I will certainly want to share my experience and help young spinners and contribute in whichever way I can.”
