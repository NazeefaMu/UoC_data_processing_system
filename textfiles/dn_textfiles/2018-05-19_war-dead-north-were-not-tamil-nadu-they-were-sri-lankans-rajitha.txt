War Dead in North were not from Tamil Nadu, they were Sri Lankans: Rajitha

Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne <U+200B>on Wednesday said the government would take a neutral stance with regard to commemoration activities in the North on May 18.
The following are excerpts of the discussion held at the Cabinet media briefing with regard to the government’s stance on letting the North mourn the dead.
Journalist: Minister, a Northern Provincial Council member has suggested that May 18 be declared as a day of mourning. What is the government’s stance on that?
Rajitha Senaratne (RS): We have no problem. All these years the JVP celebrated the deaths of their comrades ‘Viru samaruwa’ or something?
Journalist: But how can they say that it is a national day of mourning?
RS: The people died in the North were not from Tamil Nadu; they were our own people. Our children were killed and in the other side too, our children were killed. It was a civil war, not a foreign invasion.
Journalist: The LTTE was a terrorist organization. They have been proscribed thus.
RS: What was the JVP then? Was it not also proscribed as a terrorist organization? Though the people who were killed were terrorists to us, they were parents, children, siblings and spouses of those people.
Journalist: The government had declared National Ranawiru Day to commemorate My 18. And lamps were lit on behalf of fallen soldiers and we commemorate them. Now when the people of the North do this, what do we in the South do?
RS: Though we say we are commemorating our soldiers (heroes), what are we celebrating? Those killed were also our children. And that is why we are to bring about reconciliation.
Journalist: The soldiers killed terrorists.
RS: Were only terrorists killed during the war?
Journalist: Are you saying that other people were also killed?
RS: There is no war without casualties. Everyone knows that. In 1988, were only JVP rebels killed? Were not innocents killed then?
Journalist: The JVP is not like the LTTE. The LTTE is an international terrorist organization
RS: Could you please tell me the difference between what Prabhakaran and Wijeweera did? Tell me the difference in the atrocities they committed? Tell me which one was right and what was wrong?
Journalist: I would like to ask the military spokesperson, at a time when we have war crime allegations against the army, are you saying that the army killed civilians?
RS: No officer in the army will tell you that no civilian was killed during the war. No army in the world will tell you that. It is war.
Journalist; I want to ask the military spokesperson.
RS: Can you tell me whether there is any war in the world where civilians were not killed?
Journalist: Is it right that you say this when we have an international investigation against us?
RS: The investigation is against extra judicial killings and what I am saying is different. A war will have casualties.
Journalist: Military Spokesperson, do you accept the government’s stance?
Military Spokesperson: I don’t want to go into a confrontation here. I don’t think the Minister was implying anything against the armed forces and what I got from him was that during certain incidents in a war, casualties can happen.
RS: The war was fought against terrorism, not against the Tamils, please remember that. I have always maintained this stance.
Journalist: What I am saying is that when they commemorate their dead, does that not mean that they are commemorating the very people who killed our people in the South?
RS: That is exactly what the JVP does. The JVP says that in 1988 they had a genocide, similarly in the North, they say genocide happened. These are just different perspectives.
Journalist: The incumbent government stopped the celebration of ‘Victory Day’, they made that decision on principle saying that if we celebrate that, it would be like celebrating the deaths of thousands. But they are now having a day of mourning..?
RS: Who is they?
Journalist: The Northern Provincial Council. Will the government let them do that?
RS: They have not done much development work, so they keep passing these resolutions. They are not to be taken seriously. Like lowly politicians in the South, they use things to win some votes. Even the TNA has fallen out with the NPC Chief Minister.
When politicians go bankrupt, the weapons they take to hand are ‘race and religion’.
Journalist: They are saying that they are going to rename roads after fallen LTTE leaders?
RS: The TNA will not let that happen.
