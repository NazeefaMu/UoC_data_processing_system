A failed experiment

The new electoral system has deservedly drawn heavy flak from all political parties across the political divide. Even the pohottuwa which won a near landslide at the February 10 LG polls has started griping after some of the local councils won by it has had the tables turned. None other than President Maithripala Sirisena, during one of his regular meetings with editors and heads of media organisations, the other day, was critical of the new electoral system, particularly the monstrous increase in the number of local councillors (over 7,000) whose maintenance would place a heavy financial burden on the state, and called for an urgent revision of the system.
The latest to add his voice against the new electoral system is Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan in the wake of at least three local councils won by the TNA in the north being usurped by other parties through resort to subterfuge. He too has called for change in the system where justice will be done to the parties who won a majority.
Perhaps the worst to suffer has been the UNP which lost the coveted Galle Municipal Council, which it wrested control after a long period, after the SLFP lent its support to the pohottuwa, prompting Minister Vajira Abeywardena to call for a re-look at the new electoral system. The same was witnessed at Negombo where the UNP which won by a majority of over 6,000 votes was unseated by the same combination which prompted the UNP’s Mayor in waiting (until then) Royce Fernando to cry foul and declare that black money was at work.
Decidedly, the new electoral system was put in place without giving thought to its ultimate outcome. True, any experiment is bound to run into snags. But those responsible ought to have paid careful attention to all the nitty gritty, particularly as the matter concerns the franchise of the people. The end result has been utter chaos, with most of the local councils in an unworkable state.
If the new electoral system was intended to check acrimony and bloodletting during electioneering, in addition to halt the practice of money bags being thrown liberally, in the battle for the manapey it has signally failed to do so. On the contrary, it has gone onto exacerbate the situation, with unforeseen developments cropping up. Previously, if there was violence during the election campaigns, now this has shifted to within the walls of the councils. Television showed how violent fisticuffs broke out during the inaugural sessions of some of the hung councils. At the inaugural meeting of the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, won by the pohottuwa, there was a right royal free for all with damage caused windows and furniture of the building, necessitating police intervention.
It was the contention of the Joint Opposition that the chief reason for the non disposal of garbage and the rise in dengue was the delay in holding the LG elections by the government. However today the situation has even further deteriorated with garbage piles lying unattended, what with the ongoing clashes among councillors whose attention is only focused on retaining the power they won in the councils with the support of other parties.
As already mentioned, the new electoral system has not brought about the desired effect where vote buying is concerned. If this happened under the PR system it was in relation to bribing the voters. However now we have a situation where big money is passing hands between the elected councillors of different parties in order that one particular party secures the majority. Hence all the good intentions made to cleanse the electoral system and rid it of the sleaze prevalent under the PR system has come to naught.
On the other hand the new system has caused chaos and confusion. It is difficult for a person of average intelligence to fathom on what basis the seats are allocated vis-a-vis votes received, with the compulsory quota of women’s representation adding to the confusion. For instance, in the Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council, while the UNP won by a majority of 1,000 votes the seat allocation was equal (19) for the Greens and the pohottuwa with the mayoralty eventually going to the pohottuwa via some jiggery pokery. In Negombo even though the UNP won by over 6,000 votes, there was only a single seat difference in the allocation of placements in favour of the UNP which, needless to say, left ample room for manipulation. For the first time in the local government history in this country the public was treated to a comedy of sorts where the mayor or chairman of an MC or PS was decided by drawing lots under the supervision of the District Secretary. If that was not enough, violence broke out within the premises of the councils between rivals no sooner the victor was named, a development that is unprecedented.
Hence it is plain that the system is anomalous and needs overhauling. The President should take prompt action in this respect. The system should be done with before the next elections. The experiment has failed.
