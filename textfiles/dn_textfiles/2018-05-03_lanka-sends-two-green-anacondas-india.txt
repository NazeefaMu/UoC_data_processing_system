Lanka sends two green anacondas to India

The Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens welcomed a male and a female green anaconda from the Sri Lanka National Zoo on Sunday under the animal exchange programme after a gap of six years.
C Ravishankar, Director of the Mysuru Zoo, said, “The reptiles aged about four years were flown in from Sri Lanka to Bengaluru on the night of April 28 and reached their enclosure at the Mysuru Zoo in the early hours of April 29. They have been housed at the quarantine enclosure at the zoo.”
He said, “The length of the reptiles is about 6 to 8 feet and they weigh about 15 kilograms. Their condition is stable. They were transported under constant supervision from the zoo veterinarians and animal keepers. Five green anacondas were last received from the same zoo in 2011 and after an interim of six years, for the second time, we will be receiving six anacondas from the Sri Lankan zoo after obtaining approval from the Zoo Authority of India. Under the exchange programme, the Mysuru Zoo will be sending four black bucks and four nilgais to the Sri Lankan zoo,” said the director.
