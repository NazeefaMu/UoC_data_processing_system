Celebrating ‘National Selfie Day’

June 21st was National Selfies Day - a day celebrated since 2014. Selfies have become so popular that more and more inventions have been created to enhance the ability to take them, and more locations are being scouted by people looking for great places to take selfies.
There are few opinions about the origin of ‘Selfie Day’. According to Days of The Year in 2014, BBC officially declared June 21 a Selfie Day as part of their “Who do we think we are?” project. According to Holiday Calendar, it was started by DJ Rick McNeely from Fishbowl Radio Network in Arlington TX on June 21st 2014 as a way to get people to enjoy taking selfies of themselves and to do it in a creative way.
It’s also somewhat amusing to learn that the term “selfie” was reportedly coined by a drunk Australian on Flickr in 2004, a year after people starting taking pictures of themselves with their cell phone cameras and posting them on MySpace.
You’ve probably noticed that we’re right in the midst of the selfie movement. The selfie movement is a strange cultural phenomenon that involves holding your camera-equipped mobile device out in front of your face and snapping a photo of yourself so that it can be shared on social media.
People take selfies very seriously these days. But how do you take a good selfie the first time without wasting time trying to get one you’re finally happy with to post on Facebook or Instagram?
The answer to that doesn’t necessarily mean more makeup, bigger hair, or an entirely new face. Anyone can look great in a selfie, regardless of how they look in real life.
It might take some practice, but if you spend enough time looking at yourself on your camera screen and snapping photo after photo, you should learn how to take good selfies in no time. After all, selfie-taking isn’t rocket science.
