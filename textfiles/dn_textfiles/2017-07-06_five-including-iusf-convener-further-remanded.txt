Five including IUSF Convener further remanded

Five university undergraduates including IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekera were further remanded till July 19 by the Maligakanda Magistate court yesterday.
They were arrested on the charge of causing damages to government properties by forcibly entering the Ministry of Health premises.
Police informed court that eight more students who were allegedly involved in damaging state properties have been identified. Police together with State Counsel Janaka Bandara made submissions on behalf of the complainant.
They plead court to further remand the suspects as they can be kept in remand custody until the conclusion of the case under the Public Property Act.
