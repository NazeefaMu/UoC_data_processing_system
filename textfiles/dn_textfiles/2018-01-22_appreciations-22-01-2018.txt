Maruneekiar Thiruvathavoorar
She led a graceful life
I feel privileged and honoured to have been called upon to pay tribute to the memory of our dearly beloved cousin late Maruneekiar Thiruvathavoorar, who was affectionately called Manie akka. She passed away on June 10, 2017. I only hope I can do justice to the memory of this lovely lady who has touched our lives as either a family member, friend, colleague or beloved teacher, leaving loving memories of her in our hearts.
Maruneekiar Thiruvathavoorar was born on March 17, 1926, as the third child of Kathiravelu Sadayer Arulnandhy and Sakunthalaiamma.
She had a brilliant secondary school career; at the Senior Cambridge Examination, she came second in the Island. She proceeded to Annamalai University in South India to do her degree. She topped the batch at the Inter-Science Examination and was granted a full scholarship to complete her degree. Her subjects were Physics and Mathematics. Maruneekiar's proficiency in English was such that her English professor, impressed by one of her essays, had suggested she do an English Honours Degree, which Manie akka politely declined because physics and mathematics were her favourite subjects. She read physics and pure mathematics and obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree. In 1955, she obtained a Diploma in Education from the Colombo University.
Upon graduating, she joined Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, and taught there for a short period before joining Saiva Mangayar Kalagam, where she taught for 15 years until her premature retirement over the language issue. The Principal at that time was Nahamma Kasipillai, the eminent educationist. Her period at Kalagam was a happy period, as her colleagues were congenial and the students keen and respectful. She was not only elegant in attire, but also equally elegant in appearance. She would often observe that the saree had to be neatly draped and pinned so that she was free to concentrate on teaching the students without worrying about her attire.
In 1952, she married Thambipillai Thiruvatharoorar, a fellow student at Annamali University, but of the Arts Faculty. They were rarely apart. Her husband, after a short spell as a Land Development Officer, joined Walker Sons and Co. Ltd. and retired as Sales Manager in the Northern region. When her husband went to Australia on a scholarship, he took her with him and she stayed with friends during the period of their stay.
In all our moments of joy and sorrow, Manie akka was always the first to call and celebrate or mourn with us, as the circumstances required. I was always touched by her caring and reassuring words, when I was in need of them most. More than anything else, she was a loyal friend and reliable ally. She was a genius at making friends, was cultured, and always bright and cheerful. She was one of the most delightful companions, and I do not think she ever made an enemy.
She was deeply religious, but was ecumenical in perception and always accommodated all religions as one. I have never known her to have failed in her duties; whatever she did for her family, friends, and colleagues, whether they were in the right or wrong, it was always with the best intentions. Her word was her honour and her promises were her bond. In short, as a woman, she was endowed with a warm, genial, benevolent, and magnanimous disposition. Her compassion and kindness knew no bounds. She was completely free of pettiness in her attitude to others. These were the sterling qualities which endeared her to all those who had the good fortune to know her.
Manie akka was always a cheerful, loving, sharing and giving person. Her house was always open for those who needed tender loving care. She was a foster mother for so many of her nieces, nephews, and other relatives. Manie akka’s heart was always at home; thus, she possessed unshakeable love, devotion, and care for her husband and her brothers and sisters, and gave her family the utmost of her nurturing care. She was a tower of strength to her husband, Thiruaththan; sisters, brothers, all family members, and relatives, who always looked up to her for help and support in times of trials and tribulations.
Maruneekiar Thiruvathavoorar had, in some way or other, touched the lives of many of us and left us with precious memories of her that we would always treasure in different ways, as we offer our thanks to the good Lord in prayer for the gift of this lovely lady who inspired many, and lived as a true human being in life and spirit.
I carry with me the fond and pleasant memories of the late Manuneekiar Thiruvathavoorar, a simple and humane person who was not only trusted, loved, and highly-respected by her friends, relations, and by all communities, but was also held in the highest esteem by them. The passing of late Maruneekiar removed from our midst, one of the most popular relations.
She will be always remembered with devotion, love, and respect by all of us who have been fortunate to have known her. Many will miss her, and many more will mourn her demise. She is worthy of remembrance for generations to come.
My wife, my siblings and their families, and I share these heartfelt sentiments with Chithra akka, Thevi akka, and all those dear and near to them, with a sense of love, affection, and gratitude for having known her family and having been greatly impacted by every member of it.
May her soul rest in peace!

Jith de Fonseka
He was a loving husband
When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth, you are weeping for that which has been your delight. - Kahlil Gibran
I wish to thank the Almighty God for his grace that is upon me to pen these thoughts about my late husband, Jith de Fonseka. Even though I am not a writer, it was in my heart to honour him, as it has been four years since he went to be with Jesus.
I never thought it would be possible for Suranjith, Sarita, and I to get through the journey of life without Jith. We were a closely-knit family and had lots of great times together. Jith was an amazing husband who always chose to do his best for the family.
Spending quality time with each of us was top- priority to him. I can hardly remember a “no” to any request that the three of us made. He would go out of his way to do anything to make us happy. We truly miss the times the four of us had together; we would laugh and joke together amidst the busyness of life or make it a point to have at least dinner as a family, pray together every day, sneak in a holiday just so we could enjoy one another’s company while getting some rest or have family-night about once every few weeks—all because we believed and still believe in family. What we miss the most is the time the four of us used to have when we got into one big bed and had close, intimate chats about anything and everything.
Jith also had very sincere qualities when it came to his friends. He would never forget even the smallest thing anyone had done for him, even in the years gone by. He was simple and a person without guile. He was no respecter of persons and treated the most affluent person the same way he would the poorest of the poor. I truly admire these amazing qualities he had, as they were rare and have taught us much as a family.
He had the highest regard for his parents who were unique and wonderful people.
Jith’s faith in God was simple, yet profound. As a family, we came to realise this even more during the time of his last illness. He had such simple, child-like faith and trusted the Lord Jesus with regard to everything. Even when faced with impossible situations, he believed that God’s plan and purpose for his life would prevail.
There was not a trace of doubt or fear, and he rested in knowing that he was a child of God who was absolutely loved by him. There is so much that the three of us have learnt from him and are so grateful to him. He was truly a special human being and we are so thankful to God for ordaining us to be a family. We treasure the years the Lord gave us together, as they are priceless and will never be forgotten.
Jith’s motto was always “…as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Joshua 24:15) and we will pass on this legacy to the next generation and the generations to come.

Patrick Samaranayake
Silent social worker
Death came to Patrick Samaranayake quite suddenly. He hailed from a distinguished family and was the son of W. H. Samaranayake of Loretto, Polgahawela. His father, W. H. Samaranayake, was the author of Practical English, and was an ex-Principal of St. Bernadette's College, Polgahawela.
Patrick Samaranayake was loved and admired by all. He was a silent social worker, and his devotion to duty was unique. He was calm and collected in manner, and was a staunch member of the Roman Catholic Church.
Men of the stamp, mettle, and genius of Patrick are indeed rare as the sandalwood trees that adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka. Patrick has now gone to his eternal rest; may he reap in the heavens of gladness, the fruits of a holy past, and may his generation follow in his noble footsteps.
May he be born again among us and may God Almighty grant him eternal rest.
I do wish that this humble and sincere tribute of mine to a brilliant pupil, catches the eyes of his wife and children, to whim I, along with my wife and child, extend our deepest sympathies. He leaves behind three brothers and a sister. His death anniversary falls in January, 2018. A beautiful life, full of kindly deeds, a helping hand to those in need; unselfish, loving, and kind are the memories left behind by him.
May his virtues hasten his journey to heaven.

Jinadasa Hettiarachchi
An exemplary individual
Jinadasa Hettiarachchi of Galahitiyawa, was a dedicated and conscientious social worker in the Gampaha district. He was a leader to many voluntary organizations in the Genemulla area and spent his energy and resources for the benefit of his fellow men.
He voluntarily donated a portion of his paddy land to build access roads to a number of houses which were not served by any other road.
Hettiarachchi (Jine to his friends), was a product of Galahitiyawa Central College. During his school career, he excelled in academic studies, as well as extra-curricular activities.
He was the first student of the college to pass the Gandharva Sabha examinations and perform the full ves regalia and demonstrate his dancing skills to the public.
After his college career, he joined the Cooperative Development Department, and served in remote areas in the North Central Province and the Puttalam district, rising in executive positions. After retiring from public service, he devoted his time to social services in and around his home area. He was the Chief Dayaka of the Sugatha Subhadraramaya of Galahitiyawa.
Hettiarachchi was a patron and active member of the Past Pupils’ Association (PPA) of the Galahitiyawa Central College up to his last days. His contribution and guidance in the school's development activities were highly appreciated by his colleagues and the PPA members.
He was a good friend, and even in his last days, he had not forgotten to call his colleagues.
With his demise, we have lost a genuine and sincere friend, as well as an exemplary human being.
May he attain Nibbana!

Noeline De Silva
Teacher par excellence
Noeline started her teaching career at St. Anthony's College, Wattala. Later, she entered the Maharagama Teachers' Training College and did the special English course. After passing out, she taught at various schools such as Ruwanwella Central; Vijaya College, Matale; Gonsalves MV, Pamunugama; and later, got a transfer to her hometown Mabola, Wattala, where she taught at St. Mary's MV until her retirement. Wherever she taught, her main aim was to give a sound and basic English education to the underprivileged children of the area. She often conducted English classes free-of-charge and always stressed the importance of English. She was also involved in various religious and social activities organized by the Mabole parish, and did a silent service to uplift the underprivileged people of the area. She was also an active member of the Legion of Mary and an energetic Sunday school teacher.
After her retirement, she joined the staff of Aquinas College of Higher Studies, Colombo 8 and served for over 10 years as a senior lecturer in the English Diploma course. Noeline was Ever-ready to help anyone in any emergency or illness. Always smiling, caring, and empathetic, her simple ways and faith in God was an example to us. Her illness two years prior to her passing on November 2, 2017, was a great shock to many of us. She was handicapped during this period, and the attention and tender care rendered to her by her loved ones was admirable.
May all the merit you accrued during your lifetime, help you to attain the eternal bliss of God's heavenly kingdom. May your gentle soul rest in the peace of the Lord.
C. S. M. de Silva
