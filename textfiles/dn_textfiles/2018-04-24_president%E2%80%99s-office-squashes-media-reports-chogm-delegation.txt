The President’s Media Division (PMD) yesterday rejected various false information being reported regarding the official delegation accompanying President Maithripala Sirisena to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London.
The PMD states that the President was accompanied by the President’s wife, the President’s official doctor, Minister Tilak Marapana and his wife, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva,a Language Interpreter and two Foreign Affairs Ministry officials.
Moreover, the print and electronic media personnel of the President’s Media Division and journalists representing private media institutions and a few officers of the President’s Security Division, who do not belong to the official delegation participated in this tour.
Other than that, no person was included in the delegation under the expense of the Presidential Secretariat or attended the CHOGM or any meeting held simultaneously.
It was announced that, Industries and Trade Minister Rishard Badurdeen and Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera attended the Business Forum and that it is informed that the Presidential Secretariat has not met expenses for any of the parties who attended the Business Forum. “Thus, we reject certain media reports that alleged that over 100 delegates accompanied the President on this tour,” the statement added.
