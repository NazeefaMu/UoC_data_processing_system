Lanka take on Afghanistan in crucial semi-final

Whether Sri Lanka will qualify for the South Asian Football Championship final or not is the question every football fan in Sri Lanka will be anxiously waiting for when our lads take on Afghanistan in the crucial semi-final today at 6.30 pm local time. If Sri Lanka can pull off a win over Afghanistan, the island nation will qualify for a South Asian Football final after 20 years.
In 2009 Sri Lanka reached the semis and had to taste a defeat at the hands of Maldives. Sri Lanka did not perform well in recent times, but with the present team’s performance has become the talking point among the regional football fraternity.
Afghanistan is ranked 150 and Sri Lanka ranked behind them at 194 in the world rankings. From 2003 the two countries have met on seven occasions and Afghanistan has won five times while Sri Lanka has secured victory only once. One match was drawn.
According to Afghanistan coach Peter Segt, even though he is aware of most of the South Asian teams, he is lacking in knowledge of the Sri Lankan team which includes many young players.
Sri Lanka coach Sampath Perera said that Sri Lanka has been tested in the counter attack strategy and proved good at it. “We hope to follow the same method in the semi-final against Afghanistan,” said Perera. “We will follow a new technique by using two attackers with a one not being exposed directly. Captain Roshan Nalaka will not play in the first segment but will be used during the middle of the game,” he said.
The Sri Lanka team includes nine under-23 players and the inclusion of Sujan Perera who is a professional player in Maldives has strengthened the local side. Goalkeeper Sujan won the Man of the Match award in the game against India, even though Sri Lanka lost. The Afghanistan side includes many professional players and they have won all three group matches and scored 11 goals. Sri Lanka won against Nepal but lost to India in the group matches. The other semi-final is between India and Maldives kick off at 3.30pm local time.
