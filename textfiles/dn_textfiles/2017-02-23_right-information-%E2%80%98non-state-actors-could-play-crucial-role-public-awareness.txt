Right to Information: ‘Non-state actors could play crucial role in public awareness’

Non-state actors could play crucial roles in educating and advising the public, requesting information, and monitoring the government’s sharing of information,Co-Convener of India’s National Campaign for People’s Right to Information Venkatesh Nayak said.
He was delivering the keynote address at a lecture entitled “Making the Right to Information a Reality in Sri Lanka: The Role of Non-State Actors,”to share information on how civil society and NGOs can aid both the government and citizenry in implementing the RTI Act.
The lecture was held at the BMICH yesterday.
“Non-state actors can educate the citizenry by holding information fairs, putting on skits, writing songs, especially popular Bollywood songs, and developing pamphlets,” Nayak said.
“They can also do sample surveys, case studies, and pattern analyses to see exactly how people are using the RTI.
Governments take recommendations for improvement seriously,” he said.
Nayak mentioned that once people encounter obstacles in their pursuit of information, many give up for lack of knowledge of the system. To counter this problem, NGOs can set up RTI clinics and provide RTI experts who have experience in obtaining information.
Along with advising the public on how to go about requesting information, non-state actors can also guide the government’s rollout of the RTI Act.
“Task Forces with civil society representatives have advised governments throughout South Asia. In India, the government respected civil society instructions because it knew the RTI movement was grassroots. And in Bangladesh, district advisory committees are coming up,” he said.
“Government and civil society can and should work together for the sake of strengthening RTI.”
