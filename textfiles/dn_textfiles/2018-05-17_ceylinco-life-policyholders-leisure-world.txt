Ceylinco Life policyholders at Leisure World

The precincts of Leisure World reverberated to the sounds of unbridled fun and frolic recently when thousands of Ceylinco Life policyholder families from every district of the country descended on the theme park to celebrate the first phase of the life insurance leader’s Family Savari mega promotion.
Four thousand people won a day’s outing with access to the park’s rides, slides and chutes, meals, and transport to and from the location at the 11th edition of this annual event - easily the largest interactive customer promotion in the local life insurance market.
This was the largest gathering of policyholders since the inception of Family Savari. Adding to the excitement was the presentation of five aerial sightseeing tours by helicopter for five families selected at a draw at the location, and won by Ceylinco Life policyholders from Battaramulla, Maharagama, Pelmadulla, Kurunegala and Ratnapura.
Families from distant areas were also provided accommodation, ensuring their fun day at Leisure World was unhindered by any circumstance.
This first phase of Family Savari for 2018 will be followed by an all expenses paid holiday in Rome for 20 people from five policyholder families, a holiday in China for 10 policyholders and their families, and in Singapore for another 50 policyholder families. In all,Family Savari 11 will benefit 4,260 people from 1,065 policyholder families, an increase of 2,000 over the 2,260 rewarded annually at previous Family Savari promotions.
The Ceylinco Life Family Savari promotion has as its Brand Ambassadors the Sri Lankan actors Sriyantha Mendis, Sanjeewani Weerasinghe and Roshan Ranawana and his wife Kushlani who participate in the Savari outings and overseas tours.Over the past five years, Ceylinco Life has presented winners of the grand prize at the Family Savari with holidays in Paris (2013), Japan (2014), Switzerland (2015) Germany (2016) and UK (2017). In all, nearly 24,000 people have won overseas holidays or an excursion to the Leisure World theme park under this programme to date.Policyholders eagerly await the announcement of the new destination every year, when the promotion begins in August or September and concludes with the overseas tours the following year.
All active long term Ceylinco Life policyholders, holders of Ceylinco Life Retirement Plans and new policyholders who purchase a policy, pay three months’ premium and keep their policies active are eligible to win these holidays. Depending on the size of their policies or the balances in their Retirement Plans, some policyholders are eligible to qualify for the draws for all four categories of prizes.
