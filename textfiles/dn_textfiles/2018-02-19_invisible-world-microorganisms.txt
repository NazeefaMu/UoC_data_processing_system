Invisible world of microorganisms

Microbes are tiny little creatures that are not visible to naked eye. They should be observed with the help of a microscope. Microorganisms can belong to different categories. They are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae and viruses.
Natural decomposers
Microorganisms are the natural decomposers. These decomposers include bacteria, fungi and Actinomycetes. They are the creatures who degrade the complicated organic substances into simple inorganic substances, releasing energy and nutrients hence facilitating plants to uptake the nutrients and involving in nutrient recycling in the environment. Certain steps in major biogeochemical cycle such as Nitrogen cycle, Sulphur cycle and Carbon cycle involve several types of microorganisms. Some examples are Rhizobium involving in nitrogen fixation, Nitrosomonas involving in nitrification process, Thiobacillus and Green sulphur bacteria involving in sulphur oxidation process and etc. In Carbon cycle microbes mainly act as decomposers, helping to decompose dead plant and animal material.
Bioleaching
The next important activity done by them is the Bioleaching. It is the process described as the dissolution of metals from their mineral source by certain naturally occurring microorganisms or the use of microorganisms to transform elements so that the elements can be extracted from original sample. Fe and Cu are such two metals that are extracted from bioleaching procedure. If we take the use of chemical and physical methods, lot of gases and harmful chemical substances will be released to the environment, causing environmental pollution. But by using the microorganisms and providing suitable conditions to them we are able to leach out the element we need without causing much environmental impacts.
Bio insecticides and fertilizers
The exposure of economically important plants to various pests and insect attacks is a critical problem faced by the field of Agriculture. In mass cultivation, lot of economical disadvantages will be caused due to this. Thus the use of insecticides is increasing. One of the major problems when using these chemicals is that the insects create a resistance within them by exposure to such chemicals. To overcome this issue bio insecticides are now being used. These bio insecticides contain live bacteria that produce toxins which cause stomach poison in the insect and kill them. Those are not poisonous for the plants and microorganisms are used to supply nutrients to the plants as well. These are named as bio fertilizers. They produce essential nutrients like nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate. These bio fertilizers are beneficial over chemical fertilizers, because chemicals decrease the quality of soil and create health issues in humans as well as animals. The use of bio control agents and bio fertilizers which are composed of microorganisms is much effective in agriculture.
Purifying wastewater
Another use of microorganisms is to treat the wastewater. There in the secondary treatment microorganisms are added and they are allowed to grow. They use the organic matter and decompose them.
Then the water can be separated from the deposited matter.
Bioremediation is another important process when talking about microorganisms. It means use of biological organisms to solve an environmental problem such as contaminated soil or groundwater. Contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other petroleum products. If we see how it works, some types of microbes are capable of eating and digesting those contaminants.
They usually change those contaminants into small amount of water and gases like carbon dioxide, hence cleaning the environment from pollution. These bioremediation relies on microbes that live naturally in soil and groundwater. And they create no threat to human. So bioremediation process is safer process to make use of to clean contaminants from environment.
Microorganisms for a healthy life
Field of Medicine also incorporates the use of microorganisms very much. The vaccines we use for various diseases are made of microbes that are dead or inactivated, so that they are unable to cause the disease. The antigen in the vaccine is the same as the antigen on the surface of the disease causing organism. The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies against the antigen in the vaccine. When the vaccinated person then comes into contact with disease causing microbe, the immune system remembers the antibodies and make them faster. So the person is protected. And also certain antibiotics like penicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin are extracted from microorganisms. These antibiotics either help to prevent microbe cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis and hence protecting the person against infections. And also microbes are used in the field of recombinant technology to make various proteins. Human growth hormone and insulin are such two hormones produced using recombinant microorganisms.
Some microorganisms keep us healthy. Those microorganisms are in large numbers inside our body and they stop the development of disease causing organisms. One example is our gut microbial population. And now there are commercially available products named as probiotics. These are the supplements made of beneficial friendly lactic acid bacteria formulated to reflect composition of healthy gut microorganisms. These help to increased tolerance to infections, control diarrhea and etc.
Microorganisms are also used in the field of food and beverages such as wine industry, beer industry, edible microorganisms and etc. For the production of wine grapes are used and grape pulp is kept for fermentation. The yeast used for the fermentation grows a film on the fruit or in the environment. And also some cultivated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeare added in order to improve the quality of our wine product. Beer is also an alcoholic beverage made from fermentation of starch sources such as rice. And the process includes the microorganisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Saccharomyces uvarum. Brandy and whiskey are some other beverages produced from fermentation activity of microorganisms. Fermented milk and dairy products also make the use of microbial activity. This fermentation is done by the lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus are some lactic acid bacterial groups. Lactic acid bacteria ferments the carbohydrates such as lactose in milk into lactic acid. Because of this lactic acid proteins are precipitated and it gives a thicker consistency to our dairy product. Microbes are also taken as food supplements such as single celled proteins. These are dried cells of microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and fungi. Spirulinais one such example for those food supplements.
Microorganisms are tiny organisms. Apart from above mentioned activities they may possess many more uses. It is true that certain types cause diseases. But we cannot neglect microbes as disease causing organisms because without them much of ecosystem and human activities will be interrupted.
