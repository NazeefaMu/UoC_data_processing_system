Domestic kasippu breweries raided

In a joint operation, officials of Galle Excise station and Hiyare Police Special Task Force camp in Galle raided two households where kasippu breweries were allegedly functioning and arrested three suspects together with a stock of kasippu. The spirits were packed in hand luggage similar in appearance to school bags.
The two households are located near a school in the Akmeemana electorate in Galle. The officers detected that one brewery was positioned on part of the roof of one house, while the other was in the kitchen of the next house.
The officers seized 32,250ml of kasippu and 340,000ml of goda in four barrels together with copper wires, gas cookers and quantities of ammonia and yeast. The items taken into the officers’ custody were worth about Rs.100,000, they said.
The operation was launched by a group of Excise Inspectors led by Galle Excise Station OIC Chief Excise Inspector Deera Gunasekara and a group of officers of the Hiyare STF camp led by its Commander IP M.A.B.A. Bandara. The mission was planned on information received by Excise Commissioner General R. Semasinghe by way of public petitions.
