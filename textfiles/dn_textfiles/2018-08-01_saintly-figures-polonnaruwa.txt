Saintly figures  from Polonnaruwa

Sabtha Swaras in Indian classical music means seven Swaras. Similarly, Sabtha Lokhas means seven worlds. Sabtha Thandava of Lord Siva is depicted in seven different Thandavas. In Hinduism, the seven Rishis are called Sabtha Rishis. These Sabtha Rishis could be still seen among the stars. Similarly, in Hinduism, the seventh day after the full moon day and seventh day after the dark full moon day are called Sabthami.
Sabtham in Bharatha Natyam item based on seven counts in the thala scale. It is based on Misrachaapu thala. Basically, Misrachaaputhala is founded on seven thala counts. Due to that, the dance item based on seven thala counts in the classical Bharatha Natyam repertoire is generally referred to as Sabtham.
Stone slabs
During the Polonnaruwa period, in Sri Lanka, the seven Maathas (seven mothers) figures were carved in three different stone slabs. All these different seven Maathas are collectively called Sabtha Maathas. Today these excellent ancient carved figures are seen at the National Museum of Colombo under the title of Sabtha Maathas. The same category of Sabtha Maathas (seven mothers) sculptural friezes is also seen at the Indian archaeological sites and numerous Sivan temples in South India.
The Polonnaruwa period Sabtha Maatha stone friezes were discovered from the ruins of the 5th Sivan temple of Polonnaruwa. All the Sabtha Maatha figures are based on Hinduism and depicted with four arms. They are depicted in a seated position.
According to Hindu mythology, the seven Maathas are named Brahmi, Maheswari, Vaishnavi, Varaahi, Kaumaari Indraani and Chaamundi. According to certain Hindu legends Goddess Brahmi originated from Lord Brahma, Goddess Vaishnavi Maatha originated from Lord Vishnu and Goddrss Maheswari originated from Lord Siva. Another Hindu legend states, that the Goddess Brahmi is the consort of Lord Brahma (the God of creation).
Four faces
In Tamil, Lord Brahma is often referred to as Naanmuhan, because it reveals that Lord Brahma is always depicted with four faces. Naanmuhan means the God with four faces. Among these Sabtha Maatha stone friezes, Goddess Brahmi is depicted with three faces. The cause must be that the sculptor who carved this figure was not in a position to carve the fourth face. It is assumed that the backside of the image is blocked and covered with the stone slab. This must be one of the causes that the Goddess Brahmi figure was carved with three faces. The symbols depicted in the hands are not clearly or easily seen.
According to Hinduism, Lord Vishnu is the God of protection and his consort is Goddess Vaishnavi. Lord Siva is often referred to as Lord Maheswaran. Lord Siva is the God of destruction. Goddess Maheswari is considered as the consort of Lord Maheswaran. Among the Sabtha Maatha stone frizzes, the carved figure of Goddess Maheswari is unique in nature. The head of this figure is adorned with a crafted headgear. Except for Goddess Maheswari, all other figures are seen wearing plain head gears. Goddess Maheswari’s lower right arm is holding Thirichul, the upper right arm is holding Udukku (Uddeki or Damaru), and the down left hand is resting on the thigh. The left upper hand is holding Paasa cord which symbolizes worldly illusions, desires and attachment. The costume patterns and ornamental decorations are not seen clearly.
Among the other seven Maathas, Kaumarai is said to have been originated from Lord Skanda. Varaahi is another Maatha among the group of Sabtha Maathas. Varaahiis assumed as the consort of Varaaha incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Among the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, in the Varaaha Avathara, Lord Vishnu appeared with a boar face and protected the earth from destruction. Goddess Varaahi is also depicted with boar face.
Divine origins
Indran's consort Indrani is also considered as one of the seven Maathas. Chaamundi is considered as one of the divine origins of the Sabtha Maathas.
These three stone friezes belong to the in-between the period of 10th to 13th century A.D. All the Sabtha Maathas figures are carved on a horizontal level with the same size.
There are no differences in the sizes of the seven figures. The word hastha in Sanskrit means hand gesture.
Silpa Sastra describes 32 varieties of sculptural hastas (hands). Yet Abaya hastha, Varadahastha and Vitarka hastha are commonly seen in these seven carved figures. Abaya Hastha depicts the protection hand, Varadahastha depicts the blessings hands (facing the palm down) and Vitarkahastha depicts the preaching hand. The Sri Lankan Archaeological carved Sabtha Matha figures are unique in nature and closely linked to the Sabtha Maatha carved figures of contemporary Chola period of India.
