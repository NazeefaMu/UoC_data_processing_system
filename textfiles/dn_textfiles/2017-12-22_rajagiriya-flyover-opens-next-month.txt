Rajagiriya Flyover opens next month

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the Rajagiriya Flyover will be opened by President Maithripala Sirisena in Januray 2018.
The Prime Minister was speaking during an inspection tour of the Rajagiriya Flyover which is nearing completion.
The Prime Minister said an overhead bridge will be built from Kelaniya to Colombo Fort and it will be extended up to the HSBC building in Rajagiriya.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that traffic congestion hampers the country’s economic development and added short term, midterm and long term initiatives have been formulated to solve all traffic issues.
“The intention of the government is to build roads according to a proper plan and not just build roads everywhere,” the Premier said.
He further said that the Rajagiriya Flyover was constructed to improve the transport system and to reduce traffic congestion, but now there is a huge traffic near Town Hall.
The Prime Minister added that the government commenced various projects having taken into consideration all these issues.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the project was expected to be completed by the end of December 2018. Instead of building two lanes separately on either side, we decided to build all four lanes at once.
“As all four lanes at once will be constructed at once, we will be able to reduce traffic congestion in that area,”he said.
The Prime Minister said the government has plans to build a road from Kandy to Hambantota.
“We aim to reduce the existing traffic jams in Kandy and Colombo. Traffic congestion in these areas will be reduced after the Kandy – Colombo highway is built. Measures have also been taken to commence Light Rail Transport (LRT) services. These initiatives are vital to strengthen our economy,”the Prime Minister added.
He further said that people blame the government for transport issues and therefore we have taken measures to solve the pertaining issues and provide a better transport service to the public.
The Prime Minister said that the younger generation will have a bleak future if such pragmatic measures are not taken at this point in time and added that on the other hand, the government has to be free from debts.
