Illegal issue of bus route permits under former regime: Over 2000 files before FCID

Regulation of  transport sector become a major issue 

CCTV cameras at bus stands to curb extortion demands

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday said the National Transport Commission (NTC) has taken 2,095 files to the FCID to investigate into various malpractices which had occurred when granting bus route permits during the previous regime.
The minister noted that the regulation of the transport sector had become a major issue.
“It is a problem whether we can control it through legal,ethical or other means under good governance,” he added.
“A large number of people come to me every day for a route permit and I have to turn them back.
I tell them, come to me only if you are prepared to adhere to the principles of good governance. I cannot grant permits in an illegal manner,” the minister said at a workshop on the strengthening of the national and provincial transport sector at Waters Edge.
The minister told provincial authorities that extortion from bus owners by thugs and other influential people was still rampant.
Thus the minister urged provincial authorities to install CCTV cameras at bus stands to curb the issue of buses still being subjected to extortion demands.
“The NTC will fund the initiative,” he added. “It was also noted that long distance buses stop at undesignated places and that CCTV would also help put a stop to that,” the Minister said.
