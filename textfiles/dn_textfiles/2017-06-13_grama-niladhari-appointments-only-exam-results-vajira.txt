New Grama Niladhari Officers will be selected for 1,775 vacancies based only on the results obtained by the candidates at the examination held in September last year, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The minister was speaking at a Technical Officers and Grama Niladharis appointing ceremony at the Colombo Divisional Secretariat Auditorium yesterday.
