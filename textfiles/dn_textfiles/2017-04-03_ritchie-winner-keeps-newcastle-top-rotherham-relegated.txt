Ritchie winner keeps Newcastle on top but Rotherham relegated

Matt Ritchie struck a second-half winner as Newcastle United survived a Wigan Athletic fightback to win 2-1 and remain a point clear at the top of the Championship, while Rotherham's relegation was confirmed with a 1-0 home defeat by Fulham.
Newcastle took the lead in the 36th minute when Dwight Gayle netted his 22nd goal of a productive season, but Wigan, who had scored only once in their previous five matches, responded through Michael Jacobs’ dinked effort in the 50th minute.
However, Newcastle have repeatedly demonstrated their resolve in their testing title race this season, and Ritchie restored their lead seven minutes later when he headed home after his initial effort came back off the woodwork.
“We've got seven games left and we have to keep on winning,” Ritchie told Newcastle's official website (www.nufc.co.uk). “You've just got to have the desire to get over the line.
“We've worked hard to get into this position.
We just need to continue to work hard, stay focused and keep the same mentality that we have done throughout the season, because we're in a great position at the top of the league.” – Agencies
