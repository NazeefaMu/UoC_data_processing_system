Garbage dumps surround Akkaraipattu Arasayadi junction

Residents of the Akkaraipattu Arasayadi area complain that the garbage dumped in the area has caused a serious health hazard.
The garbage dumped at Arasayady junction in the Alayadivembu MOH area along the Akkaraipattu – Ampara main road permeates an unbearable foul smell, they said.
Environmental pollution due to garbage dumped recklessly has a direct link with a large number of dengue patients in the area in recent past, they said.
The Alayadivembu MOH Dr. A. M. Ismail instructed the people to draw special attention to the cleanliness of the environment aiming to curtail the spread of dengue.
Residents who have mosquito breeding locations were identified and were warned to clean their premises. Garbage dumped without clearing for a long time is another cause of the spread of dengue, he added.
The Alayadivembu MOH is also taking action to combat the disease. The bare lands are also cleaned to prevent the disease.
Residents were warned that legal action will be taken against offenders.
