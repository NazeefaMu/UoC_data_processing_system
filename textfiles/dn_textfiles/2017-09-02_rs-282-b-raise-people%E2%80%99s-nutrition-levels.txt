Rs. 28.2 b to raise people’s nutrition levels

The government has allocated Rs. 28.2 billion for the National Nutrition Programme in the next five years, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said nutritious food is essential for good health. The public should be made aware of the importance of consuming healthy food as well as buying nutritious food.
The minister made these observations at the launch of the “Health Sector Cost of the National Nutrition Programme of Sri Lanka” at the BMICH in Colombo recently. Minister Senaratne said the government has allocated a large amount of money for the improvement of health and nutrition of the people. Around Rs. 100 million has been spent to promote health and nutrition through the 2016 Budget, he said.
UNICEF and other non-governmental organisations have also allocated funds to uplift the nutritional standards of the people.
The ministry has implemented a programme to eliminate bad health habits, Minister Senaratne said.
