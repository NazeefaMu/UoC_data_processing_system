Ex Sampath Bankers Club completes first CSR Project

Ex Sampath Bankers club completed its first CSR project when it set up a Children’s Library at a school which lacked many facilities as the children were all from very poor families in the area.
The Executive Council of the Club in keeping with its objectives took a decision to embark on a CSR project and selected education sector to be the focus. The members of the Committee appointed visited some schools in the Colombo district and although most of them requested assistance the facilities they already enjoyed were such that they could not be categorised as most deserving. Therefore the committee decided to look at schools in the Kalutara district with the assistance of the Regional Manager of Sampath Bank responsible for that district and the Manager of their Kalutara Branch.
The Manager discussed this issue some officials in the Regional Education Department in Kalutara and obtained their recommendation to decide on a deserving school. The school selected for the project was Duwegoda Primary School which is located in Halkadawala a remote area in the Kalutara District which lacked many facilities but having a highly motivated Principal and staff who took great pains towards developing the school.
Sampath Bank very generously provided the thirty nine school bags along with tills for this purpose and they were presented to the new students at this ceremony. The school principal, teachers and the parents in their speeches expressed their appreciation of the contribution made by the Club to fulfill a long felt need of this poor remote school.
Ex Sampath Bankers Club very sincerely thank all those who contributed towards this worthy cause and looks forward to their continued support for its future projects as well.
