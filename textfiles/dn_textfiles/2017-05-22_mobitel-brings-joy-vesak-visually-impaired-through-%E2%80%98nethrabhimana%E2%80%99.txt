Mobitel brings joy of Vesak to visually impaired through ‘Nethrabhimana’

The National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel brought the light of joy to the visually impaired in the country on Vesak day, with an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform, that enabled users to listen to the stories on display on five prominent Vesak Pandals in Colombo this year.
Mobitel set about to remain true to its slogan ‘We Care, Always’ by sharing the joy of the celebrations with the visually challenged. Mobitel combined one of the oldest methods of communication in the form of storytelling with modern technology, to bridge the gap that previously prevented the visually impaired part of society from experiencing the splendor of Vesak.
Along with the supervision of the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually Handicapped, Mobitel accompanied two luxury buses with close to 50 visually impaired citizens to experience the ambience of prominent Pandals located in the city.

Enabling them to take part in other Vesak activities such as enjoying ‘Dhansal’ and walking in groups along the illuminated streets. The IVR platform enabled those who could not be in the vicinity to experience Vesak in the comfort and the safety of their homes.
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of ‘Nethrabhimana’ the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually Handicapped, Nawarathne Mudiyanse said “I believe that what Mobitel has conceptualized for the first time ever through this effort is an act of great thoughtfulness and empathy towards those of us who are less fortunate.”
Mobitel aims to raise awareness about the hardships faced by the visually challenged population living in Sri Lanka and remove society’s blindness to their plight.
With this small gesture of goodwill, Mobitel used its brand to communicate the message of equality for all human beings living in the country including the visually impaired. From the reactions received it was evident that they had immensely enjoyed the Vesak outing and had an unforgettable experience overall.
