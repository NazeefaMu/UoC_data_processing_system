LMD recognizes TRIAD as ‘Most Respected Advertising Company’ in SL

The most respected business entities are recognized and listed by Lanka Monthly Digest annually, in a bid to set a standard of excellence for the corporate sector.
Triad said on Tuesday it is proud to be chosen as the 'Most Respected Advertising Company' in the country with the likes of John Keells Holdings, MAS Holdings, Dialog Asiata, Commercial Bank, Hayleys, Unilever Sri Lanka, Hemas Holdings, Sampath Bank, Brandix Lanka and Aitken Spence leading the top 10 in the Hall of Fame.
Triad entered the fray of advertising in 1993 with a mere three people.
Today, 25 years later, the company ranks amongst the leading advertising companies in the country and holds its own as the only indigenous communications conglomerate at the top believing in the credo that Sri Lanka Can.
Backwardly integrating to offer a complete solution to a client, over 10 years Triad divested into other areas of communication such as offset printing, digital printing, screen printing, audio-video production, BTL activities, public relations, digital communications, corporate communications and publishing.
As the company celebrates its groundbreaking achievements on its 25th year of operation, Triad's Director and CEO Sarva Amarasekera says, "We are young. We have all the energy to challenge convention. We will give leadership to modern Sri Lanka and the youth of this country, who are hungry for rapid growth. We believe in real time strategies and practical do-able solutions. Throughout our 25 year journey, we have conducted our service offering in the most transparent and ethical manner. We have taken pride in upholding the integrity of our business and our team. We are driven to deliver. Our proven track record is our legacy. We believe the true strength of our conglomerate is our family of people 'API'. Together, we know we can because 'Sri Lanka Can'."
