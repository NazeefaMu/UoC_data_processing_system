‘Final decision on raising LP gas prices, yet to be made’

A final decision on increasing LP gas prices is yet to be arrived at, Consumer Affairs Authority Pricing and Management Assistant Director W. R. Meewanage said.
Speaking to the Daily news yesterday, the Assistant Director said requests had been received from the Litro and Laugfs gas companies, to raise prices of domestic 12.5-kg gas cylinders by Rs. 275.
The increase in both world market gas prices and USD to LKR exchange rates, were cited as the main reasons for their demand.
