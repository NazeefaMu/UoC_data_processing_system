A shot in the arm for flagging West Indies cricket

Cricket in the Caribbean has been flagging and there was no better solution to solving it than the West Indies men's and women's teams winning their respective World T20 competitions. It is the first time it has happened in the short history of the tournament which began in 2007 and has completed six editions of it. The Women's tournament began in 2009 and there have been five completed editions.

What everyone would like to see is this enthusiasm which West Indies has got into their system for T20 cricket born again in their Test cricket as well.
Not many of these players play Test cricket which is a crying shame. West Indies enjoy their cricket very much and it is generated on the field whenever they win. It is now upto the West Indies Cricket Board to ensure the success in T20 cricket is now transferred to the other two formats as well - Test and One-Day International cricket. When T20 cricket is thriving in the Caribbean this is the moment the Cricket Board should seize and capitalize on.
The closeness of results and the high scoring ability of some of the teams gives a clear indication that in T20 cricket any team can beat anybody at any given time and that includes the associate member sides who performed exceptionally well and even caused a few upsets when Afghanistan the most improved side of the associates pulled off a stunning upset over the eventual champions West Indies in a group match by six runs. Afghanistan were the only associate side that qualified to play in the Super 10 (along with Bangladesh) having come through the qualifying round beating Zimbabwe by 59 runs in the decider.
Right throughout the competition they gave all the Test playing sides they met a tough contest thus underlying the fact that associate teams have a chance of competing equally especially in the T20 format. Afghanistan's performance had the ICC's CEO Dave Richardson talking of increasing the number of associate teams in future World T20s by having a Super 12 instead of the present Super 10 which would give more opportunities for associate members to participate in the second round of the tournament.

With the first six World T20's taking place within a space of nine years, the ICC have now made it a four-year cycle from the next edition onwards. It will take place in 2020 in Australia.
Explaining the reasons for breaking off the two-year cycle for T20 cricket, Richardson said, "The danger of course is that if we keep pushing T20 and keep playing T20 events every two years, it will effectively cannibalise the other two. We want to make sure that we keep an even and more reasonable balance between the three formats. Hence, the decision to go with one men's World T20 in a four-year cycle".
The ICC is also mindful not to let the success of T20 cricket overshadow the other two formats and has even decreased the number of teams participating in the fifty-over cricket World Cup to 10 teams in 2019.
"The reason to go with a 10-team [2019 World Cup] tournament was done for a number of reasons. Number one, probably it was a format that would generate more competitive cricket and secondly, more value," Richardson said.

With the tournament staged in India, the home country was the favourites to win the title for a second time. Till the semi-final stage India displayed the form that would take them to achieve the pinnacle in the shortest format. But it was in the real crunch games that West Indies started producing their real firepower. As their captain Darren Sammy said they had 15 match winners in their side and so it proved.
The main focus of attention was on one of the biggest names in T20 cricket Chris Gayle. When he started the tournament with a typical Gayle century off 48 balls against England, everyone was of the opinion that Gayle was a one-man show that carried West Indies cricket. That may have been in the past but this West Indies team had many winners. Gayle never fired thereafter; he made only 13 runs in his next three innings. That cricket is a team game was proved by the West Indies in no uncertain manner. In their next game against Sri Lanka it was Andre Fletcher who won it for West Indies with an innings of 84 not out off 64 balls. In the low scoring match against South Africa it was Marlon Samuels' valuable 43 that got them across the line. In the semi-finals against India it was the power hitting of Johnson Charles (52 off 36 balls), Lendl Simmons (82 n.o. off 51) and Andre Russell (43 n.o. off 20) that saw them successfully chase down 193. Then in the final against England it was Samuels 85 not out off 66 balls and that astonishing hitting by Carlos Brathwaite who sent the first four balls of Ben Stokes for six that provided the final twist to an absorbing tournament. It brought the World T20 title back to the Caribbean once again after a lapse of four years. With the next edition of the competition not taking place until 2020, West Indies will hold onto the trophy the longest than its previous four winners - India, Pakistan, England and Sri Lanka.
New Zealand proved to be the most consistent team in the group matches but for all their consistency they faltered in the semi-finals against England to lose by a big margin of seven wickets.

South Africa were talked as one of the team's that could make it to the finals especially after their excellent showing in India last October where they won the ODI series 3-2 and the T20I series 2-0. But despite an abundance of talented players in the side they still failed to make it to the last four and the chokers tag haunted them.
England looked a completely different side to the ones experienced in the past. England are known for being a very good Test side but rather ordinary in the other two formats because they don't give much emphasis to them. But this England team under two former coaches who served Sri Lanka in the past - Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace turned things around so well that England looked on course to win the World T20 title for a second time till that final over when Brathwaite snatched away the trophy which was well within their grasp.
Australia came with the hope of winning the only title that has eluded them in their history, but they fell short of expectations and there was wide opinion that they had got their batting line up all wrong by having the big hitting David Warner coming to bat in the middle rather than as an opener where he could have served the team well.
To the surprise of many none of the Asian teams managed to get beyond the semi-finals despite the tournament being played in the subcontinent. India playing at home had the best record whereas former champions Pakistan and Sri Lanka were totally disappointing getting knocked out in the group stage. Bangladesh who promised a lot in the Asia Cup reaching the final of the tournament fell flat on their face and returned home without a single win in the Super 10. Virat Kohli who won the Man of the Tournament award, Joe Root, Jos Butler, Jason Roy and Marlon Samuels were the top batters in the Super 10 whereas in the bowling it was the spin of Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Samuel Badree, David Willey, Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan and the two Afghan bowlers Mohammed Nabi and Rashid Khan that caught the eye.
