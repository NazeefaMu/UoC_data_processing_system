Trawler on maiden voyage catches fire

A trawler on its maiden voyage had caught fire in the seas off Hikkaduwa.
The trawler had set sail on its maiden voyage from the Dikovita fishery harbour when it caught fire 51 km away from the Hikkaduwa beach.
Six crew members on board managed to escape unhurt and were rescued by another trawler.
These trawlers had been given to fishermen by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Development Dilip Wedaarachchi.
He has directed the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department Director General to conduct an investigation into this mishap.
