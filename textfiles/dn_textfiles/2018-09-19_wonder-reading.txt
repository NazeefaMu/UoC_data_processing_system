Wonder of reading

Many a man in this digital era complains that they do not have time to read. Yet, I do cultivate time every day to read a book or a newspaper despite heavy schedules of work as I know the wonder of reading.
I like to read because every minute of our life that passes is irreversible and so precious and I want to exploit that time with a useful work. I like to read as the wealth of knowledge I get from reading cannot be stolen or deleted unless some sort of paralysis takes hold of my brain cells, yet what I have gained from reading can be shared with a generous mind.
I like to read because I can go to the past - to the origin of this world or even the eras before that. I can meet the kings and queens, their kingdoms, their rise and fall. Besides, I can learn the wonders and miracles of new inventions and discoveries and how they affect the world and people respond to them. I can go to the future and see how life on this planet would be.
I can go into the sun, moon, an active volcano or to the farthest point of this universe without spending a colossal amount of money and time. I can climb up the highest point of the mountain Everest or explore the deepest point of the ocean without any protective suits but by the most comfortable vehicle of reading.
I like to read because I can have access to the world’s most prestigious universities, hotels, libraries, museums, zoos and what not. I like to read because I like to get lost in the creative thoughts of great writers and find different layers of meanings of their writings. Not only that, I can blend the knowledge that I have learnt from books and what my teachers have taught me and come up with new ideas to see the world from a different perspective.
I like to read a book rather than allowing my fingers to run on a keyboard of a computer and eyes getting tired from the radiation of it because reading a book requires no electricity, no particular place or no health hazards of any sort, but a wise and a healthy mental exercise.
I don’t think with this information, I can arrive at a conclusion. Yet, it is only through reading that such pleasures can be derived. In short, such elevation such enlightenment can never be experienced or gained by anything else other than reading!
