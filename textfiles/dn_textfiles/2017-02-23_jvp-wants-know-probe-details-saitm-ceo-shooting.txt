JVP wants to know probe details on SAITM CEO shooting

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday demanded to know the revelations of the investigations into the shooting incident against the SAITM Chief Executive Officer.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake making a special statement in Parliament said that there were reports of contradictory evidence and witness accounts leading to many doubts on the incident of Chief Executive Officer of SAITM coming under gun fire on February 6.
The Leader of the House and Higher Education and HighWays Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that Minister Sagala Rathnayake would reply to Dissanayake’s demand today.
JVP MP Dissanayake said that the government has to tell the country the truth behind the shooting incident near Malabe Private medical college.
He said that the SAITM CEO Sameera Senaratne who identified himself as a doctor was said to have been shot at. He added that there were media reports that two unidentified persons came in a motorcycle and opened fire at Senaratne’s car. “There were subsequent attempts to place the blame and responsibility on those who agitated against the SAITM,” MP Dissanayake said. MP Dissanayake also asked the progress of the investigations so far and what had been found in those investigations. During the round of questions for oral answers JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake also inquired from Minister Kiriella that the Sri Lanka Medical Council had said Sameera Senaratne was not a registered doctor and what was the stance of the government. He also asked if the government has to investigate into the incident as Senaratne had a narrow escape in the shooting incident.
Responding to MP Ratnayake, Minister Kiriella said that he was not aware of the qualifications of the said person and asked to raise a separate question on that matter.
However Minister Kiriella said that it seemed JVP MPs are worrying that the murderers missed the target.
