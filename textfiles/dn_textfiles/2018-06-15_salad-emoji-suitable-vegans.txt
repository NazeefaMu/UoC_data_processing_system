Salad Emoji suitable for vegans

Google has removed the egg from its salad emoji in order to make it more inclusive for vegans.
Jennifer Daniel, who works as a user experience manager for Google, announced the change on Twitter.
She tweeted that was "big talk about inclusion and diversity at Google" and cited the redesigned emoji as an indication. If you need any evidence of Google is making this priority may I direct your attention to the emoji - we've removed the egg in Android P beta 2, making this a more inclusive vegan salad."
The tweet was criticised by a number of Twitter users, with some arguing over whether eggs were vegan or not. Sky News can confirm that as eggs are produced from animals they are not svegan.
Ms Daniel responded to the controversy by saying: "Hello carnivores, vegans and everyone in between!
"Just want to clarify that the goal of salad emoji redesign was to create an image more faithful to unicode's description. 'A bowl of healthy salad, containing lettuce, tomato, and other salad items such as cucumber.' Bon appetite!"
