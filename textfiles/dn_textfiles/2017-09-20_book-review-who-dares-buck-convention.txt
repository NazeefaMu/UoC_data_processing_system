Book Review: Who dares to buck the convention?

Title: SamukkaAuthor: Jayani C. PinnawaleTranslated into English: Edmond Jayasuriya
In her third novel “ Samukka”, which now is translated into English, Jayani has attempted to tread on a new path to bring out a valued perspective to the attention of youth. The message is for youth to build character, while transcending from conventional thought, however deep and manifested, so as to build one’s life, with an enlightened mind and thereby, acquire value for one’s self and society. It is her long experience in serving in many capacities in the Sri Lanka Administrative service and exposure that prompted her to attempt to stress this point for serious consideration to the youth of today, for they play a positive role in society.
Samukka is a novel woven around a youth named ‘Wickrama’ who deplores conventional way of life. He is the only child of Tittawelas, a wealthy aristocratic family living, in suburbs of Colombo. From his childhood Wickrama creates a secluded life of his own, He spends most of the time in his room reading and when in school, in the library.
Disillusioned youth
However, whenever he manages to get out of his house, he enjoys the company of youth in the neighborhood, namely Cyril, his sister Swarna, Jayasunmana and others.
Even though his mother never tolerated his association with these ordinary people, he enjoyed such comradeship, especially expressing his loving sentiments to Swarna. As time passes due to the close relationship with these friends, he gets to know about the youth struggle, that takes place during this period, a struggle where disillusioned youth took to arms and rebelled against authority. In this association with his friends, Wickrama realizes the active involvement of his dear friends, Cyril and Swarna.
Though his attempt to seek answers to the reasons of involvement is not forthcoming due to his close association he is more or less forced to join as a sympathizer.
Consequently, as time passes Wickrama, too gradually gets involved indirectly, when he supports them by agreeing to pass vital information to the rebel group about the Railway department, where his father is a key official in this department. This indirect involvement is well articulated by the writer to portray how Wickrama was dragged onto this movement by force of circumstances. Innocently done, Wickrama became an accessory and a later on a fugitive hounded by authorities.
Answers Sought
This was a natural phenomenon in Wickrama’s character as set out in the novel, as his intention was to find out about the reasons for the struggle, where he sought answers from his friends and the leader of the struggle, even proceeding further; to find how the youth could achieve their goal in undertaking such rebel activity.
We come to read as to how this situation came about as natural outcome, as Wickrama was keen and interested to know and understand due to his interest in reading on current affairs about political change, peoples struggles and on theories of socialism and Marxism.
As time passes this indirect involvement in the struggle resulted in his taking a bold step to leave his parents and home to meet the leader of the movement to know and understand the reasons for the struggle and how the youth could achieve their desired goal ultimately, as he always reasoned out in this way.
The writer shows how this youth dared to meet head-on with the active persons in the youth struggle when he left his home and parents to be with the rebelling youth; more interested to study the cause which he imbibed in his reading.
While being with them having realized the intricacies, danger and the resultant loss of life of youth he did his best to advise them to look at alternative paths rather than fight authorities Unfortunately such advice did not carry weight as the rebelling youth were too deeply involved and there was never any way to stop or turn back.
The involvement has its effects as Wickrama undergoes much anxiety and fear of capture and resulting effects. The resulting actions of the parents to save him is also unfolded in detail
However when the force of circumstances that came to pass with his parents' direct involvement with authorities in their intervention to get him out of the association with these youths, Wickrama was forced to return home.
He was disillusioned losing his friends especially Cyril and Sawrana one whom he dearly loved and expressed
After his return home, his parents send overseas for higher studies as they wanted him to be away from friends with no relationship with the youth movement. Such circumstances required him to agree to the arrangement made to proceed overseas. It had an impact on his life.
Post-struggle period
His belief of success to achieve three expectations, involvement in music, books and being with Swarna still manifested when he returned after his success in his higher studies in India. He compiled a book incorporating most of his beliefs, thoughts he acquired in his reading, experiences So we observe the post-struggle period with change of environment and beliefs forced Wickrama gradually and duly change his ways of life.
