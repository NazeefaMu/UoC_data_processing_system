President, PM seek further date to testify in Tissa Attanayake case

 
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today sought a further date to testify in the case filed against former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake. 
When the case came up before High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi, President's Counsel Nissanka Nanayakkara who appeared on behalf of the key witnesses in the case, President and Prime Minister, informed Court that his clients are not appearing before Court since they are attending Parliament sessions. Thereby, the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election in order to affect the results of then Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena was re-fixed for trial by Colombo High Court.
Accordingly, the case was put off for trial on a day-to-day basis commencing from February 26 to March 2.
