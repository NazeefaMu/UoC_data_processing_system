Project to promote sea cucumber farming

Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage is to launch the 'Extended Regions of Fisheries and Development Project' in Kilinochchi on August 31 at 9.30 am to promote sea cucumber (sandfish) farming in Sri Lanka.
The venues for the said event will be the Walaipadu Office of the Provincial Secretariat and the Walaipadu beach. The project will be extended to selected fisher-folk areas in Mannar, Kalpitiya and Oluwil, Ministry sources said.
All Tamil National Alliance Members of Parliament, along with the MPs in Parliament representing the North, the Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister, members of the NPC and the State officials of the Northern Province are scheduled to attend this event.
Sea cucumbers serve a useful role in the marine eco-system and help recycle nutrients, breaking down detritus and other organic matter which bacteria can continue its degradation process.
