PM’s office conducts Train the Trainer program for persons with disability

The ‘Train the Trainer Program’ to empower persons with disability was held from September 20 to 22 for private sector institutions, field officers of National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and Vocational Training Authority (VTA), a press release from the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office stated.
The Policy Development Office has established a Sub-Committee on Vocational and Technical Training focusing on persons with disability (PwDs) to enable vocational training schools to absorb more PwDs in the near term. The committee recommended conducting a Train the Trainer program under a pilot scheme. Over 35 participants from various districts took part and were benefitted through this three-day programme.
According to the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) data in 2012, 71% (1,105,761) of the total population of persons with disability (PwDs) have functional difficulties, aged 15 years and above and are mostly economically inactive. Persons with Disability (PwDs) have difficulty in accessing the job market and have issues of social, economic inclusion.
The output of the programme will be improved access to vocational training, continuing education, employment, live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life for persons with disability (with visual, speech, hearing, mobility, intellectual, and psychiatric disability).
The three-day training programme was a success, in that the participants committed themselves to make a change in the lives of the persons with disabilities which will be monitored periodically by the TVET Subcommittee on PwDs. It was organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Department of Social Services, Employer’s Federation of Ceylon, Youth Business Sri Lanka, World University Service of Canada, MAS Holdings and the Subcommittee on Vocational and Technical Training focusing on Persons with Disability of the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister's Office.
