Day of the humanitarian heroes

Saturday August 19 was World Humanitarian Day. It is held every year on this day to pay tribute to aid workers who have risked and lost their lives in humanitarian service. The Day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2008 to coincide with the date of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.
The bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Mello was born in Brazil, and worked tirelessly over three decades to help those victims of armed conflict by easing their pain and making sure the world did not forget them.
Dangerous and difficult environments
Awareness was a vital part of his campaign, trying to ensure that those in First World countries and places of peace remembered that there was more to war than the deaths of combatants and conflicts between governments. These people struggle every day to survive against odds that were created in spite of their desire to just live in peace and safety.
The Canal Hotel bombing was a massive loss for the United Nations and the humanitarian community and marked a turning point for humanitarian operations in Iraq and worldwide. Each year, World Humanitarian Day focuses on a theme, bringing together stakeholders from across the humanitarian system to advocate survival, well-being, and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers.
Around the world, humanitarian aid workers operate in dangerous and difficult environments. Over the past 20 years, 4,132 aid workers have been attacked. Last year alone 91 aid workers were killed, 88 were injured and 73 were kidnapped in the line of duty. The majority of these attacks took place in five countries: South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Attacks against aid workers are deplorable and represent clear violations of international humanitarian law. In addition to endangering aid workers, these attacks threaten humanitarian operations and the lives of millions of people who rely on humanitarian assistance for their survival.
Every year thousands of men and women the world over put their lives in danger working in humanitarian causes all over the world. Working in the most poverty and illness stricken third world countries the world over, often in areas of great social violence, these dedicated heroes put their lives on the line, and sometimes lose them in the pursuit of their goals. World Humanitarian Day is when we remember these heroes and their sacrifices.
Natural hazards
Every day humanitarian aid workers help millions of people around the world, regardless of who they are and where they are. In essence, the day is a global celebration of people helping people. These are victims trapped in wars that aren’t of their own making. Meanwhile, the world isn’t doing enough to stop their suffering. The UN demands that world leaders do everything in their power to protect the millions of civilians caught in armed conflict.
It is estimated that more than 130 million people worldwide require humanitarian assistance in order to survive. During the first ever World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, held in May, a United Nations commitment was made to support those affected by crises, as well as those individuals who go out of their way to deliver aid to those in need. This milestone summit marked a major shift in how the international community prevents human suffering by preparing for and responding to crises. Yet, we have to recognise that the world is at a critical juncture, as we are witnessing human suffering unparalleled since the Second World War. More than 60 million people, mostly children, have been forced from their homes due to conflicts and violence. The human and economic cost of disasters caused by natural hazards is also on the rise. Over the past two decades, 218 million people were affected each year by disasters– at an annual cost to the global economy that now exceeds US$300 billion. That is why we must continually seek better ways to meet the needs of millions of people affected by conflicts and disasters in our rapidly changing world.
Every day, humanitarian aid workers stand on the front lines of war and disaster to provide life-saving assistance to millions of people worldwide. These people brave tremendous dangers and difficulties to deliver assistance to those who need it most and it is fitting that we applaud their absolute selflessness on this special day. In honour of them, a number of events will take place around the world. For instance, a wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, along with a high- profile event that will be held in the General Assembly Hall.
A digital campaign will be launched to raise awareness of the impossible choices faced by people caught in crisis. Photography exhibitions and film screenings will complement these activities by documenting and portraying the lives of those affected by conflict and disaster.
Humanitarian needs
The UN Secretary-General held the first-ever global humanitarian summit of this scale in Istanbul in May 2016. The goal of this summit was to find new ways to tackle humanitarian needs in our fast-changing world. This three-year initiative is being managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The summit set a new agenda for global humanitarian action. It focuses on humanitarian effectiveness, reducing vulnerability and managing risk, transformation through innovation, and serving the needs of people in conflict.
The Day also seeks to draw attention to humanitarian needs worldwide and the importance of international co-operation in meeting these needs. Every year, disasters cause immense suffering for millions of people – usually the world's poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable individuals. Humanitarian aid workers strive to provide life-saving assistance and long term rehabilitation to disaster-affected communities, regardless of where they are in the world and without discrimination based on nationality, social group, religion, sex, race or any other factor.
Humanitarian aid is based on a number of founding principles, including humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. Humanitarian aid workers should be respected, and be able to access those in need in order to provide vital assistance. Humanitarian aid workers can be international, but most come from the country in which they work. They reflect all cultures, ideologies and backgrounds and they are united by their commitment to humanitarianism.
Everyone can be a humanitarian. People affected by disasters are often the first to help their own communities following a disaster. Responding to emergencies is only one aspect of humanitarian work.
Humanitarian workers also support communities to rebuild their lives after disasters, to become more resilient to future crises, to advocate for their voices to be heard, and to build lasting and sustainable peace in areas of conflict.
