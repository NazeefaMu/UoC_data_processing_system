SL soon a child labour free country

Sri Lanka is heading towards a child labour free country, Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) Director General Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe said.
He was addressing the launch of DCS’s ‘Child Activity Survey 2016’, yesterday at the Water’s Edge.
“The survey was conducted at the request of the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) provided assistance to conduct this countrywide household survey in 2016,” he said. He added that this is the third in the series of Child Activity Surveys (CAS) conducted by the DCS. The previous rounds were conducted in 1999 and 2008/2009 with the assistance of the ILO.
The total number of children in the age group of 5-17 years in Sri Lanka in 2016 is estimated at 4.6 million.
The survey estimates that 90.1 percent of the children were attending school during the survey period. Among the children not attending school, a majority (84.2 percent) are in the 15-17 year age group and about half of them are awaiting G.C.E (O/L) results.
A small 6.8 percent have not yet enrolled due to being below the age of 5 by January. The survey revealed that only about 2.3 percent of children aged 5-17 years are engaged in some kind of economic activity.
This is a decline by 10.6 percentage points from the 12.9 percent reported in 2008/2009.
The total child labour is only 1 percent of the total child population and hazardous form of child labour is as low as 0.9 percent.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary M.I.M Rafeek said accurate and timely data plays a major role in formulating policies in order to make need-based demand driven interventions to bring about rapid developments in the country. “At a time where much emphasis is laid on good governance, transparency and accountability, policymakers should have access to reliable data in order to justify the reasons behind the policies formulated by them,” he said.
He said the statistics pave way for a scientific approach to investigate all available evidence in formulating policies which will result in achieving the desired outcome.
Labor and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Gotabaya Jayaratne, Research and Evaluation ILO Geneva Head Azfer Khan also attended the ceremony.
