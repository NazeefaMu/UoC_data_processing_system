Cathay Dragon in codeshare arrangement with Shenzhen Airlines

Cathay Dragon has announced an expansion of its codeshare agreement with Shenzhen Airlines that will see the airline add three new destinations to its network in Mainland China.
In the strengthened agreement, Cathay Dragon’s “KA” code will be placed on Shenzhen Airlines’ flights between Hong Kong and Yantai, Jinan and Harbin, while Shenzhen Airlines’ “ZH” code will be placed on Cathay Dragon’s services between Hong Kong and Nanjing and Xi’an.
Cathay Dragon customers travelling on Shenzhen Airlines codeshare flights will enjoy the convenience of checked-through baggage service to their final destination.
Tickets for the new codeshare services are now open for sale for travel commencing July 11.
The airlines’ existing agreement, which has seen Cathay Dragon codeshare on Shenzhen Airlines flights between Hong Kong and Jinjiang, has been in place since January 2015. With the addition of Yantai, Jinan and Harbin, Cathay Dragon’s network in Mainland China will increase to 27 destinations.
Cathay Dragon’s CEO Algernon Yau said: “This is another milestone for Cathay Dragon and our partner Shenzhen Airlines. Both airlines have demonstrated great commitment to our customers and this latest arrangement will provide more choice and greater convenience for our passengers travelling between Hong Kong and Mainland China.”
