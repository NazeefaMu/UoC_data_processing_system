Tea exports dip by 9%

Sri Lankan’s tea exports fell 9% to 20.1 million kilos in April 2017 from a year ago but earnings grew as prices were higher, Forbes & Walker Tea Brokers said.
“All main categories, tea bags, packeted and bulk teas have shown a decrease compared to the corresponding month of 2016,” they said in a report. But total tea export revenue grew 23% or Rs.3.1 billion to Rs. 16.5 billion in April 2017 compared with the same month last year and average tea export prices were up 36%.
“It is also relevant to note that the total FOB (free on board) value recorded for April 2017 of Rs. 822.83 too shows a significant gain of Rs. 218.06 vis-à-vis Rs.604.77 of April 2016,” Forbes & Walker Tea Brokers said.
