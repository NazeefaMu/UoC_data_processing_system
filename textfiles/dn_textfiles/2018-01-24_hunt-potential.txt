On the hunt for potential

‘I like to focus on we, rather than I. We, is a power word’ says Head Girl of Devi Balika Theshani Weligamage. Perfect Prefects Weligamage’s authority and vision depend on this core belief. She is ambitious, yet her ambition is for herself and for others. She and her fellow prefects are stronger together.
“I always believe in humility and I like to be humble. I like to focus on us, rather than I. We is a power word which is why I like to focus on working together as a team because that is so important. I like to focus on that. Through that, I radiate positivity and get the work done. Apart from that I really believe in being committed,” said Weligamage
Weligamage feels that Prefect-ship is such a great opportunity for a school student because when it comes to school life, it is not just about studying and excelling in academics. School life is one of the most important phases of your life.
Enriched life
“It is where you acquire the knowledge that you need to win the world. You are able to cultivate good qualities. Prefect-ship is one of the key positions you can receive in a school and gives you a great opportunity to uplift yourself and improve yourself. I am really happy to be the Head Prefect and it has really enriched my life a lot,” stated Weligamage.
Weligamage feels that it is important to have the heart as well as being intelligent. “I like to be friendly and I want to be an accessible person. I also want to be compassionate. The sisters look up to me and my prefects. So it is important to set an example to them,” said Weligamage.
She has greatly benefited from being educated at Devi Balika. It is where she has received opportunities to explore her potential.
“I think joining the drama club has really given me great opportunities and broadened my horizons. I joined the English Drama Circle and the Sinhala Drama Circle and we have entered so many competitions and registered a lot of victories. That was a fun time and a time when I developed many good qualities and it was a great learning experience.
I still am a member of the media unit. I did some sports as well, such as rifle shooting, getting a sharpshooter badge. For three years in a row, I became a sharpshooter in rifle shooting. I took part in basketball, handball and netball. I was a member of the school choir. I was a member of the English Literary association as well,” explained Weligamage.
She points out that when facing a problem, it is important that you do not lose your faith. You have to be dedicated and motivated and you have to hold on. That vibe of positivity is there when she faces obstacles.
Motivated patience
“There are times when you feel down and your crew feels down, but you still need to be positive because your crew looks to you for some sign as to what to do, and you need to be strong for them. You need to believe that every problem has a solution. You also have to be patient. I believe in having patience because I need to motivate those under me, and make them feel positive, and make them feel we can succeed. I need to encourage them,” added Weligamage
Weligamage believes that in order to see a change in the world, you need to be that change.
“I like to make a difference in the world with what I am doing right now. How I behave and what I do, the example that I set is important. Because I believe that if you want to see a change in the world you have to start with yourself. In society, there are so many different people. We see a lot of problems in society. To make a difference you need to take a risk. You need to be who you want to be,” said Weligamage.
Ambitious yet well grounded, Weligamage believes in herself and believes when selecting a job you need to learn your passions and potential. There is no rule that you need to be a doctor or engineer. Understand yourself and choose your profession.
“So now I am doing languages at Devi Balika, I want to study well, but at the same time, I want to do extra-curricular activities and lead a balanced school life. And I want to be a good role model. I am interested in doing Law in the future and I am interested in foreign affairs, international relations and international law. I also am interested in the United Nations so I would like to step into that kind of field. Because all the fields connected to the UN seem very interesting to me. Even WHO is also a field that really interests me. I did SLMUN once,” explained Weligamage.
Innocent crowd
The choices we make in life may have lifelong consequences. Which is why you need to think very carefully. Your choices will have an impact on your private life and sometimes it may have an impact on society. Sometimes youth tend to go to extremes. If they encounter an extremist, they might be attracted to these ideas and will go to a really dark and destructive place. Their lives will end in tragedy and along the way, they will hurt a lot of innocent people.
“When you are a young person there is the possibility of you being brash. So before you take a choice you need to think if what you are trying to do is right or wrong. You need to be conscious of what you are doing. Many young people do not realize the potential within themselves. They need to power up this potential and unleash these talents. Young people have the power to radiate compassion, empathy and positivity. Those are much-needed qualities in the world. By being kind you can really make a difference in one person’s life. You need to be careful about who you select as a role model because not everyone makes the world a better place,” said Weligamage
Weligamage is very mindful of human rights. The safety of women is a human right. Education is a human right and is vital to the lives of young people.
“But even today we see a lot of human rights violations. I would really like to talk about human rights violations and this applies to many societies in this world. Because this is what is lacking. To become a leader you need to be dedicated, you need to be able to delegate and you need to be an effective communicator. Be patient and whatever happens, carry on. And also be strong. I admire leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama. Before being a leader you need to be a follower first. You need to be able to listen. So the right combination of charisma and those qualities can make you a leader. But to be a leader that actually does some good to the world you need to have the heart. That will make you a balanced person and a good leader,” pointed out Weligamage
Good qualities
An only child in the family, her beloved father works abroad. Her mother gave up her job to be with Weligamage and took care of her. School is an important place in her life points out Weligamage. The people she has met in school and the situations she has encountered in Devi Balika have moulded her and helped develop her good qualities. She is who she is today because of her parents, school and friends.
“At the same time, I really like my pastimes such as travelling, drama and reading books. At the same time, I approve of doing charity. I want to become a great asset to my country. These days I am reading a book by Ann Brashare – ‘The Whole Thing Together’. I also like to read Sherlock Holmes. I like books where the plot is mysterious. And I like suspense as well. I do like Adventure/ horror movies. I was a fan of Teen Wolf and Harry Potter as well!” summed up Weligamage
