‘JO should not try to dilute SLFP’

The JO should not sling mud at the President and try to dilute the party. If the party is weakened, the victory goes to the UNP as it will be a one horse race,” Western Provincial Councillor Gamini Thilakasiri said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at Rajagiriya together with Kotte SLFP organiser Jamaka Ranawaka and Colombo District Organiser Rajitha Kodithuwakku.
He said President Sirisena is a clever visionary leader, who could achieve significant election victories and urged the Joint Opposition (JO) to rally round the President to strengthen the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Thilaskasiri said the SLFP has no future unless rallying round with the leadership of President Sirisena. If the JO ready to work more closely with the SLFP leadership, it will not be hard to win forthcoming local government and Provincial Council Elections, he said.
“He led the SLFP to the victory when he held the SLFP General Secretary post. But the party lost two elections without his support,” he said. Speaking on the SAITM medical faculty issue, he said that there should be equal room to access education.
Speaking on the Treasury bond issue, he said, the President has already taken suitable measures by appointing a presidential commission to look into the matter impartially.
Janka Ranawaka said there should be a proper mechanism to curtail drug menace and the under-world activities.
“As far as I know, no one can sell drugs without police support and political backing. Both politicians and police should launch a joint approach to do away with the drug and under-world menace. The minister should work on this,” he said.
“If he can’t perform his duty well, he must resign from his post and handover it to any other who can perform. If the police fails to work against frauds and corruptions, the SLFPers will battle against it,” he said.
Ranawaka invited the JO to work with the President to form a SLFP government in 2020. He said the President will be requested to contest the next presidential election as SLFP candidate. He said the country needs not a new Constitution but certain amendments to the existing one. Rajitha Kodithuwakku requested the President to take tough action against persons who are acting against the SLFP while representing the JO. “Those in the JO are still doing evil things criticising the party and its leadership. We urged the President to take tough action against these persons,” he said.
