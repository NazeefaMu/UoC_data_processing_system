MR calls on President to condemn CBK

Incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena should condemn former President Chandrika Bandaranaike’s allegations publicly that war widows face sexual exploitation by members of the army among others,” former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement said yesterday.
The former President in his statement said her allegations against the Sri Lanka Army is a matter of grave concern.
“When a former President and Commander-in-Chief makes such a statement, the person who should respond should be the current President and the Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, as a former President and Commander-in-Chief, I urge the President to publicly condemn the statement made by Kumaratunga,” he said.
He said the government should seriously consider whether former President Kumaratunga is fit to be the head of the officie for National Unity and Reconciliation as she is using her position to tarnish the image of armed forces.
“Since Kumaratunga holds the position of head of the ONUR which functions under the Presidential Secretariat, the statements she makes goes to the world as the official position of the Sri Lankan government,” he said.
“Now, with days to go for the 34th Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, a former President of Sri Lanka and a former Commander in Chief of our armed forces says that our armed forces are sexually exploiting war widows in the north.
What we have here is a former President echoing the accusations made by our enemies in what is obviously a deliberate attempt to vilify our armed forces on the eve of the UNHRC meeting,” he said.
