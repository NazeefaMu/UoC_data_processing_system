AirAsia offers exclusive deal to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

AirAsia announced a special deal for direct flights from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The promotion is part of the airline’s efforts to further engage the local market ahead of its plans for 2018.
Travellers can discover the best of Malaysia with the iconic attractions and world-class shopping experience in Kuala Lumpur, a slice of paradise in coastal cities such as Langkawi and Terengganu, the charms of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Penang, lush rainforests in East Malaysia, and more, with low fares for the booking period from February 18 to July 31.
Spencer Lee, Head of Commercial for AirAsia Malaysia said, “Our focus in Sri Lanka remains on connecting locals to the world thanks to our extensive Fly-Thru network and low fares. Flying via Kuala Lumpur, Fly-Thru passengers will be within reach to the best Asia has to offer across Malaysia with must-visit destinations such as Penang, Langkawi, Kuching, and Kota Kinabalu among others. Guests will also be only hours away from many great adventures exploring several Asean countries, China, Japan, Maldives, Australia, and even the US.
“But the next phase for us is to offer an even seamless experience using technology and data.
We want guests to enjoy products and services that are personalised, convenient, and most importantly, easily accessible with just a few clicks. Among them include our cashless transaction app, BigPay; in-flight Wi-Fi and free entertainment platform, ROKKI; duty-free marketplace, ROKKIshop.com; and many more.
We look forward to growing further in Sri Lanka not only in terms of connectivity but digitally as well to cultivate an ecosystem of smart travelling,” he added.
AirAsia currently connects Sri Lanka directly to Malaysia with two times daily flights operating out of Colombo to the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
Aside from the direct route, guests can also make use of the airline’s seamless Fly-Thru service that connects travellers to other flights with their baggage checked-through to the final destination without the hassle of immigration clearance at the transit hub in Kuala Lumpur.
