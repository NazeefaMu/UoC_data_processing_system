Fashion Bug continues CSR  initiative with Sri Lanka Railways

Fashion Bug, one of Sri Lanka’s leading retail clothing chains with over 16 outlets island-wide,together with the Sri Lanka Railway Department recently refurbished signage and direction boards at the busiest train terminal, Fort Railway Station.
Fashion Bug has been involved in this annual initiative since 2013 and hopes to continue and commence many more similar projects in future.
These initiatives exhibit how private corporations contribute to public services, even in their least possible ways and the retail clothing chain has notably placed social responsibility at the core of its day to day operations including being a prioritized pillar in its corporate strategy.
"We feel obliged to give back to the society. The resources, time and funds invested in this extensive project was definitely a worthy investment considering the tens of thousands who would be guided and assisted by the sign and direction boards in their daily traveling to and forth," said Dr. S H M Faraaz, Deputy General Manager of Fashion Bug on this occasion.
The company spends millions on this initiative and completes the refurbishment within a two month time frame, with the cooperation extended to them by the authorities at the Sri Lanka Railway Department.
Fashion Bug spends over Rs. 20 million annually on various CSR projects that are carried out throughout the country, ranging from sports and education through to health, public services and beyond.
Additionally SisuDirimaga, an award winning CSR program by Fashion Bug, has successfully benefitted over 12,000 students as of today, and continues all the way till it achieves its goal of spreading amongst 120 schools and over 100,000 students across the country.
