Only two confirmed  AH1N1 deaths reported in  Sri Lanks:Dr. Samitha Ginige

Only two confirmed deaths had been reported due to Influenza AH1N1 from Sri Lanka so far and it is only a mild illness. Only the people in high risk categories, especially pregnant mothers should seek immediate medical treatment, Consultant Virologist of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Samitha Ginige told the `Daily News’ yesterday.
According to Dr. Ginige, vulnerable persons such as elderly people (over the age of 65 years) or very young children (below the age of two years), pregnant women, postpartum mothers, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner and follow the medical advice. Then they can prevent complications.
According to the Consultant Doctors, several viral diseases including Dengue, influenza and a viral fever with symptoms similar to Dengue are spreading rapidly in the country at present.
According to them one of the symptoms of viral influenza is that the platelet blood count reduces in some patients, but not as low as those afflicted with dengue. There is a risk of this condition developing into pneumonia in persons in high risk groups. But it is common for communicable diseases to spread in April and May and the public should not be panic.
