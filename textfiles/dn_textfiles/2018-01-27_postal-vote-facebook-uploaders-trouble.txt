Postal vote: Facebook uploaders in trouble

The Election Commission said an investigation was launched to trace the individuals who posted videos marking their postal vote on social media.
Additional Commissioner M.M.Mohamed said the Commission received complaints that several people have uploaded videos of them marking their postal vote into Facebook.
He said the Commission is in the process of examining these videos and action will be taken against those who posted them.
Displaying marked ballot papers is against election laws.
