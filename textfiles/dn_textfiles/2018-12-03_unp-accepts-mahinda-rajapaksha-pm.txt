UNP accepts Mahinda Rajapaksha as the PM

The United National Party has officially accepted that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the current Sri Lankan Prime Minister, the President of the National Alliance for Lawyers Associations and the Former Director of the National Livestock Development Board and the Industrial Technology Institute R.Manoj Gamage (Attorney-at-Law) said.
 
Addressing media in Colombo yesterday he said that the UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim had sent an official letter withe his signature to the TNA Leader  R. Sampanthan stating that MP Ranil Wickramasinghe (not PM Ranil Wickramasinghe) will be nominated as the candidate for the Premiership from the United National Front. He had clearly mentioned the designation of the UNP Leader as a member of the Parliament. 
 
According to the Attorney-at-Law Gamage, the letter is now being circulating all over the country through the Internet and anyone can see and read it. But still the UNP Leader is staying at the Temple Trees saying that he is the Prime Minister while his own political party's (UNP) General Secretary Kabir Hashim says he is only a member of the Parliament. This reveals the truth to the country.
