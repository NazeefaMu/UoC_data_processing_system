A child and a woman injured in an accident are in a critical condition, the Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The accident has taken place around 11.50 am at the Southern Expressway near the Dodamgoda-Gelanigama area. A jeep that has gone out of control due to the heavy rainfall, has gone off the road. Four people who were in the jeep were injured and hospitalised, Gunasekara said.
SP Gunasekara said four accidents occurred in the Southern Expressway due to adverse weather conditions. Two more accidents occurred in the Colombo- Katunayakaye Expressway.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) requested the motorists to maintain an average speed of 60 kmph and to switch on headlights when they use expressways. The RDA also urged motorists to take necessary precautions to avoid accidents.
