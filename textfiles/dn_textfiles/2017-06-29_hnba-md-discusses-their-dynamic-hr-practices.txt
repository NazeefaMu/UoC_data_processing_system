HNBA MD discusses their dynamic HR practices

The ‘people factor’ of an organization with no doubt is its greatest strength, making its management crucial in a highly competitive industry such as Insurance.
HNB Assurance PLC (HNBA) and its fully owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Limited (HNBGI) has deployed a human resource strategy for its staff which focuses on enriching the life of its employees, both through enhancing quality of time at work as well as providing for greater work-life balance.

As a Group with over 900 employees, the strategic human resource practices extend beyond the standard human resource practices, to help our staff and their families fulfill their aspirations and dreams. Extensive measures are taken in order to create a contemporary organization culture with augmented values as well as a support mechanism to enable one to go forth in one's career.”

Continuous learning and development is encouraged throughout each tier of the organization.
