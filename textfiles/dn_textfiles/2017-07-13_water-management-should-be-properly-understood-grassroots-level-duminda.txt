Water management should be properly understood at grassroots level: Duminda

Some irresponsible officials slip through the water problem in the cover of 'water management'. They do not simplify the phrase to enable society to grasp its real meaning. Until water management is understood the grassroots level, society cannot be convinced, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said.
He was addressing the officials at the Anuradhapura Kachcheri to discuss drought relief programmes among other issues, recently.
Minister Dissanayake said the government spent a lot of money on officials and agencies for water management training in vain because it has not produced any result, Minister Dissanayake said.
The phrase 'water management' is attractive but nothing is achieved, he said.
“All parties say that the water problem could be solved through water management. Officers must explain how water could be managed at paddy fields, factories and homes to the grassroots level without waiting to preach on the subject until a landslide, flood or other natural disaster hit them,” the minister said.
He added that the country's ancestors should follow the concept that no drop of rainwater be allowed to flow into the sea without being used effectively.
“It led them to build amazing irrigation systems. We should follow such theories, while being aware of water management,” he said.
