Karunaratne in doubt for  Windies tour - fractures hand

Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne is in doubt for Sri Lanka’s three-Test tour of the Caribbean after suffering a fracture on his index finger of his left hand at practice.
An X-ray has confirmed a fracture which is certain to rule him out for at least a few weeks.
If the fracture requires surgery - a decision that will be taken over the next 24 hours - he will almost certainly be out until July. The three Tests against West Indies are scheduled for June.
The left-handed Test opener sustained the injury while batting in the nets in preparation for Sri Lanka's Super Provincial one-day tournament that began yesterday.
Sri Lanka are already without fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera and Shehan Madushanka due to injuries and doubtful for the tour.
