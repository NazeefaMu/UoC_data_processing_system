Wells which are contaminated following floods can be re-used after cleaning. The wells can be cleaned by following the instructions issued by the Public Health Officer / MOH etc of the relevant area.<U+200B>
<U+200B> <U+200B>Further details, instructions and required chemicals<U+200B> <U+200B>can be obtained from those officials, Health Ministry sources<U+200B> said.
According to the sources, the PHI or MOH of the relevant area should be consulted before starting to clean the well. The well should be emptied using a motor or manual mechanism. Inside walls of the well should be thoroughly cleaned using a brush. Then let the well fill with natural water.
After filling the well, a fresh water bucket should be taken from the cleaned well. Then two table spoons of TCL powder obtained from the PHI or MOH of the area should be thoroughly mixed in the water bucket. The bucket with the mixture should put into the well carefully using a tug. The bucket should be moved inside the well water up and down several times in order to mix the mixture with the well water, the sources said.
The well water can be used after 30 minutes of this process. Mixing TCL powder with well water (as described above) should be done three times a day. One tablet of chlorine should be used for five litres of tap water if people cannot assure the cleanliness of tap water they consume, the sources added.
