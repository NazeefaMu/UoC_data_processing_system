STF suspends search, teams on alert in Wilpita

The Special Task Force had suspended search operations at the Wilpita forest reserve to arrest two suspects who had fled into the forest after an exchange of fire with STF personnel, STF Commandant, SDIG M.R. Latheef said.
However, he told the Daily News that although clearing operations had been suspended, the STF had deployed teams at strategic locations to prevent the suspects from escaping.
Earlier this week on Monday, a close associate of underworld gang leader Makandure Madush known as Manel Rohana alias ‘Tilak’ was killed following a shootout with STF personnel at Kamburupitiya, Matara.
