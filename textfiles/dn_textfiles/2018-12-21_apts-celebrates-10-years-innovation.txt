APTS celebrates 10 years of innovation

The 10th-anniversary celebrations of Asia Pacific Technology Systems (APTS) took place on October 4th at Cinnamon Lakeside with 250 guests and partners from Sri Lanka and overseas.
Founded in 2008 by Namal Senaratne with only an initial investment of Rs 500, the company stands tall today with an annual turnover of over Rs 500 Million. The company has an impressive portfolio that caters to a wider range of requirements for startups, medium-scale and large-scale companies and offers network solutions and infrastructure, security solutions, data centre services and managed services. APTS partners with internationally reputed IT service providers such as CISCO, DELL EMC, VMware, Oracle, Hitachi and Checkpoint to consult and distribute their technology in Sri Lanka. APTS steadily gained recognition and trust among partners as a direct result of the quality of service and the team’s ability to stay true to the company values of honesty, integrity and an ethical approach to business.
“Stick to the basics. Work on time. Commit to your word. Be courteous. No matter how many degrees or titles we have, if we can’t work by the basics, whether it is our personal or professional life, we will not get far. Even my team, I always encourage them to stick to these basics, because a strong foundation will set the pace for many great achievements,” says Namal sharing some of his principles for work and life.
Throughout the years, APTS has won numerous national as well as international awards including Top SME in Asia (2016), Excellent Sustainable Development Award (2016), World Leader Businessperson (2016) and Most Emerging Entrepreneur (2014) to name a few. “We’ve had many challenges. But we learnt that we can only achieve success if we are committed to something and when great people come together with one goal in mind,” said Namal at the event.
This year APTS will evolve into the next generation of technology with the launch of N-Flex, a company that delivers IT cloud and networking software to simplify workspaces. N-Flex goes beyond product distribution to connect software companies with local businesses through marketing and reverse logistics that connect B2B clients. N-Flex uses a state-of-the-art Customer Experience Centre that allows you to use and experience the software that you’re about to invest in, making it a first of its kind facility in Sri Lanka. “We’re excited to reveal N-Flex while we celebrate 10 years with APTS. We want to identify technologies that shape the IT industry. With our reputation preceding us, we have no doubt about building credibility among our partners as well as our ability to deliver,” said Namal about the new venture.
