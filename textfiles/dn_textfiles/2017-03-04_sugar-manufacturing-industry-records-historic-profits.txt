Sugar manufacturing industry records historic profits

The state owned sugar manufacturing industry reported historic profits, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said in Buttala on Thursday.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the inaugural event of the sugar cane harvesting ceremony of Pelawatte Sugar Industries owned by the Lanka Sugar Company (Private) Limited (LSCL). “We start another round of sugarcane harvesting. For years, similar harvesting ceremonies have been taking place, but local sugar production was incurring losses and likelihood of privatisation has been in the air,” Minister Bathiudeen said.
The government owned sugar production industry is earning profits without any need for privatisation, he said.
Over 11,000 workers under LSCL, have together helped transform losses to equal levels of massive profits in a year, he said.
"We are producing less than 10 percent of our annual sugar needs locally. We need to increase this. Meanwhile, Maximum Retail Prices (MRP) on sugar sales are not helping our sugar development efforts,” the minister said.
Sri Lanka consumes 500,000 MT sugar, but locally productions is only 8 percent, he said.
