brinjal binge

Vegetables are the most important part of a meal. From our childhood our parents lay much emphasis on the importance of consuming vegetables. Once you get used to it you can't do without it. In Sri Lanka 'Batu' is one vegetable that is immensely popular. It is a Sri Lankan food that is used widely throughout the island. Garden Talk met up with Assistant Director of Agriculture Sajeevi Wickrematillake to discuss this vegetable that is a favorite in our island.
"In Sri Lanka Vambatu/Brinjals (Solanum Melongena) is widely cultivated and used. Two other species are Thibbatu (Solanum Torvum) and Thalanabatu are grown in the Dry Zone. Vambatu is grown in the Low Country Wet Zone and Dry Zone. In the Up Country Wet Zone Vambatu is not grown much. From Low Country vegetables Vambatu is the second most extensively grown vegetable," said Wickrematillake
There are many varieties of Brinjals. From them the following varieties have been recommended by the Department of Agriculture -
* SM 164
* Thinneweli Purple
* Padagoda
* Amanda and Anjali (Local Hybrids)

There is another variety called Leneirri that is not recommended but is very popular amongst the farmers. In addition to this there are hybrid varieties brought from abroad. These are Purple Long and Swing. These are foreign hybrid varieties. They have been introduced by the Private Sector. But these have not been recommended by the Agriculture Department. So these are grown to a certain extent," stated Wickrematillake.
The origin of Batu is from India. It was also seen in China and then spread to other Asian countries.
"Batu can be used for many food purposes. It can be used to make a curry and can also be made into a pickle. From Thibbatu one can make a sambol. In South Asia, South East Asia and South Africa it is called Eggplant. In North America and Australia it is also referred as Eggplant. The British call it Aubergine. Brinjals is popular throughout Sri Lanka," pointed out Wickrematillake.
Thibbatu even though not very popular in the past is gaining in popularity in Sri Lanka.
"This is because Thibbatu is done on a commercial scale in the Dry Zone in Sri Lanka. This is because even though elephants generally pose a threat to cultivation, Thibbatu is not damaged by elephants. So without any loss you can get a good harvest from Thibbatu and get a good income. Thalanabatu is also grown on a commercial scale in the Dry Zone," added Wickrematillake
When it comes to Brinjal varieties there is a difference in colour and appearance.
"The purple comes from the Anthocyanine pigment. Depending on the concentration and the deposited amount of the pigment, the appearance differs. If you take SM 164, the pigment concentration and deposited amount is relatively less. It is a lighter shade of purple. When you take Thinnaweli Purple the pigment concentration is relatively high. It is a deep purple. The trunk is also deep purple and the entire fruit is a deep purple color. Even the leaves are a purple and green mix. The flowers are also a deep purple. Padagoda also has a relatively less concentration of the pigment," explained Wickrematillake
Brinjals and Thibbatu also have great medicinal value.
"The Anthocyanine pigment is good for heart diseases. The Nasunin pigment also present improves blood flow to the brain. It is also good for diabetes. It decreases the risk for obesity. And it promotes healthy complexion and hair," added Wickrematillake
Brinjals are not properly exported from Sri Lanka.
"We do not meet the export qualities. We have shortcomings. There are also various pest and disease problems. Also our farmers apply pesticides and these residues accumulate. Mature plants. Mature plants are affected by bacterial wilt, a disease that affects all plants that belong to the Solanaceae family," said Wickrematillake
It affects the upper portion of the plant making it wither. After that the rest of the plant withers in the space of two days and dies. The bacteria comes in through the roots and goes through the Xylum cells. It enters through the root system.
"This is because water sucked from the roots is distributed to the rest of the plant through the Xylum cells. So that is how the plant withers. The family Solanaceae is susceptible to that bacteria," said Wickrematillake.
Fungi infection also causes rotting. There are three types of these Fungi - Fusarium Species, Rhizoctonia Solani and Sclerotium Rolfsii. Here the portion of the trunk closest to the soil rots. Even the roots rot. There is a discoloration.
"When it comes to Pests, the 'Shoot and Stem Borer' is the biggest problem. Stem borer is an adult moth. It attacks the shoots, the tender leaves and the fruit, laying its eggs there and then the worm that comes out of the eggs starts eating the plant from inside. Another pest is the Spidermite," she said.
"It sucks the juice and the leaves turn a copper color. Then we know it is a mite attack. It attacks the fruit as well and the fruit loses its pigment and turns white. The fruit and leaves also loses their form and goes out of shape," noted Wickrematillake.

HOW TO PREVENT AGAINST THE DISEASES
* When making the nursery in the wet zone, it must have adequate sunlight.
* The water must not collect in the soil. It must drain well
* The Agriculture department recommends when planning Vambatu, that there should be a 60cm distance between two plants and a 90cm distance between two lines of Vambatu plants. (This is to control the humidity. Increase in humidity causes diseases)
* Day temperature has to be between Celsius 27 - 32
* Night Temperature has to be between Celsius 21 - 27
* In the Dry Zone if you irrigate every five days it is ok
* The soil PH value has to be between 5.5 - 6.8
* Also the weeds in the field need to be controlled because some pests can be found in the weeds
* The field can also be covered by an insect net 2m high, this is to protect against moths
* Irrigation is necessary and a good drainage system.
