Leadership thoughts

“Everything has changed except our thinking,” a very rightful quote by the great Albert Einstein.
A new wave is rolling in, shaking up the old school of thought. Only a few extraordinary Leaders could hold on to take the ebbs and the tides of this changing environments and be ahead with the power of open mindedness and adaptation.
With many changes in social and cultural spheres taking place rapidly, there was concern among a few that interest and enthusiasm in the study and engagement of looking for extraordinary human faculties, would decline. Research and study in this area are evidently and surprisingly vibrant and socially salient.
We are, perhaps obsessed and blinded by a too closer look on traditional and conventional methods of Leadership and Business Management .......and shutting ourselves from possibilities of discovering new potentialities. When we are called to explore we recoil in fear that we may jeopardize our professions and reputation as Guru’s of Leadership & management. We feel secure been glued to our comfort zones......been simple practical logical..... makes a great day. Our progression in leadership & management teachings is like furnishing the floor that we occupy day after day.....it looks better and better each day....but lacks the sparkle of an Innovative face-lift.
“Visionary Leadership “ in its real true sense is a mental creation of your intended destination for your Organization and your people. And the principles applied to realize these visions is the capability and the will of a leader and his people to build an indomitable mechanism to get there.

“There are the visibilities and the invisibilities of facts and other dynamics around a given situation. The visibilities are seeing by everybody...but the invisibilities..that’s probably the most crucial information that’s required for adaptive decision making can only be perceived by “True Visionary Leaders”
“Visionary Leadership’ is religious.....in the sense that Businesses and people are dependent on your power to foresee opportunities, that can be recognized and engaged . Your people trust in your directing, decision making,.... on your loyalty, integrity morality and real truthfulness in protecting the organization and its people from adversities in every way. Self -centered Ego-centric individuals don’t make real “Visionary Leaders’
Visionary Leadership should be extraordinary......not only confined to been knowledgeable about leadership theories and strategies.....but having the ability to see and perceive facts and situations beyond its visible facts....been at a level of consciousness, been meta-cognitonal innovational transformational and act beyond the capacities of an ordinary mind..... possessing intelligences’ and abilities to demonstrate an understanding and mastery of all aspects of life –body to mind soul to spirit.
There is no easy way to be a great leader.........there is no easy way to shift your intelligence and competence to a new dimension ....to new heights..... this may not be the best way to talk about great leadership.....but it is certainly the most bold and truthful way to start it.
If what you are trying to accomplish as a leader ...is by following a few simple and practical rules...and within everyone’s reach...“you will not make a great visionary leader.
Visionary leaders sparkles and energizes their environments like a new dawn. They are bold and daring in their imaginations, and insight. They work with the power of intentionality and alignment with a higher purpose. Their eyes are on the horizon, looking at possibilities of exploring new horizons day after day. They are social innovators and change agents, seeing the big picture and thinking strategically. There is a profound interconnectedness between the leader and the whole, and true visionary leaders serve the good of the whole.
They recognize that there is some truth on both sides of most polarized issues in our society today. They search for solutions that transcend the usual adversarial approaches and address the causal level of problems. They find a higher synthesis of the best of both sides of an issue and address the systemic root causes of problems to create real breakthroughs.
True Visionary Leadership ,needs something more than knowledge and education, skills and competencies, talents or physical advantages. It requires the Will to Pioneer..Originate, and Explore ....This Greatness needs a Creator.....needs the liberty for hypothesis , for extrapolations ..in the absence of facts.
You can read listen and watch a hundred or more stories and facts that are inspirational....but just as the great Thomas Edison tells us....”Genius is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.
Visionary leadership is based on a balanced expression of the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical dimensions. It requires core values, clear vision, empowering relationships, and innovative action. When one or more of these dimensions are missing, leadership cannot manifest a vision.
“Visionary leadership is the ability to direct your Organization and your people into the future with foresightedness Organizational and personal consciousness and a higher level of logics and understandings about the dynamics surrounding your business environment.”
