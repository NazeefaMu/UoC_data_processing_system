N. Amarapathma fired a three under par third round to be the latest Course Record holder of the re-designed and updated Diyatalawa golf course. Amarapathma’s best card of the day earned him the Course Record while elevating him to tied sixth position with Sisira Kumara.
The laying of new grass on the greens proved a good improvement and lifted the standard of the course, which boasts of scenic beauty and unique features of a physically challenging course.
