We will not support Govt.- Dilan

United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Media Spokesman and Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that the UPFA would not support a Government headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“The people's mandate on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is very clear and it reflects that he has no mandate to function as the Prime Minister nor as a Minister,” he said.
State Minister Perera added that even President Maithripala Sirisena had asserted before the election that a caretaker government would function after the Local Government election on February 10.
He added that under this situation Ranil Wickremesinghe should not be the Prime Minister and some other member should be appointed.
“Hence, the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would not be extended to a government headed by Wickremesinghe in future,” State Minister Perera said.
