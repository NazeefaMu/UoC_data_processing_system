Convicted women transferred to Angunakolapelessa Prison

Prison officers have taken measures to transfer 126 convicted women inmates from the Welikada Prison to the Angunakolapelessa Prison, Prison Department Spokesman Prison Commissioner Thushara Upuldeniya said.
The reason for the transfer he said was due to overcrowding at the Welikada Prison.
He said no new convicted prisoners will be admitted to the Welikada Prison hereafter as a measure to reduce overcrowding.
New convicted prisoners will also be sent to the Angunakolapelessa Prison, constructed to high standard and equipped with more facilities including a modern hospital, which provides women inmates with medical facilities.
