Dogs at hospital premises: Rajitha blames some hospital directors

Some hospital directors cannot even control stray dogs roaming in hospital premises, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had said, sources said.
The sources said Dr. Senaratne had also stated that officials who do not participate in three meetings of the Hospital Committees should be removed and new officials should be appointed.
"Some hospital directors are being controlled by some hospital committee members.
"Some hospital directors cannot control the workers who are under their administration," he said. Dr. Senaratne expressed those views during a recent discussion at the Health Ministry. The minister said hospital properties belong to the state and these properties should be protected. Businessmen and donors should be appointed and included in hospital committees, the minister had said.
Dr. Senaratne said all state hospitals will be equipped with blood testing machines within the next two weeks while from January 1, the Health Ministry will stop staff at state hospitals requesting patients to get done blood tests from the private sector.
Disciplinary action will be take against Hospital Directors who violate this rule, the minister had said.
