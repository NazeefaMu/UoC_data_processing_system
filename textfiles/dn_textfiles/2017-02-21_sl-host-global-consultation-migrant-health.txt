SL to host Global Consultation on Migrant Health

Sri Lanka will host the ‘2nd Global Consultation on Migrant Health: Resetting the Agenda’ in Colombo from <U+200B>February 21 to 23. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will inaugurate the event today at Galle Face Hotel at 9 am.
This consultation is to be co-hosted by the Government of Sri Lanka, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the IOM. Over 150 delegates from 40 countries will attend the meeting. It will offer member states and partners a meaningful platform for multi-sectoral dialogue and political commitment to enhance the health of migrants.
The objective of the consultation is to share lessons learned, good practices and research in addressing the health needs of migrants and to identify gaps, opportunities and new challenges, to reach consensus on key policy strategies.
It also aims to reach a unified agenda across regions on the health of migrants, reconciling acute large scale displacement, as well as long-term economic and disparity-driven structural migration.
The consultation hopes to pave the way for a possible roadmap of key benchmarks and to engage multi-sectoral partners at policy level for a sustained international dialogue and enabling policy environment for change.
To facilitate a continuation of the political dialogue on the advancement of migrant health, a “Colombo Statement” expressing governments’ support to promote the health of migrants at multi-sector level will be declared by President Maithripal Sirisena on February 23.
At the 106th IOM Council in November 2015, a High-level Panel on migration, human mobility and global health was organised. During the session, <U+200B>President Sirisena, offered to host the Global Consultation on migrant health.
