National Sustainability Discourse:
President to hold discussions with university dons

A series of discussions are being held to receive feedback from universities academics after the launch of the National Sustainability Discourse.
This discussion with university academics consists of two rounds, and the second round is scheduled to be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena in the near future.
Discussions were already held at the Colombo University, Sabaragamuwa University and the Open University, and during these meetings, the challenges faced by Sri Lanka as a middle-income country in formulating sustainable development policies in the fields of education, transport, agriculture and industrialisation were discussed.
The National Sustainability Discourse aims to create a broad dialogue in all fields, including with the public, politicians and academics, to ascertain the vision for Sri Lanka’s sustainability development.
These meetings will be held with the participation of vice chancellors of the universities, the Presidential Expert Committee Chairman Prof. Mohan Munasinghe and other members.
Steps have been taken to hold a series of meetings at ministry level regarding the ‘Sustainable Sri Lanka Vision’, from next week.
According to the statement made by the President at the UN in 2015, he is spearheading Sri Lanka’s drive to achieve the sustainable development goals.
The National Sustainability Discourse which operates efficiently to obtain the ideas of all will be implemented in every province of the country. Through this process, the public will get an opportunity to express their views on relevant issues and directly engage in dialogue.
The main objective of this programme is to prepare a plan to determine the long-term economic, social and environmental goals of the country over the next 12 years, while displaying the capabilities of Sri Lanka.
The discourse aims to engage young people, academics and professionals. The report will be updated according to the feedback of the parties.
This would be the first effort to announce the capabilities and ideologies of Sri Lanka and to make plans to confirm the economic, societal and environmental vision for the next 12 years, where the President has identified the importance of holding a national debate based on this draft.
The National Sustainability Discourse, which includes discussions held for three months on the content of the first draft of the National Sustainability Vision for 2030, was launched by President Sirisena.
The draft will be amended to incorporate the contributions of the public to create a national blueprint for sustainable development policies until 2030.
Sri Lanka expects to become a middle-income country with a prosperous, competitive and developed economy, comfortable environment with fauna and flora, and a peaceful society.
The National Sustainability Discourse will identify the issues within most sectors and provide solutions and reveal the way forward for the country’s development.
Even though the governments which come to power conduct development programmes, they are not launched in accordance with a comprehensive national development plan.
Although every government has made such development plans, this is the first draft which is deprived of criticism or political favour, and with the contribution of a committee of experts in different fields.
