Final decision on LP gas, milk powder prices soon

The Government has not yet taken a final decision on revising the prices of LP gas and milk powder, Industry and Commerce Ministry Director Indika Ranathunga said.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Finance Ministry auditorium yesterday, the Director said requests have been received from Litro and Laugh gas companies to raise the price of domestic 12.5kg gas cylinder by Rs 275.
“The increase in gas prices in the world market and the increase in exchange rates for US Dollar to Sri Lanka Rupee have been cited as main reasons for the demand. The companies have asked to consider the loss they had to incur as the prices were not revised last year,” she said.
She said the companies importing and distributing milk powder have requested to increase the price of 1kg of milk powder by Rs 100. However, she said the discussions in this regard were inclined towards not increasing the milk powder prices.
“Currently, the Consumer Affairs Authority and the Finance Ministry are discussing on price revisions of gas and milk powder and a final decision will be made by next week. Most likely, the prices will not change before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year,” she added.
Lanka Sathosa Limited Chief Executive Officer Dr S H M Faraaz said essential items would be sold at comparatively low prices at island wide Sathosa outlets during the Avurudu season. He said mobile units will be deployed in selected places such as stations during the festive season to sell essential items to people who return to their villages.
He said the prices of local potatoes, big onions, dhal and rice would be further reduced by next week.
Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute Sales Division Head W H Duminda Priyadarshana assured that there would not be any rice shortage in the country this year.
“Paddy was cultivated in about 639,000 hectares in the Maha Season and we expect 2.4 million metric tonnes of paddy. This is sufficient for eight months’ local consumption,” he noted.
Consumer Affairs Authority Pricing and Management Assistant Director W R Meewanage said raids would continue throughout the festive season, adding that it has conducted 1,700 raids up to March 24.
Census and Statistics Department Agriculture and Environment Statistics Director A M U K Alahakoon said the inflation decreased to 3.2 percent in February from 5.4 percent in January, on a year-on-year basis. He said this was the lowest inflation recorded since April 2016.
