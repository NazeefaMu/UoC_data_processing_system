Blending flavours

Juliet Coombe tries tumeric latter and learns about the perfect artisan brews from the master and mistress of blending coffee and tea at the Edgcumbe-Rendle Roastery Café.
Growing up in India, Chris Edgcumbe-Rendle, now a master roaster and blending aficionado, loved trying out different teas from a young age, blending them together in his jungle book life, which was the envy of all his friends back in England.
It was of no surprise to them when he became a coffee and tea master chef of blending and roasting, which is the result of decades of training with the best, tasting endless styles from around the world and having a passion for mixing and blending different varieties to create exciting new drinks. In the case of coffee, much of the taste is due to the variety of bean, as well as down to the roasting process, which is quite an art form – no two roasts are the same, given that ambient elements also play their part. On our tour of the Roastery which lies directly opposite the cafe, we were given some Colombia El Calapo green beans (in effect, coffee seeds) to grow and were let into how Chris and his wife, Alice, quietly, after over three decades of passion, have grown a huge fan base of ardent coffee and tea lovers. Followers love it so much they will detour on their way to and from London to try the latest blend and to pick up some bags of their signature blend that comes with tasting notes. Their multi-award-winning house coffee, Sussex Barn blend, has a great taste profile of berries, spice and chocolate.
Of course, behind every talented artisan blender is a James Bond style business partner, Alice Rendle, who designed the stunning branding at the EDGE cafe, complete with family dog as part of the logo. Like her husband, she is also on her own personal crusade to get back to the good old days when we cooked slowly, and everyone stopped to talk about things while drinking loose leaf tea. She firmly believes that this will help save the planet by encouraging people to stop using tea bags with plastic in, which adds to our rubbish mountains and affects health. “Making tea, she explains, is always best the ‘old school’ way as it brings out the best flavours and colours, which she proves pouring different mixtures of camomile, fennel and rose petals into a tasting glass, and then says, with a sparkle in her eyes, ‘happy sipping’. The true golden colour is a magical Aladdin and the Lamp type experience and all the more fun as she explains all the tea making paraphernalia on the shelves of the shop, which are also on sale online at www.edgcumbes.co.uk and in the EDGE Café, The Old Barn, Ford Lane near Arundel castle, West Sussex.
Chris, as he takes us round the Roastery, explains how his first big break was working for James Finlays of London, one of the biggest tea producers in the world, with responsibility for buying Ceylon teas to go into Sainsbury’s Green Label, which resulted in him spending an exciting year in Sri Lanka, at the Colombo auction houses at the age of 20, where he would do the tasting for up to 400 different teas in a day. Going back to live in Asia in 1970 was his idea of heaven as he could indulge in street hoppers and spicy sambal while learning from the island’s finest tea makers. So he could identify the different tea tastes, he sipped milk between each batch to neutralise the taste of the last one and then put a broker’s price on it. Like his father who founded Edgcumbes Coffee Roasters and Tea Blenders in 1981, he grew to love tea mixology and has never looked back from his four exciting years with Finlays, whose bush-to-cup success goes back to 1750 when tea became all the rage as a result of the golden age of trade. He also fell in love with the coffee bean process after several exciting years in Kenya, applying the knowledge that the mix is the key to any award-winning drink.
As we watched the coffee roasting machine turn through the sea of beans, taking out small stones and discussed the incredible range of blends, Chris explained proudly, ‘Our company now spans two generations, and when Frank Edgcumbe-Rendle my dad retired from his job as a jute and tea trader in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and moved back to the UK, he was distraught to discover he couldn’t find any decent loose-leaf tea and so he sat at the kitchen table with a set of scales and blended some high-quality Assam and Kenyan tea leaves together. He called the blend Rusper, after the West Sussex village where he grew up, and decided to sell a few packets, calling the newly formed company Edgcumbes – his traditional family name with lots of Cornish/Devon Celtic connections. The couple believes, along with their dynamic young team, that locally, fresh-roasted coffees and hand-blended loose-leaf teas always taste better than commercially packaged products. Combine this with the voodoo of the setting, entertaining staff, quirky sustainable furnishings and a philosophy of bring your own take-away cup for a discount. If you have more time, of course stay and learn for a while about this fascinating business in the sun drenched courtyard - here regulars talk about where the seasonal range of five or six coffee styles come from on their travels, many of them have taken the time to enjoy one of their many amazing courses that are done in a superb teaching area next to the EDGE café.
Asked about the future, both Chris and Alice are excited by the prospect of travelling the world together while sourcing and learning about ever more blends, roasting techniques and whatever else might go with coffee and tea. A little tipple of something stronger, now and again, also, wouldn’t go amiss. So far their travels have taken them to Colombia, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Kenya.
Get in touch with Edgcumbes, and you might have an opportunity to try Christopher’s other business, Rendle’s Original Pink Gin, created by his father while fighting in the 16th Light Cavalry in India during World War 2. Captain Frank Edgcumbe-Rendle, to deal with the horrors of war, created his own secret recipe by adding spices and herbs from the Orient and made sure he knew it was his bottle of gin by adding Hibiscus for its pink colouring. Rendle’s Original Gin now the talk of the American and Canadian people, Christopher believes it's time to take it back to where it all started -Asia as its infusion and story is all about the magic and mystique of the Orient. As Serendipity has it, Alice and Christopher are going next on their travels to research more of a range of Sri Lankan teas and no doubt add to their already very exciting blends, which you can buy in their delightful artisan café shop. For them travelling to different places is important as you can never stop learning or discovering new exciting things. So next time you have a coffee or tea sit back as you sip it and think what it took to grow, blend and turn it into the drink most of us consume as much as water.
