Kingsman reaches Sri Lanka

The 20th Century Fox, together with the British High Commission and Skyline Entertainment Pvt Ltd, celebrated Britain’s creative industries during a reception to launch the film ‘Kingsman: The Golden Circle’.
The film is the much anticipated follow-up to the hit 2015 film ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’. Speaking to guests from the Colombo film and arts scene at the reception, the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, His Excellency James Dauris, commented that the film reflects the breadth of talent in Britain’s creative industries. “The UK’s film industry is one of the most successful in the world because of the quality of its directors and actors, remarkable and diverse film locations, world-class production houses and top quality acting, arts and design education”, he said.
International release
The reception, which took place at the British Residence, was the first in a series of ‘Kingsman’ related events during ‘Kingsman Week’ in Colombo, leading up to the international release of the film on September 22. Skyline in partnership with TNL Radio and Scope Cinemas also hosted the first ever official double-feature fan screening in Sri Lanka.
Returning cast members Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and Edward Holcroft will be joined by an incredible host of names including Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, Pedro Pascal, with Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges.
The first Kingsman film introduced the world to Kingsman - an independent, international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion, whose ultimate goal is to keep the world safe. In Kingsman: The Golden Circle, our heroes headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage.
The film is directed by Matthew Vaughn, a leading British filmmaker who has produced, written and directed an impressive array of films. He has worked with British talent, including Daniel Craig and Michael Caine, as well as being part of international blockbusters such as ‘X- Men: First Class’ and ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’.

Director Matthew Vaughn and MR PORTER have created this collection with a focus on British heritage, with cloths sourced from traditional mills and hand-picked collaborations with classic brands.
