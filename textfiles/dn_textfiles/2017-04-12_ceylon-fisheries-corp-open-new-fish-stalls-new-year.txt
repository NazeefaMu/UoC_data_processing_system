Ceylon Fisheries Corp to open new fish stalls before New Year

The Ceylon Fisheries Corporation has planned to set up 20 new fish stalls countrywide to enable people to purchase fresh fish at reasonable prices for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season. Of them, 10 stalls were opened last month and the balance 10 will be set up before the New Year.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amraweera has instructed Corporation Chairman Jagath Perera to widen the Corporation’s stalls network.
