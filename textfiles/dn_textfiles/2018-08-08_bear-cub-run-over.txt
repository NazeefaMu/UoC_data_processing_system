Bear cub run over

A bear cub died on the spot after being run over by a vehicle on the Buttala – Kataragama road. A group of passengers in another vehicle, having seen the incident, reported it to the Galge Wildlife officers.
Kataragama Wildlife office veterinary surgeon Ananda Dharmakeerthi ordered Wildlife officers to transfer the body of the animal to the elephant transit home at Udawalawa for a postmortem. The veterinary surgeon said that the bear cub weighed 15 kilos and that the animal was about one year old. Wildlife officers will pursue the matter in court.
