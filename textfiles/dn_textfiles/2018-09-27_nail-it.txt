Nail it!

No matter how refined your choices are and how good your clothes and make up look, unkempt nails are a sign of sloppiness. There is no way to camouflage messy nails unless you hide them from sight. Similar to your face, your nails too need constant care and indulgence. Read on to see how well-manicured and healthy nails can be a joy to behold.
 
 Filing your nails 
Taking down the length with a file can cause too much stress on the nail, which encourages breakage or splitting, especially if you have longer nails
Filing can also weaken nails if you use a back-and-forth sawing motion. Stick to one direction only in this three-step process: File side to center, where you go on the side of nail to the tip at a 45-degree angle, then the other side to the tip, and then finish at the top of the nail. But do not file too much of the sides, which could encourage tears. Use a light stroke and make sure you soften off the corners of nails. Never file just after you’ve gotten out of a shower or bath. Wet nails break more easily.
 
 Vitamins are good for brittle or weak nails 
Nutritional deficiency is the most likely cause of nail disorders. There are several nutrients that can affect the growth and suppleness of fingernails. Diets that do not include enough protein will lead to weak nails as there will not be a sufficient amount of protein fibers to allow the cells to keratinize. Deficiencies of folic acid and Vitamin C will also cause brittle nails.
Biotin helps the body use carbohydrates, fat and protein and is found naturally in many foods, including nuts, eggs, avocados, meat, fish and vegetables.

 Age and nail growth 
Nail growth slows slightly over time. On average, fingernails grow about 3 mm (0.1 inch) per month; toenails only a third of that, or 1mm (0.04 inch) per month. As early as the age of 25, that rate slows by about 0.5 percent per year. So by the age of 85, your fingernails may only be growing 2 mm in length per month.
With age, nails may become brittle and prone to breaking. Repeated wetting and drying, or exposure to harsh cleaning chemicals or cosmetics like cuticle and nail polish removers, can worsen the problem.

 Getting rid of the nail biting habit 
Reasons to stop:
* Nail biting won’t typically cause permanent damage but it definitely has its downsides.
* It can make your nails grow in a weird manner. If you damage the tissue around your nails, they may stop growing the way they should. This gives you abnormal-looking nails.
* It can spoil your smile. You can chip, crack, or break your teeth when you bite your nails. Over time, nail biting can even cause jaw problems.
* It can make you sick. Hands are a hotbed for germs, and nails are their perfect hideout. When you’re putting your fingers in your mouth multiple times a day, it increases your chances of getting sick. Plus, the skin damage you can cause when you bite your nails creates an easy way for germs to get in.
 
Healthy nail and hand care tips
Soak nails in olive oil
For weak, thin nails, soak them in extra virgin olive oil for 10 to15 minutes a day for a month, then twice a week thereafter. This inexpensive home beauty treatment will help fortify damaged, weak or peeling nails.
 
Use a cuticle cream
A soothing cuticle cream helps nourish dry cuticles and brittle, damaged nails with vitamin E. Massage the cream into and around your nails nightly before going to bed.
 
Eat biotin-rich foods
Make sure your diet features food that is rich in biotin such as liver, cooked eggs, whole grains, cauliflower and avocado, among others. In addition to other health benefits, biotin can help strengthen and thicken nails. You can also take a biotin supplement, if necessary.
 
Stay hydrated
Drinking enough water is essential for health, and nail health is no exception. Without adequate moisture, nails can become brittle, break and peel easily. Drinking enough water helps them to retain moisture and stay strong.
 
Give your nails a break from polish
Along those same lines, although nail polish looks nice, your nails need to breathe. Constant use of polish, even nontoxic polish, can weaken the nail.
