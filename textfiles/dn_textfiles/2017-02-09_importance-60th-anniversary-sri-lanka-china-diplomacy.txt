Importance of 60th anniversary of Sri Lanka-China diplomacy

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and People’s Republic of China, as the President of Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association (SLCFA), I am honoured to extend warmest wishes to our two peoples and the leadership of our two countries.
This important anniversary scheduled for February 7 is the greatest event within the diplomatic chronology of Sri Lanka during past six decades.
On February 7, 1957, S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike and Zhou Enlai, two Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka and China established official relations at Colombo, mutually holding hands of bilateral diplomacy and friendship. During the period of foregone 60 years, it was China who assisted us most, in economic, security, political and diplomatic fields without being second to any other country in the world. People of Sri Lanka will never ever forget the fact that the victory of the 30 year old separatist war would not have been successful in 2009, if not for assistance provided by China to our government.
Hence in May 2013, leaders of our two countries proclaimed the uplifting of relations to a “Strategic Cooperative Partnership of Sincere Mutual Assistance and Everlasting Friendship” in the official communique jointly issued. I take this opportunity to wish success to the Free Trade Agreement expected to be signed in China during the official visit of Sri Lankan Prime Minister in May this year, which would be a major foothold of 60 year old state to state diplomacy.
