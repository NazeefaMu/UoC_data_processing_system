MR using JO as cover up for his misconduct: UNP MP

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is attempting to cover up financial and other alleged misconduct carried out by him and his family members during his regime, using the Joint Opposition, UNP Parliamentarian Heshan Withanage said.
He said it was humorous that the Joint Opposition (JO) was making baseless allegations that the government was taking political revenge when legal action was taken against persons responsible for various misconducts during the last regime.
Withanage made these comments at a press briefing at Sirikotha yesterday.
The MP said unlike the period of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the law of the country is followed to the letter.
He said when legal action is taken against persons for malpractices, especially persons representing the JO, it is categorised as political revenge.
“The people are aware how the country was governed. However, under the good governance government, the law is equal and positions of persons are not considered. It is clear that Namal Rajapaksa was arrested over an investigation under the Money Laundering Act. But the JO levels allegations that the arrest as political revenge,” he said.
Withanage said during the previous regime, there was no accountability with regard to public money.
Public money was misused and mismanaged as the then rulers wanted, he said.
UNP Parliamentarian Sandith Samarasinghe said he was not satisfied with police investigations into an incident where the bodies of two female elephants used for safari, were exhumed.
He said the two elephants died due to inhuman treatment by the mahouts.
It has been reported that a team had tried to get the bodies after exhuming. This is an illegal act because the owner of any elephant is the state even though that particular elephant belonged to a private owner, Samarasinghe said.
“Police has not taken action against these persons yet. Persons responsible for the incident have been identified as supporters of former President Rajapaksa and a Chief Minister,” he said.
