‘Ranaviru Sevana’ begins producing artificial limbs

The ‘Ranaviru Sevana’ state-of-the-art wellness centre for disabled War Heroes at Ragama, turned a new leaf on Army Day on Wednesday when it ceremonially commenced its workshop for the production of Prostheses and Orthotics, benefiting over 15,000 amputees and physically-handicapped Army War Heroes.
The establishment of the workshop, equipped with new machinery and equipment of international standards was brought to completion, under the initiative of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake. He was supported by the President for financial patronage to realise this cause.
Accordingly, the President, lauding the heroic deeds of affected War Heroes, facilitated the approval for about Rs. 160 million for the project which included machinery and equipment to the value of about Rs. 80 million, according to Major General S. K. Thirunavukarasu, Director General, Directorate of Rehabilitation.
At the workshop, about 25 foreign trained Army technicians would manufacture and assemble artificial legs and limbs or prostheses upon the importation of required components. The construction of the workshop that cost about Rs. 80 million had been designed enabling amputees to get their worn out artificial devices repaired without seeking new replacements for a considerable period.
Battle-affected War Heroes would be benefitted by this project as they can learn to use artificial products in the correct manner during their stay in the place.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake attending the inauguration of the new complex, unveiled a plaque. The Chief Guest was also briefed on the workings of the machinery and equipment by unit heads.
Lieutenant General Senanayake thanked those who supported the project, including foreign-based companies.
“This is a tribute paid to the heroic deeds of our War Heroes on this landmark day of the Army.
It will certainly boost the morale of physically-handicapped War Heroes until they are naturalized and returned to society as ordinary citizens. This facility, perhaps the best in the region, could be further expanded under phase 2 and 3 in the future to turn it to be a public venture to serve the country one day,” the Commander said.
Major General S. K. Thirunavukarasu, Director General, Directorate of Rehabilitation explained how the new workshop saw its birth as an extension to the Ragama ‘Ranaviru Sevana’ and acknowledged the support received from the Commander, Army Engineers, other agencies and philanthropists.
At present, 115 handicapped resident War Heroes undergo rehabilitation and recuperation at Ragama ‘Ranaviru Sevana’.
Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Officers of the Army, with civil invitees were present.
