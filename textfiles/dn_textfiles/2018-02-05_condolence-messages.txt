Condolence Messages

Catholic Church mourns the loss of a virtuous disciple of the Buddha
His Eminence Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, in a condolence message expressed his heartfelt sympathies on the passing away of Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera.
In his message, he expressed his sadness at the demise of the Thera.The message adds:
I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Ven.Wimalarathana Thera, who is a learned and virtuous true disciple of Buddha, many years ago. I have had the honour of working together with the late Thera for inter-religious reconciliation and as a close friend, I was witness to his great qualities which has also guided me during my lifetime.
He was a great example to the Buddhist society and clergy while his love for this nation and his service to it should be greatly admired.
While his demise is an immeasurable loss, on behalf of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to our fellow Buddhist brothers and sisters at this time of mourning.
We wish that Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera attains the supreme bliss of Nibbana he wished for.
‘Standard-bearer of inter-religious harmony’
An intense sense of grief strikes me as I take a few moments from my hectic election campaign to reflect upon the passing away of the preeminent, most erudite Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya. I have all along been an ardent admirer of the Maha Thera for his singularly commendable and brave viewpoints and for his formidable preaching and writing as a missionary and educator.
Above all, I always knew him as a principle standard-bearer of the council of inter-religious harmony in Sri Lanka and had the honour and privilege to be a co-speaker at the High-Level Summit of Buddhist and Muslims Leaders in Yogyakarta and Borobudur, Indonesia, recently and in many other forums with him. We spoke at length about how, we as followers of different belief systems were respectively secure and comfortable in our Buddhism and Islam, intrinsic to our Sri Lankan patriotism. It was important for him that we nurture this exquisiteness in our country.
It was not long ago that we were grappling with loss of peace and ethnic and inter-religious tension. Wherever and whenever needed, Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera steadfastly stood his ground to help diminish any chance of perpetually recurring ethnic enmity and tension. In his passing away, as a Muslim political leader, I cannot for a moment doubt, under any circumstance, what would have been the course of this country and what our future holds if we failed to have erudite monks of responsibility such as the Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera. In his work and service are deeply laid the seeds of future welfare, not merely to the Buddhists but also to those of all faiths in this country.
Ven. Bellanwila Maha Thera in the true sense of a Buddhist priest, understood the universe, spoke and lived in the most civilized manner, a life with righteous intentions for the larger goodness of humanity. I deem, in his passing away, as his supporters, we have collectively increased our responsibility as a nation to work towards inter-religious amity.
