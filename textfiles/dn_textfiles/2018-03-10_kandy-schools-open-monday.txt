Kandy schools open on Monday

All schools in the Kandy administrative district will open on Monday (12), Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said yesterday.
He said tensions were easing in the district and civilian life was returning to normal.
“There have been no major incidents reported so far except for a few individual attacks but we see the people of Kandy rallying together during these troubled times”, Ekanayake said.
The Education Ministry closed all government schools in the district on Monday (5) in lieu of the clashes which broke out in Digana and Teldeniya on Sunday (4).
