[CITIZENS' Mail - (25-06-2018)]

I don’t know, I can’t remember, a national malady!
At a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, a senior politician was unable to satisfactorily explain how he and his family came to occupy a luxury apartment when his residence was being renovated. To many questions by the state attorney, his answers were “I don’t know or I can’t remember”.
A few parliamentarians stunned the nation admitting having taken millions of rupees from the master fraudster who has played out the country for billions. Their excuse, “We received these cheques. We can’t remember who gave the cheques. The money was used for the election campaign.”
But when the campaign donations came the election had ended. Perhaps the CID will tell us, whether these donations have been banked, invested in business ventures or busted in hotels, casinos and massage clinics!
With all this ill-gotten filthy lucre they are bound to vie for ‘post turtle’ positions once again. These rogues and their leaders can never change. The people have been fooled enough. Let them come. The people have no time to experiment with born-again politicians.
Unlike politicians who have deservedly earned the condemnation of the nation as abominable rotters, our cricketers have been a much-loved breed. Thankfully, many a time they have been able to lift the spirits of this perpetually despairing nation. Politicians and others in positions of power have a lot to learn indeed from the cricketing greats such as Sangakkara, Muralitharan, de Silva and Jayewardene. But going by the events that overtook the game of cricket itself at the St. Lucia Test Match in the West Indies one wonders whether our cricketers are beginning to go the way of our politicians. Did not our Captain Chandimal sound like an MP when at the ball tampering inquiry he famously admitted very much like a politician: “I put something into my mouth, but I cannot remember what it was?”
Inasmuch as the MPs who received cheques from Perpetual Treasuries do not deserve seats in the August House as Honourable members, Chandimal has forfeited the honour of Captaining Sri Lanka.
