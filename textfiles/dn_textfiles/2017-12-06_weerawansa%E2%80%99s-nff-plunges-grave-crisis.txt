Weerawansa’s NFF plunges into grave crisis

Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake, the Deputy leader of the National Freedom Front (NFF), is likely to cross over to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Daily News reliably learns.
Dissanayake addressing a gathering in Anuradhapura yesterday had indicated the decision whilst calling on the general public to support the mandate of the SLFP.
This new development ahead of the much anticipated local government polls comes just days after another member of the NFF Jayantha Wijesekara resigned from the NFF. Wijesekera, a former member of the NFF and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, had decided to resign following the resignation of the party secretary Priyanjan Vitharana.
At a media briefing, Wijesekera cited that he had decided to quit the NFF following Vitharana’s resignation. He called on ‘progressive politicians from the JVP and the NFF to join forces with President Maithripala Sirisena.’
It is unclear the exact reason for Weerakumar Dissanayake’s change of heart, however, sources told the Daily News a growing sense of disenchantment exists in the party.
The resignation of Wijesekara and Vitharana has prompted many to rethink their decision to remain in the party.
National Freedom Front (NFF) National Organiser Piyasiri Wijenayake, who criticised party leader Wimal Weerawansa over his statement on bombing Parliament, was sacked from the party recently.
