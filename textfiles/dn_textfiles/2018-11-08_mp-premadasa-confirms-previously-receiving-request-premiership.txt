MP Premadasa confirms previously receiving request for Premiership

Deputy United National Party Leader and former Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa confirmed that President Maithripala Sirisena had requested him to accept the Premiership of the country under the former government.
Former Minister Premadasa said so in reply to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference held at Temple Trees, yesterday.
He also accepted that they had discussions with the President for the previous government to go ahead by rectifying their faults and added that he was unaware whether they were successful or not as those were held at higher level.
