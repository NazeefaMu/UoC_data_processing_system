JHU strongly objects to PC motion: Warnasinghe

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) strongly objects the motion passed by the Provincial Councils to identify its Chairmen as Speakers and their deputies as Deputy Speakers, said JHU National organizer and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe.
He said all Provincial Councils had passed this resolution and sent to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa to include it in the Constitution which is being formulated.
Warnasinghe made this observation yesterday at a press conference at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
He stated that this motion is against the Provincial Councils Act as well. Warnasinghe added that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the JHU objected the motion when it was moved in the Western Provincial Council on March 21. He said the motion had been moved on a decision reached at a meeting of the Provincial Council Chairmen.
“The same resolution formulates nine provincial Parliaments similar to Parliament and this is a step towards separatism,” the Provincial Councillor said. He said the UPFA members of seven Provincial Councils support former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. “The supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa are speaking of a united country but they support a motion that strengthens separatism. The JHU does not support a resolution that promotes separatism,” Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He said the worst suggestion has been for a new constitution by the Northern and Western Provincial Councils.
“They had suggested that the powers of the Governors of Provincial Councils, representative of the President, should be pruned as much as possible,” Warnasinghe said. “Some groups gradually attempt to strengthen Provincial Councils to an extent that would affect the unitary status of the country”.
He said the JHU objects the Provincial Council system as a policy. Warnasinghe said the JHU would extend its support if the government takes measures to abolish the Provincial Council system.
He added that a large amount of people’s money is spent on a single provincial council sitting.
Provincial Councillor Warnasinghe said the Provincial Councillors attend workshops on a daily basis. He said they are not organized by the government or representatives of the two main parties.
