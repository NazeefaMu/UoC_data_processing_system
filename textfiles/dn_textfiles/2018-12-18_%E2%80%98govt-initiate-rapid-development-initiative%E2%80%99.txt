‘Govt. to initiate rapid development initiative’

United National Party Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said the United National Front under the leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe would implement an unprecedented rapid development initiative to protect the citizens, War Heroes and the country within the next 10 months.
He said UNP MPs would go to meet the supporters at grassroots level to understand their grievances.
"The UNP should start a new journey which is free from theft, commissions, and bribes," Premadasa said.
"The ‘Gam Udawa’ initiative commenced by him as the Minister of Housing would also reach the 20,000 new villages by 2025," he said.
He was also confident that the United National Party would win all the elections in the future.
Assistant UNP Leader UNP Ravi Karunanayake said the UNP should go ahead for the sake of the people leaving behind the dark era under the Rajapaksa rule.
"A new government formed by the UNP would provide all the previous benefits to the public," he added.
Karunanayake also stressed that a stable UNP would rule the country until 2030.
UNP National Organizer Navin Dissanayake requested the people to protect unity within the party and thereby defeat the Rajapaksa regime.
"The new government to be formed from today should give priority to UNPers," he emphasized.
He also said the UNP is the only political party which has a team of good leaders as it selects its party leaders in a democratic manner, but, not on the personal interests.
UNP, during the next six months would fully work for the party supporters and to build the party up, Dissanayake said.
Jathika Hela Urumaya leader Patali Champika Ranwaka said the persons in the previous government who have failed the country by engaging in crime and corruption will soon be brought to justice.
He said the political coup on October 26 violated people’s self-respect and self-pride, which is the very reason why people fought back until victory was claimed.
Ranawaka also said that the fresh start will adhere to a people’s agenda that will ensure economic and social prosperity in the country. Ranawaka also pointed out that it was the people from all parts of the country that defeated the political coup.
“We have shown that the Rajapaksas are unable to do anything that they claim. We shall never allow the Rajapaksas to come back to power again,” Ranawaka said.
UNF MP, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the people’s sovereignty had been destroyed within the past 50 days, when Mahinda Rajapaksa ruled the country, but, now the Party has made a good start for a new and a long journey.
"During the Rajapaksa regime, there was no democracy and only nepotism,"he said.
He said the country lost billions of rupees as a result of their fraudulent activities such as the Avant-Garde deal.
Former Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Ven. Dambara Amila Thera and UNF MPs addressed the rally.
