Rejection of nomination:Janasetha Peramuna files writ petition

Janasetha Peramuna leader Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera yesterday filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Welikanda Pradeshiya Sabha to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer.
It was delivered by the authorised agent of the Janasetha Peramuna in respect of the Local Authorities Election to be held for the purpose of election of the members to the Welikanda Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioner said he discovered from media that the nomination paper delivered by the Janasetha Peramuna in respect of Welikanda Pradeshiya Sabha had been rejected on the grounds that such a nomination paper did not contain the total number of women candidates.
The petitioner is also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Welikanda Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioner had cited Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Polonnaruwa District), SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hasheem, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that even though the nomination papers had been rejected by the second respondent, the reason for rejection was not informed by the second respondent.
This petition was filed through Pradeep Associates.
