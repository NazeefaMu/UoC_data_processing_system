Sri Lanka  Retail Forum  on October 17

Sri Lanka Retail Forum, has now become the nation’s leading retail sector forum has returned for a second consecutive year, and registration for the forum opens today (September 10).
Owing to the overwhelming success seen at the forum held last year, with 450 participants, the Sri Lanka Retailers’ Association (Guarantee) Ltd. (SLRA) is organizing the forum once again.
This year’s theme is “Towards a Dynamic and Evolving Retail Sector” and is scheduled to be held from October 17 to 18, 2018 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
The SLRA is the sole industry body for this sector, representing nearly 40 leading and national level retail firms, with countrywide reach across various product segments.
Sri Lanka is adopting an open strategy to trade, with the recently implemented National Export Strategy, and signing of FTAs, therefore local retailers not only need to gear up for emerging challenges, but they need to take hold of the opportunity of going-to-market.
Fresh strategies of increasing competitiveness and opening up to the global market is essential, which is the thought behind this year’s theme. The Forum brings together the front-runners of both the local and international retail industry, sharing their insights and leading deep-dive discussion on strategies that Sri Lankan retail companies can adopt and further build on, to sharpen their processes from supply chain management to customer services, etc.
The discussions will have a synergistic effect – inspecting from various angles the shortcomings of the industry at large, and suggestions of how they can be tackled from individuals who have already achieved success in the industry.
The forum will focus on four thematic sessions: reshaping customer engagement, driving tomorrow’s retail today, new models challenging the status-quo – brands-culture-sustainability, and where retail in the region is heading. These sessions will explore tools such as data analytics, sustainable practice, a tourism – retail nexus, and digitization strategies. E-platforms for retail and how the industry can evolve into the digital ecosystem will also be a key discussion at the forum.
“A dynamic and evolving retail sector should be a device that Sri Lanka can boast of as contribution to its economic growth, and this will establish the goods and services of local companies as superior products in the global market. The goal in which the forum is held is that Sri Lankan Retailers will learn strategies that will boost their performance, the performance of the industry, and ultimately the performance of the whole nation,” said Charitha Subasinghe, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018.
This forum is ideal for those keen on learning new trends and innovations in the retail industry, and it will cover a wide range of challenges and new insights across the 4 thematic sessions that will be held over the course of two days. Registrations are open until October 15, 2018.
