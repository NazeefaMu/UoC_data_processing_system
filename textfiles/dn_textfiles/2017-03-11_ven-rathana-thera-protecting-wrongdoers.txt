'Ven. Rathana Thera protecting wrongdoers'

The Citizens' Organizations collective suspects that Ven. Rathana Thera is protecting wrongdoers and murderers, while trying to bring in an anti-democratic fascist political leader into power.
Left Centre Co-convener and Citizens’ Organization's collective Convener Chameera Perera said he suspects Ven. Rathana Thera’s activities as he continues to make contradictory remarks about law and order of which he is not aware of while criticizing his own party.
“If he has issues within his own party without taking measures to solve them, he is on a mission to form a new party which is against moral norms,” he said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR).
Perera alleged that Ven. Rathana Thera is among the group of individuals who supported the anti- democratic activities carried out by Mahinda Rajapaksa under the former government.
