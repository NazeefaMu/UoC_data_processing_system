Point of view 
Equity markets were buffeted by both dampened sentiment following last week’s communal tensions and global geo-political headwinds, causing the broad-share ASPI to pare down ~42 points W-o-W, to record its largest weekly loss since mid-Jan.
Retail investors opted to remain on the sidelines yet again this week, as the state of emergency declared last week failed to be lifted after the original 10-day lapse and amid discussions to extend it further.
Global financial market volatility meanwhile heightened over the week due to rising concerns over trade tensions following the US’s tariffs on Steel & Aluminum imports, the worsening diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia and ongoing turmoil within the US political landscape. Despite the 0.64% W-o-W decline on the main share Index, daily average turnover levels on the Colombo Bourse rose 69% W-o-W to average Rs.1.25Bn as Local Institutional and HNI remained active in the market (59% of crossings cf. 43% last week) and foreign investor appetite for domestic equities made a strong rebound.
Local Institutional and HNI investors made a stronger comeback in March relative to Feb when average participation levels fell to 24% cf. the 61% in Jan and 59% so far in March.
Interest in blue-chips dominated crossings turnover with HNB accounting for 47% of total crossings for the week, while JKH accounted for 22% of crossings. Meanwhile, relative to last week when Foreign investors recorded the lowest net buying for this year (Rs. 193Mn), Foreigners pumped in Rs 1.0Bn to domestic equities this week amid strong buying interest in counters such as JKH and HNB.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for directional cues from both domestic political developments and the US Fed’s interest rate decision next week.
Manufacturing and serviceactivity expands in Feb 
A leading indicator of economic activity in the Manufacturing and Services Sectors, the SL Purchasing Managers Index in February indicated expansion in both Manufacturing and Service activities with a reading over the neutral 50 index point level.
Manufacturing Sector PMI rose to 55.6 index points (cf. 51.7 in Jan’18) as Manufacturing activities expanded at a higher rate in Feb compared to Jan following a seasonal slowdown. While there was a notable expansion in the New Orders & Production sub-indices, all sub-indices of the PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signaling an overall expansion in manufacturing activities.
Moreover, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months. Services sector activities also gathered momentum over Feb (58.4 vs . 56.6 index points in Jan), supported by New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment and Expectations for Activity. Business activity in Financial Services, IT programming, and Transportation of Goods & Warehousing rose notably over the month while employment increased in Feb cf. to the decline observed in Jan.
Meanwhile, in a reversal of the dominant trend over the last 2 months, Backlogs of Work declined in Feb’18 while optimism on the three-month business outlook strengthened modestly. In its latest Mission statement meanwhile, the IMF noted that Sri Lanka’s economic recovery is set to continue with the economy gradually normalizing post the weather-related shocks in 2017. The IMF noted that GDP growth is estimated to rise to 4.4% in 2018 while Inflation is projected to revert to around 5% by end-2018, as food prices stabilize.
