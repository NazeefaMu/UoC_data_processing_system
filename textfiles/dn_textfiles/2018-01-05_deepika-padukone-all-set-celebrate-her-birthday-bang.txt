Deepika Padukone all set to celebrate her birthday with a bang

The internet was buzzing with pictures of our favourite stars holidaying in exotic lands celebrating the new year. While the holiday season is almost over, Deepika Padukone has a lot more celebration to look forward to. The actress turns 32 today and she’s got some amazing getaway plans. No points for guessing that her partner in this would be alleged boyfriend, Ranveer Singh.
The much-loved couple is off to Sri Lanka to celebrate Deepika’s birthday.
According to sources close to the couple, the two have a lot of adventurous things on their itinerary. “The couple is going snorkelling, and will spend time with each other," informed the source. This is not only a great way for the couple to spend time with each other on her birthday, but it also gives the two an easy getaway after the Padmavati controversy. Now that the film has been given the U/A certificate by the CBFC after a few modifications, Deepika and Ranveer can relax and spend some quality time together in the exotic land of Sri Lanka.
We sure can’t wait to see some fun pictures from the couple’s vacation on the island.
