Launch of emergency mobile app
Ragging should stop - Minister

Ragging at higher education institutions should be done away with promptly in order to ensure an ideal education environment, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister was speaking at the launch of an ‘Emergency Safety Mobile App’ to curtail ragging in universities, at the Higher Education Ministry yesterday.
The University Grants Commission (UGC), which stands for zero tolerance of all forms of violence in universities, has developed this app in collaboration with the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). The app has been developed for university students and academic and non-academic staff to be used in emergency situations of violence, including ragging and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).
The mobile app can be downloaded free of charge by undergraduates or by staff and can be utilised at any instance of ragging. If a particular student or any student close by is subjected to ragging, that particular student can inform authorities by pressing a button on his or her phone. Then relevant authorities take prompt action in this regard.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said that the Anti-Ragging Act should be implemented immediately to curtail ragging. It is the duty of university management to make use of this Act.
“In line with the launching the mobile app, the university administration should take measures to utilise the Anti-Ragging Act,” State Minister Grero said.
