Essex pair Lawrence, Porter win awards

LONDON: Dan Lawrence and Jamie Porter won Cricket Writers' Club awards for their key roles in Essex's County Championship triumph this season.
Lawrence was voted the 2017 CWC Young Cricketer of the Year, while Porter earned the County Championship Player of the Year award.
Both Lawrence and Porter received their awards at Tuesday's annual CWC lunch in London, one day after hearing they will be touring Australia with England Lions next month.
Lawrence scored 761 runs this season at an average of almost 45, including three hundreds and three fifties, to help newly-promoted Essex win the championship for the first time in 25 years.
The 20-year-old is the first Essex player to win the award, restricted to England-qualified players under the age of 23, since Ravi Bopara in 2008.
Seam bowler Porter, 24, took 75 wickets at under 17 each in Essex's unbeaten First Division campaign. AFP
