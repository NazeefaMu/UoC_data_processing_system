Decades of distinction

I pen this article to chronicle the forty-year political journey of visionary, unselfish, outstanding, and charismatic gentleman politician par excellence, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He was born as the second son of Esmond Wickremesinghe and Malini Wickremesinghe on March 24, 1949. He has three brothers and one sister. He received his primary and secondary education at Royal College, Colombo, and graduated from the University of Colombo. He got married to Maithree Wickremasinghe, a Professor of English at the Kelaniya University, in 1995.
Ranil Wickremesinghe is truly a leader of the new independent era. He was elected to Parliament in 1977 General Election from the Biyagama seat at the age of 28, having worked in the Youth League of the UNP from his university days. As the youngest politician of Sri Lanka at the time, he held the post of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Jayewardene. Very soon, in recognition of his exceptional talents and unique capacity for work, he was appointed to the Cabinet as the Youth Affairs and Employment Minister. Later on, he was given the portfolio of education. Then in 1989, as a seasoned legislator, he was made the Leader of the House under President Premadasa. He also served as Industries, Science and Technology Minister.
Nationwide achievements
From 1977 to 1994, during the 17 years that the UNP was consecutively returned to power, Ranil Wickremesinghe, as a dynamic young politician, had a crucial impact on the development of the country. He is still considered to be the best Education Minister of the country owing to the radical educational reforms he initiated in the 1980s aimed at the qualitative improvement of school education (with a special focus on English, Technology and Computer skills) and the Education Administrative Service. He energised the young people in Sri Lanka with creative, motivational as well as skill development programmes through youth clubs (Yovun Samajas) and youth camps (Yovunpuras).
Later on, as Industries, Science and Technology Minister, he was responsible for Sri Lanka's second round of economic liberalisation that commenced in 1989 with the focus on financial de-regularization and industrial promotion in rural areas through infrastructure development and the institution of industrial estates. As the MP for Biyagama, he dramatically developed his electorate to become a modern model suburb with brand new carpeted roads, electrification schemes, water and sanitation projects, schools, community centres and other infrastructure inputs. He also established the Biyagama Free Trade Zone to provide employment for thousands of young men and women in a range of industries.
Prime Minister of the country
Ranil Wickremesinghe holds the record of being sworn in as Prime Minister for four times in the country’s history (May 1993, December 2001, January 2015 and August 2015) whilst Dudley Shelton Senanayake and Sirimavo Bandaranaike had been appointed three times. It is important to note that Wickremesinghe possesses experience performing his duty as Prime Minister under three different executive Presidents. First under D B Wijetunga, next under Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and currently under Maithripala Sirisena.
During his tenure as Prime Minister, he has achieved quite a few milestones. The most remarkable achievement was during the crucial period of war. Then the country was facing numerous problems due to the brutal war. He took a bold step to sign a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE that is still being considered a breakthrough in defeating the cruel terrorist outfit. In every term as Prime Minister, he has contributed a yeoman service to the country.
Moreover, in the present national coalition government under the President Maithripala Sirisena, he is playing a major role in several aspects especially the constitutional reforms for the prominent issue of the country as they pledged in their election propaganda. He also takes remarkable steps to the country’s economy, education, foreign affairs and trade as a whole.
Commitment and interests

He is an avid reader - devouring books and web articles/news related to regional politics, international affairs and world history on his cherished iPad.
