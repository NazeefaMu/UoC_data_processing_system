Cabinet approval to import 50,000 metric tons of rice

Sathosa received Cabinet approval to import 50,000 metric tons of rice to cover expected rice shortages in the near future.
The Yala season rice harvest this year had fallen by 50 percent as a result of the drought which had led to a possible shortage of rice in the market until December this year.
Of the total amount needed, 100,000 metric tons have already been imported from India and a committee is to be appointed under the leadership of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to make arrangements to import the remaining 400,000 metric tons.
The above was proposed through a joint proposal by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathuideen, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and International Trade and Development Strategies Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
