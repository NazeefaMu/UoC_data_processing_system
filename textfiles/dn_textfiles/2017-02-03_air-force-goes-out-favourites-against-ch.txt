Air Force goes out favourites against CH

Air Force SC will go out as the favourites to overcome the rejuvanated CH and FC side in their second round Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby match which will take place today at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana. Kick of will be at 4.00 pm.
Airmen thus far is the superior side and managed to win several key matches including the Kandy SC match of the first leg at Ratmalana and losing against Havelock’s SC after a close game in the ongoing league tournament, while the CH and FC has lost all their 12 matches played to date and look a jaded outfit, But they might look into give an improved performance through their third row forward and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa who leads them from the front like they did against Police last week despite their narrowly lost by 21 points to 26 in the end.
CH and FC will most probably will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Police SC.
