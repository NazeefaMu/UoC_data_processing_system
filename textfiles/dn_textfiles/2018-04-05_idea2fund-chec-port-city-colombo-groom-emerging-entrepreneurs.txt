The 7 shortlisted Sri Lankan start-ups from the second round presented their ideas to MTI Consulting CEO Hilmy Cader.

Based on the overall evaluation and fine tuning of the start-up concepts, the final shortlisted entrepreneurs will proceed to the ‘Investor Linking Stage’.

The combined recipe of MTI’s strategic advisory including implementation support and investor linking will lead to the formation of new start-ups that will generate more opportunities and add value to the economy in the future”, said MTI Consulting CEO, Hilmy Cader.
