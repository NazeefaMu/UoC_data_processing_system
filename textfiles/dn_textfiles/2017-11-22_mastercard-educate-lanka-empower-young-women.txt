Mastercard - Educate Lanka  empower young women

Mastercard and Educate Lanka presented the first batch of Mastercard sponsored scholarships to educate female students from socioeconomically marginalized backgrounds at a ceremony held recently in Kandy.
Mastercard had partnered with Educate Lanka earlier this year to initiate the scholarship program, as a part of its “Doing Well and Doing Good” initiative to empower young women in Sri Lanka.
“We are excited to have taken the first step towards a deeper collaboration with Mastercard to create an inclusive and equitable society and look forward to realizing the full potential of our collective visions. This is also an opportunity for us to demonstrate the efficacy of a sustainable and impactful corporate-social partnership model in helping Sri Lanka to advance its socioeconomic targets and meet its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Manjula Dissanayake, Founding President of Educate Lanka.
In addition to offering financial assistance, the program also provides mentorship, skills training, career and leadership advancement, and employment opportunities through Educate Lanka’s complementary programs. This helps ensure that the students have the best opportunities for a successful life. The program also allows them to learn directly from members of the Sri Lankan business community, thereby directly enhancing their wealth of knowledge and employability.
“Mastercard has always been about creating a lasting positive impact and a brighter, more inclusive future. Our partnership with Educate Lanka helps us accomplish these goals through the power of education. This will also help create a stronger workforce and increase the nation’s global competitiveness. We congratulate the first batch of scholarship recipients who are striving to end the cycle of poverty and reaching for a better life,” said R.B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager – Sri Lanka & Maldives, Mastercard.
Educate Lanka is the brainchild of Manjula Dissanayake, who identified that despite Sri Lanka having a universal education system, poverty still keeps students away from the opportunities they deserve. Realizing that education is the key to a prosperous future, he founded Educate Lanka, which has provided funding from secondary through higher education for more than 1,000 students since 2007.
