Super Stars who contributed towards a worthy cause

Super Star Veterans won the Football for Peace and Charity International Veterans Football Tournament 2017 organized by Football for Peace Sri Lanka in collaboration with Muthuwella Veterans Club which was held at the City Football Complex grounds over two days.
But the real ‘STARS’ were the players of all nine teams who took part in this tournament for a worthy cause of contributing towards the needy children of this tiny island.
It really touched the hearts of the small crowd gathered at the City League Grounds when a group of needy children from Wellampitiya Ash Shifa (Children with Special Needs) and Prithipura Children Home displayed their skills of dance and extending their appreciation to the untiring efforts of the Football for Peace Sri Lanka headed by Muheed Jeeran for organizing such an event to help the needy children alike them.
And nearly 200 players from nine clubs namely FC London Red and White from England, United Veterans Kolkata from India, Super Stars Veterans, Maligawatte Veterans, Java Lane Veterans, Aluthkade Veterans, Old Peterson Veterans and Muthuwella Veterans were the real ‘STARS’ as they generously donated their share through entry fee.
London FC fielding two teams paid an entry fee of Rs. 50.000/- and the other seven teams entered the fray with Rs. 25,000/- as entry fees.
All in all Rupees 220,000/- was collected as entry fees with few donations from well wishers who wants to remain anonymous and the Champions Super Star Veterans, 1st runner-up Kolkata United Veterans, 2nd runner-up Java Lane Veterans and the 3rd runner-up Maligawatte Veterans all fulfilled their promises by donating their prize money to the needy children. It not only showed their sportsmanship but also their humanity.

Coming back to the game of final of the Peace and Charity International Tournament Super Star Veterans beat fully tired United Veterans Kolkota FC from India by 5 goals to 1. But both the winner and loser expressed that they had played for a worthy cause and the result does not matter at all. What a great gesture it was.
Of course the Super Star Veterans in their ranks had ten former Nationals players including three players who still play for reputed clubs taking part in the Champions League and FA Cup tournaments and they were too strong for the Indian team who had to play five matches in a single day.
