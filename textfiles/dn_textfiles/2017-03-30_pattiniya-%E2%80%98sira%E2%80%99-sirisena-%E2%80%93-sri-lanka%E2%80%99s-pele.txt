Pattiniya, ‘Sira’ Sirisena – Sri Lanka’s PELE

To reminisce about P. D. SIRISENA, the wonder boy of Sri Lanka soccer in the 1960s and early 1970s is to say quite honestly that he was to Sri Lanka , in our own microcosm, what the great PELE was to Brazil. On the 7th of October 1940 was born to PATTINIYA DURAGE ODIRIS PERERA and EMULIN PERERA a baby boy who they named PATTINIYA DUARGA SIRISENA. it is said that even at birth Sirisena had the knack of kicking his feet about and there was something amazing the way he did it. He probably was signaling that here was a football champion in the making for the country. He was destined to be the king of the football field here and abroad. The magic he wove when he had the ball at his feet was what the greet Pele was known for. In over a dozen years of football for his school Maradana Central College, Saunders Sports Club and Sri Lanka, he dazzled, dribbled, body swerved, sent the opposing defenders including the custodians the wrong way to hit the nets. It was done PELE style.
A fabulous future
There is no other beauty in football than to see a player with dribbling ability. Spectators go into raptures when a player dribbles past opponents and scores goals. Sirisena during his reign was eye catching with speed, body swerves, magical work with both feet. No surprise that many a defender and team was unable to stop his artistry. They watched helplessly.
In the Lankan game there were many other wonderful dribblers such as Nithi Nicholas, Edward Wickremasuriya, Denzil Walles, Judy Preena, A. Zaninulabdeen, Karunapala and Andrew Fernando, K.D. Somapala, Azeez and Subani Hashim Deen who spectators flocked to watch, but Sirisena was monarch and unparalled.
From the time he knew what a football was, he took to the game like a duck to water. He was fortunate to be being born near Price Park, which was the cradle of Saunders Sports Club-- the birth place of many outstanding footballers. He began to impress all watching with his passion, discipline and his dexterity with the ball at his feet and they all predicted a fabulous future for this youngster. And he did not let them down as he began to grow in stature.
After having shown his class at Price Park he joined Maradana Central College and it did not take long for him to show his team mates how to play to win. In those days fans flocked to venues where inter-school, Playgrounds, club matches and when international teams played to watch and soak in the excitement that was tremendous. Famous venues other than for the school and Playgrounds were the Army ground at Echelon Square, Government Services Ground at Parsons Road and of course the Prince of Wales Ground, which now stands the Sugathadasa International Stadium. Sadly the Army Ground and Government Services Ground are no more. Where they stood now stand the Galadari and Cinnamon Lake Hotels.
Unlike today, supporters and fans knew the dates and the venues. When it was known that Sirisena was in action in an inter-school game, crowds would flock to watch Sirisena’s artistry and he would not let them down. He won games for his school scoring match winning goals and making them champions. In that time St. Benedict’s College famous for football too had a master dribbler in Denzil Walles. But sadly at that time these two schools did not play each other, otherwise it would have been a blockbuster watching the two magicians spinning their magic with the ball at their feet.
National honours
At Price Park as a youngster Sirisena watched and learnt from some the greats such as Azeez, Richard, Ismail, Wilson, Nandasiri, Podiappuhamy, Eric Perera, T.O.M. Deen and ‘Petha’ Premadasa. Azeez was a penalty specialist. It is said that he carried an explosive in his right foot when taking a penalty and no goal keeper would dare attempt to stop it. One custodian Benedictine Vijaya Silva dared saving a penalty from Azeez, feared to put his hands but kneed the ball and for a few weeks he was seen sporting a bandage at school and limping for days.
After a successful school career in the game, Sirisena was an automatic choice for the famous Saunders Sports Club, which club had a number of national caps. The Club dominated soccer in the country. Football Association Cup which was the cup of cups to win saw Saunders who were tagged the ‘glamour boys’ carry it way every time they entered the finals. ‘Sira’ as he was fondly called played for them as a schoolboy with their greats and many a time outshone their more senior and brilliant players. He with his scintillating ball play struck many a winning goal for them. Goalkeepers it is said used to shudder when Sirisena had the ball at his feet. In the 1960 FA cup he scored two dozen goals in 6 games.
National honours came his way as a schoolboy and he played for the country 35 times and captained the team for 7 years which was record. He toured countries like India, Pakistan, Israel, Burma, Holland and Thailand and broke the ice by being the first Lankan to be invited to play for a club in Holland – Arc Hercules Ist division league champs in the country. While still a schoolboy he was picked to play against Zenith FC Russia . Although losing 2-5, he showed his skills by making the passes that helped Captain Peter Ranasinghe score both goals. Ranasinghe, an Old Josephian, was a gentleman footballer and led the team with aplomb. He also made the team Zenith FC from Dusseldorf West Germany watch in amazement by scoring two goals that was stunning which helped to hold the visitors to a 2-all draw which was great.
Pomp and pageantry
Coming, as I did from St. Benedict's, a school that was renowned for football and inter-school champions I would rarely miss a match. Those were the days when Albert Fernando a former Bens captain was the first Sri Lankan to train with Brazilian players of the calibre of Pele, Socrates, Carlos Alberto, Zico and Garincha coached St. Benedict's College. He obtained a trainer’s license from the home of football Brazil. One match I watched Sirisena putting on show his magic was in the Gold Cup final where he slammed all five goals against Colpetty United’s 4 after trailing at one stage. In addition to cricket which was my pet sport and wrote a lot, I also covered, football, hockey and basketball for the ‘Times of Ceylon’ as a reporter and later Sports Editor.
Football, then, was known as a poor man’s game in the country,. Successive administration did try as did the dynamic Manilal Fernando, to bring focus and distinction to the game as they launched a scheme to financially reward players and employ them. But Sirisena and his ilk carried the game on their shoulders without the pomp and pageantry that our sportsmen of today in Cricket especially are accorded. To me it seemed that to the soccerites of yore, it was the sport that mattered , and not making money.
When the great Sirisena hung up his boots after a glorious career, Manilal Fernando appointed him a Technical Director and he served in that responsible post with dedication until age caught up with him. Incidentally, former President of the country Ranasinghe Premadasa was also a Price Park player which is near Hultsdorf. He too had talent and would have made it to the big league, but preferred to take to politics and serve his countrymen. His son Sajith is now carrying on the tradition. Sirisena was a close confidant of Premadasa and in recognition of Sirisena’s great contribution to the game Premadasa named a ground at Maligawatte which is known as the P.D.Sirisena Playground. Premadasa also built the first floodlit R.Premadasa Stadium for cricket and the Indoor Stadium. His old school St.Joseph’s College has a pavilion in his memory.
It won’t be wrong to imagine that P in Sirisena’s first name stands for the legendary Pele of Brazil. Because Pattiniya was to Sri Lanka football what Pele was to Brazil.
