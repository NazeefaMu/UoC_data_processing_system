Riu Sri Lanka in CSR initiatives

Riu Sri Lanka, an all-inclusive resort with 501 rooms, recently held a tree planting and beach cleaning program as part of its social and community responsible activities (CSR). The resort is confident to take part in similar initiatives in future.
One of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is environmental pollution, which is occurring on a vast and unprecedented scale around the globe.
Riu Sri Lanka with a motive to contribute to a ‘cleaner and greener’ environment focuses on two major challenges air pollution and water pollution and strongly believes in giving back to the local community. The hotel planted king-coconut trees with the participation of government officials, staffs and locals. Planting trees undoubtedly produce clean air, reduce carbon, and provide shelter to birds and other wildlife.
The hotel also recently spent a day together with its staffs in a beach cleaning activity and many of their guests volunteered for this worthy cause too. Tons of rubbish especially plastic find its way into the world’s oceans every year and it is causing significant threat to marine life and sea birds. Riu Sri Lanka is the ideal destination for a family.
