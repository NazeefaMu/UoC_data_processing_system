Thomas, Sangakkara guide Tallawahs to win

Man of the Match Oshane Thomas whose searing pace dismantled St Kitts & Nevis Patriots’ chase and Kumar Sangakkara guided a spirited Jamaica Tallawahs to a 41-run win in the Caribbean Premier League match played at Kingston, Jamaica.
Sangakkara kickstarted the innings in the fifth over against Ben Hilfenhaus, riding a pair of streaky shots that fell safely as he carted the Australian for three fours and two sixes in a 24-run over. He routinely used his feet to combat the Patriots’ spin trio of Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Nabi and Tabraiz Shamsi. When he wasn’t charging forward, he got creative within the crease, shuffling back and across to disrupt their lines with a series of flicks and scoops. By the end of his innings, he’d racked up his third consecutive half-century.
Scores: Jamaica Tallawahs 157-5 in 20 overs (G Phillips 31, K Sangakkara 69, R Powell 43, S Cottrell 2/38)
St Kitts & Nevis Patriots 116 in 17.5 overs (E Lewis 40, Mohammad Hafeez 21, O Thomas 3/31, K Santokie 3/10, Mohammad Sami 2/10)
