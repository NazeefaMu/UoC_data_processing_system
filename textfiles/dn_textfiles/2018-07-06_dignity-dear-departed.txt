Dignity to the Dear Departed

Disaster strikes us oftentimes, uninvited. Once arrived, it leaves rubble with quite much to attend to. Buildings collapse, and they can be rebuilt. Trees fall down, and they can be replanted. Materials smash up, and they can be repurchased. Can the same be said about the humans?
The humans matter above everything else. It wreaks havoc when a post-disaster death toll swells in cancerous proportions. Disasters come with the inevitable consequences of death. One remedy is available for disaster-led deaths: dignified management of dead bodies. This field of study requires an exclusive attention of the regional emergency response services. A number of organisations, both at government and non-government levels, enter the ground to work on the most important task at hand, managing the dead bodies.
The dead cannot speak. They are lifeless remains of a life. Yet, they deserve dignity. Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe, who was instrumental in establishing the Trauma Secretariat, maintains that Sri Lanka’s foremost lesson of the dignified management surfaced with the Tsunami which struck the country in 2004.
“I remember about 35,000 bodies were piled up. The disposal was a tough job. The even tougher issue was on how to dispose of the human remains with dignity. The government in its own right contributed to an honourable burial. The Health and other related ministries were called upon to assist the dignified disposal of the dead bodies.”
Dr. Jasinghe reminisced this at the third Asia Conference on Regional Cooperation and Policy Development on the Management of the Dead in Emergencies organised by the International Committee of Red Cross Sri Lanka Branch to explore the contemporary options of the dignified management. The conference provided the institutions responsible for the management of the dead in disasters with the information and tools necessary to identify criteria and the set of actions needed for the development of policies and formulation of strategies. At the same time, the meeting offered a platform to follow up on discussions held in the first two editions of the Conference and to promote greater regional cooperation. The event also coincided with the introduction of ‘Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: a Manual for First Responders’, a joint publication by WHO, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The first edition of the manual, published in 2006, was developed after the tsunami. It has since been used widely around the world and is the most downloaded document from the World Health Organization website whenever a natural disaster occurs.
Policies
The development of policies for the proper management of the dead ensures that the bodies are handled with dignity, managed properly to restore their identities and returned to their relatives and their societies in cases of disasters. The Conference was graced by the representatives from forensic institutions and institutions dedicated to disaster relief, as well as other relevant institutions. Representatives from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Philippines were in attendance.
Sri Lanka has evolved quite much in the post-disaster dignified management of dead bodies. Yet, the country has more room to improve in Dr. Jasinghe’s opinion. The common man’s attitude, for that matter, needs to change which is mostly centred around myths.
“Most people believe that cadavers spread epidemics. This is a myth caused by the intricacies of cadaver management. The cadaver management is a basic requirement of the dignified management. For that, we need to eliminate the common myths. Even if the person had died of an epidemic, the cadaver does not spread the disease,” Dr. Jasinghe emphasized.
The management of dead bodies, because it needs to be executed in a dignified manner, requires the intervention of several international organisational bodies. According to ICRC Regional Forensic Manager Jacqueline Rodriguez, the ICRC provides financial as well as technical support to establish a connection between the family members separated from their loved ones. The most essential ingredient in establishing the connection is the proper and dignified management of the dead in disasters.
Natural disasters can have catastrophic consequences, causing large numbers of deaths, observed Ravindra Fernando, who is Emeritus Professor of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at the University of Colombo. Local organisations and communities are usually the first to respond to a disaster, which includes rescuing and caring for survivors and managing the dead, Professor Fernando added.
The first responsibility of the dignified management rests with the first responders. Wherever the disaster takes place, the first responders are required to follow simple, practical and easy guidelines in order to complete the initial stages of dignified management of the human remains. They take the foremost steps which assist the forensic experts who will be in the scene, though not anytime sooner, to establish the connections of the missing people. The task of the first responders, so to say, is absolutely a necessity in the dignified management of dead bodies.
Who is likely to be the first responders? The residents, most likely. And then the volunteers from various organisations followed by the local authorities and communities. The forensic experts might probably be the last to arrive in the scene given the gravity of the disaster. Which is exactly why the first responders should get into the job straight away.
Lack of training
Most first responders are not trained to handle dead bodies, but there is a lot that they can do to give the best possible chance to investigators to identify the remains of those killed.
“Dignified management of the dead is a key component of disaster response. Lack of awareness of the persons who handle the dead bodies is a major problem. These first responders need simple, practical and easy-to-follow guidelines, ensuring that they can carry out this task in a proper and dignified way. This includes taking the necessary steps to aid future work by forensic specialists and investigators in identifying human remains and clarifying the fate of the missing,” Professor Fernando explained.
Unique code to each body
The first responder’s first task is allocating a unique code to each body. Second, they must take photographs and record data about each and every body at the earliest possibility. The third requirement is to place each dead body in a body bag. Fourthly, the bodies should be stored in an orderly manner.
These four steps, though seemingly simple, are the initiative of the long and arduous task of dignified management of dead bodies. This enables the identification of any missing person. But the process is not over yet. On a parallel track, a list of the missing must be formulated while gathering information on the persons mentioned therein.
This is homework that makes the forensic experts’ job easier. This homework needs done soonest possible, as dead bodies are subject to decomposition. When the forensic experts get into the scene, the completion of the preliminary stages helps the facilitation of the identification. According to the field manual, the first responders need not be the forensic experts themselves. But if they follow the basic steps to the letter, that will improve the forensic identification of the dead and hence enable them a dignified management.
“The first responders are key,” emphasizes Stephen Cordner, Professor of Forensic Pathology, who is also the lead author of the manual. “These people are first on the scene when a disaster strikes. They can follow the simple steps in this manual to make the work of the experts more effective later.”
The field manual employs drawings and photos that coach the first responders on handling dead bodies with dignity. Descriptions are succinct on allocating a unique code to each body, taking photographs, collecting and recording data about the body, placing it in a body bag and storing bodies temporarily. The first responders are also enlightened on the safe handling of bodies of people who died from an infectious disease.
The manual has been made use of in many settings. It has offered guidance to many teams working on recovering the bodies of hundreds of migrants who died in a boat that sank near the island of Lampedusa in 2013.
Yet, in Sri Lanka Professor Ravindra Fernando observes a few hiccups in the dignified management process.
“The major problem in tidewaters is to search and collect the dead bodies, proper identification, performing quick but thorough autopsies and release the bodies to the relatives. Lack of trained staff and resources are the challenges we face,” he explained.
Despite a few hiccups, the country is faring much better than it did a few years ago.
“Since the Tsunami tragedy in 2004, we are better prepared and equipped to deal with such catastrophes. Sri Lankans are now trained to face such disasters,” Professor Fernando added.
Post conflict, the Red Cross registered more than 34,000 tracing requests from families whose relatives had gone missing. They currently have a caseload of over 16,000 tracing requests people island-wide, back to 1990.
Between 2014 and 2015, the Red Cross carried out an island-wide family Needs Assessment with 395 families of missing people to identify their needs. This resulted in a detailed finding from the assessment and recommendations on how to address these needs. According to the majority of families interviewed, their most pressing need is to know the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives followed by the need for emotional support. Families also need help to restart their livelihoods and to deal with administrative and legal difficulties. The Red Cross has initiated that project of addressing these needs with a support programme implemented through local organisations.
The families of missing people experience a loss known as an ambiguous loss, which is defined by the state of uncertainty they live in. The Red Cross conducts lectures in universities on the concept of ambiguous loss to raise awareness of it with the aim of having it added to psychology and counselling curricula. The understanding of ambiguous loss is essential to provide families with emotional support to cope while they wait for answers.
The ICRC has also worked with the authorities to introduce the Certificate of Absence as an alternative to the death certificate in Sri Lanka for missing persons whose fate is yet to be ascertained. They also provide legal guidance on missing people in addition to the scientific process of identifying human remains.
Their worldwide role encompasses ensuring that the remains of people who died during the armed conflict, disasters or migration are handled with dignity and professionally managed. In the Sri Lankan context, the organisation trains the judicial medical community on the application of forensic archaeology and anthropology in the recovery, analysis and identification of human remains.
They also sponsor and conduct workshops to address challenges in the management of the dead in disasters. As part of a quality-assurance pilot project they are developing with the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, the Red Cross is providing technical expertise to improve existing facilities, build capacity, and to collect, centralize and manage forensic-related data.
