Construction of 707 model villages ongoing

Construction work has begun on 707 model villages countrywide with housing and attendant infrastructure facilities, by the Housing and Construction Ministry.
Under the Northern Province development scheme, 48 model villages would be built for the benefit of 251 families displaced by the war. The investment in this programme amounts to Rs 1,163.310 million.
A spokesman for the National Housing Development Authority said Rs 476 million has been spent to build 29 model villages with a complement of 1,071 houses. These model villages have been built in all districts under the Vavuniya Bogaswewa housing project, Welioya sustainable housing development programme, kidney patients housing programme, housing renovation programme, Weera Sumithuru housing programme, Sonduru Piyasa housing programme, Sevana aid programme and the Samata Sevana National Housing programme by providing low interest housing loans under the aegis of state banks.
Apart from this, several housing schemes for middle class families were coming up with state and private sector contribution. Four of these schemes are coming up at Wadduwa, Homagama, Jalathara and Ragama. Land allotments have been identified in other areas too to launch such schemes this year.
Under this programme, middle class families would be able to purchase a house at afforadable prices, the spokesman said.
