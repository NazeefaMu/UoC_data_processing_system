GMOA to strike if MOH-SLMC stand is  pro-SAITM

Tomorrow would be a decisive day, because the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) would take a decision on today at 4.00 pm to launch an island-wide strike, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday evening, he said the GMOA would launch an island-wide strike without prior notice, if the Health Minister attempts to sabotage Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Election which is to be held between January 23 and 24. At the moment, he is trying his best to prevent the victory of the GMOA representatives.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the SLMC and the Health Ministry (MOH) would present their stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court during the final hearings of SAITM case scheduled for today and tomorrow. The GMOA would launch an island-wide strike without prior notice if the stand is pro-SAITM.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said it was revealed that the SLMC is going to present illegal documents without the signature of its Registar, to the Supreme Court, stating that it is their stand. If this happens, it would be a pure violation of the Medical Ordinance.
The Health Minister and his two teams which contest for the SLMC Election, are trying their best to prevent doctors from voting. They are threatening them using social media, by not granting duty leave, organizing several hidden voting centers, and not giving parking facilities, The GMOA would take legal action against such persons through the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) and the police, he added.
