Going organic, growing vegetables at home
Homegrown milestone

The new Agriculture Minister in his first Cabinet paper is planning to promote organic agriculture. At present, 3,801 farmers in Sri Lanka are cultivating paddy under organic farming on 4,955 acres. The Cabinet paper, which aims to encourage farmers to cultivate organic farming will propose providing financial assistance to farmers to encourage them to use organic farming instead of giving them a fertilizer subsidy. The fertilizer subsidy will be granted to the farmers who use chemical fertilizer on their paddy fields.
This article is about growing organic vegetables at home. While Sri Lanka has a majority living in homes with modest land around, urban built-up settings are showing an increasing trend of apartments units. What this article shows is vegetables can be grown for domestic consumption in either setting with little investments.
As long as there’s sunshine and you spend five minutes every day to water your plants, you can really grow your vegetables, harvest and eat your ‘live’ organic nourishing vegetables within three weeks.

Organic Veggie Walls in schools
Often, schools find it hard to build or sustain an Edible Garden.
Students get to have their hands dirty: transplanting, soil mixture, watering and fertilizing their plants. They get to see and observe each and every plant every day. This is important for students’ learning: Observing the weather and the plants’ environment, plants’ response and caring for plants.

Kerala Smart Kitchen Gardens: Grow your own food at home
In a bid to motivate more people in the state to pick up organic farming and eventually grow their own food, the Kerala government has been introducing different agricultural programmes and schemes under its ambitious ‘Haritha Keralam’ Mission.
Now, the Kochi-based Vegetable and Fruits’ Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) has collaborated with the state government in a novel initiative, which will encourage more citizens to not just invest in organic farming, but more importantly, consume fresh, homegrown, and pesticide-free produces.
Through the ‘Grow Your Own Food’ (GYOF) programme, VFPCK aims to help interested households by setting up Smart Kitchen Gardens on their rooftops and has already partnered with city-based WRENCH Solutions, which will aid the organisation to source and distribute high-quality seedlings.
VFPCK has also recently kick-started a seedling production unit under a budget of 10 crore for the same purpose. VFPCK has also recently kick-started a seedling production unit under a budget of 10 crore for the same purpose.
The ‘Smart Kitchen Garden’ will reportedly comprise coir pith-based grow bags filled with compost instead of soil. These bags are being touted by the concerned authorities to be more productive than their regular counterparts sold in the market.
Polycarbonate greenhouse sheets are used which offer more durability. They can last up to 10 years, and also have an additional UV filter coating, which protects the plants from the excessive heat. For a nominal sum, WRENCH will provide all facilities, including the crops and panels,” said K Varghese Daniel, who is the CEO of WRENCH Solutions, to The New Indian Express.
The first-of-its-kind concept in the state is expected to be piloted in Kochi first, and will subsequently be launched across Kerala.
Smart watering tips for your vegetable garden
1. Water selectively: Only water if your plants really need it. Dig a small hole with a trowel (or just poke your finger in) to check for soil moisture at root level.
2. Time your watering: Water early in the morning to give crops time to absorb the moisture before it evaporates in the heat of the day. This also allows any water that gets on the foliage time to dry off before nightfall, helping to minimize problems with slugs and fungal diseases. Watering heavily now and then will encourage a more extensive root system than watering little and often.
3. Take careful aim: When watering by hand, aim at the base of plants where it’s needed. This will also keep foliage dry.
4. Tap water: Sink plastic pots or upturned bottles with the cap removed and the bottom cut off up to the rim next to thirsty plants such as squash. Water into the pot; the water will reach the roots instead of running off the soil surface.
Optimize vertical space

Your main challenge is how smartly you utilize your vertical space to double up the space you have on your terrace, make a plan on how you should do this, if you have walls, hang planters on it. Grow vegetable shrubs and vines like beans, squashes, gourds and tall tomato varieties near the walls and railings.
This way they’ll not only get support but also grow outside and upward and you’ll save a lot of your space. Use old shelves, racks to keep pots and buy pot holders, put them around the corners. On these you can grow herbs to improve the taste of salads and cuisines you’ll prepare, you can also grow a lot of flowers to appease ornamental views.
