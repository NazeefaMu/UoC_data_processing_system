Scary comb nails are  the latest fashion fad

We all live increasingly hectic lives, juggling heavy workloads and a lack of sleep. However, even the busiest of us might balk at the idea of a manicure that also doubles up as ten teeny-tiny combs.
Sounds bonkers, yet this vision has become a reality - thanks to some very creative nail art. The brains behind the latest striking trend is Nail Sunny , who, back in February brought us the evocative Kylie Jenner ‘baby fingers’ manicure .
This time, the Russian beauty salon have designed a manicure where tiny combs are attached to each nail - perfect if you’re always on the go...
The eye-catching nails were revealed in a tutorial posted by the salon, which showed how they can be used to brush through your hair.
In the video, we also see how this look is achieved by brightly-coloured extensions being added to each nail, before the teeth of the comb are drilled out.
Once this is done, each nail gets painted a different, cheery colour, for extra impact.
Nail Sunny accompanied their bizarre creation with the caption: “Brush nails - YAY OR NAY”.
Mostly, it was a “nay”.
“If they get caught on something your entire nail will rip off omg,” wrote one person, which is a good point, and one which has our eyes watering.
“Nay those are the ugliest thing ever,” another, more candid person added.
“This is frightening!” read another comment.
But there were people who pointed out that this design requires a lot of creativity and strong craftsmanship. Which is fair.
“Different...Thumbs up for creativity,” one fan wrote. Mirror
