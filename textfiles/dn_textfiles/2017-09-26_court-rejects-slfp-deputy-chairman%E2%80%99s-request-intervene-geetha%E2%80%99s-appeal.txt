Court rejects SLFP Deputy Chairman’s request to intervene in Geetha’s appeal case

The five judge bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday rejected the request by SLFP Deputy Chairman Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to intervene in the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe challenging the Court of Appeal judgement.
The Court of Appeal had issued an order in the nature of a writ of Quo Warranto declaring that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena observed that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii), the first respondent, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship of both Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
The court noted that permission has been given to Ihala Megagama Gamage Piyasena to intervene in the case and another party can not be allowed to intervene when the case is being heard.
Senior lawyer Ali Sabry PC appearing for Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena made a request that his client wanted to intervene in the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The petition was taken up before five judge bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Sisira de Abrew, Anil Gooneratne and Nalin Perera.
Senior Lawyer JC Weliamuna appearing for the respondents objected the request. He told court that such a request cannot be allowed as the petition is fixed for hearing.
