FCID to probe bank accounts of five senior SLAF officers

Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday, allowed the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to probe 40 bank accounts of five senior Sri Lanka Air Force officers when the case over the controversial MIG deal was taken up before court yesterday.
The Magistrate ordered managers of seven banks to provide details of bank accounts when the Attorney General’s Department sought court permission to scrutinise 40 bank accounts belonging to five SLAF officials in connection with the MIG deal.
