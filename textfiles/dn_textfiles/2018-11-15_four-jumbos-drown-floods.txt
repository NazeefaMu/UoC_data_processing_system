Four jumbos drown in floods

Four wild elephants drowned in the recent floods at Salambanchenai, Punani in the Kiran Secretariat Division were given a burial by the officials of the Wildlife Department and residents on Tuesday.
The residents said elephants usually cross the waterway to go to their habitat in Punani, Kirimichchai, Alankulam and Vakarai. However, due to the heavy rains, the four elephants could not cross and had drowned.
Residents had later appealed to officials to remove the carcasses of the elephants.
