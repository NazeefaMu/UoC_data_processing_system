Sports  Minister orders - Nine ODI players to return

In an unprecedented move, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera ordered nine Sri Lankan cricketers headed for India to play in the ODI series to turn back, as the squad had not been approved by the Sports Minister.
The Daily News learns that the nine players were at the Katunayake Airport on Monday night when they were stopped and asked to return.
When contacted Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the official request for approval of the squad was not forwarded to him on time.
The Minister said he had approved the squad yesterday afternoon.
According to the country’s sports law, all Sri Lankan national squads are subject to the Sports Minister’s approval.
Sri Lanka is currently engaged in a three–match test series against India. The ODI leg of the series in India commences from December 10.
