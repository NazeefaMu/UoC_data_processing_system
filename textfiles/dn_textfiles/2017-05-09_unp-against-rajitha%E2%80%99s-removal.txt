UNP against Rajitha’s removal

 
The UNP today stated that it is against removing Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha UNP headquarters, UNP backbencher Hector Appuhami said Minister John Senaratne has no moral right to make such a request.
"Minister Senaratne was in the vanguard of making the 'yahapalana' government and he was with us right from the beginning.
He speaks straight. He has undertaken a huge task on behalf of the people.
We, in the UNP, do not agree to his removal from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Minister John Seneviratne who joined the Cabinet later has no right to make such a demand.
We don't think that Dr. Senaratne made any wrong statement or anything against the country" he said.
