Dramatic Pride

Drama is at a high standard at St. Joseph’s College. The reason for this is that these boys are always looking to surpass their previous achievements. Dramatic Moves features the St. Joseph’s Drama Society for whom no challenge is unachievable. They are equal to anything.
Teacher in Charge Camilta Perera feels that drama is the intelligent choice.
“Drama is a great opportunity for these children. It encourages them to resolve conflict and consider alternative perspectives and recognize the varying roles and responsibilities that individuals have in our society. Allowing children to get involved in drama is a wise choice.” “It helps them to raise their self –esteem and develop character. It helps them to develop critical thinking skills. It helps them to develop social skills and talents. They learn firsthand the importance of team work, responsibility, commitment and hard work.”
“Children use drama to explore their own thoughts and feelings. It is very important for their emotional and social development as well. Drama can prepare a young person for life in ways that go beyond the academics,” said Perera.
Team Spirit
Actor Leeth Bonveev Meth Singhage, feels that at St. Joseph’s there definitely is talent.
“Well, we have a lot of born actors and a bunch of very talented kids. And what St. Joseph’s drama has done is, they have molded it up and made it something much more than just “a school drama society”. St. Joseph’s College has stage dramas that is of national and international levels
During this year’s inter house drama competition I saw many talented juniors who would no doubt be the future of Joes drama,” said Singhage.
Drama makes an individual a different individual says Singhage.
“It shows us what is acceptable and what is not. It definitely gets us ready to face the society and another important factor is that it helps us destroy that little stage-fright,” stated Singhage.
“I have approximately acted in just six dramas out of which three are public shows. I first took part in The Mousetrap by Cold theatre 7.
Then I took part in the Joes Inter-house Drama comp. where I was awarded the ‘Best supporting actor’.
I played Lucius in Julius Caesar for the Shakespeare Drama comp.
And the same year I acted as Peter Pan in Peter pan the musical- a grand production organized by St. Joseph’s college together with Cold Theatre 7 and St. Bridget’s convent.
After that I also acted in the Tempest playing ‘Ariel’. I guess it is quite an achievement the fact that I did all this in just two years of drama experience!
I think Peter pan the musical has been the best production done by Joes yet and It’s definitely one production that will never be forgotten,” informed Singhage.
Each and every drama competition/ production by SJC has been organized at a grand level. “It was through a lot of struggle that this was accomplished. School did give priority for drama mainly because of the society’s hard work and pressure. St. Joseph’s College is no doubt a school which is right at the top when considering drama. There is a pretty tight competition out there but Joes is always up for the race. Joes drama is open to anyone and everyone. This is what makes everyone at SJC join and continue with drama,” explained Singhage.
When getting into the skin of a character for Singhage it takes a lot of thinking rather than character exercises. “Once I’ve gotten into the right character and mood it’s easy for me to click in and out of it. I have never done a female role. But I’m pretty confident that I will be able to nail it if I ever get the chance because it’s still just stepping into that persons’ shoe,” feels Singhage.
The biggest strength of Joes drama is that team spirit which is extraordinary. With each drama comes a new family.
“Joes drama started kicking again in the year 2015 with the inaugural inter-house Drama comp. There onwards up until now Joes drama has been developing. My parents have always been the key to my success. Even in drama, my dad has been very helpful but right now he wants me to temporarily stop dramas till I’m done with O/L’s,” said Singhage.
Ups and Downs
President of the English Literary Union, Dilushka de Mel stated that the fact that they have a group of dedicated members who give their 200% and the old Josephians who are ever ready to support them is a huge strength.
“Through drama I’ve learnt to balance all my work so that I wouldn’t lose out on either my education or any other activity, which would be very useful once I go into the cooperate world,” said de Mel.
De Mel believes that St. Joseph’s College Drama is definitely one of the best and continuously keeps improving each year, saying that the mere fact that he has been taking part in dramas within college from grade 9 is an achievement to him.
“I think Peter Pan the musical, would be one of the most unforgettable dramas I’ve taken part in. Then again practices with the Shakespeare cast of 2016 were definitely an adventure of a lifetime. Seeing the talent and potential in my juniors I see a really good future in Josephian Drama,” stated De Mel.
He feels that the only issue that drama has faced in the past few years is the fact that parents tend to be reluctant to send their kids for late night practices.
“I see a talented group of young up and coming actors from St. Joseph’s College who would keep the school’s flag up high. The drama circuit is extremely competitive. Each and every school gives everything that they’ve got to get the title “Champions of the Annual Inter School Shakespeare Drama Competition” so it’s each school for its self,” pointed out de Mel.
Being the catholic boys’ school, St. Joseph’s College Drama has many restrictions when it comes to the dramas they do, due to reason such as the age differences between the actors.
“However we have done everything possible within the past five years whether it be a comedy, tragedy or a major production. It’s with pride that I say that most of the students doing drama manage to balance drama with their educational activities, and get extremely good results at all the examinations whether it be simple as a mid- term test or even Advanced Level,” added De Mel.
De Mel feels that every student should do at least one drama while in college, since there’s a lot that you can learn through drama. It helps definitely once you leave the safety of your parents. “When it comes to getting into the skin of a character, at first it was hard, but as you keep performing you tend to get a ‘thing’ for the character, and once you crack the character and understand it totally, the character becomes a part of you - all your character traits and mannerisms. You start becoming a part of the character. So you could say that it depends on how experienced and how well you understand your character,” explained de Mel.
De Mel feels that portraying female roles is a challenge.
“It’s definitely harder to portray a female than a male, especially since females should be portrayed in a way that it wouldn’t make the audience laugh. However it depends on the actor and his experience and abilities,” informed De Mel.
Although the cast starts off as complete strangers, towards the end of the production the entire cast becomes one huge family.
“All the Pettah runs, Koththu nights, Sleepovers at school and cast parties, all of this are what separate Josephian drama from the ordinary school drama society. This is something truly amazing and is the main reason why most of us continue to be a part of Josephian drama,” explained De Mel. Josephian Drama has definitely has had its ups and downs.“We just came out of a dark era where Josephian Drama was almost on the verge of fading away, because of the scarcity of talented actors. However, we managed to overcome that challenge and come back stronger than ever,” said De Mel.
Extremely understanding
Actor, Melanctha Cruse feels that sacrifices are a key factor for their success.
“I think that our drama society possesses many talented actors that have unique capabilities and we have very supportive seniors and old boys that always come and invest their time to improve our performances. I’ve learnt that in order to achieve something that you really want to, you have to be extremely dedicated and willing to sacrifice,” said Cruse.
The pool of actors has a unique set of skills and certain actors specialize in distinctive type of roles. Overall the society consists of a very talented group. “Drama is way more than what people see on stage. There is a lot that happens in order to prepare for a production. It teaches you the skills you need when you go out into society,” stated Cruse.
Shakespeare 2015 was a milestone for the boys.
“Personally, winning the Shakespeare drama competition in 2015 was my biggest achievement, because we didn’t get through the semi- finals in 2014. I thought I won’t be able to be a part of a cast that won the competition before leaving school. Apart from that, I would consider helping my house win the Inter house drama competition for three consecutive years as my achievement. The Shakespeare drama competition in 2015, we performed an extract from “King Lear.”It would definitely do down in the history of college because we won the Shakespeare drama competition after a drought of 10 years,” explained Cruse. Looking at the current juniors and the boys that have just started to be a part of their productions, Cruse feels that college drama is in good hands.
“In the past few years it was difficult to get people to take part in productions and numbers were considerably low, but this changed with the evolution of the Inter house drama competition. I think the seniors and the old boys put in a lot of work in order to help the juniors prosper. The inter house drama competition provided the juniors the opportunity to play lead roles and give them the required exposure to develop,” pointed out Cruse. The directors and seniors are extremely understanding.
“They make an effort to work around our schedule and this helps us balance our studies, sports and extra- curricular activities,” said Cruse.
Drama, Cruse feels is an amazing experience.
“It’s one of those things that an individual really doesn’t know until he or she actually tries it. It’s an amazing experience, the practice hours, the challenges, getting to really know your cast and there’s so much more to it. I think that if you’re a part of a school that does regular productions, you have to take part in at least one just for the experience,” shared Cruse.When stepping into the shoes of a character Cruse feels that it isn’t easy but at the same time it isn’t the hardest thing to do.
“You have to use your creativity and create a story for your character and really look at the tiny details of your character and your character’s motive. There are certain characterization exercises that we do in order to help us improve.
Personally, it was tough. The first time I played a female role was in 2015, and initially there was so much that I didn’t know.
Gradually, with the help of my directors and a few of my fellow actors I was able to pull it off. Looking back at it now I really appreciate the director’s decision to make me portray a female because I didn’t know that I was capable of playing such a role,” pointed out Cruse.
