Shane Watson teaches WWE legend John Cena cricket

Forty-year-old WWE legend John Cena has recently taken up on a new challenge. A change from the mainstream wrestling, the Doctor of Thugonomics decided to turn his attention to Australia’s favourite pastime.
Cena is currently in Australia to promote his movie ‘Ferdinand’, and while he was there he tried to learn as much about cricket as possible.
Former Australian skipper Shane Watson, and now Sydney Thunder captain, tried to impart and teach Cena as much as he could. The duo was seen having a good time.
Cena also took the effort to post the pictures on Twitter for his fans. He made a fun tweet too.
