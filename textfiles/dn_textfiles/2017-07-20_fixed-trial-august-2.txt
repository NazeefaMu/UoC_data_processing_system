Corruption case against Rohitha Abeygunawardena:
A corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was yesterday fixed for trial by Colombo High Court.
Accordingly, the case will be taken up for trial on August 2 and 3.

The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs. 41.1 million.In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to Section 23 (a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deemed under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva appeared for the Bribery Commission.
President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
