Writ petition by Perpetual Treasuries re-fixed for support

The writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Private Limited, a primary dealer in government securities, seeking an Interim Order restraining the Central Bank from taking action under the directives issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, was yesterday re-fixed for support on March 10 by Court of Appeal.
The petition had been filed by Perpetual Treasuries (Private) Limited, Perpetual Asset Management (Private) Limited and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Private) Limited through senior counsel G.G. Arulpragasam.
The petitioners further sought an order quashing the directives of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank dated November 7, 2016 in respect of the Perpetual Treasuries.
The petitioners stated that the directions issued on November 7, 2016 are unprecedented regulatory controls over a primary dealer by the Monetary Board and are disproportionate to violations and regulatory concerned cited in the petition. The petitioners said directions are unlawful, unreasonable, unjustifiable, arbitrary and capricious and are in violation of legitimate expectations of Perpetual Treasuries and were imposed without a fair hearing.
The petitioners stated that the directions were issued beyond the scope of Regulation 11(2) of the Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No. 1 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009.
The Central Bank, Monetary Board of Central Bank, Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, officials of the Monetary Board and several others were cited as respondents.
The petitioners stated that it is no longer possible to sustain operations without the risk of bankruptcy. Attempts to seek redress, clarification or relief have been ignored by the respondents. The petitioners have no other recourse than to seek relief from Court.
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank had issued directives against Perpetual Treasuries involved in controversial bond deals.
President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando with S.A. Parathalingam PC appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the Central Bank and the Attorney General.
