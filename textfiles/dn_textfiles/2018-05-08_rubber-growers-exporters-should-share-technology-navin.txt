Rubber growers, exporters should share technology - Navin

Countries that grow and export rubber should share their knowledge and technology and learn from each other to promote the industry, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking at the Global Rubber convention (IRSG ) at the Taj Hotel yesterday, he said the rubber growing countries should not look at each with suspicion.
“Raw rubber feeds a huge value added industry and some experts say that by 2025, the world would need 17 million tons of natural rubber. The IRSG prediction may be different but the world needs more rubber from a renewable source and this creates a huge opportunity,” Minister Dissnayake said.
“As a public leader and a policy maker, I have some concerns with the economic prospects and future of rubber production. I have no issue at all with natural rubber, a wonderful versatile material,” he said.
Commenting on Sri Lanka, he said that one issue that he identifies is the long time duration for a rubber tree to produce latex in profitable volumes,” he added.
“A small fanner cannot wait for 7 to 10 years after converting his small farm, the only asset he owns, to get adequate returns. Even large investors with other options may think twice,” the Minister said.
“Arable lands are in high demand in Sri Lanka now. Especially in the wet rubber growing regions where other agricultural crops can be planted with better returns. One example is Oil Palm,” he said.
“There are other plants and crops that can produce natural rubber in commercial quantities and millions of dollars are being invested in R&D to promote commercial applications,” the Minster added. Minister Dissanayake said that in theory, rubber can be made profitable. In practice, most of our producers are unable to do so unless the prices are high.
“Global rubber industry players collectively manage an expanding industry with an estimated sales value of over 400 billion, spread all over the world from the South Pole to the North Pole.”
