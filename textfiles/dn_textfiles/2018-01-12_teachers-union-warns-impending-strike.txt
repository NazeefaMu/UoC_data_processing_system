Teachers Union warns of impending strike

The Ceylon Teachers Union warned that they would launch a trade union strike action if the education officials do not take action over Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Dassanayake who allegedly forced a principal to kneel.
The parents of a young girl had met the principal of a Tamil medium school in Badulla with a letter from the Chief Minister seeking the admission of that student. The Principal, however, refused to enroll the student by citing that she would only follow the instructions of the education authorities and the circulars regarding Grade 1 admissions.
“Upon hearing this, the Chief Minister summoned the principal to his residence where he had reprimanded her and threatened her,” Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin told the Daily News. “She was forced to kneel before him and apologize.”
Stalin said the union was concerned over inaction by the Education Ministry and had submitted a letter to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka seeking redress.
“We have also written to the President and the Governor, seeking their intervention,” he said. “Similar incidents have taken place in the past under a previous regime but it is up to the present government which banks on the promise of good governance to do good.” Stalin, however, warned that if their letters or requests are not heeded to, they would have no choice but to resort to trade union action next week.
