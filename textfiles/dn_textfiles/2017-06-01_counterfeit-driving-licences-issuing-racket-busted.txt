Counterfeit driving licences issuing racket busted

Six suspects arrested:
Six suspects who issued counterfeit driving licences were arrested along with 56 forged licences by the Organised Crimes Prevention Division (OCPD) at an office at Devanampiyatissa Mawatha, Maradana, yesterday.
OCPD officers earlier arrested a driving licence forger near RMV in Werahera.
They raided the forged driving licences issuing office at Devanampiyatissa Mawatha, Maradana based on information provided by him. OCPD OIC Janaka Kumara said the racket had been in operation for about 10 years. The suspects had sold forged licences to those who have failed practical and written tests conducted by RMV as well as to differently-abled persons.
They issued only light vehicle licences. The templates discarded by RMV in Werahera have been used by the forgers. The equipment used to prepare forged licences have been handed over to the Moratuwa University for testing.
