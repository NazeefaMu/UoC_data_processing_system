LOLC Green inaugurates Islandwide school tree planting program

LOLC Green recently inaugurated its islandwide schools tree planting program to promote the habit of tree planting and to raise awareness on deforestation and its impact to Sri Lanka, amongst the school children.
The program is part of a wider sustainability campaign implemented by the LOLC Group, under its Sustainability Committee, LOLC Green. The initial phase of the LOLC Green Schools Tree Planting Program was unveiled at the Liyangahawela Maha Vidyalaya in Bandarawela.
The first step of this wider program will see the planting of 3000 trees in 300 identified schools in all 25 districts. The 3000 saplings will be planted within the first 4 months of the project. The LOLC Group’s island wide presence through its network of 245 locations will be aptly utilised to drive this program.
Initially, 300 Schools have been identified within a radius of 5 kilometres to the branches of LOLC Finance PLC and Commercial Leasing & Finance PLC (CLC). Each branch office and its staff members have been entrusted to work closely with the administrators and the students of the selected schools to monitor and record the growth of the plants.
The LOLC Green Schools Tree Planting Program will be led by a project committee for every school comprising of the school Principal, Teacher in charge, Student coordinator and the LOLC Finance or CLC Branch coordinator. The plants will be sourced from the Agricultural Department’s regional nurseries and distributed to the selected schools by LOLC Green.
Speaking at the event, the Principal of the Liyangahawela Maha Vidyalaya in Bandarawela, Venerable Liyangahawela Rathanajothi Thera said, “The students, teachers and the parents of our school wishes to extend their fullest support towards this project.”
The LOLC Green Schools Tree Planting Program project head, Mohan Thilakawardena, Assistant General Manager of LOLC General Insurance said, “The overall goal is to create a greener Sri Lanka whilst making Sri Lankans live healthier.”
Following a stringent review and monitoring process at the end of the first year, LOLC Green intends to select the Best Branch amongst the LOLC Finance and CLC branch network and the Best School amongst the schools involved to present them with the LOLC Green Award for their outstanding efforts and contribution.
