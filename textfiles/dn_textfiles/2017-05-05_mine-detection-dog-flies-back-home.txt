Mine detection dog flies back home

Members of the sappers, Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE) of the Army bade adieu to mine-detecting German shepherd, Zira-Yankee during a farewell on the eve of the dog’s departure back to the US.
The dog served more than six years in Sri Lanka, having cleared over 62,680 sq meters of heavily mine-infested land areas in the North.
During her service here with her handler, Corporal T.K.D Rajapaksha of the Corps of Engineers, the dog, Zira-Yankee performed her duty in Manthuvil, and Ananthapuram at Puthukkudirippu, Vellamullivaikkal, Mahamilankulama, Kumburumulla and Komanthurai areas and managed to recover 16 anti personnel mines, one hand grenade, one unexploded explosive ordnance and three Rocket Propeller Grenades (RPGs).
Her departure was acknowledged on Sunday at the Chief Field Engineer’s Headquarters at Mattegoda after she was delivered back to Kimberly Mc Casland of the US-based Marshal Legacy Institute (MLI) by Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, Colonel Commandant, SLE in the presence of her handler, Corporal Rajapaksha.
Born on June 5, 2009 in the US, Zira-Yankee arrived in Sri Lanka on June 24, 2011 and underwent training until 12 December 2011 before she joined the Army de-mining teams on duty in mine-infested areas.
