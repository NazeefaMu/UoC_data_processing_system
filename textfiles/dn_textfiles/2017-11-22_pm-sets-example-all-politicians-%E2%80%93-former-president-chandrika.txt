A cross section of society including politicians yesterday hailed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for voluntarily appearing before the Commission investigating into the Central Bank Bond issue
They said that the Prime Minister deserves a special appreciation for setting an example to the country by appearing before the Commission.
“The Prime Minister’s appearance before the Commission marks the beginning of new era of governance where rule of law reigns,” they said.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga sending a personal message to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that his initiative will symbolize the beginning of new culture of free and democratic governance.

The message: Dear Prime Minister, Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! My homage to you for taking the brave decision to testify before the Presidential Commission. This is the beginning of Free and Democratic Governance.
“My unstinted support is with you in this most challenging task.

Building a just society and good governance -Ven. Dambara Amila Thera
This is what we expected to build a just society and good governance. It is a historic moment in the country and I would say even Asia that a sitting Premier under whose government the Commission functions in, voluntarily comes before them to provide evidence, states National Movement for Social Justice Convenor Ven. Dambara Amila Thera.
Ven.Dambara Amila said:”It shows that the law is equal to all and sets a good precedence. It shows that whether you are a monk, politician or Prime Minister, you have to adhere to the law- it is above all”.
“We respect the Prime Minister for doing such a thing and as people who helped bring the Yahapalana government into power, We are very happy with what he did,” the Thera said.
An example to country - Lakshman Yapa
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has set an example to the country by personally appearing before the Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond Issue on Monday.
“His initiative to go before the Commission shows that the country has witnessed political change,”he said. The Prime Minister could have given the testimony in a form of affidavit without appearing before the Commission in person. But, he appeared before the Commission. This is what the people of this country expected by electing the new Government in 2015.
First steps towards changing political culture - Viyangoda
Puravesi Balaya Convenor Gamini Viyangoda said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took the first step towards changing the political culture of the country. None of the previous leaders appeared for an inquiry or to give an explanation. During the previous regime, not even a Provincial Councilor or Pradeshya Sabha member was brought before the law.
“The Prime Minister is an exemplary figure to all politicians, when he was requested to appear at the Bond Commission, he willingly agreed to appear. As the Prime Minister of the country, he could have refrained from appearing before the Commission, but he did not do that,”Viyangoda said.
The Bond Commission does not come to an end with this but he helped the Commission to clarify some of the missing details. The Prime Minister proved to the country that he was not involved, however, legal action should be taken against the perpetrators who were involved in the Bond scam.
