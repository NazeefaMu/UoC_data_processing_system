BBDO Lanka wins Bronze at 2017 Tangrams Effectiveness Awards

BBDO Lanka was awarded a Bronze for Effectiveness at the 2017 Tangrams Effectiveness Awards held at Spikes Asia Festival recently at Suntec Singapore.
Asia Pacific's premier awards honouring outstanding marketing strategies that deliver real business results, the Tangrams Effectiveness Awards was held at the end of the first day of Spikes Asia 2017 in Singapore.
BBDO Lanka, together with BBDO Singapore, took home the award for their work for Anchor in Sri Lanka under the ‘Marketing Campaign for National Brand Development’ category.
Said BBDO Lanka Managing Director Santosh Menon, “The Tangrams champion work that drive businesses forward through their insights and innovative marketing strategies that produce solid results. The jury identifies the most thought provoking work that genuinely and measurably demonstrates how it engages consumers. We are delighted to have been honoured with this prestigious award for our first ever entry.”
BBDO Lanka and BBDO Singapore were recognised for their ‘No Excuses’ campaign launched in August 2016 for Sri Lanka's leading milk powder brand Anchor. The addition of the BBDO Singapore team brought in new perspectives and the vision for Anchor as a champion of human potential bringing Sri Lanka together was articulated with the line ‘Goodness Feeds Greatness'.
Research showed that whilst Sri Lankans were genuinely enthused about opportunities available to them in myriad avenues, they were nevertheless hesitant to make the first move. And thus the ‘No Excuses’ campaign was born, to spark this important conversation and to inspire people to reach within themselves to unleash their latent potential.
Said Menon, “BBDO Lanka combined with BBDO Singapore to bring the full prowess of the BBDO network to the fore for Anchor in Sri Lanka. We are proud to win this Tangram for Sri Lanka and to do work, for the brand, that is proven to work.”
“Over the years, we've been named Effie’s Agency of the year Sri Lanka in 2015 and Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine's ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year’ - Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015. This comes from our passion for creativity that we utilise to create ‘work that works’ for our clients and their brands. This award in particular gives us great satisfaction and pleasure because not only did we compete with the best in Sri Lanka but our case for Sri Lanka stands out among the best in the Asia-Pacific region."
Meanwhile Clemenger BBDO Melbourne, Australia, took home three coveted Agency of the Year trophies for Effectiveness, Media Strategy and Digital Strategy for being the best performing individual agency office in each award section. BBDO Worldwide was recognised as Tangrams Network of the Year.
BBDO Lanka is the Sri Lankan affiliate of the global BBDO network and soon after only its first year of operations was awarded Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine’s ‘Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year’ – Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015. In 2015, it was also named ‘Agency of the Year’ at its Effie Awards debut in Sri Lanka.
