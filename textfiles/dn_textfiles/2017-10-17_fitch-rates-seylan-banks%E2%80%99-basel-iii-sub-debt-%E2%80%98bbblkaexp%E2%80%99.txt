Fitch rates Seylan Banks’ Basel III Sub Debt ‘BBB+(lka)(EXP)’

Fitch Ratings yesterday assigned Seylan Bank PLC's (A-(lka)/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated debentures an expected National Long-Term Rating of 'BBB+(lka)(EXP)'.
The debentures will have tenors of five, seven and 10 years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the bank plans to use the proceeds to fund loan growth, strengthen its funding mix, reduce structural maturity mismatches and reduce its short-term borrowings.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
