Independence Day
 Sri Lanka celebrates her independence Once again with added vigour And enthusiasm Why? Because all Sri Lankans were free To be on par with the imperialists And other foreign rulers Now we are enjoying the full political freedom From foreign domination But are we enjoying full economic freedom? Not all- We still depend on the foreign powers For our essential food items Like rice which is our staple food Our rice production is so low and insufficient To meet our needs We still depend on western system of education Without adopting our own national system Based on our own religions and cultures Then how can we celebrate full independence In this condition of our reliance upon others’ traditions? We have added alien educational curriculum To our private degrees and diplomas At the cost of lakhs of dollars and pounds Depending on foreign employments Without any option for local vocations And without contributing or shares To local production for self sufficiency In economy. So let citizens of Sri Lanka be determined To free themselves from economic dependence In the future when we celebrate the next national Independence Day.

Modish Heads
Fashionable trends Moving all time Digressed from fate Attention way laid Empty free hours any Unspoken by many Lovers never meet yet fate Thoughts tension Agitate Pruned trendy heads Trimmed to style as said Leaving a bare pate awhile Making many smile Vivid hairy fashions In get and spiked passion Glued all together, milled Make look as if wild Heads remain styles differ Yet the bald heads prefer Time immemorial suffer As salons make offer

DREAM CAR
Turning into a reality Our dream car Finally did reach and Now resting proudly In front of our house; Allowing half of the land To go to another hand, Half of the house Letting a stranger invade And permitting a bank To keep an eye On our monthly earnings!

2017…..
 Don’t fire crackers, We can foresee this year too, The sun will rise in the morning, The moon will rise at night, There will be severe droughts, Followed by heavy rains, Bringing earth slips and floods, An increase in the number of refugees, Multitude of protests; On price hikes, communal problems; Port issue, elephant rampage, Establishing private medical colleges Same cycle of celebrations; Valentine day, mother’s day, teacher’s day, children’s day, Thaipongal, NewYear, Vesak, Poson, Ramazan, Hadji, Deepavali, winding up with Christmas, The wheel turns on and on. Some chameleons will change their colour, Some monks may disrobe, Mega may continue; sagas of Swapna, Shivanya, Me Adarayai Only change is the age So take things as they come Without a single hum The essence is the presence, 2017 is the copy of 2016!
