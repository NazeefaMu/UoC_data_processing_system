St. Joseph’s College annual prize-giving held

The 116th annual prize-giving of St. Joseph’s College, Colombo 10, was held recently at the Rev. Fr. Stanley Abeysekera Sports Complex cum Auditorium.
Addressing the event, St Joseph’s College Rector Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel said teachers who are used to traditional methods, have to be given proper training in the use of technology to impart knowledge.
“It has become essential to be conversant with modern technology in order to survive in the post-secondary education and business worlds. The government should invest more in the enhancement such facilities,” Rev. Fr. Gabriel added.
Old Josephian and Jetwing Group of Hotels Chairman/Managing Director Hiran Cooray was the chief guest and presented awards and certificates to students.
National Catholic Schools Director Rev. Fr. Ivan Perera, St. Peters’ College Rector Rev. Fr. Trevo Martin, other clergy and parents of students also participated.
