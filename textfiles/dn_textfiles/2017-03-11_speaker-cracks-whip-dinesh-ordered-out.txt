Speaker cracks the whip: Dinesh ordered out

MP Dinesh Gunawardena is no doubt a well-versed senior member in Parliament with experience spanning to over three decades. He is an old-timer who first entered Parliament from the 1983 by-election representing Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP).
He is the current leader of the MEP and also the Parliamentary Group Leader of the Joint Opposition, a self-proclaimed group formed by stalwarts of pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa camp.
Hailing from ‘Boralugoda family’, Dinesh has been playing a leading role in Parliament as a front bencher, and Parliamentary traditions and Standing Orders are nothing new to him. Being a seasoned politician of our time, there is little doubt that many new comers in our legislature would naturally look to him, despite varying political affiliations, to shape their own careers.
It was such a political personality who went down to new low this week to end up with one week’s suspension of Parliament service. Had it been MP Prasanna Ranaweera or Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma, as was the case in May last year following an in-house brawl, it might not have raised many eye brows. Yet, MP Gunawardena’s conduct in Parliament last Wednesday was unbecoming for his own stature, and that scene sets off alarm bells over the lack of discipline among our members representing the highest elected body in the country.
 
Speaker rejects Weerawansa's separation move
The ugly scenes in the House took place barely a day after a supplementary estimate of Rs 134 million was presented to Parliament to pay the newly approved monthly allowance of Rs 100,000 to each MP. The allowance of MPs for attending Parliament sittings has also been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 500. It was not long ago Speaker Karu Jayasuriya reminded the House that Rs 4.6 million is spent for a day to run a Parliament session, and urged the members not to waste public money by disrupting the sittings. 
Ironically, the ugly scenes in the House took place barely a day after a supplementary estimate of Rs 134 million was presented to Parliament to pay the newly approved monthly allowance of Rs 100,000 to each MP. The allowance of MPs for attending Parliament sittings has also been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 500. It was not long ago Speaker Karu Jayasuriya reminded the House that Rs 4.6 million is spent for a day to run a Parliament session, and urged the members not to waste public money by disrupting the sittings.
What preceded the chaotic situation in the House on Wednesday was the Speaker’s detailed ruling refusing to recognize five National Freedom Front (NFF) MPs led by Weerawansa as a separate group in Parliament. This in fact was a decisive ruling that would go down in the annals of history of country’s legislature.
The Speaker pointed out accepting the NFF as a separate group would set bad example which could ultimately lead to mushrooming of separate groups or parties other than that of their original party from which they have been elected to Parliament. He observed that this could eventually fail the entire parliamentary system and pave way for misuse of parliamentary privileges.
The Speaker however assured that he would take all possible measures to see that the rights of each and every MP are guaranteed.
Uproar in House
A tense situation erupted in the House following this announcement as MP Weerawansa agitated in the House requesting the chair to allow him to express his views over the ruling, and MP Gunawardena backed his colleague’s call. The Speaker did not permit this request maintaining that his ruling is final and that it could not be challenged or debated. Then again he stated he would allow MP Weerawansa to raise his concerns on a future date possibly within the same week, but the JO paid no heed.
The chaotic scenes followed next led to the abrupt suspension of sittings for three times and Parliament Police were called into the Chamber for the first time in recent memory.
After all it was not only MP Gunawardena, who misbehaved in the Chamber at that instance, but also NFF MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara. They too were seen repeatedly challenging the chair while flouting Standing Orders by storming into the well.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya tried his level best to plough through the day’s business giving repeated warnings to protesting MPs, but in vain. He came to a head when the JO MPs defied his orders hurling abuse at the chair with utterances such as “Shameless Speaker”, “What a shame”, and “Speaker is a puppet”.

At one time the seemingly miffed Speaker admonished MP Gunawardena stating, “You are a very senior MP and you should not behave like this. I remember, when you were the Chief Government Whip, you did not even allow me to stand up to move the Right to Information Bill. Now you try to preach us on freedom of speech”.
Police called in to remove Dinesh
The Speaker gave back to back warnings to MP Gunawardena and then ordered him out of the Chamber due to ‘severe breach of discipline’ using the powers vested in him under the Standing Orders. As MP Gunawardena did not obey and remained firmly seated, the Speaker ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him from the Chamber with the assistance of Parliament Police.
About 20 police personnel filed into the main chamber, while the Joint Opposition MPs numbering about 15 formed a protective ring around the seat of MP Gunawardena to prevent him being taken out. The Policemen stood close to MP Gunawardena but did not attempt to touch him. Then after about 30 minutes, the Police withdrew from the Chamber and the House resumed sittings.
It was at this point a motion was put before the House to suspend MP Gunawardena from Parliament for a week. It was passed with a majority of 63 votes, receiving 85 votes in favour and 22 votes against. Three abstained from voting while 114 were absent. The TNA MPs voted for the motion along with the UPFA and UNP MPs in the Government. The Joint Opposition group voted against while the JVP MPs abstained.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena walked out of the Chamber after the adoption of the motion and the JO group followed him.
Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando, who had been perusing old Parliament records to find out similar incidents in Parliament, told the Daily News on Thursday that the last occasion where police personnel entered the main Chamber to remove a member was far back in 1994.
“On January 18, 1994 the Police had removed Parliamentarians Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, Heen Mahaththaya Liyanage, Wijith Wijithamuni Zoysa and Reji Ranatunga from the Chamber. The Speaker at that time was M H Mohamed. Prior to that former Parliamentarian Sarath Muththettuwegama had also been removed from the Chamber by Police in 1985”, he said.
Debate on SAITM
Meanwhile, the SAITM issue also came to the fore in Parliament this week as members of both sides took the floor to air their different views on this subject.
The adjournment debate on the SAITM moved by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake attracted a lot of attention, while pro-SAITM and anti-SAITM groups held demonstrations in the vicinity of Parliament.
In fact, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe is a conundrum the former Government left behind for this Government to solve. However, the members of the former Government, now in the JO, have shown confrontational attitudes towards the SAITM expediently forgetting their role in its making.
The JVP voiced strongly against private universities, while the Government members were seen divided on the matter. Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekara were vocal against the SAITM, while Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and S B Dissanayake fought tooth and nail to withstand criticism directed at it.
The SAITM issue has resulted in headaches for the Government that it can no longer bury its head in the sand. Not a day passed without commentary or new development over this contentious issue that has been dominating the news cycle over the past days, arguably adding more fuel to the tensions rather than simmering them down.
For the cash-strapped Government grappling with much more serious issues such as the debt-ridden economy and hammering out a deal on vital aspects of Constitutional reforms, issues such as the SAITM could serve as distractions. Clearing the air of uncertainty on them would be of help for the Government to move fast to achieve its desired goals.
