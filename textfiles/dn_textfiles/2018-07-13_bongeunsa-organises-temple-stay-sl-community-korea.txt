A Special Temple Stay programme was organised by the Bongeun Temple in Seoul, in collaboration with the Embassy of Sri Lanka to South Korea recently, with the participation of Sri Lankan clergy, about 80 Sri Lankan employees living in different regions of Korea, as well as Embassy staff and their families.
On this first ever Temple Stay programme arranged for the Sri Lanka community, Bongeunsa Chief Incumbent Ven. Won Myung Thera and Sri Lankan Ambassador to South Korea Manisha Gunasekera delivered congratulatory remarks.
The programme included a cultural programme featuring the traditional tea ceremony of Korea, a musical performance by the Bongeun Korean Classical Orchestra as well as traditional Sri Lankan dance and bathi gee performances by members of the Sri Lanka Students’ Association in Korea and the choir of the Korea Sri Lanka Maha Vihara Temple in Korea.
Counsellor (Employment and Welfare) of the Embassy Jagath Batugedera made a brief presentation on the Diriya Maga awareness and counseling programme to the Sri Lankan employees present. Traditional Korean temple foods as well as Sri Lankan delicacies were served to the participants who received the opportunity to appreciate the unique temple culture of Korea.
Prior to the event, the Ambassador met with Bongeunsa Chief Priest Ven. Won Myung Thera and discussed issues of mutual interest.
