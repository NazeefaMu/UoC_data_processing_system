JVP, Government trying to postpone LG polls - Vasu

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is working hand in glove with the government in trying to postpone the local government elections, parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
Addressing a press briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance, Nanayakkara noted that the JVP is trying to postpone the LG elections by finding loopholes in the new proposed systems.
“Both the JVP and government wants the LG polls postponed as both fear heavy losses at an impending election. They are working hand in glove to postpone the elections,” he added. Nanayakkara said the joint opposition was planning an agitation campaign against the government demanding immediate measures to hold the LG poll without delay. Socialist Alliance member Raja Kollure said the government has failed to maintain law and order and underworld thugs seem to be running amok. Kollure said if steps are not taken forthwith the law and order situation could worsen, jeopardising the security and safety of the citizens.
