Serendib Flour Mills hosts ‘7 Star’ get-together for bakers islandwide

As part of its ongoing effort to engage with bakers across the country, Serendib Flour Mills recently conducted a series of get-togethers and meetings for bakery owners.
The events brought together small, medium and large scale business owners together and enabled them to learn more about the ‘7 Star’ brand and its key product values and properties.
The get-togethers focused on creating greater awareness about the ‘7 Star’ range of products, whilst highlighting the stringent best practices, processes and systems that are used by the company to produce the finest quality of wheat flour products.
These get-togethers so far have been held in Ampara, Marawila, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela and most recently in Galle and Matara. Serendib Flour Mills also hopes to host similar events across other key areas of Sri Lanka in the coming months.
Commenting on SFML’s endeavour to connect and collaborate with the country’s leading local bakers, Kalinga Wijesekera – Head of Marketing and Communications, Serendib Flour Mills (Pvt) Ltd, said, “Local businesses are important contributors to our economy and society and it’s important for us to support and work together with them.”
Recently two 7-Star wheat flour variants in the Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) portfolio recently received SLS certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), making 7 Star Flour, the first wheat flour brand in the country to receive the certification for meeting the necessary quality standards.
The ‘7 Star’ flour range has won the hearts of consumers across the island, and in a very short time period, the brand has become synonymous with value, nourishment, quality and trust.
Aside from enabling bakers to create tasty treats for their customers, the ‘7 Star’ products also ensure that consumers get optimal nutrition. The Fortified Flour products in the range are packed with essential nutrients and minerals and are ideal for creating wholesome items such as fish buns, rolls, patties and much more.
Operating from a milling facility at the Colombo Port, Serendib Flour Mills adheres to the highest standards of quality and safety, and implements stringent best practices and protocols throughout its entire operation.
