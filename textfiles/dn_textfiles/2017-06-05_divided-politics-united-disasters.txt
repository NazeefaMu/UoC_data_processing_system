Divided by politics, united by disasters

‘Divided by politics and hate speech united by disasters’ is an adaptation from a popular jingle featuring stars in the IPL in India.
The reason being recent floods showed a refreshing outpouring of civic consciousness and action by rich, poor, urban, rural, media houses and social media galvanizing to organise responses small, modest and big to help affected persons.
It was a re run of what we saw soon after the 2004 Tsunami. Some of the interventions are not necessarily what best practices prescribes. But you can’t fault the heart for trying. Nor should politics of self-interests nor bigoted messaging of hate stand in our collective way.
Our disasters
We will face disasters through floods, droughts, landslides, food shortages, water shortages due to climate change and potentially tremors/earthquakes downstream due to a fault line coming from the Himalayas.
“Climate change has emerged as a key concern for Sri Lanka and its people in the 21st century.
Sea level rise, warming temperatures, uncertain effects on forest and agricultural systems, and increased variability and volatility in weather patterns are expected to have a significant impact in the developing world, where people remain most susceptible to the potential damages and uncertainties inherent in a changing climate.” Source: National Physical Planning Policy and Plan. Sri Lanka 2006-2030 (final draft).
This necessarily means we need to act together to protect ourselves. Hence civic consciousness is critical and fundamental.
An abundance of which we have at present. But people are going to be tired if called to do so too frequently.
Policy
“Sri Lanka NEXT – Blue Green era”, aims at transformation towards a low carbon economy with 10,000 climate resilient villages will be set up, -“Punarodaya” 2016-2018 will establish Climate Resilient Villages and Climate Smart Cities, - Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) have been submitted, achieve 20% renewables by 2020.
It will be further increased by 2030, forest cover increased to 32% from the present 29% by 2020, Cabinet of Ministers has approved the setting up of an Independent Climate Change Commission to deal with climate related problems and issues. We are behind schedule in this process.
Awareness and Advocacy
A multi-pronged solution at all levels is a must in creating the required awareness and advocacy on all important topics i.e. Environment Protection and Conservation, IWRM, WASH, Climate Change, SDGs.
A good starting point is school education and curriculum development.
Existing Partnerships to consider are Lanka Jalani (LJ) – i.e. Area Water Partnerships, LJ and Girl Guides Programme, LJ and Boy Scout Programe, Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Religious Organisations trained in Disaster Relief Work, UNDP SL.
Promoting this slogan as a CSR –“Using Air Conditioning Sensibly, Switching Off Appliances and Equipment When Not in Use, Driving Greener Cars, Buying Energy-efficient Appliances, subscribing to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.” Some of us are mapping disaster prone areas with the intention of having on board households with mobile phones voluntarily in a data base to enable early warning messages to be targeted when needed with links to further back end information.
Ultimately it’s the poor, vulnerable who might be in the path of unfolding disasters who need to be equipped with information and options. The numbers are not huge and easily manageable.
Key considerations
• Conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of ecosystem structure and function are important climate change adaptation strategies because genetically diverse populations and species rich ecosystems have greater potential to adapt to climate change.
• National ownership on and leadership of the SDGs is vital, country will need to follow a whole-of-government approach, building broad coalitions around the goals will be crucial to achieving them, co-operation by sharing new ideas, knowledge, and technologies, and investment, leveraging Science and Technology to address national needs.
• Our physical attributes, elements of policy and COP21obligations need to be connected and implemented.
• Control of Greenhouse Gas Emissions / International Climate Change Protocols / Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
• Proactive Reforestation programmes and projects should be implemented to offset destruction of forest cover for development as well as to maintain required national Carbon Emission levels as per agreed upon global Climate Change Protocols.
• Effective monitoring of Carbon Emissions i.e. Pollution Mitigation through effective Transportation Policies.
• Mitigation of the Destruction of Marshlands and Wetlands:
• Flood Risk Management Policies and Action Plans should be developed underpinning Climate Change.
• Managing flood risk by striking for good balance between effective Urban Management and maintenance of existing flood mitigation infrastructures.
Technology
• Wherever possible adopt and adapt Technologies for local consumption. Utilization of the rapidly developing local mobile industry link up to the global “Disaster Response Programme” in improving network preparedness in providing effective coordinated support to humanitarian response and disaster affected communities (GSM / GSMA Foundation http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programmes/disaster-response).
• Implement locally developed “Low Cost Open Source Weather Station” technology. This technology provides capacity building in schools and Universities in the operations and maintenance of the technology. (http://iwmi.cgiar.org/tools/mobile-weather- stations/Mobile%20Weather%20Stations%20-%20Manual.pdf).
Partnerships
• Utilize existing National/Local Partnerships for research, development, mitigation and disaster risk reduction activities.
• Rainwater Harvesting – RWH should be considered as a “Silver-Lining” to Disaster Response in making it mandatory to include a RWH System in newly constructed housing. (http://lankarainwater.org/wp/ / http://www.unhabitat.lk/confagn.html).
• Address River Sand Mining issues– Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL)/Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB)/Open University of Sri Lanka.
• Water issues at the River Basin grass-root levels (Area Water Partnerships) – Lanka Jalani (http://lankajalani.org/ ).
• Water Management Research and Development – IWMI (http://iwmi.cgiar.org/), UNDP Sri Lanka (http://www.lk.undp.org/).
