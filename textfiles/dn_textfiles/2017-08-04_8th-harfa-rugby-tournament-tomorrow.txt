8th HARFA rugby tournament tomorrow

The annual rugby championship, called the Rugby Extravaganza organized by Hisham Abdeen Rugby Football Academy ‘HARFA’ will be worked off on Saturday and Sunday at Havelock Park. Every rugby lover is delighted to say that HARFA is running its 8th rugby tournament. This tournament is growing each year from strength to strength.
The tournament is likely to attract over 700 up and coming ruggerites from schools and rugby academies ranging from under 8 to under 20.
The teams expected to take part are: Summa Navaratna Royal Junior Rugby Academy, S. Thomas’ Prep, Thurstan College, Mahanama College, Lumbini College, Rasheed’s Kandy Rugby Academy, Synergy Rugby Academy, and schools from Panadura, Galle and Anuradhapura.
They are hoping to play an open (10 a side) and over 40 ‘Evergreens’ tag rugby tournament. No ‘A’ division players are permitted to play in the Open category.
Attractive awards including prize money are on offer to the winners and runners-up teams. Eight teams in the open category and six teams in the over 35 category will also participate.
Frenchmen and former Sri Lanka Army coach Jan Vlaskamp who is the Patron of HARFA is giving a big hand as sponsor. A keen rugby follower he has been a generous supporter and benefactor since the first kick off of the ‘HARFA’ rugby tournament. He donated a shield for the annual Havelock SC vs Army rugby game.
The HARFA rugby carnival is the brainchild of Hisham Abdeen who learnt his rugby at Zahira College and later played for Isipathana College, Havelock SC, CH and FC and Sri Lanka. He led Sri Lanka to win a Sevens title for the first time in 1984 when they bagged the Bowl at the famous Hong Kong Sevens.
