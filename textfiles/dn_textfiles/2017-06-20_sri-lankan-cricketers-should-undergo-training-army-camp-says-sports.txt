Sri Lankan cricketers should undergo training at an Army camp, says Sports Minister

The Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera speaking at a certificate awarding ceremony for six hundred students who had completed a six months sports diploma course said that he had suggested to Sri Lanka Cricket to give a six months training at an Army camp for Sri Lankan cricketers as he feels that they lack physical fitness.
Some cricketers are unable to run once they get 25 runs as they suffer from cramps and they have to either continue batting or return to the pavilion as the new ICC rules prohibit the use of a runner. If they are unable to run till they get 50 runs then they should go home. The foreign coaches of the National Team have said that not to over exert the cricketers as they may get a muscle strain but you can see they have put on weight when they remove their shirts.
Some people are saying that just because a catch is dropped a match won’t be lost. But in reality the matches are lost due to dropped catches as they are too fat and are unable to dive and take the catch.
Sportsmen and women should indulge in physical fitness from a young age which would keep them in good stead when they are picked for the National Team. That is why I suggested that they should be sent to a Army camp to gain physical fitness. The selfishness of the coaches has resulted in the decline of the sports standard in Sri Lanka as they do not allow young coaches to come up. Still they are using the coaching techniques which were used in the 1960’s.
He said children from 6,440 schools are being picked to be trained at 316 schools till 2028. The Sports Ministry will also recruit 23 coaches each from 23 districts and to find out those who could produce athletes who could represent the country at Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games.
