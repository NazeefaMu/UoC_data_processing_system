Boat left sans approval

The ill-fated multi-day fishing boat IMUL-A-627-KLT had not obtained approval from authorities at the Beruwala Fisheries Harbour prior to its departure on the pilgrimage, investigations revealed.
The boatmen had not sought approval as it was not a fishing expedition, according to the report on the investigations handed over to Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera by Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando on February 20.
The report had been compiled by the Kalutara Additional Director of Fisheries who conducted the investigation. It also stated that over 35 passengers had been travelling in the boat when it capsized. The boat was unsuitable for passenger transport as it was meant for fishing purposes. The undercarriage of the boat was designed to facilitate ice, fuel and the catch, and it was designed to carry a limited weight.
