Use of drones for filming to be regulated

The Civil Aviation Authority will take steps to regulate and standardize the use of drones for video filming, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He was addressing a workshop organized by the Civil Aviation Authority at its auditorium in Hunupitiya, Colombo recently.
"Today drone cameras are being used in an irregular manner," the Minister said and added that once regulations were introduced, registration with the Civil Aviation Authority would be mandatory for such activities in addition to the approval of the Defence Ministry and Cultural Archeological, Irrigation and Power and Energy Authorities as well as the Police station of the respective region or area.
The Civil Aviation Authority had emphasized that registration or approval was unnecessary to operate a drone below 200 grams weight without a camera or filming equipment in a person’s home garden within an airspace below 150 feet heigh for leisure or education purposes.
But once regulations were introduced, all drones above that weight fixed with filming equipment as well as its operators should be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority.
Regulations in this regard would be introduced in Parliament for approval after which the Civil Aviation Authority would be empowered to implement them.
