Defy overcrowded domain step into an unchartered land with ample growth opportunities

George Bernard Shaw once said, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”
Leaders venture out and are not afraid to challenge the status quo. They step into the unknown, looking for opportunities to grow, innovate and inspire. You can read in the newspapers, books and the net about the great leaders who faced challenges but none of them claimed a personal best by keeping things the same.
Leaders who challenge the process are willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services adopted – even if there is a risk of failure. And if they do fail first or second time, they learn quickly from their actions and do it again.
For those of you who are unfamiliar with this powerful practice, Challenge the system can be broadly summarized in the following manner. It is the practice in which:
* Leaders search for opportunities and seize initiative in order to change the status quo.
* They look for innovative ways to improve the organization or the world. In doing so, they experiment, take risks and achieve small wins.
* And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities.
The concept is relatively easy to grasp.
Opportunities
Leaders have to search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow, and improve. Each leader has to ask himself, ‘How do I go to work today and do something that will move the enterprise and myself another step in the right direction?” Although there has never been a time when a company could rest on its laurels and survive, it is even truer today that if you are holding your own, everyone else will be passing you by.
To search for opportunities, leaders must use the four essentials:
1. Seize the initiative: Initiative is one of the tenets of Army operations. To be effective on the battlefield, or the boardroom you must gain and maintain the initiative. It is essential to make your competition react to you, not you to them. Once initiative is lost, all control of the situation goes to your opponent. The first of Stephen Covey’s Seven Habits is to “Be Proactive.” Proactive leaders are able to seize the initiative and gain control of their personal and business environment.
2. Make challenge meaningful: This tie right back into “Inspire a Shared Vision.” When people understand why they are doing things, they buy into it and are much more motivated to accomplish their objectives.
1. Innovate and create: Routine work drives out non-routine work and smothers to death all creative planning, all fundamental change in any institution.
2. Look outward for fresh ideas: We need to leave behind the Not Invented Here (NIH) attitude. There are all kinds of sources of information and knowledge that we have not yet tapped into. Continually question the status quo and look to see how others are handling their challenges. Experiment and take risks by constantly generating small wins and learning from mistakes. Leadership is learning by doing, adapting to actual situations. (Tennis star Martina Navratilova lost 21 of her first 24 matches against Chris Evert. She decided to accept more risk and hit more freely and beat Evert in 39 of their next 57 matches. No woman tennis pro has ever won as many matches or tournaments as Navratilova)
3. Create a Learning Environment: The best leaders are the best learners - and the best creators of a learning environment.
Some of the ways we can create a learning environment are by:
1. Simulations or trials. Test things out before you put them in place. Everything can be a pilot.
2. Ask if anyone if the group has had experience doing this before. Have that person share their knowledge.
3. Keep track of the process and were a mistake was made. This will reinforce the learning environment.
4. Get others involved. Learning involves more than a few people.
5. Celebrate each correct move.
Behaviours that derail the Challenge
Challenge the system is more easily preached than practiced, often resulting in a strong feeling of hypocrisy about leaders. On numerous occasions, people have told me, “My boss says he wants us to be creative, challenge the status quo, and think outside the box. But when we question why certain work must be done the way it is being suggested, we hear something like, “If you have a problem with it, no one is forcing you to work here!”
How would you translate that message? It can certainly come across as controlling, deceitful, and quite disabling to creative efforts. It is usually much easier for you to challenge something you believe needs improving, than to have others challenge something you believe does not. There will always be operations in an organization that are untouchable at the moment. But, you will lose your credibility as a leader if you declare yourself immune to change or your favorite things off limits to the scrutiny of others.
Sometimes, this practice is communicated as “challenge only the little things.” There are organizations that seem to allow people to dabble, tweak, fine-tune, or slightly improve, but any change that might be considered too big is off limits. There is nothing at all wrong with continuous improvement. It just does not require the same degree of leadership that more ambitious opportunities call for.
Inherent in this practice is the need to experiment and take risks. Challenge the system is never completely safe. Remember, if there is no chance of failure, there would be no risk taking, only sure thing taking. Leaders must continue to work at creating an environment which promotes the taking of a few chances.
In some companies, challenge is positioned as additional work vs. part of the job. I remember hearing a boss actually say, “If people around here think they have time to go off and look for new ways to do things, maybe they don’t have enough to do right now.”
Challenging the system is not “something else” that people need to do, on their own time. It is the only way to keep up with change occurring every day—from competitors, technology, economic conditions or whatever. If change is not done by you, it will be done to you, and leaders know on which side of that statement they most want to be.
Full power
There are three pieces of advice when attempting to bring forth the full power and value of Challenge the system. First, keep yourself and others focused on the specific behaviors associated with it, and do not get caught up in the various misinterpretations of the word “challenge”.
Next, remind others that the practice is ultimately about taking action to create change. It requires preparation, dialogue, respecting others, and cooperation, because change usually produces some level of discomfort for those affected by it.
Finally, remember that Challenge the system is a two-way street. You cannot expect others to enthusiastically pursue growth in this practice if they are repeatedly shut down every time they offer a new or different approach.
Needed good leaders
Let us recap what we have learnt. Challenge the system does not mean challenge the values or standards, just because uncompromising integrity or flawless quality are too hard to live by. It does not mean attacking other people when we don't agree with their ideas or points of view.
Nor does it mean seeking to dismantle what is working well, or attempting to eliminate something that is simply a personal inconvenience for you. Challenge the system is about finding and implementing new and better ways of doing things in order to constantly improve to grow.
People in most organizations today have some pretty ambitious objectives to meet each year. The waters are choppy and the wind in their faces is strong, which means that hitting the numbers takes a lot of hard work. But hard work by itself is seldom the answer.
It also takes a lot of different work. I frequently ask people if they think they can meet their goals for the coming years by continuing to do their work the way they are currently doing it. Without exception, the answer is no.
This is one reason why organizations need more good leaders. They need people who will cease the ongoing complaining about how outrageous goals might be (and some indeed are beyond reason), and start rallying people to figure out what can be done to accomplish them. Isn't it ironic that so-called impossible goals are accomplished all the time? Somehow, people do figure out an answer.
3 -points
As we go along with this series, we will share with you some of the proven to-do items that enable people in organizations to be more effective in Challenging the system and implementing innovative ideas and methods.
In the meantime, there are a couple of things you can immediately start practicing as a leader, in order to lay the groundwork for helping others embrace the need to challenge the way things are done.
First, do not allow new ideas to be immediately discounted with little or no consideration. Intervene by prompting rich and open dialogue to ensure that ideas get a fair hearing.
Second, never allow invalid assumptions to rule the day over proven facts. Ask team members to justify their beliefs about whether something new will work or why it won't.
Finally, spend less time reviewing and reporting on results already in the bank and more time on pursuing new possibilities.
