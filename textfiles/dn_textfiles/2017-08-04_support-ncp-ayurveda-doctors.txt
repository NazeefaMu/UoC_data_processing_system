Support for NCP Ayurveda doctors

The North Central Ayurveda Commissioner’s Department has embarked on a programme to expand welfare facilities for ayurveda physicians in the North Central Province, according to North Central Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis.
He said at present, there are 804 such physicians engaged in the province. He said so far, only 352 doctors are registered under the provincial Ayurveda department.
A ceremony to appreciate and encourage registered ayurveda physicians will be held on August 6 at the NYSC auditorium, Anuradhapura with Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne chairing it. North Central Governor P. B. Dissanayake, Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara, Provincial Health Minister M. Herath Banda and provincial politicians will participate.
At this ceremony, 58 registered ayurveda doctors will be provided with patient beds, lockers, tables, plastic chairs, drugs blending machines, etc at a cost of Rs. 500,000 to encourage them. Also, 294 physicians will be offered a cash donation of Rs. 5,000 each as an incentive in recognition of their services.
Dr. Alwis told the Daily News that preliminary steps have been taken to encourage ayurveda doctors in the province to be registered with the government.
Also, steps have been taken to update their knowledge and practice by holding conferences, workshops and symposiums throughout the year organized by the Provincial Ayurvedic Department.
He said attention is focused on helping ayurveda doctors who treat kidney, cancer and heart disease.
