Jaffna to be a strategic city

Jaffna has been selected for development as a strategic city, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The government has made a large investment of funds to solve the water and other problems confronting its citizens, the Minister also said.
He was speaking at a meeting after laying the foundation stone for the proposed new public bus stand at Ginigathena recently.
Minister Ranawaka said once the proposed development projects were completed, they would stand as historic edifices of development in Jaffna for its people. However, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran could not show a single edifice of construction or development projects he had undertaken during his term of office. To overcome this shortcoming, Vigneswaran was trying to rouse and instigate the Tamil people to take them back to the pre-war mentality to garner their votes.
However, the government was not upset by Vigneswaran’s theatrics because the majority of intelligent Tamil people in the North supported the government’s development programmes launched for their benefit, the Minister said.
