Thirimanne recalled after 13 months

Left-hand middle order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne has been recalled to the 16-member squad for the second Test against India starting at the SSC grounds on Thursday 13 months after playing his last Test for Sri Lanka.
Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman has also been named in the squad at the expense of fast bowler Suranga Lakmal who declared himself unfit for the Test with a stiff back.
Thirimanne will in all probability fight for a place with Dhananjaya de Silva to fill the number six slot left vacant by the injury to Asela Gunaratne. He can also bat at number four.
A sudden loss of form resulted in Thirimanne who was a permanent fixture in the national team for three years since 2013 losing his place. Since then he has been working really hard at his game to regain his Test place. He had moderate success in the recently concluded Premier league season scoring 282 runs (avg. 35.25) for Ragama CC with two half centuries including a top score of 70. He did however score 59 as captain for SLC President’s XI against India in the two-day warm-up match played at the CCC grounds.
Sandakan’s inclusion indicates that Sri Lanka are looking to go in with a strong spin bowling attack on the SSC pitch. Sandakan forms a strong spin combination that includes Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera who both played at Galle and uncapped left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara.
With fitness doubts persisting with Herath’s sore left middle finger of his bowling hand Pushpakumara will be a likely replacement if he fails to recover sufficiently to play in the Test.
Sri Lanka are giving Herath who captained the team in Chandimal’s absence enough time to recover from his injury which he sustained while fielding during the Galle Test.
Dinesh Chandimal also returns to the side to lead the team after missing out on the first Test through pneumonia.
He is expected to resume his usual number four batting position with Kusal Mendis reverting back to number three. Mendis was asked to bat at four at Galle because Sri Lanka could not bat opener Danushka Gunathilaka, who came in as replacement for Chandimal in the middle order.
Gunathilaka who made his Test debut in that match didn’t contribute much being dismissed for 16 and 2.
India who won the first Test by 304 runs leads the three-match series 1-0.
SRI LANKA SQUAD FOR 2ND TEST AT SSC: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Nuwan Pradeep, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan, Lahiru Thirimanne.
