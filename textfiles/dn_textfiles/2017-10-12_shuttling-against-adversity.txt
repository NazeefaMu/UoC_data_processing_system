Shuttling against adversity

‘Sri Lanka’s undisputed badminton champion’, ‘the country’s badminton singles national champion’ and ‘champion shuttler’ - these are terms which have been associated with him for a span. Olympian Niluka Karunaratne went down in history by becoming the youngest national champion in 2001 when he was 16 years old.
Coming from a family which plays badminton Niluka has followed his father, national level badminton champ and Coach Louie Karunaratne’s footsteps by taking up the sport when he was eight years in 1993. His brothers, Diluka, and Dinuka, too have done their bit to give identity to badminton in Sri Lanka.
“My passion for badminton emerged mainly when I realized that I had a natural flair for the sport. I was playing cricket too at that time but once I began to excel in badminton I had to dedicate myself to one of the sports. I chose badminton,” Niluka explained.
An old boy of Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda, and Royal College, Colombo, Niluka’s first national win was in 1994 when he became the runner up in the under 11 all island age group. He represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championship in Jakarta, Indonesia, when he was 15 years in 2000. By July 2012, Niluka was ranked 48th in Men’s singles from the World Badminton Federation. He considers becoming the runners up in the Welsh International in 2003 as his biggest win. One of the happiest moments in his life was representing Sri Lanka at the 2012 Olympics as the captain of the Sri Lanka Olympic contingent. He defeated world number 8 Kenichi Tago of Japan 2-0 recording 21–18, 21–16 in 44 minutes at the Wembley arena in the Olympic Men’s badminton singles Group C. He also took part in the 2016 Olympics Games in Rio.
He notes that you need talent to climb up the ladder in badminton.
“Passion and how much effort you put into the game count as well. You need discipline to excel in this sport. Years and years of continuous training will horn your talent. This will take you to the global arena and get you opportunities to compete with the top rankers in the world,” Niluka said.
He says that maintaining the world ranking is the biggest challenge for an international level badminton player. He is currently in the 85th spot. He has been in the 34th rank in June 2013. This is the best he has attained so far in his career.
He notes that Sri Lanka still lacks facilities to mould budding young badminton players into international champions.
“Training here itself is a challenge when you have to venture on and face opponents who have been trained with world class equipments and the latest techniques. Though things are tough I have no plans to leave my motherland and play for a foreign state,” says the gifted youth who had gotten opportunities to train in Harvard in 2005 and Durham, UK, in 2012.
“Though I was offered scholarships in two of the best universities in the world, it was not what I wanted in life. You get into a totally different mindset when you go there and you get into a different lifestyle. I would also have to give up my first priority which is representing my country continuously,” he noted adding that his schedule includes training for three hours two times a day for six days a week.

Besides badminton Niluka has a thirst for wanderlust. He has travelled to more than 70 countries, taking part in tournaments for around 17 years. He is a wildlife enthusiast and had visited many wildlife destinations in the world including the wilderness in South Africa. Queried if a badminton player would make a worthy squash or tennis player Niluka said that badminton is more strenuous than the latter. A badminton player needs to cover more distance on the court than a tennis player.
“We also get less time to rest during our sets. However there are many badminton players who have later taken up and excelled in squash. I too have played the game for fun but my forte is badminton,” he stressed.
He admires three figures in the sports world: Michael Jordon, Mohammed Ali and Bruce Lee. He is motivated by the inspiration they have given to the public rather than their achievements in sports.
The trials he faces every day to become a better person and athlete drives him to work hard and aim higher.
Niluka says his parents, Louie Karunaratne and Mithra Mendis, have been the pillars of his strength. His brother Diluka has his own badminton association while Dinuka works for HNB. The youngest in the family, Chamika, is into cricket. Niluka is employed at Sampath bank.
His future plans involve starting his own business. His message to youth is to start dreaming at a tender age.
“The size of your dream or how many dreams you have do not really matter. Your dreams may change overtime. Decide what you want to do with life for yourself. Work towards achieving your dream. You cannot be somebody else but you can be a better person in a different profession. Gather experience and learn. Enjoy what you do,” he advised.
He will be taking part in the Scottish Open and the Open Grand Prix tournaments soon.
