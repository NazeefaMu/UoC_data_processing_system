Dolphins add beauty to Chilaw sea

A school of dolphins visible in the sea off Chilaw these days adds to the beauty of the sea, say fishermen. The school consists of over 25 dolphins and is visible nearly one kilometre off the beach. The fishermen say they come from Kalpitiya and swim towards Colombo every day.
They are clearly visible if the sea is calm.
Chilaw Additional Fisheries Director Anura Jayasekara confirmed of this school of dolphins and said he saw them when he sailed off to sea around 1 pm one day last week with several other officers for an official matter.
