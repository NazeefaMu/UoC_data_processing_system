Nearly 20,000 graduates to the public service this year

Steps will be taken to absorb around 20,000 graduates to the public service this year, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
According to rough estimates, it has been identified that there are around 20,000 vacancies available at the public service by now, he said. However, a systematic survey is being carried out at institutional level to calculate the actual number of vacancies in each State institution.
“All vacancies identified in the survey will be filled this year. The approval and consent of the President and Prime Minister are sought for this programme,” the minister added.
“Parallel to the graduate recruitment programme, a graduate recruitment structure will also be implemented. The structure will give priority to the most suitable and capable graduates to enter the public service,” he said. The minister noted that unlike in earlier occasions of graduate recruitment, shortcomings will be minimized.
Secretary of Nidahas Upadidari Sangamaya of Sri Lanka Freedom Party Manula Perera, there are around 46,000 unemployed graduates, who obtained degrees after March 31, 2012. He added that 50,000 graduates each were recruited to the public service on two occasions in 2004 and 2012.
