Gamma Pizzakraft shows appreciation to war heroes

Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., currently the sole franchisee for Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in Sri Lanka, once again embarked on an initiative to enhance the lives of disabled soldiers who reside at the Senapura Camp of the Gajaba Regiment Galnewa.
A dormitory and washroom complex at the Senapura Camp of the Gajaba Regiment Galnewa was constructed to show appreciation to the war heroes of the Senapura Camp.
Yasa Nadaraja, CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka stated, “It was a project fuelled through the generous hearts of the Gamma family where we experienced moments of joy as we handed over the completed property to the regimental head quarter battalion of the Gajaba Regiment.”
“All of us consider it an incredible honour and privilege to be alive today, and to show our appreciation to the heroes of this nation. We owe our happiness and our lives to them. This is simply our way of giving back”, said Kaushal Mendis, Director – Human Resources of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
