Govt’s commitment to Good Governance paved way for GSP+ restoration: PM

The Government’s rigorous commitment towards reconciliation, democracy and securing human rights in the last two years has paved the way for the EU’s decision to restore the GSP+ trade concession, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Releasing a special press release, Premier Wickremesinghe said the EU’s decision is not just a victory of the Yahapalana government but for all of Sri Lanka.
“Textile and other Sri Lankan export products will have more access to the European market with the GSP+ facility, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further stated in his release.
