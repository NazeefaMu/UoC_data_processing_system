Killing of cops: Ex-LTTE cadre arrested

An ex-LTTE member has been arrested in connection with the murder of two constables at a police post in Vavunativu, Batticaloa. He is said to be a rehabilitated ex-cadre.
According to the police, the arrested suspect is Rasanayagam Sarvananthan (48), a resident of Hudson Road, Vattakachchi, Kilinochchi.
He was taken into custody on Saturday (01) and handed over to the CID for investigation.
It is reported that the killing of the two policemen was in retaliation for not allowing a Mahavir commemoration to take place in Vavunativu, where loudspeakers were to be used to commemorate former LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, when the area’s police OIC arrived and halted it.
However, the suspect and the others later lit lamps and held their commemoration, reports say.
The suspect is said to have been a member of the LTTE from his childhood, according to investigations.
The two murdered constables Niroshan Indika Prasanna and Ganesh Dinesh have been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant.
Meanwhile, reports also indicated that a protest was staged yesterday in Batticaloa, opposite the clock tower, against the killing of the two policemen. Another protest was also scheduled to take place last evening by the ex-LTTE cadres.
Unconfirmed reports also stated that a search operation was being conducted in the Vavunathivu lagoon area and several youths were taken in for questioning by the police.
