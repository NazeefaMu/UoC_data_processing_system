Vasudeva laments UNHRC’s silence over elections

The UN Human Rights Council has never questioned the government as to why it has failed to conduct elections, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
The UNHRC is not worried about Sri Lankans’ right to vote, he said
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Nanayakkara said the Election Commission will become a museum, if the government deprives the people of their right to vote by postponing elections.
“The UNHRC does not utter a single word about government’s failure to hold elections,” he said.
