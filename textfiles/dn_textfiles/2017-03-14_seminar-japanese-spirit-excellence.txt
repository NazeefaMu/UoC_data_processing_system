JASTECA Institute of Management in collaboration with HIDA, the Overseas Human Resources and Industry Development Association of Japan will conduct a two day specialized program titled "Japanese Spirit of Excellence at the 'place of action' (Monodzukuri and Gemba)" - a Japanese concept of Excellence for manufacturing, sales/marketing, services, banking and finance,trading, logistics or business operations.
This two day seminar is scheduled to be held on 23rd and 24th March 2017 (8.30am - 5pm) at the Renuka City Hotel, Colombo 3.
Monodzukuri means having a state of mind with regard to Spirit of Excellence in order to produce excellent products or to offer an excellent service.The word "Gemba" is a Japanese term for "place of action". In business, "Gemba" refers to the place where value is created, eg: in manufacturing the "Gemba" is the factory and in service a place of service delivery.
'Profits are made possible by the power of Gemba', due to the degree of excellence to achieve at the place of action (power of Gemba) is one of the concepts that lie at the basis of Japanese Monodzukuri. The power of Gemba is derived from the human interaction based on Omotenashi (thoughtful consideration)logic and skills which Japanese people share with the spirit of hospitality. This is a notion that emerges from the concept of Japanese Monodzukuri.
In the manufacturing and service industries, productivity and quality of products and services depend on how one utilizes the abilities of personnel on the front-line. Keeping good relationships and increasingthe motivation of front-line employees lead to raisethe productivity and quality levels, and eventually generate larger corporate profits.
This is a concept that emerges from the concept of Japanese Monodzukuri.
It is considered that Japanese-style skills of Omotenashi (thoughtful consideration), emphasizing on adequately identifying hidden problems and desiresof clients and doing'what they are pleased', is very effective not only in the service industry butalso in the manufacturing sector.(Gemba/Monodzukuri).

With the increase in reliance on e-commerce and ordering products and services on line, when a Japanese customer knows that an enterprise is committed to Monodzukuri and Gemba it gives a clear indication to the customer that he or she will be dealing with an organisation where there is a mindset among employees that they need to treat the customer with special care with no mistakes whatsoever providing a perfect product or a service."
