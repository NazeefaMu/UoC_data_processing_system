Spain take early lead in World Cup

Melbourne Thursday: A miraculous putt from Rafa Cabrera Bello on the 18th green gave Spain the leadafter a challenging opening round of the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne Thursday.
Cabrera Bello and his youthful team-mate Jon Rahm executed a flawless game plan in the blustery conditions, which made foursomes -- alternate shot -- play difficult for the two-man teams at Kingston Heath. With only six countries returning scores under par, the Spanish combination took a one-shot lead over the USA, France and China -- courtesy of the late birdie that resulted from Cabrera Bello's snaking 15-foot putt.
Rahm drove the ball magnificently and Cabrera Bello did the rest around the greens as the pair gelled well to notch a three-under par 69 ahead of Friday's fourballs.
Cabrera Bello said he could not believe his last putt had dropped.
“I thought I had holed it, then it looked like it was going to miss right and then, I don't know how, maybe someone upstairs put some backspin on it to go in the hole,” the two-time European Tour winner said.
Spain will be grouped on the second day with France whose Victor Dubuisson and Romain Langasque returned a two-under par round of 70. AFP
