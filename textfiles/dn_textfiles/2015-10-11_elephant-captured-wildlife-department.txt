Elephant captured by Wildlife Department

An elephant which had been terrorising villagers in Vellaveli, Batticaloa was captured by Wildlife  Department officials. The elephant is said to have killed several people and had also caused destruction to crops and property in the area. An 18 member team of wildlife officers headed by Eastern Province Wildlife Department  veterinary surgeon Nihal Pushpakumara nabbed the elephant three days after launching an operation to capture  it. Villagers had also engaged in several protests during  the past few days due to the destruction caused by the animal.Picture by Sivam  Packiyanathan, Batticaloa special correspondent
