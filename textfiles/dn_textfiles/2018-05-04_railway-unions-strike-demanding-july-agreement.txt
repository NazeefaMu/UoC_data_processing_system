Railway unions to strike demanding July agreement

Railway drivers, guards, station masters and controllers yesterday threatened to launch an indefinite strike from midnight on May 8, if their demand for a salary increase was not met.
"If the authorities do not grant the first salary level of the tertiary stage, all engine drivers, guards, station masters and controllers will launch a strike,” The Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) Convener Lal Ariyaratne said.
"This salary structure was agreed upon at a discussion held last July. But, so far it has not been granted,” he added.
At this discussion, it was agreed the salary structure which was on the secondary level would be brought to the tertiary level. Meanwhile, Locomotive Engineering Operators' Union (LEOU) would also join the strike from midnight of May 8 if their demands were not met .
"We urge the authorities to resolve the salary anomalies of railway employees and several other demands,” he added.
