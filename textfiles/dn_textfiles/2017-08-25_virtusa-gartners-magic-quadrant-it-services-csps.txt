Virtusa in Gartner's Magic Quadrant  for IT Services for CSPs

 Virtusa Corporation, a global business consulting and IT outsourcing company that accelerates business outcomes for its clients, announced that it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the Visionary Quadrant of the 2017 Magic Quadrant for IT Services for Communications Service Providers (CSPs) Worldwide.
The report, published on July 19, 2017, evaluated Virtusa along with 16 other CSPs. Virtusa is the only company positioned in the Visionary section of the Magic Quadrant.
According to Gartner, “This edition of the Magic Quadrant project demonstrates that communications service providers (CSPs) are continuing with various transformation projects as compared with previously seen business process outsourcing (BPO) or simple application development and maintenance outsourcing. This scenario makes the role of IT services providers important from CSPs' future readiness perspective.”
“In recognizing us as a visionary in this year’s Magic Quadrant, Gartner is affirming that we are at the forefront of helping our clients reimagine their business and establish themselves as undisputed leaders in the markets they serve,” said Srinivasan Jayaraman, global head of Communications, Media, Information and Entertainment (CMIE), Virtusa. “We have worked closely with our CSP clients on their journeys to digitally transform their business and achieve competitive advantage.”
Virtusa’s telco labs empower CSPs to bring customers and partners together through a single platform, enabling them to jumpstart their transformation processes while providing opportunities to co-create and co-innovate across such areas as block chain, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).
Currently, Virtusa is driving several large digital transformation programs, leveraging customer and digital maturity indexes, customer experience assessment frameworks, SDLC automation, benchmarking tools and solution accelerators, through wireline and wireless technologies developed in its telco labs. By leveraging the innovative capabilities of the telco labs, CSPs can develop necessary expertise to deliver their concepts to market quickly while reducing their transformation cycle time by 50 percent.
For the IT Services for CSPs Magic Quadrant, Gartner evaluated vendors with expertise in discrete and multi-year engagements around operational IT in a multiregional context. The assessment evaluates vendors’ current offerings and overall strategies, as well as their future initiatives and product roadmaps. The report was compiled by analysts Jouni Forsman, Norbert J. Scholtz and Amresh Nandan.
“The Gartner Magic Quadrant recognition clearly validates the trust our clients have in our ability to successfully partner with them in their business transformation journeys,” said Praveen Purushotham, global head of Marketing, Virtusa.
