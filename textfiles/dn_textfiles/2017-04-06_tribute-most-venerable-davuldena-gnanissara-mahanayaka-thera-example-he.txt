Tribute to Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Mahanayaka Thera: Example he left behind

The last decades of the English rule in Ceylon left much room for cultural exploration. English scholars such as Professor Rhys Davids founded Pali Text Society in a bid to offer more emphasis to Buddhist studies. The Buddha’s teachings had a constructive discourse owing to many factors.
Most western scholars portrayed the teachings as a nihilistic phenomenon. This drew the dire need to produce scholars to counter such false opinions. That need was fulfilled by many scholars, both lay and monk, subsequently generating an interesting platform full of debates and logical discourses.
Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera’s birth comes to pass in such a backdrop. In 1915, Ceylon was yet to fall free of the English rule, albeit with a rich religious discourse taking place.
He enters the monkhood at an unimaginably young age of 13 and reaches the pinnacle of institutional eminence as well as spiritual fame.
Hagiography is not quite a novel concept – unlike the term itself - to Sri Lanka, a land in which the writings of saints are found in abundance. That was not an uncommon phenomenon especially with its cultural background enriched by Buddhism. A comprehensive account of Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera could be added to this impressively massive pile of the hagiographies.
Buddhist order
In Sri Lanka, the Buddhist order is instituted into three major sects: Siam sector (initiated in 1753), Amarapura Sect (initiated in 1803) and Ramanna Sect (initiated in 1864. The Mahanayaka legacy commences with the revival of the Sri Lankan edition of Upasampada in 1753. The Upasampada is Pali for consummating the traditions of a monk. A layperson, mostly regardless of his age, enters the Sangha Order as a novice monk, and is entrusted with certain duties before he is considered eligible for Upasampada. However, the minimum age requirement for the Upasampada is 20. The Upasampada calls for a ceremonious celebration, traditionally. The appointment of a Sangha senior to the Mahanayaka position commenced with the revival of Upasampada tradition. The Mahanayakas of all chapters are highly revered in Sri Lanka.
Genuine honour and fear-filled respect could seem strange allies. Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera, who held the position of Amarapura Chapter’s Mahanayaka Thera, had earned quite a respect genuinely drawn from his brethren, both contemporary as well as the juniors. He had been hailed as an exemplary leader of the Sangha community.
He was a novice monk under the tutelage of Venerable Dr Umale Piyarathana Thera. Why he has earned respect among his contemporaries could be an interesting factor. Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera had been praised for his academic prowess, particularly in Sanskrit.
Most Venerable Tirikunamale Ananda Mahanayaka Thera, the chief incumbent of Sri Vajiraramaya, identifies rare characteristics in Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera: self-restraint conduct, perseverance, perfect virtue and the remarkable command of the Buddha’s teachings.
Humbleness and respect for teachers
The Thera is descendent of Monarawila Keppetipola Thera who shouldered the Uva-Wellassa rebellion. Most Venerable Ananda Thera links the religious fervour in the family to the late Mahanayaka Thera’s interest in joining the Sangha Order at such an early age, and the subsequent ability to sustain it until the passing away.
During his tutelage at the Vidyodaya Pirivena, Most Venerable Gnanissara Thera secured the Samaraja prize reserved for the brightest student of that institute. Most Venerable Tirikunamale Ananda Thera recalls how the late Mahanayaka Thera offered advice to his peers at the institute. “Whether you are a lay or a monk, you have a responsibility as a student. Your main responsibility is to study properly without being lazy. Humbleness and respect for teachers are two core concepts that lead to your success.”
Most Venerable Tirkunamale Ananda Thera recalls the days the late Mahanayaka Thera spent at the Vajiragnana Dharmayathana, Maharagama, as Sanskrit lecturer. When he questions a student, the late Mahanayaka Thera would not forget to take out a small watch from his inner pocket and say: ‘this gift to the one who gives the right answer…” When a student comes up with the right answer, he would add: “Well, I didn’t say that I would give this to anyone,” and would tuck it back inside the pocket. He had that amazing witty feature, with which he conversed easily.
The late Mahanayaka Thera offered his service as head of the Tripitaka Compilation Board attached to Department of Buddhist Affairs. Even at 100, he wasted no time. With his impressive command of Sanskrit, the Most Venerable Thera used to compose a verse or two. He was the living example of the ancient Sanskrit aphorism that scholars have time only for intellectual leisure.
With all such credit under him, the late Mahanayaka Thera was still a humble human being to anyone in his surrounding. Most Ven Tirikunamale Ananda Thera compares him with Sariputta Thera who is known to be the humblest among the Buddha’s disciples.
Like any other noble saint, Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera left an example to be followed.
He held the most prestigious position in Buddhist monk order, yet he did not digress from the Noble Path. One can confidently say that he lived a spiritually perfect life.
His lifespan itself is ample evidence in an age where life expectancy is becoming a serious subject despite the availability of the most sophisticated medicine on earth. 
Unforgettable legend
ANIL WEERASINGHE
The Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera has just crossed the great divide. Let us wish the renowned priest the bliss of Nibbana. The birth of this great priest was on December 31, 1915. Ceylon had just experienced riots where many National leaders were jailed by the British. In the international scene, a needless war (World War I) was on. The great Empires of Austria, Hungary, Britain, Germany and Russia were still very much intact. These Empires went to war expecting to extend their boundaries but at the end becoming great losers. In Austria, Emperor Franz Josef was in the 67th year of his reign in the great Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna. In Germany, the impulsive Kaiser Welhelm II was ruling more as a warlord (he was a grandson of Queen Victoria). In England the very down to earth George V was on the throne (he was another grandson of Queen Victoria).
Last but not the least the tragic Emperor Nicholas II was in the last couple of years of his reign. All the Empires except the British collapsed by the end of the Great War. The air plane was still in its infancy. Computer was not known to the world. In Ceylon almost 80 percent of land area was still jungle. Freedom to Ceylon was only a piped dream. To this lost world, came in this erudite monk. He has departed in an era what one would call a computer-rich era and mankind looking to colonize other planets!
