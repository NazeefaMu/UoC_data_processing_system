Sandali’s plant nursery thrives with Thurunu Diriya loan

Starting a business and turning it into a successful venture is not an easy task. Every entrepreneur, small or big, has to face numerous obstacles including financial barriers.
The ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka - Bank of Ceylon Thurunu Diriya’ loan scheme has given potential small-scale young entrepreneurs an opportunity to surmount financial barriers and reach their dream.
Sandali Kulathunga (24) who runs a plant nursery that bears her name – Sandali Plant Nursery – in Kimbissa, Dambulla, is one such Thurunu Diriya loan recipient.
Sandali is the middle child and the only daughter in a family of five. After finishing her Ordinary Level Examination at Weera Mohan Jayamaha Maha Vidyalaya, Dambulla, she followed the National Vocational Qualification Level 4 Certificate course in Plant Nursery Development at Inamaluwa Technical College and a course in Landscaping and Gardening at Matale District Vocational Training Centre, Dambulla.
With her qualifications, she started a plant nursery on four acres of her parents’ land, facing the Trincomalee - Dambulla main road, with the guidance of her father, who is currently working at the Agrarian Services Department.
Although she had four acres of land for her business venture, she was only able to run her nursery on a small scale due to economic difficulties. She came to know about the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme at the Technical College, where she followed the course in plant nursery development. She saw this loan scheme as a great opportunity to expand her business and applied for a loan.
Since she had all the requirements to receive the loan, she easily got through the loan application process and received the loan of Rs. 5 lakhs a few weeks ago. She used the loan to expand her plant nursery by buying a water pump to get water from the Dambulla Water Project and building a hut to house her plants and a small building for business purposes.
“I could easily get through the process of getting this loan and SEDD was very supportive throughout this process. SEDD also conducted a two-day training programme to educate the entrepreneurs on how to conduct a business. This helped us to learn a lot of things that we did not know.” She had praise for the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme and Small Enterprise Development Division (SEDD).
“My future plan is to expand and develop my business by getting the maximum use of the four acres of land we own,” she said.
The Bank of Ceylon in collaboration with the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Minister’s Office, the Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Small Enterprises Development Division (SEDD) of the Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Ministry implemented the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme, which provides loans without a guarantor and collateral or with lenient guarantor conditions for young entrepreneurs who possess a degree or a recognised vocational certificate and who have been in business for not less than three years.
Further details of this loan scheme can be obtained from any branch of the Bank of Ceylon or from Divisional Secretariats islandwide.
