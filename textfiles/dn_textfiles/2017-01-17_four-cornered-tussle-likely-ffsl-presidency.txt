Four cornered tussle likely for FFSL presidency

A four cornered tussle is likely for the presidency of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka when they hold their AGM in May.
The present president Anura de Silva, former president and media director Ranjith Rodrigo, the present secretary Balendra Anthony and another person with the blessings of a former president are likely to contest for the top posts.
When asked for his views the present president Anura de Silva said that he wants to contest for a second term to show that he can act independently without the support of Ranjith Rodrigo as several people had made allegations against him saying that he was under the influence of the former president Rodrigo.
De Silva said that he has rendered yeoman service to revive the football leagues despite spending a lot as legal fees due to several court cases. Former president Ranjith Rodrigo said that he is happy that there is a contest but the present president and the secretary should not use the resources of the Football Federation in their campaign. He denied the allegations made against him regarding interference in the affairs of the FFSL.
“I hope to win again and serve the game to the best of my ability,” Rodrigo said.
