Point of view
Last week’s positive momentum led by blue chips continued this week too, helping push the benchmark ASPI to an ~11 month high. Sri Lanka defeating a motion to deny GSP+ trade concession, continued foreign buying, positive corporate earnings boosted the investor confidence this week helped the Index gain 75 points over the week to close at 6610.46 points.
The market rally since late last March has led to the bench mark price index gain a cumulative ~550 points, which help improve gains to 6.1% Y-T-D (cf. 4.9% last week). Off board large parcels accounted for ~41% of market turnover for the week helping push average turnover for the week to LKR 1.35 Bn, ~48% higher than Y-T-D turnover of LKR 0.91Bn. Crossings in JKH accounted for ~28% of the week’s total crossings while Melstacorp accounted for ~21% & of the week’s total crossings.

EU grants GSP+, CB forecasts 5.0% GDP growth in ‘17E
Sri Lanka won the EU parliamentary vote on GSP+ yesterday (by 436) votes enabling tariff concessions across a wide range of exports to the EU. The GSP+ scheme is designed to help developing countries by granting full removal of tariffs on over 66% of tariff lines covering a wide array of products.
The EU was Sri Lanka’s main export destination in 2015, accounting for nearly 1/3 of the country’s global exports and the restoration of GSP+ is expected to benefit listed entities in the Apparel, Rubber and Ceramics Industries In its Annual Report for 2016 meanwhile, the Central Bank (CB) noted that the country is expected to progress towards higher growth trajectory over the medium term upon addressing certain structural issues.
The CB added that the formulation of policy frameworks with the help of multilateral agencies including the IMF, along with the swift and consistent implementation of these policies will be essential to improve the economy’s productivity and efficiency.
The CB also emphasized the importance of attracting Foreign Direct Investments, improving export income through diversified exports (eg: value added, technologically intensive products), attracting high spending tourists as key measures to reach a higher economic growth over the medium term.
The Monetary Authority projects a GDP growth rate of 5.0% Y-o-Y in 2017E (cf. 4.4% in 2016) and a medium-term output target of ~6.5-7.0% Y-o-Y.
