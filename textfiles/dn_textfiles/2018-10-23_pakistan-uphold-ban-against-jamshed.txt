Pakistan uphold ban against Jamshed

Lahore, Monday: A Pakistani cricket tribunal Monday upheld a 10-year ban on former opener Nasir Jamshed over his role in various fixing scandals that rocked the Pakistan Super League (PSL).
The 28-year-old -- one of six players banned for multiple charges of spot fixing -- was sanctioned by an anti-corruption tribunal in August for his role in the scandal, which tainted the Twenty20 tournament in only its second year.
“The independent adjudicator has found the ban was ‘perfectly justified’ and shall continue to remain in force,” the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement. AFP
