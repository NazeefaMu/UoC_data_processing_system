Namal Rajapaksa denied entry to U.S.

MP Namal Rajapaksa who was on his way to the United States from Moscow was stopped from boarding his plane to Houston by officials.
Rajapaksa tweeting in the early hours of yesterday from the Moscow Airport said, “Emirates Air #Moscow informs, I won’t make my Houston
Flight as #US Officials instruct them to not let me board. Valid reason yet to be received. US has the Sovereign right of course. Sure it has nothing to do with my name, being part of #lka opposition or my travel from #Russia”.
Rajapaksa was in Moscow as an independent observer of the Russian Presidential Election and attended a couple of official meetings.
A spokesperson from his office speaking to the Daily News said that Rajapaksa had been granted a visa to the US. However, later he had been told by the US officials that there were ‘technical difficulties’ and that it would take time to resolve it.
The spokesperson added further that Rajapaksa’s programme in the US would be over by the time he was granted access and thus the MP had decided to return to Sri Lanka as soon as possible.
