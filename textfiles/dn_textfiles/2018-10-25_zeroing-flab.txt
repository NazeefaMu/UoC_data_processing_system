Zeroing  in on the  flab

There is no permanent fix for cellulite. Though almost everyone experiences cellulite at some point, misinformation about it is just as common as the dimpled nuisance that plagues our thighs, butts and bellies. However there are plenty of things you can do to minimize cellulite with or without the help of expensive medical treatments.
Food and cellulite
Eating a lot of refined and processed foods encourages cellulite to form. The skin is the largest organ of detoxification in the body, and a chemical and impurity-laden diet will attempt partial excretion through the skin, where toxicities and metabolites can bundle together in tissues. Make sure you eat a diet of nutrient-dense, natural foods.
Too much salt causes swelling, which affects the appearance of cellulite. When combined with poor quality skin, the swelling can happen between the skin areas like a honeycomb showing signs of cellulite
The impact of exercise on cellulite
A regular exercise practice cannot cure cellulite but in many cases it can help prevent or reduce its appearance. Cellulite occurs when connective fibers underneath the skin become weak or lose their elasticity, but stretching and strengthening those areas (in addition to burning away excess fat overall) can help.
Firming and toning those muscles will in turn tighten the skin, giving the illusion that cellulite is less noticeable. Yoga routines that target the butt and thighs can help, as well as strength-training moves that build muscle and boost circulation.
Running or other forms of cardio can help keep weight off, which may reduce the appearance of dimples and dents.
Weight loss and cellulite
Weight loss is not a guaranteed cellulite removal strategy, but maintaining a healthy weight through diet and regular exercise can certainly help. There will be less fat beneath the uneven connective tissue to create the dimpled appearance as you lose weight.
Within about two months of beginning a weight-loss program, you might begin to see a slight reduction in cellulite. Maintaining your lowered weight is a must, though, as yo-yo dieting and weight fluctuations can sabotage your battle against cellulite.
Home remedies for cellulite reduction
Massage
One promising remedy is massage. This can be done at home or with the help of a professional massage therapist. Massages have a multitude of mind-body benefits, but you may also enjoy reduced thigh cellulite in the process.
Massage may reduce cellulite by improving lymphatic drainage. It can also help stretch your skin tissue - this can help stretch out cellulite dimples, too.
Drink more water
Drinking water is another low-cost option that may help with cellulite. Not only does it keep you hydrated, but water also helps remove the toxins that can lead to fat accumulation. Water can also help encourage circulation and lymphatic flow.
Green tea
Green tea can speed your metabolism and help you burn fat by stopping the production of fat-absorbing enzymes. But, catechins found in green and white teas can also reduce insulin resistance.
Omega-3s
Another theory is that consumption of the wrong kinds of fats leads to an imbalance of the fatty acids that the body needs for smooth skin and tissue. There is some evidence that consuming enough Omega-3 fatty acids and fat soluble vitamins will help reduce cellulite over time. Either way, Omega-3s and fat soluble vitamins are important for many other functions in the body, so it won’t hurt to try it!
Lifestyle changes are your best bet
Unfortunately, there’s no way to prevent cellulite, according to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. It’s a common condition, and the risk increases with age and certain lifestyle choices.
Although you can’t control your age, you can make some changes to your lifestyle that can help reduce the amount of cellulite on your thighs.
Talk to your dermatologist if you’re interested in professional procedures to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Some treatments, such as laser therapy, may help but won’t fully erase cellulite on your thighs.
 
Also important - know that results from any remedy or procedure aren’t permanent - you’ll likely have to repeat the process to continually reduce the appearance of thigh cellulite.
