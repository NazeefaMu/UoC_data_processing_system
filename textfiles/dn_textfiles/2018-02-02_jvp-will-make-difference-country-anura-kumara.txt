JVP will make a difference  in the country: Anura Kumara

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader and Member of Parliament Anura Kumara Dissanayake, speaking at a JVP meeting held in his hometown in Andiyagala in the Palagala Divisional Secretariat, Anuradhapura, to promote their candidates for the area, said he had sacrificed much during his career in politics, including his property as well as family, and would continue to do so for the sake of the future of the children in the villages.
He said the JVP had fought hard to change the old electoral system.
“Whilst many say that I have not visited my village in a long time, I have not been able to visit as often as I would like due to national responsibilities,” Dissanayake said.
The JVP leader, who said that many capitalist parties were promising various goods and benefits to the people in order to get votes for their party; “Sil cloths to arrack is being distributed for that purpose, and today, we see many villages divided over party lines and that should not be the case.
It is time for everyone to get together and vote for a party which would break away from the old ways and build the country.”
He asked that the people think carefully before casting their votes on February 10; “You elected Maithripala Sirisena as President and he appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Now ask yourself, what have they done during the last three years? That period was a failure.
Therefore, think before you vote,” he said. “Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the meantime, is asking that his Pohottuwa be voted into power.
Do not vote for that either. They destroyed the country in the past and lied their way into winning votes. He earlier spoke of the electric chair, but that too turned out to be a lie.
Their MPs and brothers have filled their bank accounts to the brim. You had voted for such people in the past and they have failed you.
Vote for the JVP and you will see that our members who are not corrupt—who do not draw a salary from the government—will make a difference,” he added.
