Maggi wins ‘Youth Food Brand of the Year’ at SLIM Nielsen

Maggi brand was voted ‘Youth Food Brand of the Year’ for the fourth time by young consumers at this year's SLIM-Nielsen Awards.
This is the fifth consecutive year that Maggi has won a SLIM-Nielsen People's Award. The win is an endorsement of the trust consumers place in the brand and their love for the brand's latest addition to its product portfolio, Daiya Chicken flavoured noodles, whose appealing taste enhanced Maggi's popularity amongst local youth.
Maggi Daiya Chicken flavoured noodles is a spicier and flavoursome variant for teenagers who enjoy spice in their food. The product is fortified with calcium and features popular spices, contributing to the product's great taste.
Nestle Food Vice-President Priyadarshinie Karunaratne said to be voted their number one choice for five years running is indeed an honour. "We'd like to extend a big heartfelt thank you to all of our consumers for their support and trust. They will always be at the centre of our Maggi world and we will continue to provide ways to assure that their ‘Happiness is Homemade.”
Maggi has been a trusted Sri Lankan household for well over 30 years. Its range has been expanded and renovated over the years to ensure it remains relevant to local consumers, as their needs and preferences evolve. As part of Nestl‚'s ongoing efforts to ensure its products offer a superior nutritional profile, Maggi's most recent renovation includes enhancing its noodles range with popular ‘home ingredients’ typically found in Sri Lankan kitchens, such as turmeric, nutmeg, coriander, cumin and cardamom, , and fortifying it with vitamin A and calcium to support the country's efforts to address micronutrient deficiencies.
Nestle Managing Director, Shivani Hegde said they will continue to innovate and renovate products in line with local consumer needs, support the country's efforts to address micronutrient deficiencies and empower consumers to make informed choices in their diets and lifestyles, thereby enhancing the quality of life of people across the value chain and contributing to a healthier future.
The SLIM - Nielsen People's Awards award recipients are chosen by consumers between 15 to 60 via a structured questionnaire conducted by Nielsen islandwide.
