Goodman reveals surprising complaint against ‘Kong Skull Island’

Unsurprisingly, though, he was only kidding when venting his light-hearted frustration.
The new film has been praised for doing away with the traditional King Kong plot of having a Beauty and the Beast style story with the female protagonist and the titular beast.
That seems to be great, progressive news for Brie Larson - but not so much for Goodman.
Speaking to the NY Daily News, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts said: “We’ve seen it before so many times, and we’ve seen it done well so many times. So why tread in that territory again? What do we possibly have to gain retelling the beauty and the beast story?“And frankly, I don’t think the beauty and the beast story is as progressive or relevant in 2017.”
But Goodman quipped: “I was surprised that I wasn’t the beauty. That hurt.”
Alas, the possibility of a love story between John Goodman and King Kong will be resigned to viewers’ imaginations for the time being.
On a more serious note, the actor revealed that he never thought he would get the chance to a monster movie.
“I never thought I’d have a shot of doing anything like this,” the 64-year-old confided. “I don’t fit any of the types that would be in a King Kong movie.”
The film’s producer also spoke out on rumours leading man Tom Hiddleston could next take on the role of James Bond.
