Villagers pay for contractor’s negligence

Lives of close to 700 families in the Ranwediyawa village in Galewela are at stake with no bridge to cross the Kospotha canal from the village to attend to their daily needs. The bridge built across the canal at great expense was washed away within six months of completion due to the sub standard work of the contractor.The villagers now have to wade through the canal waters even at high tide to attend to their daily chores. A family which had a bereavement recently had to cross the canal in knee deep water to carry the coffin of the dead villager to the Kospotha cemetery. Authorities had allegedly paid dues to the contractor even after the bridge collapsed without taking the contractor to task. They request authorities to take remedial action to provide a quality bridge to end their travails. Picture by Sigiriya special correspondent.
