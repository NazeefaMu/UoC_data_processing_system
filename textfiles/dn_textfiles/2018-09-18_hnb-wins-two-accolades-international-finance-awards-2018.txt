HNB wins two accolades at International Finance Awards 2018

HNB PLC has been recognised as the Best Retail Bank and Best Micro Finance Bank at International Finance Awards 2018.
The event is organised by the International Finance Magazine as a global platform for the recognition of leadership and value-generating capacity. Winners of the IFM Awards are selected following careful evaluation of submissions from across the world with qualified research being conducted on all nominees by dedicated teams prior to selection of winners based on the strength of their application and past accomplishments.
“The IFM Awards are globally renowned as a showcase for industry best practices, innovation. These awards help to highlight which direction the entire global banking industry is moving towards, and it is therefore gratifying that we have not only maintained, but improved our performance from last year. We believe this is further vindication of the remarkable transformation taking place at HNB, and the catalytic role we will play in the coming chapters of Sri Lanka’s growth story,” HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles said.
Over the past year, the bank has been deepening its engagement across its full spectrum of banking services, resulting in a 30.7 Year-on-Year (YoY) expansion in Profit Before Tax to Rs. 14.1 billion in just the first six months of 2018 alone.
“Customer centricity is at the core of our success, and what enables HNB to advance its leadership position in the retail sector. By focusing on operational excellence and product innovation with an emphasis on easily accessible digital services, HNB is working to catalyse a new paradigm in banking. In that regard, we express our heartfelt gratitude to our customers who are partners in our success, and to our dedicated team whose efforts fuel our organisation to greater heights,” HNB Deputy General Manager – Retail Banking, Sanjay Wijemanne said.
HNB has long maintained a thriving presence in the microfinance sector. As the very first Sri Lankan bank to enter the market with a branded product exclusively for the microfinance sector with HNB Gami Pubuduwa in 1989, the bank has utilized its invaluable experience as a true pioneer in the field to extend vital financial services to underserved communities across the island, while tailoring its approach to suite the unique conditions prevalent in the Sri Lankan market.
“This award therefore stands as further vindication of HNB’s tried and tested approach to microfinance and we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team of employees and field officers who have been at the heart of our success,” HNB SME and Mid-market Deputy General Manager Jude Fernando said.
