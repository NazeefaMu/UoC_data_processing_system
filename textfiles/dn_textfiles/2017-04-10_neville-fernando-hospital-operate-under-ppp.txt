Neville Fernando hospital to operate under PPP

Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday that the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) will be running under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Discussions are underway at the moment with the Ministry of Health in this regard and the taking over is in short order, Minister Kiriella told the Daily News.
“Dr. Neville Fernando has agreed to hand over the hospital to the State and it will be running under a Public-Private Partnership,” Minister Kiriella said. When asked to comment on the GMOA’s dissatisfaction over the SAITM issue, Minister Kiriella said: “we are not worried about the GMOA’s stance. This is the government position. The SAITM medical college will be there, but the NFTH will be taken over by the State.” Speaking of the minimum standards for medical education, Minister Kiriella said the responsibility of drafting them is in the hands of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and not the government. “The SLMC is to draft the minimum standards. For the last five years, we have been telling them to draft the minimum standards, but they have not done so. Once they do, we will discuss with them about the document and come to an agreement,” the minister said.
