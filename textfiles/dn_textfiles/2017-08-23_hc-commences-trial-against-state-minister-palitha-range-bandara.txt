HC commences trial against State Minister Palitha Range Bandara

 
The Colombo High Court today commenced recording evidence in a case filed against Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and another person for allegedly aiding and abetting to present a vehicle registration permit for an illegally assembled vehicle.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, the first witness Dinesh Ratnayake gave evidence and further trial was fixed for August 25.
Meanwhile, defense counsel appearing on behalf of State Minister informed Court that the complainant party had tendered an affidavit to the Attorney General citing that the complainant has no intention to proceed with the case.
Defense counsel Savithri Fernando appearing under the instructions of U.R. de Silva PC moved Court that the case be fixed for another date since his client wants to attend Parliament sessions.
However, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga decided to commence trial in the early hours as parliament sessions to be started at 1 pm.
The prosecution informed Court that the Attorney General is expecting to make his opinion regarding the defense claims that the case cannot be maintained. "The Attorney General is perusing the facts presented by both defense and complainant regarding the maintainability of the case," Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake said.
