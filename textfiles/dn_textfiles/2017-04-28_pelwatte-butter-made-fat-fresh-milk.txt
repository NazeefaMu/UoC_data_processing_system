Pelwatte Butter made from  fat in fresh milk

Although there are numerous amounts of dairy companies that produce butter in the country, the healthiest choice would be to opt for a product that is made from fresh milk instead of milk powder without any additives included.
Pelwatte Dairy is a leading home-grown dairy company that produces many different dairy products such as milk powder, yoghurt, butter and many more. The brand is widely known for the natural approach taken in the production of their products.
Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one of them being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5 % fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage so in order to control the fat percentage a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.
Pelwatte produces both salted and unsalted butter varieties, and is sold in both home-sized and bulk packs. Pelwatte Butter is the cheapest high quality locally produced butter in the local market.
