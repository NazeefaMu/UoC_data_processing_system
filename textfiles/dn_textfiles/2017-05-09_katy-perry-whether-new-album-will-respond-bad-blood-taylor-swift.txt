Katy Perry on whether new album will respond to 'Bad Blood' by Taylor Swift

 
In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, she was asked whether the record will include a response to 'Bad Blood'. 
"Well that's not my question to answer - if it's about me," she said. "I think [my album] is a very empowered record. There is no one thing that's calling out any one person.
"One thing to note is: You can't mistake kindness for weakness and don't come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that's not to any one person and don't quote me that it is, because it's not. It's not about that.
"Honestly, when women come together and they decide to unite, this world is going to be a better place... But let me say this: Everything has a reaction or a consequence so don't forget about that."
Perry's new album will feature 15 tracks, including one called 'Bigger Than Me', dedicated to Hillary Clinton, and a club track called 'Swish Swish'.
