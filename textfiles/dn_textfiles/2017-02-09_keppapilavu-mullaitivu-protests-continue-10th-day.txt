Keppapilavu, Mullaitivu protests continue for 10th day

As protests held by the residents of Keppapilavu, Mullaitivu continue for the tenth consecutive day, the military has asked that the protesters outside the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) camp show proof of ownership for the land.
Military Spokesperson, Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday said that he had been informed that the land in question belonged to the government under the Forest department and it was not private land, “We have informed them that if they prove their ownership to the land through the divisional secretariat, the Air Force would take that into consideration and release whatever land that is possible to be released”, said Brigadier Seneviratne.
The families together with their children however continue to protest and around 84 Tamil families claim ownership to around 20 acres of land on which the SLAF camp is situated on. “If they continue to protest despite our assurances, it is clear that they are operating on a separate agenda. It is also strange that they did not lay claim to this land for the past eight years but have now come to claim them,”the Brigadier said.
