CPC Private Bowser Owners call temporary halt to planned strike

The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners Association (CPPBOA) which met Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) officials and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga yesterday decided to temporarily halt their strike action..
“The Minister said that there were few problems in the previous price formula for the transportation of fuel and that the officials and the members of the Association would have to work out a new one,” CPPBOA Secretary Shantha Silva said.
He added that the report on the above subject would be submitted to the Minister on Friday. “Depending on the formula and prices, we would decide on whether to strike or not”, Silva said.
The formula for fuel transportation had been previously worked out by CPC officials and the Association in 2016 and it was scheduled to come into effect on December 1,2016.
The Union had earlier asked for a 12.5 percent increase. With officials and ministers being changed however, the pricing formula too has found itself back on the drawing board. In April this year, the government introduced a fuel pricing formula which would reflect world oil prices and it would be changed every two months.
Thus fuel transport prices too would have to be adjusted to keep in line with new fuel prices. Private bowsers transport close to 80 percent of the total volume of fuel island-wide.
The CPPBOA has more than 8,500 bowsers whilst the CPC manages with 600 bowsers.
