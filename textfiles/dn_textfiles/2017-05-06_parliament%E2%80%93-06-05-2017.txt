Ending in unparliamentary language
FM's statement creates uproar in House
Joint Opposition members and Government side members locked horns in Parliament yesterday, when Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera brought to the notice of the House that MP Wimal Weerawansa accompanied by his son a delegate to the 7th Session of the World Urban Forum in Columbia in South America in 2014 during the previous regime.
The heated situation created soon after MP Weerawansa rose to deny the minister's statement stating he accompanied his son on his own expense.
The tense situation was created while the Foreign Affairs Minister was moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act.
"When I see former Minister Weerawansa, I remember facts that I could point out the difference between the two eras of this government and the past," Minister Samaraweera said. "He accompanied his 11-year-old child to Columbia."
"I accompanied my son on my own expense," Weerawansa said. "You make false allegations as you don't have children." He adding that his son did not attend the session.
The minister went on to explain the incident and used a word that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya ordered to be expunged, as it was unparliamentary. The minister again said that he thought it was a proper Sinhala term used to identify persons of undisciplined features and added however, that there was no other fitting word to address some of the members of the joint opposition.
Later there was strong reaction from the opposition side and the use unparliamentary language, which was expunged by the Speaker. However many members shouted while Joint Opposition Member Tharaka Balasooriya and UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha expressed their views.

Hoisting of black flags on sacred and historic day
JO members' political bankruptcy reflected: FM
The political bankruptcy of those Joint Opposition members is reflected by their intention of hoisting black flags on the sacred and historic day that commences the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebration in Sri Lanka on May 12, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday.
He made this observation, while moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act when Parliamentarian Sydney Jayaratne questioned of the Joint Oppositions attempt to hoist black flags.
He added the government would not allow anybody to hoist black flags on Vesak Day, Christmas Day nor on the birthday of Prophet Muhammad.
"If they attempted to do so, they would only have to fill the Galle Face ground as they did last week for more than another ten years," Minister Samaraweera said.
Former First Lady's trip to Paris had cost Rs. 25 M
A sum of Rs 25 million had been spent for former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa to attend the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebration in 2014, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
"Some people say that the United Nations Vesak Day Celebration was celebrated for the first time," Minister Samaraweera said. "It is not true. United Nation had celebrated Vesak Day in early years too. Former First Lady had travelled to Paris to participate in it in 2014."
Foreign Affairs Minister made these observations yesterday, moving the order under the Diplomatic Privileges Act.
He also said that she resided at the George the Fifth Hotel of which the charges were very high. He added that Queen Elizabeth too refused to reside there as the rates were too high.
"The cost of a single room was Euro 20,000," the Foreign Affairs Minister said. "We could question the school children to calculate and see how much was Euro 20,000 in Sri Lankan rupees. We can ask them as to how many halls and playgrounds could be built for them with that money."
He said that Grand Mother Daisy had also accompanied the First Lady on the same trip. "According to statistics of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the mini bar in the same room had been filled thrice the very night they stayed there.
