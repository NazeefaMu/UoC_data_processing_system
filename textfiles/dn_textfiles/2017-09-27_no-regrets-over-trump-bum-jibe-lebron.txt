No regrets over Trump 'bum' jibe - LeBron

Los Angeles: LeBron James said Monday he did not regret branding President Donald Trump a "bum", accusing the US leader of dividing the nation in his feud with the sports world.
NBA star James had taken aim at Trump on Twitter on Saturday after the president withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors and star player Stephen Curry.
"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!" James wrote.
Asked if he regretted his choice of words on Monday, the Cleveland Cavaliers star gave a blunt response: "No."
In a press conference at the Cavaliers' pre-season media day, James repeatedly referred to Trump as "that guy", saying he had failed to bring the country together.
"First of all, I salute the NFL, the coaches, the players, the owners, the fans. Everyone had any association with the NFL was unbelievable," James told reporters at NBA Media Day. "There was no divide. Even from that guy that continues to try to divide us as people. AFP
