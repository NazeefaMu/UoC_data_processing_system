Chrysanthemum care

Chrysanthemum is considered the most popular cut flower in many parts of the world. As a cut flower, it has a long vase life. It is a beautiful flower that has a huge range in variety. The name ‘chrysanthemum’ is derived from the Greek words chrysos (gold) and anthemon (flower). Garden Talk talks to Lassana Flora Chairman/ Managing Director Dr. Lasantha Malavige about this flower that is celebrated in many parts of the world.
“They are mostly found in South East Asia and in North East Europe. China also became a major hub for a variety of chrysanthemums and it was later introduced to Japan. In the 17th century, it was introduced to the United States,” he said.
“Chrysanthemum flowers commercially available as cut flowers are patented hybrid varieties. These varieties have been created to increase beauty, resist disease and improve vase life. Lassana Flora works with two of the world’s leading chrysanthemum breeders and currently produces over 40 varieties of highbred chrysanthemums in Sri Lanka. Lassana Flora has entered into licensing agreements with Dutch breeders to locally propagate from mother plants,” said Malavige.

The appeal of chrysanthemums lies in its durability as a cut flower. In the case of other flowers such as orchids and dahlias, it is a favourite among horticulturists because there are many varieties to choose from.
“Chrysanthemums have a long vase life as opposed to most other cut flowers. It belongs to the family ‘Asteracaea.’ Its main difference to other flowers is its range. It has sprays (clusters of flowers), single flowers, pompoms and spiders. These main varieties are different to each other. The ideal day temperature for chrysanthemums is Celsius 20 – 27 and the night temperature is Celsius 12 – 20. In Sri Lanka, such whether conditions are available in altitudes over 1,000 metres,” pointed out Malavige.
Chrysanthemums are grown in parts of the world with controlled settings. It is a short day plant. It needs a short day and a long night for flowering.
“It starts flowering during a shorter day or longer night. In commercial cultivation, we increase the daytime with artificial light to delay flowering and increase the height of the stem. If the day is not extended, it would start flowering when the plant is small. By providing artificial light, we deceive the plant so that it keeps growing,” explained Malavige.
It can be grown from seeds or from cuttings. Commercial production is always from rooted cuttings. Cuttings are obtained for rooting from mother plants. It takes about 90 days to flower after planting the rooted cuttings. As soon as it is properly flowered, the plant is uprooted and the stem is obtained as a cut flower for sale. But if it is a garden flower, it can be kept longer. Chrysanthemums can be grown as a hobby as a potted plant or as a garden plant.
“Cut chrysanthemums under ideal conditions have a vase life of two weeks. Maintaining flowers in clean water is important. If you do not change water, there could be bacteria and other pathogens growing that can block the water circulation from the bottom of the stem to the flower. So it is important to keep the water clean and change water every other day. Each time you change water, you must clean the vase with a detergent,” maintains Malavige.
In higher humidity, it is susceptible to ‘White Rust’ and other fungal infections. In Sri Lanka, a common disease is ‘White Rust’. Other fungal infections include ‘Bothrites’ and ‘Downy Mildew.’ It can be affected by insects such as mites and aphids. Good hygienic conditions need to be maintained to avoid ‘White Rust.’ If the plant is infected, remove those plants as other plants can be affected. There are a lot of fungicides that can be used. Insect nets can be used. There are also poly tunnels where polythene covers the top and insect nets on the sides.
It seems that chrysanthemums are not merely for the eyes or visual pleasure, but also satisfy our taste buds as well.
“Chrysanthemums are used for culinary purposes. The most popular is chrysanthemum tea. It is sometimes added to wine. In Korea, chrysanthemums are added to rice wine to obtain a good flavour. Sometimes the petals of some varieties are used for salads. But they are grown under different conditions with the minimal use of insecticides or pesticides,” said Malavige.
