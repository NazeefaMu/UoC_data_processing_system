No party will gain majority at LG Polls: SB

Since no party will be able to gain a clear majority of seats at the forthcoming local government elections, two parties may have to join hands to form the administration in many local councils, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
“The SLFP may have to team up with the UNP or the Pohottuwa party to do this,” he said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting of the Hewaheta Kivul Lindapatha SLFP Central Organisation recently.
Dissanayake said the SLFP would be in the government for the next three years without any problem since the term of office of the President will continue for another three years. He said the SLFP had gathered momentum in the political front during the last two weeks following nomination day while the ‘Pohottuwa’ party had suffered serious setbacks in its popularity.
“Almost 50 percent of the former MEP members who supported Dinesh Gunawardene were now with the SLFP,” he said.
“Under the present circumstances, no party would be able to command 51 percent of the membership of the local councils after the forthcoming election.
