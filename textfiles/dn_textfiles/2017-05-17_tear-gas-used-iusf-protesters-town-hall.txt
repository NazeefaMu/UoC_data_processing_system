Tear gas used on IUSF protesters at Town Hall

 
Tear gas and water cannons were used against the Inter University Students’ Federation protestors in Town Hall a short while ago.
The Police say that the protest was staged defying the court ruling issued yesterday.
Earlier today IUSF convener Weerasekara said that they will go ahead with their planned protest despite the ban imposed yesterday by Courts.
The IUSF told Daily News Online that apart from abolishing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, they demand the government to take action on university admission shortages, to allocate 6 percent of funds to education, to refrain from money charges within school systems, stop selling government organizations and to refrain from making ETCA agreements between India and Sri Lanka.
