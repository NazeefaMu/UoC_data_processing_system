The company’s specialist technical team can remotely monitor all installations via GPRS and are able to provide islandwide assistance speedily in the event of any breakdowns.
Panda Solar offers a free estimate for any location and after installation of the solar panels, during the first year the technical free provides three site visits free of charge. Should the client move to another location, Panda Solar will install the same panels with no fee charged.
“Panda Solar can through solar power provide a home’s current or future solar energy requirements, ensuring the electricity bill reflects a zero value and which after six years the investment can be easily recouped.
