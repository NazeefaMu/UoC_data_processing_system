Defamatory case filed by Hudson Samarasinghe fixed for trial

A lawsuit filed by former SLBC Chairman Hudson Samarasinghe against Nirmala de Alwis, wife of late Sri Lankan radio and television broadcaster and lyricist Premakeerthi de Alwis, claiming Rs. 500 million as damages for an alleged defamatory statement, was fixed for trial on January 19 by Colombo District Court yesterday.
Meanwhile, Colombo District Court rejected a request made by the plaintiff that the lawsuit should not proceed with the facts pertaining to the murder of Premakeerthi de Alwis.
However, Nirmala de Alwis had raised objections for the request citing that her statement was relevant to her husband’s death.
Plaintiff Hudson Samarasinghe stated alleged defamatory statement made by the defendant had given a wrong impression to the public and the defendant had made this statement with wrongful intention to defame or injure to him.
Counsel Lakshan Dias appeared for the defendant.
