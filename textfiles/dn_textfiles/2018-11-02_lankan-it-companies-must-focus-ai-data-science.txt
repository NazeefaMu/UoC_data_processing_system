Lankan IT companies must focus  on AI, data science

AI (Artificial Intelligence) and data science will be a point of focus globally for IT companies and Sri Lanka should also look for opportunities in this segment, said Chairman, SLASSCOM, Jeevan Gnanam.
“Globally this segment is growing very fast and it will be close to a trillion dollar industry by the end of next year. The global markets are changing, hence this would be a huge opportunity for us to be relevant and be prevalent in this opportunity,” he said.
Gnanam pointed out that if they need to have revenue of USD 2,400 per person, 16,000 people need to join the IT industry. However the local education curriculum does not support new trends in IT. “This is the biggest challenge we face,” he added.Accounting for the fact that 7,000+ degree holders leave from public and private sector universities, the future needs of the developing world could not be met. Therefore SALSSCOM had initiated programs along with public and private sector universities island wide to provide knowledge on new trends related to IT sector. Data science and AI are more known as a knowledge distribution tactic. Currently SLASSCOM s’ export industry sums up to USD 1.2 billion and they have a mandate to increment it to USD 1.6 billion. He said that increasing IT exports is the best way out to control the depreciating of the rupee.
The Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) will be organizing the first- ever SLASSCOM AI Asia summit. It will be hosted by The Kingsbury, on November 7 from 8.30 am-5.30 pm.
GIZ, a German Development Cooperation focuses on carrying out bilateral cooperation agreement along with the German and Sri Lankan government. GIZ had been long partnering with SLASSCOM to support their development and innovative schemes. “SLASSCOM is a strong rival of the future development of the country which is an essential change,” said Randhula De Silva, from GIZ.
She further highlighted that one of the main reason for them to join with SLASSCOM was to bring international experts to Sri Lanka to assist in the local development.
The AI Asia Summit 2018 which is organized by SLASSCOM for the first time will be a great opportunity for Sri Lanka to understand and cooperate AI aspects in their work. The main outcome of this summit would be the National AI policy. The key international speakers include Timothy Kooi, Head of Data Analytics at DHL Asia Pacific, Yasantha Rajakarunanayake, Senior Director Technology, Media Trek, Adam Easton, CEO, SimCentric Technologies, James Shanahan, Founder and Principal, Boutique Data Consultancy, Rukshan Batuwita, Applied Machine Leaning Scientist and Chrisantha Fernando, Senior Research Scientist, Google DeepMind.
