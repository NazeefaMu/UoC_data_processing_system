Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena create racing history

Young racing star brothers Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena created history by being the first Sri Lankans to win an international motor racing event for their country when they emerged overall winners of the three-stage Asia Cup Road Race in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The championship was conducted as an open age category event and included three stages worked off in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan. The Sri Lankan pair earned an aggregate of 10 points from the three stages to crown themselves as champions and receive their award the Federation of International Motorcycling (FIM) Asia General Assembly in Kuala Lumpur.
Jaden and Aaron fearlessly challenged matured and experienced riders from countries such as Japan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Nepal. They beat many riders on their home soil and placed Sri Lanka high on the Asia racing map.
The two brothers came into the limelight in 2011 when they first participated at the ACRR as eight and nine-year lads. The determined riders came through the national selection process beating national level and three Forces riders over twice their age to become the best riders of the 150cc and 250cc events.
