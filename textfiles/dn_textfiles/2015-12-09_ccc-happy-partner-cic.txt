CCC happy to partner CIC

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is dedicated to lend a helping hand to the SME sector to realise its vast potential, says Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Chairman Samantha Ranatunga, who is also the Managing Director of CIC Holdings.
“The CCC is the apex body of business in Sri Lanka, being the oldest business chamber in the country. In short, it is the oldest trade organisation in the land. It is a great asset for business and industry in the country and a very significant player in the economy. I know how valuable the CCC is, because I have been a beneficiary [of its good work] before becoming an office bearer. The CIC, where I have worked for 25 years now, has benefitted greatly from the CCC and this is true for almost every company in the country,” said Ranatunga, explaining the CCC’s role in a nutshell in an interview with the Daily News.
“This is why I thought of joining the CCC and playing an active role in it. With our wide network of regional chambers and nearly 8,400 institutions who are our stakeholders directly and indirectly, we play a multitude of roles in influencing policy. Our role in dealing with larger organisations is rather well known, but what is less well known is our work in rural areas and with SMEs. We want to be known for our role in championing the small holders. There are a lot of inputs that the SMEs can get from the larger organisations, we want to make it happen. It is challenging work, but it is our heart and soul,” says Ranatunga.

“I would call the CCC the main taproot of the economy. We have broadbased over the last 176 years to be relevant to everyone, to all stakeholders. We have a constant engagement with the policymakers. Ours is an independent view of what is right for the country’s business and economy. We are a key influence driver. We want a bigger interaction with the authorities. We are a broader platform for a better dialogue and consultation with policymakers,” explained Ranatunga.
“We always had a solid platform of understanding with the Government and policymakers. We want that platform to be strengthened which will be better for investment. We want a better dialogue with the policymakers. We have a perception of national priorities and from the policymakers’ side, we are always keen to know what their priorities are. Then we can play an even more meaningful role in developing the national economy. Consistency of policy is very important for national development. Countries which have had consistency in policy have done extremely well while countries with inconsistent policies have suffered even with vast resources. There should be consistent policies for national priorities such education and economy. If there is consistency, economies can do well.”
Ranatunga advocates “policies that won’t change across governments” at least for key sectors such as health, education, SME, social welfare and regional development. He expressed optimism on this score, since the previous and new governments were both basically aligned on the issue of economic policies.
Noting the Government’s avowed goal to increase exports to US$ 50 billion, Ranatunga said there should be a bigger focus on the services sector including education, the knowledge economy and reskilling the people. “We have to redefine how we look at this issue. We have no more land, so we basically have to look at sectors that can expand. We have to go the next level of exports. The service sector has to be expanded. We have to look at our skills base and move up the line with the knowledge economy. We have to think about reskilling our people’s skills. We also have to bear in mind that we are no longer a country with the cheapest labour. Neither do we have a good knowledge economy - we have to realign that to match the rest of the world.”
Ranatunga seeks enhanced moves to bring Sri Lankans domiciled abroad who will be an invaluable asset in terms of moving towards the knowledge economy. “At the moment we are just skimming the surface. For industries like BPO, we do not have the numbers or the scale. But we have to leverage on sectors where we have scale, such as accountancy where we have some of the best people globally.
When we have a good skills base, we can be involved in global knowledge outsourcing. If we channel that knowledge into areas where we can process that knowledge, it will benefit the country.

This move will have a positive impact on the economy.”
Ranatunga expressed the hope that with the new consensual trends in local politics, the people and the business community could expect a higher level of maturity in policy making. “We must applaud maturity in politics whenever we see it, build the momentum and ensure its continuity for the progress of the nation.”
Ranatunga points out that our thinking patterns must change to reflect the needs of the times. “For example, there should be risk-based lending for ideas. Banks are used to requiring collateral. One basically cannot go the bank with a good [business] idea and seek financial help. But these should change.”
Ranatunga notes that several leading Sri Lankan companies were at the cutting edge of their business in terms of technical prowess, sustainability and innovativeness. Their enterprising spirit has helped Sri Lanka to survive the loss of GSP Plus and the global economic downturn. “These companies have kept on growing. But we cannot go on forever with a few big companies sharing the burden. Look at Vietnam which does US$ 130 billion exports, Singapore does US$ 500 billion. We should not think of US$ 50 billion as an impossible number. We can do it. If Vietnam can do it, why cannot we ? We need such positive thinking and attitudes. We have to understand our problems and go for solutions.”
Ranatunga enthuses that Sri Lanka can do a lot more to attract world class employers on a platform of investor friendliness. “We have to get skilled people and multinationals here. We must become a preferred destination for them. We have to educate the people to become competitive. We have to improve on these shortcomings to improve the economy. The Chamber will strive to increase the standards of education in subjects related to business. We will do this to empower rural youth on par with urban youth. It will not only provide the industrial sector with skilled personnel, it will also help the rural youth to do better and advance in their chosen careers.”
Having been an employee of CIC Holdings for well over two decades, agriculture is a subject close to Ranatunga’s heart. “Agriculture is the problem child of the economy. It is still dependent on subsidies and handouts with no linkage towards productivity. The fertilizer subsidy alone costs Rs.50 billion to 60 billion which is 30 percent of what we totally spent on education in 2014. We have to rethink subsidies, perhaps give them in terms of output. That will reward productivity. The land available for agriculture is getting smaller. We have to utilize more technology to increase yields and productivity. There must be more responsible farming. More youth must be attracted to farming. ”
He lamented that only a few companies such as CIC were engaged in large-scale agriculture, with several companies literally leaving the field soon after entering it. “One problem is that most companies do not see big returns, they see the [price, weather etc] fluctuations and how it can affect their revenue streams, so they think it is too risky. This calls for a rethink on how we perceive farming. We have to reskill more people for farming. Today, the average farmer wears the badge of poverty with pride and is generally described in the newspapers as a poor farmer. But it should not be the case. There are many farmers who earn Rs.3 to 4 million per season, but some of them want to stay under the radar without paying taxes and do not want to declare their income. They thrive in the non-entity form but we have to turn them into bigger entrepreneurs to take agriculture to the next level.”
Agriculture or any other business, Ranatunga says, calls for a lot of research. He cites CIC as a prime example for a company which takes Research and Development on its own and with universities very seriously given the role it plays in the economy. Ranatunga calls for a better dissemination of knowledge from all universities and questions why only few local universities are engaged in research.
Ranatunga is a passionate advocate for skills development in the populace at all levels. “We must begin this journey now. If we have more work skills, opportunities will come from local and foreign investors. There are many wrong notions about arts graduates, for example, but there are those who might need their writing skills. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is crucial. We must create a proper macroeconomic environment and have more investor friendly policies to attract more investors along with good governance, transparency and stable political systems. We have the ingredients to attract investments. We have to make the Board of Investment (BoI) more dynamic. Our policies too can improve to attract more FDI.”
Elaborating on FDI, Ranatunga says Sri Lanka can do much better in terms of FDI thanks to its “fantastic location” at the heart of the East-West passage and its relatively good infrastructure, logistics, telecom/net connectivity, educated and knowledgeable workforce. “There are so many plus points for FDI in Sri Lanka. But we have to reassure the foreign investors that their investments will be protected at all times. That is an essential component. Then there are some other factors such as good governance, socio-political stability and rule of law that most leading investors seek in any country. These must be assured to them regardless of local political developments.”
Ranatunga, who has an intimate knowledge of multinational companies, has a better worldview on multinationals than many other business persons. “Most people like to bash multinationals, but there are many things we can learn from them, for example research and development, innovation and value for money. They respond to customer needs. Companies like Akzo Nobel (which the CIC represents in Sri Lanka) constantly innovate, have very high safety standards, and their products will give you real value. But from a regulator’s point of view, there should be better consumer protection, better safeguards and regulations so the consumers or users do not get exploited or duped at any time. It is a two way process.”
As for the CIC itself, it is looking at two areas for expansion – “one is dairy, where we are looking to expand with Israeli technology to supply the national milk collecting grid. We plan to import high quality livestock genetic material and do embryo transplanting here. We are keen to see an improvement in dairy consumption as well – that is why we went into yogurt. Sri Lankans prefer yogurt to liquid milk, so we want to increase the variety there. Importing and using powdered milk is not viable in the long term. We want to reduce that dependence and we have invested heavily in the dairy sector. We also want to get into high value vegetables for exports using advanced greenhouse technology under a certified responsible farming system. We are also setting up a technology centre in Dambulla to showcase these technologies to farmers.
He is pleased to see more companies getting listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). “We also need more small-time shareholders. It will create more interest among rural investors, who will have a sense of belonging. The listing prices itself leads to more transparency, better governance, better financial reporting. You have to be responsible and accountable on a continuous basis.
Then the confidence of investors will also grow, which can drive the economy to the next level, which is what Sri Lanka really needs at this hour.”
