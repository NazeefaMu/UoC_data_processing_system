Eco-conscious styles!

Students of Catwalk Model Academy were trained to recycle clothes to create DIY Cloths and Dye art. Each and every costume featured on the Catwalk Colour Runway was designed by the students under the guidance of experienced designers and models. The event was choreographed by Roshitha Ryan. Krishan Akw was the costume design consultant. The makeup artists were Chamari Abeysekara, Diana Kandepola, Roy Krish, and Kavi Jayawardena. Pictures by Shan Rambukwella
