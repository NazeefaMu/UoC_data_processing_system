Royal forwards against Isipathana three-quarters

Royal College Colombo will face a tough battle when they face favourites for the title Isipathana College in their Singer Inter-school Division 1 League Rugby Tournament second round match for the Milroy Fernando trophy, which is scheduled to be played at CR & FC grounds, Longdon Place at 4.15 pm today.
The Pathana lads has brought in former centre Randy Silva to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of Malintha Ruberu who is expected to play in the second half if needed and will most probably play in his pet position as fly half.
In the pack, seasoned campaigner Wageesha Weerasinghe will play as number eight alongside their cracking flankers in Sashmitha Fernando and Devin Gunaratne in the third row. Kaveesha Madushan and Sharukh Manabarana have been moved up to the front row to bind down with hooker Hasitha Mapitigama.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal ‘eight’ especially Ayesh Maduranga, Mohamad Nabeel, Azmir Fajudeen, Harith Lokugamage, Hisham Barrie, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Ashen Fernando, Maleesha Madumewan and captain Gunadheera are expected to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position.
If they deliver and get their act together to proceed with the famous rolling maul then the Royalist will have a chance of pulling off this game. However they face a huge challenge from the Pathana forwards spearheaded by their cracking number eight Weerasinghe who will be ably supported by Gunaratne, Lahiru Wishvajith, Kaveesha Madushan, Sharukh Manabarana, Hasitha Mapitigama, Weeratunge and Sashmitha Fernando.
In the set scrums the experienced Royal hooker Fajudeen should get the better of his vis-a-vis Mapitigama, while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage together with Madumewan and Isipathana line out jumpers in Weeratunge and Weerasinghe.
Royal’s new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyanaratne are playing together for the first time this season. Everything will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Pathana will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum play maker Harith Bandara will pair off well with his new fly half Randy Silva.
In all probability, young Bandara should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Chamod Fernando and Ranindhu Padmasanka together with their skipper and centre Kushan Indunil. This is in addition to the experienced centre cum vice captain Sumudhu Rankothge who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank as full back Gayan Wickramaratne is there to join the line and form the overlap. They will hope that their new halves combination of Bandara and Silva will hit it off. The halves combination of these two players will have to give a very good performance if Isipathana are to emerge victorious.

Science College – S Thomas’ College
S Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia will once again come under pressure when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season, giant killers Science College Mount Lavinia in their ‘A’ Division inter-school Singer League rugby championship second round match at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana at 4.15pm today. Science College probably met a real force in their last match against Wesley College last week and finally won by a close margin of 11-7. The story could be the same against the Thomians who are holding back nothing this season as they have won all their matches upto date with runaway victories and threatened the pride of St. Peter’s College in their last outing where they virtually thrashed them by 36 points to 13 last week.
Referee: Rohan Fernando.
