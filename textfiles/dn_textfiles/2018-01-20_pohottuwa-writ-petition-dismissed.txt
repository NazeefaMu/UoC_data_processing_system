Rejection of Maharagama UC nomination papers:
Pohottuwa writ petition dismissed

The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed a writ petition filed by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or Pohottuwa which challenged the Election Commission’s decision to reject the nomination papers for the Maharagama Urban Council.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera dismissed the petition citing that there is no reason to grant relief on merits.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Maharagama Urban Council were rejected on the grounds that it did not contain the total number of female candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of Section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The SLPP was also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Elections Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council.
Six petitioners had cited, Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Dumminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim,JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Elections Commission.
