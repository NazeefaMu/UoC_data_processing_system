We were able to work together with all stakeholders involved in the industry and conquer all these challenges to keep the industry from growing.”

This National recognition is very special to us because it comes from the very same community we have been serving passionately since our inception. I wish to thank the CILT Sri Lanka and the Judges for awarding us this prestigious award. We are honored and inspired by this award and will continue to serve towards ‘Empowering Sri Lanka’s Hub Aspirations’,” he said.
