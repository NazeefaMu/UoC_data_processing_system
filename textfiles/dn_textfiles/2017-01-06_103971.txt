Over 50 selected to import rice from January 20: Yapa

Around 50 rice importers have been selected to import 100,000 MT of rice by January 20 as a remedy to the scarcity of rice and to bring down the price of rice, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said the process of registering rice importers will be completed by January 4. Abeywardena said under this process, suitable parties for rice importation were selected. "The selected parties can import rice under the direct supervision of the government.The decision on rice imports is jointly taken by a committee of the Trade Ministry and the Committee appointed on the Cost of Living. It is up to the joint committee to take measures on rice importation including calculating the volume of rice to be imported," the state minister said.
Questioned why the government was not taking prompt action against the high price of rice, Abeywardena said a price control for rice will be implemented soon.
The state minister said that out of 800,000 acres of paddy lands, only 240,000 acres could be cultivated this season due to the drought and water shortage. This is the main reason for the price hike of rice, he said.
