Mayhem at Southern Province meeting, Governor’s directive ignored

The special council meeting convened by the Central Provincial Council to adopt the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution was held contravening the directives of the Southern Province Governor.
Earlier, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara had summoned the meeting.
However, the Governor had sent a subsequent directive to Council Chairman K. A. Somawansa requesting him to postpone the same to August 12 as the proposed bill was to be amended.
At the outset of the meeting Chairman informed the house about the Governor’s directive to call off the meeting to which the Joint Opposition loyalists of the ruling United National Freedom Alliance (UPFA) vehemently protested demanding the meeting be held as scheduled.
Then Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva told the house that the Governor is constitutionally empowered to postpone any meeting or even a session of the council under executive powers delegated to him as President’s representative.The Chairman has to act according to the governor’s orders, the Chief Minister observed.
Then Joint Opposition loyalists proposed to take a vote of councillors whether to carryout orders of the governor’s second directive requesting the postponement of the council.
Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also pointed out that the council has no right to take a vote on whether to implement governor’s orders to suspend the meeting. According to the Constitution the governor has the authority to send such directives. So we demand to carry out the governors orders.
At this stage councillors began creating a scene making allegations. Joint Opposition loyalists forced the Chairman not to postpone the meeting on governor’s instructions while opposition members including a section of the ruling party demanded to carry out the governor’s orders.
The house turned boisterous and unruly and the chairman postponed the meeting for 15 minutes.
As the House resumed after 15 minutes the Chairman delivered his verdict over the issue.
‘’I have to carry out the orders of the governor and respect both the President and Governor. However I have to listen to the majority of the peoples’ representative of the council.
So I decide to take a vote on the draft 20th Amendment to Constitution referred to me by the governor previously as formerly scheduled. I am also prepared to take up the amended bill also for discussion once it is duly sent to me by the governor, the Chairman said delivering his decision.
The Chief Minister who commented on the chairman’s verdict said that it was completely unlawful and unethical and it provided a very adverse constitutional illustration for the future.
As the meeting is going to be held in an illegal manner we cannot take part in such an unlawful assembly.So we walk out of the House, the Chief Minister declared.
The Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also made a similar statement and walked out of the chamber with his group.
As the Chairman was to continue the meeting without the participation opposition and some of the ruling party an opposition member abruptly took the Maze and ran out of the chamber creating a fanatical drama.
The Joint opposition loyalists ran after him and grabbed the Maize from him and brought back to the chamber.
However the Chairman held the meeting amidst pandemonium and obstruction of the members. Finally he took a vote over the draft of the proposed bill. All 27 Joint Opposition loyalists who were present voted against the draft bill while UNP councillor T.K.Gamini who was present in the chamber abstained. Acccordingly the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was defeated by 27 votes.
The JVP Councillors were not present at the yesterday’s council meeting.
