The quintessential politician

The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was the second leader of the country to be assassinated while in harness, the other being S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike (the country's first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake too did not die of natural cause while yet holding the reins).
It is exactly a quarter century ago that President Premadasa was killed by an LTTE suicide bomber while directing the UNP's May Day procession at Armour Street. The incident, no doubt, will be still fresh in the memory of most Lankans who went through those turbulent days in the early 1990s, as the country marks the 25th death anniversary of the late President.
Premadasa had just survived an impeachment attempt against him by his own party men and was in the process of a damage control exercise in order to wrest the political initiative that appeared to be slipping away from him. Though he brought the second JVP uprising under control and earned the plaudits of many, there were those who continued to demonize him for the means adopted to quell the violence, particularly his political enemies.
Revival
Whatever said of the late President Premadasa he was the quintessential politician of the masses who broke the mould of the hitherto elitist UNP and brought it closer to the common man. The Grand Old Party was in the doldrums after the route it suffered at the hands of Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1970. It was left to JRJ and Premadasa to gather the pieces and rebuild the party into a winning outfit. In Premadasa, JRJ had an able lieutenant who took the fight to the enemy. The duo went around the country in the task of rebuilding the grassroots machinery of the party and lifting the morale of the party cadres who were a dejected and despaired lot after the humiliating defeat.
Premadasa, with his mesmerizing oratory laced, homespun wisecracks and colloquial banter was the ideal foil for the measured tones of JRJ. The duo proved to be a winning combination.
The UNP swept the board winning over 140 seats at the 1977 General Election and Premadasa emerged victor by the highest majority overall in his Colombo Central constituency.
It was no surprise when JRJ made Premadasa the Prime Minister. It was the first time in the party's history that a commoner was elevated to that high office. Though the Executive Presidency relegated the post of Prime Minister to a virtual figurehead entity (Premadasa often used to claim that it was like the post of a peon) he nevertheless warmed to the task and went about his business in a style that is unique to Ranasinghe Premadasa, his legendary commitment to whatever task he set his sights on producing the results that would have been unattainable to lesser mortals. But the area in which he gained fame and recognition was for his signature housing programme, his ambition being to provide a shelter of their own for every family in the country and was the prime mover in having the UN declare a World Habitat Day each year.
His populist programmes, common man persona, skilled oratory, energy for hard work and charisma, no doubt gained massive public support for him and it was only natural that JRJ would nominate Premadasa to take over the mantle from him to lead the country.
Non- conformist
The rest, as they say, is history. Premadasa won the Presidential election, albeit narrowly, at a time the country was practically in flames with the JVP uprising causing rivers of blood to flow in the South while the LTTE was waging a separatist war in the North that was taking a heavy toll on the lives of the soldiers.
Despite these twin challenges, Premadasa also had to contend with the presence of foreign troops in the country in the form of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) that was a major irritant to his rule. He was in any event a fierce opponent of the Indo-Lanka Accord (he boycotted the signing ceremony) and was constantly clamouring for the exit of the Indian Army from Sri Lankan soil. This he eventually achieved in the second year of his Presidency.
The late President Premadasa was a non- conformist and the unconventional manner he requested the IPKF to leave the country was condemned by his critics as offensive to diplomatic protocol.
Unparalleled service
It is this unconventional, unorthodox style that gained him acceptance in whatever he strove to do for the benefit of the public, be it opening of garment factories in the far flung areas of the country or telling a nosy British Commissioner where to get off when the latter was found interfering with the country's electoral process. It was this same unorthodoxy he employed in overcoming the impeachment proceeding against him.
True, he had his faults and was rightly criticized for some of his actions, but Ranasinghe Premasada, it is agreed by most in this country, left an indelible impression in the political landscape of this country. His services to the poor and downtrodden were unparalleled to this day. His memory, no doubt, would continue to live in the hearts of thousands in this country who benefited from his services.
Had the cruel hand of an assassin not snatched his life in the prime of his Presidency this country may have turned a new page by now in the sphere of development and progress.
