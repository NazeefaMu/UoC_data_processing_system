Ananda College who began the schools season strongly but have failed to maintain that momentum will be hoping that they can get their act together for the Big one against traditional rivals Nalanda College when they meet in the 89th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter for the Dr NM Perera memorial trophy on March 3 and 4 at the SSC grounds.
All-rounder and 4th year coloursman Asela Sigera has guided his school to three outright wins in 13 outings against Zahira Colombo, Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Lumbini in their Under 19 Inter School cricket tournament this season. They have suffered a loss to St. Joseph's College. Ananda have also recorded five first innings victories and lost two on the first innings.
Skipper Sigera has scored 450 runs and performed with the ball as well claiming 52 wickets. The leading run getter of the team is deputy skipper and 4th year coloursman Lahiru Attanayake with over 700 runs under his belt inclusive of a century and seven half centuries. His best was 108 not out against Trinity College.
All rounder and 2nd year coloursman (right hand bat and medium pacer) Dushan Hettige is one of the key performers of the team with 620 runs inclusive of three hundreds and three half centuries with a highest score of 114 against Trinity College.
All rounder Daminda Reshan is another player to watch having scored over 300 runs including a century against Maliyadeva and bagging 34 wickets. Another key role player is right hand batsman and pacer Shamal Hirushan with 411 runs and 30 wickets.
Other top order batsmen who are expected to contribute are Kanishka Ranthilakage (500 runs) and Kavindu Gimhana (300).
In the Battle of the Maroons history Ananda leads the tally with 12 wins against Nalanda’s six with 71 drawn. The last victory in a Maroons Battle was recorded by Ananda at the Big Match in 2003 under Duminda Kularatne.
Ananda College has produced many talented players to the national team such as Anuruddha Polonowita, Sunil Wettimuny, Sidath Wettimuny, Ajith de Silva, Brendon Kuruppu, Arjuna Ranatunga, Marvan Atapattu, Sanjeewa Ranatunga, Thilan Samaraweera, Tilan Wijesinghe, Hemantha Wickramaratne, Chandika Hathurusingha, Avishka Gunawardena, Thilina Kandamby, Akalanka Ganegama, Muthumudalige Pushpakumara, Nishantha Ranatunga, Mahela Udawatta, Mithra Wettimuny, Dhammika Ranatunga, Charith Senanayake, Dulip Samaraweera and the current Sri Lanka Test cricket captain Dinesh Chandimal.
The first half century, the first century and also the first double century for Sri Lanka in Test Cricket were scored by three Anandians – Arjuna Ranatunga, Sidath Wettimuny and Brendon Kuruppu respectively. Kuruppu incidentally is the only wicket-keeper in the history of Test cricket to score a double century on debut.
The Anandians are coached by Ramesh Perera with Amal Fernando as his assistant.
