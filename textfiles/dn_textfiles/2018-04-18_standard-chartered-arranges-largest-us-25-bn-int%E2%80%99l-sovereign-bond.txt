Standard Chartered arranges largest US$ 2.5 bn int’l  sovereign bond offering

Standard Chartered acting as a joint lead manager arranged a US$ 2.5 billion international sovereign bond offering on behalf of Sri Lanka.
The bank successfully priced USD 1.25 billion each of five and 10 years Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured 144A / Reg S issuance for the Republic of Sri Lanka, making this the country’s twelfth successful foray into the US dollar bond market since 2007. The key objectives of the client were twin fold, which included price and size. The bank was successfully able to meet both these requirements. Orders flowed in steadily as soon as the transaction was announced with a strong participation from institutional investors across Asia, Europe and United States.
 The transaction had a final order book of over USD 3 billion in the 5 year tranche, achieving an over-subscription ratio of more than 2.4x, across over 235 accounts and a final order book of over USD 3.5 billion in the 10 year tranche, achieving an over-subscription ratio of more than 2.8x, across over 190 accounts.
Commenting on the transaction Lakshan Goonetilleke, Executive Director Head of Financial Institutions at Standard Chartered said, “Post Asian holidays in the week of April 2, the Sovereign was advised to select the appropriate window in week of 9th April. The strategy worked out very well, with books garnering strong demand from institutional investors in Asia and Europe. U.S. investors, who traditionally have been big supporters of Sri Lankan issuances.”
Chief Executive Officer of Standard Chartered Jim Mc Cabe, said, “We are proud to be part of this success as this represents the largest ever bond offering by Sri Lanka and incidentally is the seventh consecutive USD Bond offering mandate for Standard Chartered. This also confirms the investor sentiment towards Sri Lanka and its continued growth story as we are committed to the development of the country and are here for good.”
