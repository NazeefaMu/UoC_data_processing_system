Railway strike called off

The Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) has temporarily called off their strike scheduled for yesterday (20) night after discussions with Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister, Ashok Abeysinghe.
ROSU, Co-convener, Lal Ariyaratne speaking to Daily News said the strike had been called over long standing issues pertaining to their salaries. Deputy Minister Abeysinghe promised to take their demands to the Prime Minister.
He had also explained that the Salaries Commission was under President Maithripala Sirisena and thus he would speak to the President about the issue. Ariyaratne speaking further said the Deputy Minister had also promised to get the unions an appointment with the Secretary to the President in the next two weeks. These promises had led to the strike being called off temporarily.
