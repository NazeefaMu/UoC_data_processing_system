Seized luxury jeeps found to be assembled locally

The two luxury jeeps seized by police from two millionaire businessman in Anuradhapura had been assembled locally with imported vehicle parts. This has been established by the Government Analyst Department during investigations conducted into the matter, said a spokesperson for the Anuradhapura Division Police Crimes Unit.
He said a Land Cruiser jeep, used by a businessman, and a Pajero jeep, found in a private garage, were seized in 2015 and 2017 for investigations on the directions of the IGP following several complaints received by him.
When the matter was reported to Court, the Anuradhapura Magistrate ordered the government analyst to inspect them and report whether they had been assembled locally. The government analyst who inspected the engines and the chassis of the two vehicles confirmed it.
The spokesperson said once the analyst report was officially received, they would be submitted to Court and the two vehicles would be handed over to the Customs Department to dismantle and destroy them.
