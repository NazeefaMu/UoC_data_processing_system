The exact date of introduction of hockey to Matale is not known and the 'doyen of hockey' in this country P Thyangavelu told this correspondent that this game was introduced in the thirties by late P T Rajan, late M S Jainudeen and himself. The game took wings and flew high under late George Mant a bus magnate whose love for hockey knew no bounds. Of the trio P Thangavelu is still with us almost 90 years of age. The first hockey ground was constructed in 1957 when Edward Silva was the Mayor of Matale and the 2nd Hockey Nationals was staged there.
A little history about the two schools. St Thomas Matale was founded in 1873 A D initially it had on roll 75 boys and 17 girls. Emmanueld was its first head master and the school was run with the funds from the Church. The staff had just four members.
Three years later a major change was brought about and the school was separated with a Girls section started named St Agnes Convent. In 1897 the school gained the status of Assisted school from the Government. The main hall of the school was built between 1901 and 1924.
The school took a giant step forward when that legendary figure Charles Robinson was appointed Principal in 1923. In 1936 the game of hockey was introduced.
Charles Robinson served as Principal of the school for 35 years till his retirement in 1958. A tall figure clad always in coat and tie was seen even after his retire taking his constitutional walk from Hulangamuwa to Matale town. Since then many Principals had served the school. In the early sixties the school was taken over by the State. The present Principal is Dampi Wanasinghe.
