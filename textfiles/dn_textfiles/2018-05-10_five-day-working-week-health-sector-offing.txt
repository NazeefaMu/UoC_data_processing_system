Five-day working week for health sector in the offing

Discussions have commenced to introduce a five-day working week for health workers, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, overtime payment will be made to health workers who work more than five days a week.
“There was a request to increase attendants' training to six months. It will be considered,” he said, addressing the May Day rally organized by the Sri Lanka Janaraja Health Services Union, in Colombo, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that at present, workers enjoy an eight-hour working shift but they do not know how hard it was to achieve this by workers in the past.
“Some trade unions met their downfall because they became affiliated to various political elements but the Sri Lanka Janaraja Health Services Union became stronger by not being affiliating to any political element. It has a 68-year-old history and I have been working with the union for 40 years,” he added.
