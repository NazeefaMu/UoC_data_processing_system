Sidharth takes criticism from industry seriously

Bollywood actor Sidharth Malhotra believes in the power of constructive criticism, but says he takes criticism seriously when it comes from industry insiders. Within a short span since his debut with Student Of The Year, Sidharth has tasted a fair share of success and failure.
Asked whether he has learnt to handle criticism better after films like Kapoor And Sons and Baar Baar Dekho, Sidharth said, “Well, I think film reviews don’t really help an actor to grow or improve creativity because their words and comments are black and white... They are always inching towards negative or positive. And I understand that for them, they mostly concentrate on the business potential of a film.”
He added, “Only constructive criticism can help us to grow as creative people, as actors. Therefore, I take any constructive assessment seriously when it comes from insiders of the fraternity.”
The actor said he tries to do new characters with every film, and then assesses if he has got it right or explores the flaws. “These things matter for me to go to the next level. So, I take criticism seriously, depending on where it is coming from.”
