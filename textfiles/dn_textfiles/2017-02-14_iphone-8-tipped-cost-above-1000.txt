iPhone 8 Tipped to Cost above $1,000

There’s been a lot of speculation about the iPhone 8 with specifications and design changes being at the forefront. However, a fresh report sheds some light on the iPhone 8 price bracket. Reportedly, the premium device marking Apple’s 10-year anniversary could well be priced north of $1,000 (roughly Rs. 67,100) - thanks to the introduction of OLED displays.
Furthermore, the report also says that Apple could call it the iPhone X instead of the largely speculated iPhone 8. Fast Company cites people familiar with the matter to claim that there will be three variants that will launch in this fall. The first two variants will be presumably be - a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and a 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus - which will sport LCD displays. The iPhone 8 will be sport a 5.8-inch OLED display that stretches till the edges. The Home Button will be integrated within the display, and the battery will be much larger than its other counterparts. The device will sport a dual camera setup just like the iPhone 7 Plus.
As OLED displays are twice as expensive as LCD displays, Apple’s celebratory iPhone 8 smartphone will be priced above $1,000 (roughly Rs. 67,100), according to the report. This doesn’t come as a surprise as Apple is known for this kind of pricing, and its most premium variant of the iPhone 7 Plus costs $969 (Rs. 92,000 in India).
The report further adds that Apple has been working with Lumentum to bring a unique 3D-sensing technology. This technology will bring some sort of facial recognition, better image resolution for the camera app, or some form of augmented reality application. However, the actual advantage of this technology is not known yet. (Gadgets)
