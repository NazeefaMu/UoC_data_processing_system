‘Rajapaksa family, main target of 19th Amendment’

Prof. Ven. Medagoda Abhayathissa Thera said people have an opportunity to select a people-friendly leader on January 5.
The Thera added that the country does not need a leader who asks people to drink beer instead of drinking king coconut water.
Ven Abhayathissa Thera was addressing a gathering organised by ‘Eliya’at Pepiliyana Sunethra Devi Pirivena yesterday.
The Thera said only the persons who have maintain the cultural identity of the country should be elected as the rulers of the country.
According to the Thera, the 2015 political change was a result of a political conspiracy. Moreover, the main target of the 19th Amendment was the Rajapaksa family, the Thera said.
The Thera added that the duty of religious leaders at this juncture is to point out the reality of these situations. The present political situation should be well utilised for the betterment of the society and the country.
“A mechanism to satisfy the Tamil diaspora and power-craving persons was carried out during the recent past. During that period, people lost many things. A new constitution was about to be brought in. Political power was changed while that so-called constitution was tried to be passed in Parliament,” he added.
People should select only persons who can work with every ethnic community in a friendly manner and persons who can create a peaceful environment in which everyone can live happily and peacefully, as leaders.
The Thera added that the Speaker tried to describe the prevailing political issue as a Constitutional issue and a people’s issue. Meanwhile, certain persons tried to highlight Sri Lanka as a country which acted undemocratically.
President Maithripa Sirisena has stopped the federal programme launched to divide the country into pieces, he said.
