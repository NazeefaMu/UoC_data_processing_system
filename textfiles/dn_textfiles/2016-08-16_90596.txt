‘Bill on Office on Missing Persons, risky’

Former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris warned that the Bill of the Office on Missing Persons is the most risky Bill passed in the recent past.
He made this observation during a Joint Opposition press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's office in Battaramulla yesterday.
He said passing of the Bill is not part of a home grown mechanism, but part of an international agenda.
He said 12 countries of the Human Rights Council influence Sri Lanka to keep the promises as pledged.
He said the passage of the Bill has serious repercussions on the country and for several generations to come. Prof. Peiris said the lives lost are equally important wherever they are hailing from. Refering to the 27 section of the Act, Prof. Peiris said the Act was focusing on investigating into the missing persons in the North and East.
He said the Act enables foreign interference in Sri Lanka.
He said the Act provides for getting unlimited foreign funds to the Office of the Missing Persons office and entering into agreements with foreign institutions, appointing officials and staff and access to any office.
He said national and provincial institutions are bound to follow the orders of the institution If some one is reluctant to provide details to the institution, it can punish them under the count of contempt of the Court of Appeal.
He said the institution would not be covered by the Right to Information Bill.
