Govt. presently occupied in defusing fiscal time bomb:Finance Minister
The present government is now in the process of defusing the fiscal time bomb it inherited from the Rajapaksa regime in 2015, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. He also said that of the debt payments due from 2019 - 2025, more than 70% of it are debts taken by the ex-regime.
“For example, 77% of the share of our foreign debt service in 2019 and 2020 would be on pre-January, 2015 borrowings. We would have to service a debt of US BN$ 2,845 this year of which, 63% is debts taken by the Rajapaksa regime. In 2019, we have to service 4,285 USD BN of which 77% were taken by Rajapaksa regime. In 2020, there are 3,768 US$ BN debts to be serviced and 77% of it is Rajapaksa-time debts. In 2021, we again had to service 3,441 US$ BN of which 83% was Rajapaksa-time debts. Then in 2022, we had to pay 3,840 US$ BN of which, 71% is Mahinda Rajapaksa’s debts. In 2023, we had to pay 2250 US$ BN and 71% of it is Rajapaksa-time debts. In 2024, we have to service 2218 US$ BN of which 69% is Rajapaksa’s debts. In 2025, we have to service 4275 US$ BN, of which 33% would be Rajapaksa time debts.” Finance Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations while tabling the resolution to raise Rs. 310 BN by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for active liability management.
Assuring that the government had a clear strategy to address the issues of local and foreign debts, Minister Samaraweera said that the present government had to find answers for a debt crisis in the country. “ Of course, the debt issue in hand is a legacy of pre 2015 mismanagement and therefore let me begin by underlining the colossal burden that was left on our shoulders. This government took over a very fragile and structurally imbalanced economy. The economy was in shambles when our government took over in 2015. Economic growth in the post war years was dominated by a foreign debt funded construction boom. The then government went on to spending on infrastructure, investments, many of which yielded little or no return. The government at that time expanded its unproductive expenditure in an irresponsible manner, without proper attention to developing revenue sources to meet such expenditure.
As a result, they developed a fiscal time bomb which the government is now in the process of defusing. We inherited a fiscal time bomb and for the last three years, we have been in the process of defusing the bomb successfully,” Minister Samaraweera said.
Speaking further, Minister Samaraweera said, the “Sovereign bonds issued during 2010 - 2014 amounts to US$ 4.5 BN which would be maturing in 2019/2020. In dollars terms, our annual interest payments on the sovereign bonds would exceed 300 MN US$.
Much of the increase in borrowings by the previous government from expensive external foreign debts, requires investment in production through assets. Unfortunately, no productive investments were mechanized instead of draining our resources to utter wastage.
Fortunately for this country, in 2015, the direction of that disastrous path took a different turn and now for the first time in history, we have a clear approach to manage our debts.
Therefore, we are fully cognizant of our outstanding debts liabilities, denominated in local and foreign currencies, in view of the necessity for institutionalizing a legal framework for managing the country’s public debt profile in a prudent manner that brings debt sustainability and macro-economic stability.”
