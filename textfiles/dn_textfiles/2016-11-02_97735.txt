Cambrian big match winning team felicitation

A ceremony to felicitate Prince of Wales College’s 1977 big match winning team and the re-union get-together of the Old Cambrian victorious team will be held at the Water’s Edge, Battaramulla on November 3 evening. The ceremony has been organized by an Old Cambrian Harsha Peiris, managing Director of Pack World (Pvt) Ltd.
The event has more significance as a celebration of Cambrians’ last out right victory against their arch rivals St. Sebastian’s during their long big match history. In 1977 the victorious Cambrian team was captained by Premalal Fernando and comprised Jayantha Perera (Vice captain), Suresh De Silva, Gamini Silva, Amal Silva, Sudath Munaweera, Sripal Silva, Late Wirantha Fernando, Eric De Alwis, Russel Wijesuriya, Ananda Weerasuriya, Gamunu Chandana Peiris, Vipula Fernando, Sandun Keerthichandra, Ajith Kariyawasam and Sunil De Silva (Coach)
