Ibbankatuwa excavation reveals ancient funeral rites

Details regarding ancient funeral rites in the country are being revealed through new excavations at the Ibbankatuwa ancient cemetery belonging to the megalithic period, Central Cultural Fund Director General Prof. Crishantha Gunawardhana said.
The Director General made these observations at a media conference held at the Ibbankatuwa excavation site.
Gunawardhana said artefacts relating to old human beings were found during excavations. The country’s civilization goes far back in time. The Mathota harbour was a main commercial seaport in the past.
He said the conservation and management of the archaeological sites are essential. Artefacts found from the Ibbankatuwa ancient cemetery will be exhibited to the public at a museum to be established on the site, he said.
The site will be developed as a tourist attraction, the Director General said.
