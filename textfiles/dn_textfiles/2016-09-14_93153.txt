England women confirm Sri Lanka ODI tour

LONDON: England women will conclude their busiest-ever year of international cricket by taking on Sri Lanka in the final round of ICC Women’s Championship in November.
The three-match ODI series was Tuesday confirmed by the England & Wales Cricket Board, and will take place at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on November 12, 15 and 17.
England are currently third on 19 points in the Championship standings, which serve as the qualification tournament for the 2017 World Cup, with Sri Lanka lying in eighth, having won just twice in their first five rounds of the competition.
Arguably the bigger test of England’s credentials will come when they travel to Jamaica next month to play West Indies in the penultimate round of the ICC WC. Stafanie Taylor’s team are one point ahead of England in second place on the table, meaning that the result from that series will
have a significant bearing on the final qualification standings.
“The tour to Sri Lanka will mark the end of the busiest ever year for the England women’s team and the conclusion of the ICC Women’s Championship,” said Mark Robinson, England Women’s Head Coach. “It will be another good test to mark how we are progressing as a squad, as we bid to overcome a passionate home team in the heat and humidity of Sri Lanka.
“As always, it will be a challenge that we will relish, as we keep building for the future and look ahead to the ICC Women’s World Cup on home soil next year.”
