Into the World of  Black and White

Join Ilham’s latest exhibition will be held on May 19 from 5.30 PM to 9.30 in association with Plâté Loft Gallery and Ilham’s own Blacklit Galleria.
Masterpieces in the most intricate and minutely detailed works covering a wide variety of topics, from the explicitly of nature to the most abstract of thoughts, sketches, patterns, designs and story-based theme art: this is the specialty of Ilham Sanoon’s niche talent.
Within a short span of just three years, Ilham has accomplished a style uniquely his own, using dainty lines, the thinnest strokes and deep, detailed expressions which speak more than words could say.
The evening’s Chief Guests will be the respected Rev. Ajantha Mendis and Shamalica Fonseka.
