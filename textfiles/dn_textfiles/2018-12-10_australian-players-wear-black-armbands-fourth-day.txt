Australian players wear black armbands on the fourth day

The highly-anticipated Test series between Australia and India has lived up to its billing so far with some intriguing action in the middle.
The pendulum has swung with every session and finally, it seems that the visitors are on the ascendancy at the moment defending 322. However, the fourth day started with the game in balance even as the Australian players stepped out on the field by wearing the black armbands.
The reason for the same is the passing away of the former Australian cricketer Colin Guest on Saturday. The 81-year-old played only a solitary Test match for his country scoring 59 runs in two outings with the bat.
The hosts gave him a tribute by wearing black armbands in his memory and in a way, thanked Colin for his contribution, predominantly, to the Australian domestic cricket.
“Colin made a significant contribution to our domestic game, both as a player and a coach. His patience was rewarded after debuting for Australia in the Ashes in 1963. On behalf of the Board and staff at Cricket Australia, we sincerely acknowledge Colin for his contribution to Australia’s favourite sport.
He will be sadly missed, and our thoughts are with his family, friends and all those who crossed paths with him in the cricketing community at this time,” Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said.
