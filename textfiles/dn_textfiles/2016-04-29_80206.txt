SriLankan Airlines fund misuse : JO must reply to allegations: Bandara

 
UNP MP Nalin Bandara yesterday challenged the Joint Opposition members to reply to the allegations of heavily misusing the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, over the past years leading to its current debt crisis.
He was speaking at a press conference at Sirikotha.
Bandara said the debt of SriLankan Airlines, which stands at Rs. 461 billion, was mainly due to political mishandling of the Rajapaksa government.
He said SriLankan Airlines was ruined under the management of Nishantha Wickremesinghe, a brother of the former First Lady.
“The loss of this institution is unprecedented in our history. The debt of SriLankan Airlines alonge contributes to increase the per capita debt burden by Rs. 23,063. Now the Joint Opposition is spending lavishly to gather crowds for the May Day rally in Kirulapone. They accumulated this wealth by robbing public money. Most of the road development projects contained heavily inflated figures. We carry out the similar development projects for much lesser amounts,” he said.
He also challenged NFF Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa for an open debate over the statistics on road development work, without slinging mud at the government with distorted facts and figures.
Responding to a question by a journalist on a statement by a Chief Minister that the Galle May Day rally is against the government, the MP said there are certain “lunatics” among the Chief Ministers who do not conform with the good governance or National Government concept.
“We urge the President to correct these lunatics, as otherwise they can do a lot of damage to this government,” he said.
