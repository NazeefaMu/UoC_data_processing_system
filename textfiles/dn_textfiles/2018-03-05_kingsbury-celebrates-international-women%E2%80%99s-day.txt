The Kingsbury celebrates International Women’s Day

International women’s day is celebrated globally on March 8. This is a day that celebrates the social, cultural, economic and political achievements of women around the world. This year’s campaign theme is called ‘press for progress’ where the push for gender parity will be highlighted.
The Kingsbury is a part of the global travel and hospitality industry. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council 2014, women consist of nearly 70% of the workforce of the tourism industry, worldwide. This however is not the case in Sri Lanka where the numbers are much less. The Kingsbury is a firm advocate of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in its human resource policy and encourages more women to consider hospitality as a rewarding career path. In its carder are some women who have honed their talents and abilities to become inspirational examples. Overcoming obstacles, they are proud to be a part of the working women of Sri Lanka and role models to many. This is what some of them had to say for International Women’s day
