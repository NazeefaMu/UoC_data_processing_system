Colette Lust for life

Keira Knightley has dished out some performances in a number of period films such as the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Cavendish in ‘The Duchess’ and as Anna Arkadyevna Karenina in ‘Anna Karenina’. So taking on the role of celebrated French author is familiar grounds to her.
A pioneer in women’s rights, an author who was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature six years before her death in 1954 Colette set a benchmark in history that many women find difficult to match. Taking on the role of the young wife to a much older Henry Gauthier-Villars brought Colette to Paris in the 1870s. This was the background in which she published her highly popular of “Claudine” novels, published under Henry’s nom-de-plume, Willy. As Colette’s work gains fame her husband locks her in a room and orders her to produce more content. However Colette is fiery spirited and would not lay low as the silent victim. Her character grows throughout the film and Knightley is able to put her acting talents into practice by portraying this growth in a convincing manner. Colette’s fight over creative ownership and gender roles drives her to overcome societal constraints, revolutionizing literature, fashion and sexual expression.
Though the film cannot quite be put in the Oscar category ‘Colette’ is still makes an admirable work of art. The haunting settings and seedy characters set the tone of what is to follow.
Colette’s plight is evident as the setting shows how the society perceives women. However neither we nor the rest of the public are ready for the manner in which she rebels against her intended destiny.
The chemistry is palpable between Knightley and West, whether they are in love or estranged. Knightley gives one of her best performances as a girl with spirit and talent who becomes a woman with ferocity and a voice.
Kudos to Director Wash Westmoreland who refrains from keeping the material from becoming melodramatic or overwrought.
