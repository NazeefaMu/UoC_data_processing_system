Cooking made easy with Sera coconut milk

Ceylon Biscuits Limited (CBL) formulated Sera, a smart and versatile solution. Sera is a premium liquid coconut milk, made available in convenient 180ml UHT packs. The thickness and consistency of Sera coconut milk is no different from that of the first extract of the freshest and juiciest coconut, and the fact that it is genuinely devoid of artificial flavours, colours, additives and preservatives means that it will preserve the authenticity as well as the natural aroma, taste and texture of any curry. Sera comes with a shelf life of one year and this enables the product to be stowed away in large quantities in pantries, ensuring that it is close at hand at all times.
This effective process ensures that all the natural elements and flavour of the coconuts are locked in and that the product is safe and healthy for consumption over a long period of time.
To ensure that you start cooking incredible dishes the smart way, make sure to stock up on your fair share of Sera coconut milk, you will get three curries out of each pack, ensuring that you make the most of your purchase.
You can buy Sera coconut milk at leading supermarkets and grocery stores island-wide.
