Moving beyond weapons

Eradicating terrorism and winning the confidence of the international community is a huge achievement for the progress of our country. At the end of a conflict it will lead to another conflict.
It is a possibility, but we must keep in mind the sacrifices we have made over the last 30 years to overcome this menace and it is the responsibility of the people in power to take appropriate action to take our nation to the next level.
Our role as Security Forces officers has been fulfilled with absolute commitment and huge sacrifices. It was possible due to the fact that we had goal oriented officers leading the battle. On the same line political leaders, too, have to implement a plan so that, all our commitment and the sacrifices made over the years bring positive results, our “Tour of Duty” is completed with absolute positive results and it should be an example to the present leading actors to follow.
It is important for us to scrutinize the capabilities, commitment, ruthlessness and the determination of the terror group.
They invented many methods for the first time in the world, that was used to destroy human life, property etc. and improved on periodically and made things really hard for the Security Forces and the people.
Their main weapon and most effective tool in their armoury was the knowledge and the ability to use explosives. They introduced various types of IEDs (Improvise Explosive Devices) to attack their targets.
From time devices to suicide bombers was the most successful systems they used. Since we (STF) mastered the art of handling explosives under Israel experts we were ahead of the terror groups to a certain extent, and we managed to identify, neutralize their attacks and had success.
Suicide can be classified into three types.
Anomic, Egoistic and Altruistic
A suicide bomber has to be trained and he believes that his act has meaning and will lead to secondary gain.
Anomic suicide is due to social or personal disorganisation, Egoistic suicide occurs when you feel alienated or separated from society, altruistic suicide reflects opposition of Egoistic suicide.
But they went on to introduce various ruse tactics and methods to get to their targets, eg. First ever human bomb that killed Rajiv Gandhi.
The suicide bomber who killed Rajiv Gandhi had a different type of a suicide jacket invented by the terror group at least there were 15 members for this operation (all committed suicide during investigation).
Probable position of assassin of Rajiv Gandhi at the moment of explosion (dummy)
Vest jacket – waist belt
The explosive charge spread over the vest on her (assassins) back was not a simple flat bed, but had taken the contour of her back. While the right arm was engaged to activate the bomb, she would have to be in a bend down posture, as if to touch Rajiv Gandhi’s feet in a classic obligatory choreography of Indian social behaviour, in order to explore.
For the person of higher statue to bend slightly over a person touching their feet in respectful manner.
This would have really hit the full force of the explosion as he was very close to the main charge.
Jacket belts configuration was not that of a conventional type jacket, but the combination of two separate flaps, resembling apron hanging in front and the other on the back. Very similar to a life jacket with a strap from the rear to strap around the waist binding both sides.
The steel balls embedded in the explosive acted as missiles, in addition, the bone fragments of the body of the assassins also acted as missiles. These pieces of bone fragments of the assassin vertebral and rib bones would drive at high speed missiles to hit the target in front. That is why the Indian expert (Dr. Chandrashekaram) identified this explosive device as the first human bomb that was produced in the world. This in fact was the capability of this ruthless terrorist organisation.
It is very important to realize the amount of planning and careful launch of the whole operation to perfection.
Destruction of LTTE
Destruction of the LTTE military network was the greatest achievement of Sri Lanka in our time. We have taken total control of all areas, which were under the LTTE and taken precautions to protect our innocent people and their property. The fight against terrorism will be long and a difficult exercise, where we have to be on the alert at all given times without dropping our guard.
All of us have a role in upholding the security of the Nation.
It is true that, security operations have brought immense success and people breathe freedom today, but we have to be fully aware that this was an ideological struggle.
Those detained, rehabilitated members by the security agencies need to be made to realize that they were misguided in their understanding of the history of this country and we have to raise awareness of others, who are closely connected to them and in general the Tamil populace, so that they do not also succumb to these radical ideologists again in the future.
Counselling is the key when it comes to rehabilitation, because they have become terrorists by believing their ideologist who preached to them, mothers and wives also play a major role as they are the closest to the effected members.
You also have to do and in-depth research of the history and look at the cause for terrorism.
The effort to inspire and enlighten Tamil minds is a great challenge with profound consequences, not only for Tamil societies, but for all people.
The energy needed to transform the Tamil society by regenerating the essential Tamil culture values and peaceful change and respect for others must arise and be natured within the Tamil community. Majority community too, should understand this challenge and have to make every effort to resurrect the damage done to the trust and confidence of two communities.
Young people are a crucial wedge of a nation’s development. Their input and involvement therefore is greatly needed. They are social actors of change and as the saying goes “youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow, but also the partners of today”.
Rehabilitation of detainees who participated in terrorist attacks has presented a model for efficiency in war on terrorism. For any future effective strategy to combat terrorism the challenge is to win the minds and hearts of terrorists and provide with new opportunities to act as citizens in a democratic society.
We have faced a disease in which political grievances is infected with an ideological sanction for violence. Against this disease a professionally planned rehabilitation system offers both inoculation and cure. That is why we had to give special thought and plan out a very effective goal oriented plan implemented locally and internationally (embassies here and overseas have a major role to play).
We have to get the Tamil populance and Diaspora to realize that if they do not act and come forward there could be grave consequences for the whole Tamil community again. They have a major role to play in upholding the security of our nation and rightful understanding and application of results oriented plan with commitment.
Radical ideology is dangerous. All must collectively be motivated with a single intention. If we can get every one “believe and intention” formula including the detainees rehabilitated members they, too must share the “believe and intention”. They have to be aware that if they still pursue their wrong ways they will continuously cause misfortune not only to themselves but to their families and community.
In my experience, even a suicide cadre can be transformed back to society if you really reason out and convince him that he has made a mistake, that human life is the most important thing in the world. I managed to convince Prabhakaran’s personal bodyguard after long interrogation, and he changed his stance and even took me to Prabhakaran’s hideout in the Mullewaikkal area in 2009 where we recovered Prabhakaran’s personal weapon M16 with a grenade launcher fitted to it and many other important documents etc.
When you analyze countering terrorism, methods used by various other countries and our own experience, the identifying of root cause of terrorism is very important. Failure of the economy, no future for the youth, lack of power and hope for the future, encourage, upgrading the education system, standardization should be fair to all and equal employment.
This has given the advantage to the extremist to recruit. This situation in the North and East was well planned strategy to get the people to suffer without any other option, but to join their cause.
Forming a council with eminent personnel to undo the convoluted thinking that led them to believe the distorted history. We have to identify people who will be able to untie this racial knot.
It was Prabhakaran who was controlling the network. Now it has been broken. We must make sure unlike the IS terrorists who have transformed into independent units and operate separately, former LTTE members should not get the chance to merge again, this has to be closely monitored.
There should be a solid foundation for widows to resurrect their families and the future. It is one of the main requirements at this juncture.
The Government and other organisations involved in rehabilitation have to work hand in hand to stop terror taking root again. It is very important that to make the people in North and East comfortable and for them to act as citizens in a democratic society. Authorities must encourage Tamil community to form an ideological counter strategy groups to deal with the extremist ideological threat in their respective areas.
Former militant leaders
Church, Kovils played a major role in the past as terrorist movement made use of them, we will also have to use the clergy, school principles, teachers, community leaders, youth leaders, specially the former militant leaders who has joined the main stream of politics as they are the people who led the movement in the past to create this situation.
Abraham Lincoln said: “The probability that we may fail in this struggle ought not to deter us from support our cause we believe to be just.” We have to keep this in mind.
Multilateral cooperation plan to apprehend this problem have to be implemented. Human development approach is the key to success.
It is very much evident that over the years Tamil political leadership have been ineffective. Some of them have misled the youth for their survival and gain. One wonders, whether the present Tamil politicians in the North and East are acceptable to the present generations and the masses. The political leadership to these areas has to be emerged from the present society and they have to be people who have won the confidence of the majority and especially the youth.
Due to the absolute commitment and years of sacrifice of the security forces and other support services for the last so many years, the environment is stable and safe for all political parties.
If they launch their campaign with commitment unlike in the past, they can win the confidence of the masses and they should not miss this opportunity as it is a rare chance.
One wonders after the liberation of the North and East in 2009 whether we missed a golden opportunity to formulate and propose a reasonable devolution package, as the ground situation was conducive at that time. Furthermore, they even appointed a hardcore former terrorist as a Deputy Leader of a recognized Sinhala political party and another as Chief Minister of the Eastern Province. This was acceptable for the majority at that time and there were no protests and didn’t we miss an opportunity to push through the devolution package at that time.
But we will never get that opportunity again, whatever the devolution package, majority community will never support that and it will be a very testing challenge for the political leadership.
Keep the federal and unitary system suggestions aside, give top priority and concentrate on developing these areas and give hope to the people. They have a future and their children have a future.
If this is done as a goal oriented plan to produce results with absolute commitment by using the correct people to the correct slots (we have to learn from the military victory), north and east will be the most productive economy hub of the country that will contribute to the progress of the country.
A comprehensive nation building programme is most important in the agenda to counter terrorism. All development work under taken in these areas should give the confidence to the people, that they are partners of the development programme and where they will feel comfortable, and believe in the system where they have got their due place.
Transparency and administrators with honest and committed background will strengthen the plan. Specially the role of GAA / Division Secretaries of these districts. I believe it is a must that their past and present record will have to be assessed and personnel with result oriented plans should replace the ineffective ones, so that officers with vision and commitment at this juncture will produce results.
Education played a major role, where the standardization to enter the universities was a key issue. This will have to be looked into in a practical manner with equal opportunities to every student. The present situation has opened the doors to rectify whatever the shortcomings in the past.
Winning the confidence of developed countries is a key factor in this issue. Without the support of the developed countries international terrorism will not prosper. The possibility of forming an international/diplomatic committees to support the government plan will be of immense benefit to our country.
Tamil Diaspora and internal community
As far as the militants were concerned they were successful in their mission to dominate the areas in the North due to the fact that Tamil Diaspora and international community support which they enjoyed, over the years.
Tamil Diaspora, which played a major role in the international arena should realize, what they have contributed in the past to destroy their own community and their assets in the North and East by providing funds to purchase weapons, explosives, ammunitions, etc. had they pumped that money for the development of their so called areas, people in those areas could not, have suffered.
Whatever the cause terrorism is not the answer, since it is a human problem.
Since the present situation is very much conducive for a bright future, implementing of all plans have to be transparent.
Tamil Diaspora and internal community involvement in the development work will be a plus point, as with their funding and support only that the militants were able to bring so much of pain and destruction to their kith and kin in the past. They should realize this, and compensate. They will not have another chance and every one should understand that and support the President to achieve peace and harmony, as he is a leader who is very practical and absolutely committed to bring peace to all communities in the country.
Developed countries, UN member countries, must realize that to counter global terrorism in third world countries there should be sound economic development in those countries. Developed countries can easily come forward and offer FTA etc. to countries like Sri Lanka and show their genuine concern to combat global terrorism.
The biggest achievement is the international support, recognition the President has earned all over the world. This situation has to be analyzed properly and plan out an effective strategy to get the best from the international community as we are fully aware that without the support of the international community, terrorism in the third world countries will never prosper.
The President has earned a golden opportunity, where none of the former leaders had in the past. With a strong committee consists of professionals, experts, diplomats with experience and reputation to guide him and the country to make use of an effective programme to harness the international support, so that our country will be economically and security wise will be strong and that will strengthen the hands of the head of the state and he will go down in the history as the leader who marshalled our countries destiny to prosperity.
We have achieved two important goals to completely eradicate terrorism.
a. Destroying the terrorist military power
b. Winning the support of the international community – “use it”
When you analyze the past and present, Police will have to play a major role in the North and East. They are the people who have the opportunity to interact with the masses. Winning the confidence of the masses by understanding their day to day problems and assisting them when they need support, protection and help, will be the key to win the confidence of the Tamil speaking population. Effective policing will definitely produce results and if they are able to win them over, the years long mistrust will be diluted.
Every policeman in these areas should be able to communicate in Tamil, as it was the biggest barrier which led to suspicion and distrust. At the same time, local Police should have a very efficient, committed, intelligence units in every Police station.
For a successful security system, and smooth function of the Government Administration, key is intelligence. Since the police officers in these areas are paid a special allowance compared to other areas, they should be fully aware of their tasks for which Police Department should subject them to a comprehensive training programme, compiled with all data information and methods, to meet the demand in a post conflict arena, which they have to adopt during this transition period in a conflict zone. I believe, will be of immense value for the future of this country.
