These parents have named their child Abcde

We all know celebs have a field day when it comes to naming their children. But if we mere mortals wanted to name our kids Apple or Bear, we’d have to think about the kind of taunts they’d get in the playground.
Posting on online forum Netmums, user Annalise revealed that one of her friends’ friend paid no mind to all that business as she named her child Abcde.
“Strangest baby name ever?” she asked. “I was talking to my friend whose friend just had a baby. The baby’s name is Abcde, and pronounced: Ab-si-dee. I’ve never heard of this name before – has anyone else?” she posed to the users of the site.
Of course, no one else heard of the name either and some didn’t hold back from their feelings.
One went as far as to say it should be against the law to do that to a child.
“It should be illegal to saddle children with names like that. Awful,” she wrote.
“That is the silliest name I’ve ever heard – but kudos for the imaginative pronunciation. Some parents are too cruel,” wrote another.
Others joined in with tales of other unconventional names they’d heard, though some may have just been trolling.
Erin joked, “It’s great because if they have another child, they can call it Fghij then the next Klmno and so forth.”
“I’ve heard of an A-A…pronounced A-dash-a,” joked Megan.
One user, Jade, commented on her mother-in-law’s choice of names, “OMG. My mother-in-law named one daughter Essence-Star and the other Maikayda-Bliss.”
Finding the whole thing entertaining, Annalise went on to do some research and found that the name Abcde is more popular than one might think.
In fact, 328 girls were named Abcde in the United States between 1990 and 2014, she revealed.
According to Wikipedia, it is a rare Latin feminine name, with origins in Hawaii and is popular among Hispanic families in New Mexico.
