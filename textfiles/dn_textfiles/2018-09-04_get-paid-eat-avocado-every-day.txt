Get paid to eat avocado every day

Avocados are delicious. They're great in salads, burritos, smashed on toast and are especially good for making guacamole dip.
The only downside is that they're pretty expensive . In most supermarkets a large one costs at least £1 - and that won't go very far, especially for big families. But now there's a dream job going where you get paid to them for six months.
It's all in the name of science , as researchers are trying to figure out whether the fruit (yes, avocado is a fruit) trims belly fat or not.
Loma Linda University in California is looking for 250 avocado lovers to eat them in large and small quantities as part of the study.
Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: one will eat one avocado every day for six months, while the other will eat just two per month. At the end of the trial, each avocado eater will be paid £230. Not bad for simply munching on avo every now and again! It would probably need to be your side hustle though.
On their website, researchers write : "Since avocados contain the highest fat content of any fruit, it seems illogical to think they might actually help people lose their belly fat.
"Nevertheless, that’s the hypothesis behind an upcoming study." The only downside is, the avocado eaters in the trial will have to undergo tests to see if they lose weight or not - so you really need to live across the pond to do the job.
There's also a few requirements. Participants need to be over 25, measure at least 40 inches around the waist if they are male and 35 inches if they are female. They also need to be willing to eat plenty of avo, obviously. Mirror
