Two opening batsmen of class - Sunil Gavaskar and Geoffrey Boycott

As our readers already know, our disadvantage we immediately encounter is a dearth of opening batsmen. Just imagine having Sunil Gavaskar and Geoffrey Boycott coming into opening the proceedings for Sri Lanka, I am sure young Kusal Mendis will be grinning from year to year.
I feel that these two cricketing greats have the basics engraved in them and its worthwhile having a peep at their performances. From the subcontinent Gavaskar has been lavishly praised by Rajan Bala in his book “Glances of Perfection.” He states that the initial back and across movement he used to the express fast bowlers was only after he had assessed that at that pace they would find it almost impossible to get the ball to move off the seam, and even he reckoned if they did move it, it would be generally in. As a result of this he handled the fastest of bowlers with such skill and aplomb that they were soon a frustrated lot. Bala further adds that if he had a problem with this type of bowling, it was when the fast medium bowler maintained a consistent on and outside the off stump line and a length that did not quite permit playing off the back foot. Then he became a wee bit tentative. Even then he handled this sort of attack better than all, because the basis of his play was side on.
Bala emphasizedthat, Gavaskar like Pataudi before him, followed the maxim taught to the great England batsman, Peter May by his coach, former England bowler George Geary:” keep your head still, stand still as long as you can. When you move your feet, move quickly, but the longer you stand still the later you play your shot.” One should not forget the English coaching influence on Gavaskar in the form of Stan Worthington.
The unique aspect of Gavaskar’s batting was that he was a keen watcher and a quick learner. At the first sign of trouble with his technique he would talk to former players turned coaches, and Bala further adds that it would have helped Gavaskar, he still went back to the drawing board practicing for hours and asking his Dardar Union Club faithful’s to bowl to what he perceived as a problem area.
As it happens just a sound technique would not make a great batsman there is also the mental aspect adds Bala, an avid student of the game, Gavaskar made mental notes about every bowler he faced and about the conditions he played in. In 1974 he authored what many of us feel till this day was technically the best of his 34 centuries. This was before he sustained the finger injury. At Old Trafford in the first Test against an England attack comprising Bob Willis, Chris Old, Mike Hendrick. Tony Greig and Derek Underwood, and in conditions that were tailor made for them, extreme cold and the bowlers getting movement through the air and off the seam, he scored 101 in the first innings and 58 in the second innings. That century displayed skill in technique that have yet to be bettered by any other batsman in adverse weather conditions.
The other batsman of equal class as an opening batsman was Geoffrey Boycott, Nick Brownlee in his book” The One Hundred Greatest Cricketers” describes Boycott as infuriating, obstinate,opinionated- but how England could do with an opening batsman who could hang around as long as Boycott those days. At times watching Boycott at the crease was akin to pulling teeth, yet his record speaks for itself: of the 112 batsmen who have made more than 25,000 first class runs, only Don Bradman (95.14) has a better career average than Boycott (56.83), states Brownlee.
Boycott announced himself in 1965 with a brilliant century in 1965 Gillette Cup Finals, but thereon his career became clouded with controversy. He seems to be constantly at war with the management and players at Yorkshire and when passed over for the England captaincy, he made himself unavailable for Test matches from 1974 till 1977. Typically on his return to the England side, he scored his hundredth hundred in front of his adoring fans at Headingly, concludes Brownlee.
Both these batsmen had one thing in common and that was getting back to the drawing board, practicing and perfecting their art. Today there is a surfeit of cricket in all forms and on a given day practically all the test playing countries are in action. The question is how can young talent that we have hone their skills, have they got any breathing space, their calendars are choc a bloc with fixtures. Have the cricket world gone mad? Don’t they know that too much of a good thing is good for nothing?
For some of our batsmen who are currently on display, the forward defensive shot is nonexistent, why play a forward defensive shot, their idea is to propel the ball out of the ground, knowing jolly well that the vultures are hanging around the boundary lines. They forget that Sir Vivian Richards played a defensive shot after hitting a six. One should not tempt fate too much!
