Drought in Anuradhapura continues

The drinking water crisis in Anuradhapura will worsen if the region does not receive sufficient rainfalls. The Mahaweli Water Management Committee has not supplied water to Nuwarawewa so far.
Divisional Water Supply Engineer Hashitha Witanage said the Nuwarawewa water level had dropped drastically. He said 16,000 cubic meters of water were normally taken per day from the tank and the volume has now come down to 5,000 cubic meters. The tank received 3,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water two weeks ago via the Kalawewa and Nachchaduwa.
''The Thuruwila tank provides 19,000 cubic meters daily. That is enough to cater to stage one and two towns. The Tissawewa received 300 acre feet of Mahaweli water which was marginally sufficient for the area including the sacred city zone. Now the available water is enough only for two weeks, Withanage said.
Anuradhapura people request responsible parties to temporary stop large-scale ceremonies to preserve the water for drinking.
