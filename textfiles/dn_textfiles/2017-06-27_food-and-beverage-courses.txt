Food and beverage courses

The Western Lanka Hotel School in Kelaniya has received a National
Vocational Qualification (NVQ) acceleration to conduct NVQ level 3 and
4 courses for waiters and stewards (food and beverages). A limited number of students will be enrolled for the first courses beginning from July 6.
The courses will be conducted by an experienced lecturer who is a graduate of Sri Lanka Hotel School and an accelerated lector for food and beverages. He is also a fully qualified NVQ Assessor registered in the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission.
The Western Lanka Hotel School which was incepted in 2006 has produced
38 badges so far. Those who passed out of the school are now employed in hotels in Sri Lanka and overseas.
The Western Lanka Hotel School’s principal Peter Rodrigo has worked for 32 years at Galadari Hotel in Colombo and Heritance Hotel in Ahungalla. He said that newcomers will be able to gain a vast amount of knowledge on food and beverage subjects at a time the country’s tourism industry has experienced a tremendous growth. The courses are available in three languages including English, French and Japanese. A special seminar prior to the enrollment of students will be held on July 1 and July 2 at the Western Lanka Hotel School in Kelaniya.
