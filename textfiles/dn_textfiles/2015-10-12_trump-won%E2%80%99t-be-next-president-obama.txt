Trump won’t be next President: Obama

US: President Barack Obama is fairly certain of one thing when it comes to next year's election: Donald Trump won't succeed him in the White House.
The billionaire businessman, the frontrunner in the race to become the Republican party's White House nominee, has raised hackles with his controversial comments on immigration, gun control and women, among other issues.
“He knows how to get attention. He is, you know, the classic reality TV character, and at this early stage, it's not surprising that he's gotten a lot of attention,” Obama said of Trump in an interview on CBS television's “60 Minutes” news programme with Steve Kroft. “I don't think he'll end up being president of the United States,” Obama said in the interview, which aired on Sunday.
Trump's incendiary comments on immigration and other issues have dominated the campaign and offended many Americans, but he nevertheless has seen his poll numbers climb steadily higher. During a speech to Latino political leaders last week, Obama condemned the logic of “saying clearly inflammatory things and then saying, ‘Well that's not what I meant’ -- until you do it again and again.” “Leadership is not fanning the flames of intolerance, and then acting all surprised when a fire breaks out,” he added.
Obama did not name Trump directly during that speech, instead denouncing the overall tone of the Republican presidential field.
In his “60 Minutes” interview, the Democratic president pointed to “genuine anti-immigrant sentiment in a large portion of at least Republican primary voters,” although he stressed it was not “uniform.”
