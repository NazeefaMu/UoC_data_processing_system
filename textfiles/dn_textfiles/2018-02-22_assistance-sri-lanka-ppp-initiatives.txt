Assistance to Sri Lanka in PPP Initiatives

With the Public Private Partnership (PPP) being pursued by the Government to streamline the working methodology of the public sector, foreign assistance has come Sri Lanka’s way in a big way. The public sector enterprises have not been able to produce tangible results due to a number of limiting factors which include the following:
* Absence of good governance measures
* Overstaffing of SOEs and understaffing of public agencies responsible with facilitating PPP initiatives
* Lack of liquid funds
* Non availability of skilled staff and professionals
* Excessive state control and perceived monopolies
* Malpractices which go undetected for a long period of time
* Absence of budgetary controls like those in the private sector
* Inadequate internal control measures
* Lack of vision for short, medium and long term PPP project pipelines
* Inadequate management information systems and IT systems
Due to above and other factors, a majority of public sector enterprises were unable to achieve the required standards in productivity, profitability, liquidity and other long term stability benchmarks.
At the same time an unnecessary fear psychosis was created in the minds of the state sector employees in following areas regarding foreign investment and the implementation of PPPs.
They include:
* Loss of job security
* Loss of financial and other perks which they now enjoy
* Lack of language proficiency
* Inability to come to work at set times under a new management
* Fear of freedom at work
* Demanding work targets and set standards
* Reduction of holidays
* Fear of demotion and transfer
* Inability to pay more attention to the families at times they need
* Inter department rivalries
* The fear of total privatization
Successive governments have failed to restructure inefficient Public Enterprises and the State Treasury was called upon to meet the losses of State Enterprises causing large budget deficits of the country and hampering development or stepping into development through foreign loans. The present debt crisis of the country is mainly due to this drawback.
Time has come now and may never come again to restructure our loss making State Enterprises unless decisive actions are taken.
I had the opportunity to visit the office of ‘STAIR’ (Short term assistance to improve Public Financial Management Reform), a project funded with USA assistance and efficiently executed by Nathan Associates Inc., by a dedicated team of experts and a skilled team of staff members. They have been conducting many workshops, seminars, strategy planning sessions, video presentations and training sessions and have also prepared work manuals and instructional ideas. Tangible results have been achieved especially in preparing the ground work for public sector procurement reforms in a very fruitful manner. This was revealed by David Baxter who is a PPP specialist and a consultant to the ‘STAIR’ Project.
The Stair Project commenced its work in Sri Lanka in 2015 and during the last 27 months have rendered yeoman services towards their project success. They have worked towards their objectives, with great commitment and dedication mainly in following areas.
* Specifics of PPP implementation
* Enhancing of public procurement efficiency
* Enhancing of Transparency and competitiveness in Public Procurement Systems
* Streamlining and enhancing of Audit Capacity
* Other core areas such as improving public sector accounting
The Ministries of Finance and Mass Media, Megapolis Development, Industry and Commerce together with the National Procurement Commission and Finance Commission, have been in constant touch with this project as they will be the ultimate beneficiaries from the success of this project. The project was able to identify and train forty Public Servants who have become fully conversant with the entire procurement reform programme. The knowledge and training gained by them will be an asset to the state in training the State Sector employees as ‘Trainers’ to the entire public sector procurement reform programme.
Baxter himself cited a few challenges in the total implementation of PPP programmes in Sri Lanka. They are:
* Ongoing and incomplete changes in Government policy due to Government reforms
* Limited technical capacities of the Ministries
* Political opposition to PPPs
* Lack of educational opportunities for public servants to acquire a total knowledge on Public Private Partnerships
* Absence of resources of the Ministries, Local Government Authorities, Provincial Councils and State Agencies to train their staff on the guidelines and benefits of PPP and other reform programmes.
* Outsiders (Private individuals/concerns) introducing ‘unsolicited programmes’ on their own to PPP Projects/Programmes, overjumping the selected/decided programmes for PPP implementation, taking a political face.
Baxter expects the authorities to be aware of above issues. However, he was happy to see the completion of a number of programmes on ‘Training of Trainers’.
In addition, it will be of paramount importance to bring in new legislation for the state sector reform programme in a phased manner based on the success of each stage so that there will be very minimum opposition to PPP Programmes from all corners. A fruitful alliance with the blue chip quoted companies in the Colombo bourse will bring in steady results over the years for the PPP programmes in addition to seeking partners through the Board of Investment, Overseas Chambers of Commerce and PPP Organisations abroad also. Donors and Multi-lateral banks also have an important role to fill in the future of PPPs in Sri Lanka.

Existing labour laws also need to come under the purview of the state and suitably amended in consultation with Ministries, Trade Unions, Chambers of Commerce and productivity organizations.
Baxter highlighted the following sectors on a priority basis for PPP initiatives in Sri Lanka.
* Road and rail transport sector
* Power
* Clean drinking water
* Water Taxi/Water transport systems
* Leisure sector
I personally favour the PPP programmes for road transport sector initially as every day we hear of road accidents ,traffic jams, penalties, failed signal lights, passenger abuses by bus crews and fellow passengers, non giving of fare balances by the conductors to the passengers, racing between buses for passengers, air pollution by buses. I also remember the case of privatisation of Regional Transport Boards through the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2003. The deal was cancelled due to the buyer defaulting on payment on due date.
Over dependence on certain countries for PPP programmes is another drawback depriving global investors the opportunity to participate on a meaningful and active PPP programme in a transparent manner. It is important that investors believe that they will enjoy equal status on competitive procurements.
Baxter also stressed the importance of ‘Value for Money’ concept for all PPP programmes for the benefit of all parties. It should be a ‘win win’ situation for the state, the investor, staff, general public and other stakeholders. For all PPP programmes, innovation should not be ignored as a key to success and also to promote the programmes.
According to Baxter, the Dutch Government is providing continued assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka, amongst other countries for the success of PPP programmes.
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of USA is another institution from whom assistance could be sought for productive PPP programmes in Sri Lanka. The Government of United States listed Sri Lanka in year 2000 as one of the first sixteen countries to receive Millennium Challenge Assistance. However, Sri Lanka could not reap the benefits of this scheme of assistance due to the adverse security situation of the country.
Talking about the specific training programmes of ‘STAIR’, the following programme summary would indicate their commitment to the project which was assigned to them.
* In 2017 November they conducted a series of seminars and workshops at JAIC Hilton , Colombo for ‘PPP simulation’ in collaboration with the Dutch Government. These were well attended by the top officials of the State Sector from different Ministries. The participating officials were awarded certifications and will carry the message of the usefulness of PPP programmes and the Public Enterprise Financial Reforms, for the country and its advantages and the applications.
In addition, the officials of Provincial Councils, Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and other Local Government officials were also trained in addition to the other state sector officials so that they were able to fully understand the benefits, objectives and strategic importance.
The trained officials will create awareness at both National Level and Provincial Level to widen the spectrum and scope for set objectives under the programme.
* In 2017, over 3,000 public officials were trained with emphasis on ‘Empowerment of Women’. Over 47% of the participants were females
* In 2016, six hundred Lead Auditors were trained
* In 2016, eight hundred officials were trained on public procurement programmes
* In 2016, thousand two hundred and fifty PPP officials were trained
* In 2015, over four hundred Internal Auditors were trained
It is very vital to continue the efforts of STAIR into a more progressive level. They have carved out an opening for state sector financial reforms in a very constructive and in a visionary manner for the benefit of our country.
Baxter and the Nathan Associates Inc. officials took a leaf out of the success stories and mentioned the success story of PPP in Manila, Philippines where the transport sector benefitted immensely and the Health Sector innovations in India. There are many success stories all over the world.
As we all know, the 19th Amendment to the Constituition of our country provided for the setting up of the National Procurement Commission, (NPC). This area of procurement provides the nucleus of financial stability of most state enterprises. STAIR stepped into this area in a big way and have trained the public officials in prudent procurement practices.
STAIR was also instrumental in compiling a number of manuals and preparing video seminars for the benefit of the state sector. Some of them included:
* Procurement Audit Manual
* Forensic Audit Manual
* Financial Audit Manual
* Performance Audit Manual
* I/T systems Audit Manual
In addition, a new website was also developed for the Auditor General’s Department
The PPP drive gathered momentum globally in the last decade of the 20th century and accelerated in the 21st century. Many countries have benefitted from PPP initiatives to eliminate losses of State Sector Enterprises and lessen the burden on the treasuries of many developing countries. The fear and reluctance for PPP drives in the minds of staff and workers of public enterprises could be easily eliminated with better education and demonstrations with practical examples with figures and global success stories. It will be a new experience for the Public Sector employees especially the loss making Public Enterprises. In fact, a PPP drive is a value addition to a Public Sector Organization, which is in the best interests of such Public Organization with a long term existence vision.
We should have not allowed the public organisations to deteriorate in terms of Finance, Management, Good Governance, Administration, Human Resource and Practices, during the last few decades. The liquid funds spent on the losses of a large number of Public Enterprises in the past could well have been used for the development of the country.
A good example of a successful PPP was the Sri Lanka Telecom. Ultimate beneficiaries are the General Public. In the eighties, the people of this country had to wait for many years to get a telephone connection with problems in the availability of loops and other red tape measures of the management. For the initial public offering, there was a problem of even pricing a share at an attractive value. However, in 2004, the IPO was successfully launched at a price of Rs.15 and today Sri Lanka Telecom has reached a level of substantial market capitalization as a quoted share in the Colombo Bourse. The share price exceeded Rs.50 level on many occasions. The management is in the hands of a public and private partnership with Sri Lanka Telecom collecting much needed liquid funds through the Colombo Stock Exchange and Global Investors
We should offer a big bouquet to the management of ‘STAIR’ Project and the donors of funds for the project for assisting Sri Lanka in this hour of need and we should sincerely hope that the funding agencies will continue their assistance in fulfilling their vision.
