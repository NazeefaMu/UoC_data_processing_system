Tick fever

Tick fever may be a life threatening disease condition. Ticks are parasites that attach themselves to dogs, feed on blood and transmit diseases directly into the dog’s system. Major tick-borne diseases include: Lyme disease, Canine Ehrlichiosis, Canine Anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Canine Babesiosis, Canine Bartonellosis, Canine Hepatozoonosis. Tick-borne disease can be transmitted within 3 - 6 hours of a tick bite. Fortunately, however, a dog who recovers from Tick Fever can go on to lead a normal, healthy life, as long as he doesn’t become reinfected from the bite of another infected tick.
Susceptible breeds
Interestingly, German Shepherds, Pomeranian, Japanese spits and Doberman Pinschers seem to have more severe reactions to Tick Fever, and have a poorer prognosis.
Spread
The tick fever spread via ticks. Sadly, it only takes a single bite for a dog to become infected. When ticks feed on an animal infected with tick fever they also become infected. The parasite can remain alive in the tick for up to 5 or 6 months before being passed on to another dog.
Systems affected
The parasite damages the red blood cells of the dogs which are responsible of transport oxygen, nutrients around dog’s body and finally organs like liver, kidney and spleen.
Signs
The animal gets lethargy, do not eat, high fever, pale gums, inactive, might pant and yellow colour skin. The urine is dark brown or red colour.Swollen legs, depression and tender abdomen are usually due to an enlarged liver, Kidney problems. Neurological issues and bone marrow failure are common signs of the disease
Diagnosis
Veterinarians recommend that if you see an engorged tick (one that is full of blood) on your dog, you should have your dog tested for Tick Fever around eight weeks after finding and removing the tick. The blood test can be done by any animal clinic in Sri Lanka. The test is very simple and quick. The vet takes a drop of blood from the tip of the ear of your dogs for this test. But the sad part is the result may be negative at early 2-3 days of infection.
Treatment
Early detection and treatment can greatly improve dog’s chances of surviving Tick Fever. Anti parasitic drugs will be given by the vet to destroy the parasite with the supportive treatment to regain the blood of your dog. Dogs that are experiencing severe bleeding problems may need IV fluids and a blood transfusion. When the condition of the animal is okay for oral medication the vet will recommend medicine which is usually given for 3 weeks to several months.
Prevention
Bi annual screening for tick disease is a vital component of your pet’s annual veterinary exam. There are several methods of prevention and no method offers 100 percent protection.
Check your dog for ticks daily
Brush your fingers through its fur, applying enough pressure to feel any small to large tick which will be vary in size, from a pinhead to a pea. Legs, paws, arm pits ears, root of the tail are the places you should pay more attention in searching ticks in your dogs body. If you find a tick remove it immediately.
Collar
Collar which is medicated with tick repellent are available in the market which can be wear on your dogs neck. But make sure to remove it when you bath the dog.

Tablets

Spot on
Spot on medicine comes as drops which can be place on the back of the dog from neck to root of the tail drop by drop. This medicine also should match with the weight of your dog.
Spray
Tick repellent drugs can be spray on the coat of the dog. There are some sprays which can be used in the kennel, yard and any field your dog use generally.
Managing tick fever infected dog
Dogs who receive treatment early usually show improvement within 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment. For dogs in the chronic phase, it can take up to several months for them to visibly recover. Foods that support regain the blood is highly recommended. Resting in comfortable place is suitable for quick recovery. A dog in recovery may appear to be doing well but that doesn't mean that his body is ready for it yet. When your dog has been sick, he needs time to recover and rebuild strength. To further protect your dog, remain vigilant with regular blood work to detect recurrences.
Humans and Tick Fever
