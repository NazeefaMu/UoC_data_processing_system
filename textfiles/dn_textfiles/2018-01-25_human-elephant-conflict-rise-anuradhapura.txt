Human-elephant conflict on the rise in Anuradhapura

The invasion of wild elephants into remote villages in the Anuradhapura district, is on the rise again. The prevailing drought is also a main factor for the increasing human-elephant conflict, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News.
"During last year, wildlife conservation authorities took measures to minimize the human-elephant conflict, having identified the areas where the menace was on the rise, by putting up electrified fences and driving away herds of wild jumbos into distant reservations. But, I was convinced at recent field visits and briefings at forums such as district agriculture committee sessions, and based on reports being submitted by divisional secretaries and farmer organizations, that there is a rapid increase in the invasion wild jumbos into human habitats at present, leading to conflict," Wanninanayake said.
"It is evident that the habitation areas once cleared of wild elephants, are now being haunted and dominated by them, while most of the protective fences remain destroyed.
The information I gathered indicated that several areas previously not threatened by wild elephants, are now becoming vulnerable to invading jumbos," he added. He said according to farmer organization representatives and wildlife officials, the blocking of traditional elephant corridors is worsening the situation.
The government agent, referring to the proposed solution to prevent the expansion of the jumbo menace, said until long-term strategies come into effect, he has instructed the district wildlife conservation assistant director to set up a task force consisting of wildlife officials, civil security guards, and volunteers, to take immediate action to thwart any sudden invasion by wild jumbos, under the circumstances.
Further instructions were issued to wildlife authorities to keep adequate stocks of elephant crackers and to distribute quotas to the needy divisional secretaries, as there was a complaint by village organizations that they were denied elephant crackers when asked for.
It was reported that during the last two years, as a result of the conflict, 23 persons and 70 wild elephants were killed in the Anuradhapura district.
Wanninayake further said the other actions to be taken in addressing the menace are the mapping of traditional elephant corridors in the district, along with the re-construction of electrified fences constructed during last two years, and the removal of unauthorized constructions along the traditional routes of wild elephants. A detailed report on electrified fences planned to be erected in 2018 and an appropriate plan ensuring the systematical operations to redirect roaming elephants into distant reservations are to be submitted soon.
Divisional wildlife conservation officials said the protective fences are purposely destroyed or made to inactive by timber racketeers to gain access to jungle areas, and some villagers damage the fences to get accommodation to usher herds of cattle into the forest for feeding.
The dearth of adequate wildlife conservation officials, transport facilities, and civil security personnel being released to assist wildlife conservation activities, adversely affects relief work.
