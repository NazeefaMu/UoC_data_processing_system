Australia's woes in WT20 were self-inflicted, reckons Kim Hughes

Australia should be "bitterly disappointed" with their early exit at the World T20 and they made a major blunder not using David Warner as an opener, according to Kim Hughes, former Australia captain.
Hughes, who captained Australia in 27 Tests from 1979-84, believed most of Australia's problems throughout an erratic World T20 campaign were self-inflicted. "Australia should be bitterly disappointed because it was a lost opportunity," Hughes told Cricbuzz on Tuesday (March 29).
"They weren't outclassed in the matches they lost but they got things wrong and ultimately that was costly. The wicket in Mohali was excellent and suited Australia, but they were 20 runs short of what they should have posted."
Hughes said he was baffled that Warner did not bat in his preferred opener's position, as Australia opted to use their vice-captain at No. 3 or 4 in the order. "Australia got it wrong with Warner the whole way through the tournament," he said.
"Warner is like Chris Gayle, he is the team's most destructive batsman and is better from the get go when the ball is new and hard. The opposition teams would have been breathing a sigh of relief knowing Warner was not opening."
Australia's top-order was not utilised to maximum effect, according to Hughes.
"Warner and (Aaron) Finch are Australia's most destructive batsmen and should have been opening," he said. "(Usman) Khawaja is an artist but he is not a bludgeoner. He is like their (Virat) Kohli and should have batted at three. The middle-order really struggled and that was meant to be the strength of the team."
In the aftermath of Australia's six-wicket loss to India at Mohali, most of the criticism was directed at captain Steve Smith's refusal to bowl out leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had starred against Bangladesh and Pakistan but only bowled two overs for 11 runs against India. Hughes said criticism of Smith was unwarranted and believed most of the attention should be focused on Kohli's masterly performance.
"It is easy for us to criticise a captain but he's really the only one who knows what is happening out in the middle," he said. "Smith and (Darren) Lehmann would have had a strategy and in hindsight they could have done things differently but at the end of the day Australia were still in the box seat with three overs left in the match. I don't think there has been a better T20 innings than that one by Kohli." Australia has four years to stew over their World T20 disappointment but Hughes believed the future was still bright. "Australia still has a relatively young core and you would think a lot of the team will still be around in 2020," he said. "Australia really missed Mitchell Starc, who is the best paceman in the world in this format and Pat Cummins is another quick who could make a big difference if he is fit."
With the next World T20 set to be staged in Australia for the first time, the pressure will be undoubtedly on the hosts to break their frustrating drought. Hughes said Australia needed to analyse their T20 performances and take heed from the lessons learned. "I think Australia really need a left-arm orthodox spinner and Jon Holland, for example, is one such player doing well in Sheffield Shield cricket," he said. "Australia just haven't played enough in this format. To play just one T20 last year is ludicrous. Some of the main core of the squad don't even play Big Bash because they have international duties.
"The best teams like New Zealand and India look more settled. Australia's planning needs to be far better."
