MR should not be allowed to destroy SLFP: Vijithamuni

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not be allowed to destroy the SLFP. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members are trying to forcibly use the former President’s goodwill to promote their party and destroy the SLFP, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Gamini Vijithamuni Soysa said.
Speaking at a press conference at the Irrigation Department Auditorium yesterday, Soysa said the President had said that trade union members should not participate in activities harmful to the country and that he was ready to negotiate with them and find a solution to their issues. Speaking on the alleged military coup, the minister said such rumours are made to discredit the tri forces and the country.
“The Tri Forces made many sacrifices to end the war. No one has the right to level allegations against Tri Forces personnel,” he said.
“SLFP will form committees from December 4. Delegates will be appointed for each committee to ensure a SLFP victory at future elections,” Soysa said.
He also said the PH value of the Seethawaka River in Kitulagala has increased due to pollution.
