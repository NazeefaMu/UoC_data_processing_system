O/L students’ NICs on fast track

The Department of Registration of Persons (DRP) had informed all school heads in both, the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP), that early steps should be taken to prepare NICs for students who are to sit for their G. C. E. (O. L.) examinations this year, Kurunegala District Senior Education Director W. M. Balasooriya said when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday in Kurunegala. Most school heads had so far failed to submit applications for NICs, although they were instructed to do so by March 31.
Accordingly, the Examinations Department would accept the remainder of the applications until May 15.
