Burnetters to display creative talents

Two teams comprising a total of four Burnetters were recently selected to represent Sri Lanka at the Young Lions competitions at the 64th Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity which will take place from June 17 to 24 in Cannes, France.
Burnetters Amrit Paulraj and Falul Hallaj of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka won the local competition to represent Sri Lanka to compete in the Young Lions Design category, whilst Aysha Musthafa and Jayana Silva won the title in the Print category.
A local competition to select the winners was recently organised by Metal Factor, the Sri Lanka representative for the Cannes Lions in partnership with the International Advertising Association (IAA), the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies (4As) and the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).
This year 74 Young professionals from the industry participated at the local competition. At this competition these two teams comprising Falul and Amrit and Aysha and Jayana succeeded in winning the Sri Lanka title to represent the country at the young Lions competition in Cannes, France which is termed the Olympics of the advertising industry. These two teams will now travel to Cannes, France to represent Sri Lanka in the Young Lions Design and Young Lions Print competitions where they will be challenged to respond to a brief within 24 hours with an innovative solution.
Five teams of Sri Lankan marketing communication professionals will represent the country at the festival. The Sri Lankan teams will go on to compete in Cyber, Design, Media, Print and Film categories of the Young Lions Competitions at Cannes against the best marketing communications teams from around the world. Two young professionals from Nestle will compete at the Young Marketers competition as well.
Commenting on the selection of the young Burnetters, Ranil de Silva – Managing Director, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, stated, “I am extremely proud of our two winning teams. This is the first time that an agency has secured two places to represent Sri Lanka. These four Burnetters from Sri Lanka will now represent the country at what is termed the Olympics of advertising – the Cannes Young Lions competitions. After their success at the local competition we have groomed them, trained them and coached them in the last six weeks to prepare them to face the challenge at Cannes.
I am confident they have what it takes to win a metal in Cannes. The entire team of Burnetters in Sri Lanka joins me to wish our four young stars the very best of luck. We hope they will truly reach for the stars!”
