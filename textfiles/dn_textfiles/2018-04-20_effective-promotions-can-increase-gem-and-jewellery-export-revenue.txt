effective promotions can increase  gem and jewellery export revenue

Sri Lanka has the potential to increase gem and jewellery export earnings to USD one billion from current earnings of USD 250 million if a proper promotional plan is implemented. However new laws imposed by the Gem and Jewellry Authority (NGJA) are not supportive of the industry, gem and jewellery exporters say.
“Exporters are facing issues due to new regulations,” industry representatives told at press conference in Colombo this week. Chairman Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, A. H. M. Imtizam said that the best revenue in gem exports was recorded in 1980 where the industry brought in around US$ 500 million.
Hong Kong earns USD 27 billion from gem and jewellery exports while Thailand earns USD 13 billion per annum. The total global value of the industry is over US$ 100 billion. “Sri Lankan Blue sapphire is very much in demand in the world and its brand image alone can drive the local industry to new high.”
He, however, said that the industry is now facing issues due to new laws that are being imposed by the Gem and Jewellry Authority (NGJA).
When contacted an official from NGJA said that there are several environmental issues that have being created by the Gem miners and this are why tighter regulations have being brought in.  “We are not spending funds unnecessary and we have a long term plan to promote the industry,” he stressed.
The NGJA, this month has abruptly implemented drastic export charges and cumbersome export procedures which have had the effect of significantly slowing down exports.
“The entire industry including the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, Lanka Gem Dealers and Miners Association from Ratnapura and the China Fort Gem & Jewellery Traders Association from Beruwela have v opposed these new measures and charges.”
“With these transaction costs we will never be able to promote locally produced/value added jewellery in the international markets. Sri Lankan Gem exporters’ revenue is dropping and swift measures should be taken to correct this,” he said.
Chairman Sri Lanka Gem Dealers Association, Punsiri Tennakoon said the today 70% of exporters from Sri Lanka is by way of value addition and this is not good for the industry’s future.
He said that they also met President Maithripala Sirisena recently to discuss the matter. (SS)
