Lost in sculpture

All the dance aspects are well depicted in the solid static sculptural representations. The Indian sculptors produced excellent Hindu temple icons with a perfect theoretical foundation with well-established traditional codes and norms. The sculptors who produced the sculptures were very much impressed by the aesthetic essence of temple dances. The majority of the Indian dances are deeply rooted in Hinduism. Most of the Indian temple dances originated in Hindu temples.
The sculptors before they created their Hindu artefacts studied the Hindu Agama Sastra (established principles or codes of Hinduism) Silpa Sastra (defined traditional codes established by the theoretical concepts of sculptures) and Natya Sastra (Indian Aesthetic theory), well established theoretical traditions and principles related to dance and other dance-related art forms). Similarly, the Vasu Sastra deals with the science or Sastra of architecture. Silpa Sastra provides guidelines for forming or creating statues, icons and stone murals.
Different nuances
The beauty of the dance and its aesthetic essence attracted and influenced the minds of sculptors and painters. The dancing sculptures provided an aesthetic link between the dance and the sculpture by combined corporeality as a meeting point. The dance originated before sculptures. The dance poses influenced the minds of sculptors. Different nuances of dance including the stances (Ishana position), hand gestures and limb positions influenced the minds of sculptors. Further, these were the guiding and driving factors for the creation of devotional iconography and decorative architectural sculptures. Further, the sculptures are divided into two main categories. One is the Hindu temple icons and the other is the decorative sculptures
Plenty of bronze and stone sculptures were discovered from the Indu valley civilization. This is considered as one of the earliest forms of sculptures in the world. With the passage of time, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism produced excellent bronze sculptures to the world. Some of the sculptures of ancient India were carved on solid blocks. The sculptures were considered as some of the largest and beautiful sculptures of the world.
India had a history of sculptural tradition and it proves the excellent mastery of its iconography. Some of the dance sculptures discovered from the Indian sub-continent of Indu Valley civilization is excellent. One dance stone statute of Harappa is considered one of the oldest dance sculptures in the Hindu valley civilization. The period of the sculpture is estimated to be the period in between 3000 to 2000 BC. Similarly, another dance sculpture was discovered from Mohenjo-Daro (2000-1500 BC). Another torso sculpture of Harappa was identified by a famous scholar as the prototype of the dancing image of Lord Nataraja. Later the image served as a specimen dance image for the researchers to identify the affinity with the South Indian bronze sculptures.
One ancient Mohenja-Daro female dancing sculpture was depicted with proper tripanga dance posture with a well-defined appropriate dance hand gesture. Periodically different varieties of dance sculptures were recovered by archaeologists and researchers from numerous locations of the Indian sub-continent. In the Indian dance research study, the dance sculptures of South Indian temples occupy a pre-eminent position.
Iconography study
This dance research study could be approached from two different angles. One is based on the study of iconography pioneered by Ananda K Coomaraswamy and the other is on the research study of Karana dance sculptures of Hindu temples. Iconography does not mean an art form. It is a presentation of images which correspond to the ideas originally in the mind of the artist. Iconography dance images are especially in the form of sculptural representation. It is a reflection of the best or worst to any natural model. It is in imitation and imaginative creativity of angelic works of art (Silpa).
Dr Ananda K Coomaraswamy in 1912 made a valuable contribution to dance and sculptures. He also had done a dance research study with numerous other fine arts representations and the dances of Lord Siva. He investigated the divine manifestation of the deity’s dance with the iconographical interpretation. Following Ananda K. Coomaraswamy some more researchers have also carried out a similar type of research on dance and sculptures and dance related sculptures. The research on frozen static temple based Karana sculptures of dance were further carried out by a few more outstanding scholars.
In the Indian sculptural research study, the period of the sculptures was divided into three different periods. They are the first period, second period and third period. A variety of ancient Lord Nataraja sculptures and different decorative Ganas (Goblins) sculptures were discovered from numerous locations of the Indian sub-continent during the first period. The majority of Lord Nataraja statutes belonged to the first period. The Gana sculptures (Goblins figures) were also found all over the ancient archaeological and ancient temple sites of India. Different postures of Ganas (Goblins) sculptures resemble typical dance rhythmic limb movements and body positions.
All the Gana sculptures of India were depicted with a rhythmic vibrancy of dance. According to some of the researchers, at the end of the second and third periods, very few images of Lord Nataraja were produced, but during these two periods, an ample variety of dancing sculptures were produced. Indian sculptures discovered from different areas belong to various ages. The documentary interpretations of dance and dance related studies are elaborately given in numerous texts especially in the Natya Sastra (Indian Aesthetic theory. The ancient sculptures of India propagate the dance with beautiful dance nuances through sculptural representation.
