Playing for Peace, Trust and Care

The Body Shop Sri Lanka partnered with The Little Gym of Colombo to bring some Christmas joy and cheer to 25 young children and their caregivers. The evening of activities at The Little Gym gymnastics centre was attended by children from Shanthi Maargam and the Voice Foundation.
The children had an activity-filled evening at The Little Gym, with Director and CEO Shilpa Perera and the instructors teaching the kids gymnastic skills, and touching upon the importance of being a good citizen as a child, especially when it comes to sharing and taking turns. The enrichment and physical development centre for children aged four months to 12 years uses movement based learning and imaginative play to build confidence and skills in children.
The gymnastics was followed by a drama session by Power of Play’s Sulochana Dissanayake where she touched upon respect and kindness through singing, dancing and storytelling using puppets as a medium.
In addition to the activities for the children, the event included a self-care workshop for caregivers of children at orphanages and day centres conducted by Tehani Chitty and Seema Omar. The partnering exercise saw each caregiver share with another, what drew them to this work and the joy they find in their role.
The Body Shop’s Colombo community service projects this year are complementary to its global Play for Peace campaign, an initiative that allows customers to help refugee children when they buy seasonal gifts from The Body Shop. This campaign is conducted by The Body Shop in partnership with peace building NGO International Alert, and supports refugee children by using recreational and creative activities to help them deal with trauma and understand their experience of conflict. Each gift purchased from The Body Shop’s seasonal gift collections will help to support the project for one year in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon.
