Zesta sponsors CCC’s Budget Insights

Diversified conglomerate Sunshine Holdings stepped forward as one of the main sponsors of ‘Pre and Post Budget Insights’ video series, developed by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC).
The series of episodes which ran on social media platforms covered pre and post insights of the 2018 budget that was presented to the Parliament on November 9 by the Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Pre-budget discussions mainly focused on discussing the expectations and anticipations of key members of the economic policy committee at CCC about the 2018 budget while post-budget insights addressed the impact of the budget on the national economy, private sector and key industry sectors of Sri Lanka.
The series, moderated by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce’s Chief Economist Shiran Fernando, had a number of industry leaders analyzing the key outputs of this year’s budget.
Speaking about their partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Vish Govindasamy, Group Managing Director of Sunshine Holdings PLC said, “We are proud to partner with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in sponsoring the ‘Pre and Post Budget Insights’ video series. The series had a lot of traction on social media platforms from interested stakeholders who represent Sri Lanka’s top business sectors and supported them to identify the key elements of the recently-announced budget. As a social media video series, we clearly saw the opportunity to bridge the gap between existing and upcoming businesses through digital platforms by playing the role of a responsible facilitator. The significance of this video series is that all the valuable insights expressed by veteran business leaders are going to be readily accessible for all stakeholders in the public domain.”
Sunshine holdings sponsored the event through Zesta, Sri Lanka’s premium tea brand which comes from Sunshine’s consumer goods company and the largest branded tea company in the country, Watawala Tea Ceylon Ltd (WTCL).
