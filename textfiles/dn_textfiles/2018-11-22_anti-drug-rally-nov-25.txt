Anti-drug rally on Nov. 25

Ten parishes belonging to Tudella and other areas carried out several seminars and workshops recently on the escalation of the drug menace.
It is reported that drug peddlers are especially targeting youths and schoolchildren.
The anti-drug campaign is led by Rev. Fr. Priya Jayamanne, Head of the Catholic Congregation of the Deanary and assisted by 10 parish priests. A large rally will be held at the Tudella St. Mary’s Church premises on November 25. His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, will preside.
The rally would be a venerated prayer session to implore God to rid the drug menace from the country and to save drug addicts, especially schoolchildren and youths.
