Techno Sri Lanka from October 13 at BMICH

The 32nd National Engineering and Technology Exhibition, the flagship event of the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL), will be held on October 13 to 15 at the BMICH.
The best of its kind to be held in Sri Lanka, the event is a beacon for the transfer of technology towards scientific and technological excellence of the profession and related industry in the country.
Each year, since its inauguration in 1985 the event has brought forth the latest in technologies, products, skills and best practices from the world over to its target audience while maintaining optimum standards both in quality and quantity.
Being the largest one-stop exhibition related to engineering and technology, Techno Sri Lanka completed its 31st consecutive event last year with nearly 50,000 visitors.
The President Elect of IESL and Chairperson of the Organizing Committee for Techno Sri Lanka 2017, Eng. (Prof.) Niranjanie Ratnayake said that the this year’s exhibition theme is “Empowering Innovation” with the tagline 'Smart, Inventive, Disruptive Technologies for Sustainable Development'.
“The world is changing. Engineers are in the forefront of this change. Expectations are very high in today’s society. We need ‘disruptive technologies’ that will revolutionize the day-to-day activities, such as mobile technology, nanotechnology, household solar PV technology and perhaps other inventions and breakthroughs to satisfy society’s expectations and still not be blamed by our future generations for not leaving them a livable Planet Earth,” she said.
In keeping with its theme of 'Empowering Innovation', this year’s exhibition will introduce several competitions that will encourage and promote smart, inventive, disruptive technologies among the younger generation.
The Young Members Sections (YMS) of the IESL is collaborating with the private sector and the universities to organize an array of seven competitions.
IESL-UTE Raspberry Pi Challenge: The objective of the competition is to promote innovation through smart solutions among university students and young engineers. The popular and cost-efficient Raspberry Pi platform will be used as the core of each product in the competition.
IESL-INSEE Concrete Challenge: The vision of this competition is building brighter futures for Sri Lanka.
INSEE Cement, formerly known as Holcim Cement, for the fourth consecutive year is partnering with the state engineering universities of Moratuwa, Peradeniya, Ruhuna, and Jaffna, and the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka and Open University of Sri Lanka to conduct an innovative concrete mix design competition for the final year civil engineering students.
The Faculty of Engineering, South Eastern University of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the YMS of the IESL is organising the first ever Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Challenge for engineering undergraduates in Sri Lanka. The DroneX Challenge will be held at IESL’s Techno Exhibition this year.
The IESL-YMS Hackathon is a gathering of innovators which help them to improve communication, learn new technologies, and share knowledge to get enhance experience.
The IESL Students Chapter of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna, has planned to conduct a competition among engineering faculties all over the country under the YMS section of the IESL.
Tic-Tac-Toe challenges students in engineering programmes to design a robotic manipulator which can automatically play a simple modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe on a given board.
Spaghetti Bridge Competition – by University of Peradeniya is open for all civil engineering students and first year students. Maximum number of members of a group is six.
The YMS of the IESL in association with Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna is organizing a Computer Aided 3D Design (CAD) competition 'CAD Eager 2017'.
In addition to these events, a building clinic, short seminars, car clinic, junior inventors' area and undergraduate inventors' area too would be organized. This unique feature this year would be that for the first time the three forces under the Ministry of Defence, will exhibit their R&D exhibits at this pavilion.
