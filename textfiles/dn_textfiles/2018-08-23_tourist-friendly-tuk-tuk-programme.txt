TOURIST - FRIENDLY TUK TUK PROGRAMME

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) joined hands with the Galle Face Hotel and launched a tourist-friendly tuk tuk service at Galle Face Green in Colombo recently under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The ‘tourist-friendly’ logo is a pride mark to distinguish high-quality tourism-related service providers in Sri Lanka. Tuk tuk drivers who have successfully completed the training programme ceremonially received the logo and their certificates from the Prime Minister at the event.
The Galle Face Hotel advocated the programme in keeping with their mission to preserve the heritage and history of both the hotel and its island home as Sri Lanka is known for its hospitality. The hotel hosted the Prime Minister, distinguished guests and tuk tuk drivers for Pimm’s at the Chequerboard. The guests were entertained by a band of bagpipers and later escorted out to the tuk tuks prior to the beginning of the ceremony at the Galle Face Green.
