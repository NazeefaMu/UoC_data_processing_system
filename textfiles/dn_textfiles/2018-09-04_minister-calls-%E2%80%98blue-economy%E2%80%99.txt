Minister calls for ‘Blue Economy’

Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said Sri Lanka should be developed as a ‘Blue Economy’ by taking advantage of the geographic location - a nation surrounded by the ocean, having no conflict with other countries about ownership rights, unlike in some regions in the world.
Sri Lanka is also located near the most frequented sea-routes, he added.
The minister was speaking at a ceremony to open a new building at the Ocean University of Sri Lanka, recently.
The minister identified several economic activities associated with the sea. He highlighted the employment opportunities open to graduates of the Ocean University, including services in the merchant marine. The minister spoke of the international practice of registering ships in foreign countries under ‘flags of convenience’ for business advantage and said there is a possibility of negotiating permission for ship registration in Sri Lanka on the condition of the employment of a minimum number of trained Sri Lankan personnel on each ship. Referring to the country’s education system, the minister said a radical change in the system is urgently needed. The minister said the traditional school and university education in humanities is unable to produce the type of person required for the present-day workplace.
He added that his ministry has taken up the task of creating an alternative system of education to produce technically and vocationally qualified personnel.
The minister said he issued three directives as soon as he assumed duties. The first was that the intake of students to all training institutions under his ministry should be doubled. The second was that the curricula in these institutions should be upgraded to international standards. The third was that courses of minimal importance should be discarded to concentrate on courses with significant employment potential.
The minister said he also instructed that English and IT be mandatory for all trainees. Dr. Amunugama said the knowledge of an international language is essential at a modern workplace and so was IT.
Hitherto, knowledge in these subjects was mostly confined to children of affluent families. However, the minister said his aim is that all rural children and children from disadvantaged backgrounds gain that knowledge.
