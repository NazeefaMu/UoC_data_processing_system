Use textbooks with care: Education Minister

The Education Ministry encourages students to use school textbooks carefully, in order to use them for at least two years, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The government spends millions of public funds to provide students with textbooks annually. A significant amount of the huge public wealth utilized for providing textbooks can be saved if textbooks are used at least for two years.
“It is not an impossible target if students are motivated to use textbooks with care,” he said.
He made these remarks participating in the school textbook distribution national programme on Thursday at D.S. Senanayake College, Colombo.
The minister added that not only students but also education authorities are duty-bound to protect textbooks with care, making children use them for at least another one year. Then the money saved from well-utilized textbooks can be used for the development of other areas of the education sector.
“The Education Ministry will take steps to complete Ordinary Level Examination activities within December itself. Accordingly, paper marking activities will also be conducted during December so as to minimize the hindrance caused by the O/L Examination to academic activities. Under this, the examination activities, including the paper marking process, will be streamlined,” he said.
