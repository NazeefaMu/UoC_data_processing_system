The Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre (Indian Cultural Centre), and the High Commission of India, Colombo will be presenting ‘Euphonic Yoga’ - an artistic arena of performing Arts led by Shruti Chathurlal Sharma and group from India - on June 8 at 6.30 p.m. at the ICC Auditorium, 16/2 Gregory’s Road, Colombo 7 for 4th International Day of Yoga
Shruti Chathurlal Sharma will be accompanied by Taranpreet Kaur in Yoga, Srishti Amitaa Devi in vocal and Raudri Singh in Odissi.
‘Euphonic Yoga’ is a beautiful amalgamation of ‘Yoga’ with ‘Indian Classical Music & Dance’, bringing together the three performing arts on the same stage.
It is a concept that vitalizes and activates the stream of energy system flowing inside the human body, known as the Chakra system. This artistic arena shows the beauty of these seven chakras merging in with its corresponding Ragas while dance illustrates Bhava. The concept is designed specially to help people cope up with stress. It is also a merger effort to bring the Indian culture closer to the people in the most perceivable form.
