PM at former President J.R. Jayewardene’s 111th birth anniversary commemoration: JRJ’s introduction of open economy provided economic momentum to other Asian countries

It was former President J.R.Jayewardene who introduced an open economy in Sri Lanka, the first Asian nation to do so. But the country was unable to yield the best results of his endevour due to terrorism that engulfed the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said most of the Asian countries that opened their economies after studying Sri Lanka have achieved economic development.
The Prime Minister said that three and half decades ago the United States, Canada, the UK, the Soviet Union and other European countries were the economic powers of the world with Japan being the only country from the orient to be in this elite club.
"But now China, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and some South East Asian countries are among the countries with economic power," the Prime Minister said. "It is predicted that economic power will completely shift to the Asian countries in the near future".
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking as Chief Guest at the 111th birth anniversary commemoration of late President and UNP leader J.R.Jayewardene at the J.R.Jayewardene Centre yesterday.

"It was J.R.Jayewardene who was one of the first Asian leaders to introduce an open economy," the Premier said. "He was bold enough to do so in 1977 just a few months after coming to power. Later,China, India, South Korea, Vietnam etc opened up their economies after studying developments in Sri Lanka. Special representatives came to Sri Lanka to study how we brought in foreign investments," the Prime Minister said.
