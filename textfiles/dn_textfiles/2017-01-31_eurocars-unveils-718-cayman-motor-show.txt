Eurocars unveils 718 Cayman at motor show

Eurocars, the official importer and dealer of Porsche cars in Sri Lanka, unveiled the 718 Cayman with the German Ambassador of Sri Lanka, Jörn Rohde at the CMTA Motor Show in Colombo.
The 718 Cayman and 718 Boxster are the new names of the two-door mid-engine sports cars from Dr.Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG.
The fourth, redeveloped generation of the mid-engine 718 Cayman has a more striking, athletic and efficient appearance. Just a few weeks after the debut of the new 718 Boxster, the new 718 Cayman is extending the new model series.
The same new four-cylinder flat engines with turbo charging as in the 718 Boxster are being deployed in the 718 Cayman. As a result, they both have an identical engine output for the first time.
The Stuttgart car manufacturer’s 718 designation is a reference to the ground-breaking sports car of the same type of the year 1957, which enjoyed great success in renowned car races. The 718 Cayman and Boxster show more and more similarities – both visual and technical. In the future, both will have equally powerful four-cylinder flat engines with turbo charging.

The 718 model series is a continuation of the proven four-cylinder concept and the history of distinguished Porsche sports cars. The latest example is the 919 Hybrid LMP1 race car, which also has a highly-efficient, turbocharged four-cylinder engine with just 2 litres of displacement.
Porsche finished first and second in the 24 hours of Le Mans, the world’s most competitive sports car competition, but most recently it also won the manufacturer’s and driver’s championship titles in the WEC World Endurance Championship.
Eurocars has been the official agent of Porsche cars for over 18 years and continues to serve its exclusive clientele with services that are on par with global standards. Eurocars is part of the IWS Holdings Group, which manages a varied portfolio of industries across Automobile, Aviation, Communication and IT, Food Processing and Packaging, Industrial, Leisure, Warehousing and Logistics and Mass Media.
