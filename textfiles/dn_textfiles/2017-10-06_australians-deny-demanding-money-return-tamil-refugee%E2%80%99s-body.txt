Australians deny demanding money for return of Tamil refugee’s body

Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry vows to cover cost
The Australian High Commission in Colombo is denying that they, or the Australian government, ever demanded money from the family of a deceased Tamil refugee in exchange for sending his body back to Sri Lanka.
The 32-year old Rajeev Rajendran was found dead at the Australian detention facility on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, on Monday. Officials there say he committed suicide.
Aran Mylvaganam, a spokesperson for the Australia-based Tamil Refugee Council, said that Rajendran’s family had visited the Australia High Commission in Sri Lanka on Monday.
There, the family was told that they “would have to pay 900,000 Sri Lankan rupees to have (his) body transported home,” he said in a statement. But the High Commission is denying Mylvaganam’s account.
“The Australian Government – including the High Commission has not been approached by Mr. Rajendran’s family and has not requested funds to repatriate his body,” they said in a written statement Wednesday evening.
They added that because the man “died in Papua New Guinea, repatriation arrangements are a matter for the Papua New Guinea Government.”
“This is an appalling abrogation of responsibility,” Mylvaganam responded in an interview Thursday.
“The Australian government transported Rajeev to Papua New Guinea and the camp on Manus Island – no amount of legal manipulations can erase these facts,” he said. He accused the Australian government of “trying to pass the buck.”
He also said that the request for money may have come from the Consular Office of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry, with whom the family has also been communicating about Rajendran’s body.
Reached by phone Thursday evening, Senior Director General of the Consular Affairs Commission GanegamaArachchi said his office is looking for funds to cover the repatriation cost for the family.
“This is a unique case, and we are not ruling out the possibility of finding funds at any time,” he said.
Rajendran had been seeking asylum since 2013, according to the Tamil Refugee Council. He was being held at Manus Island, a former Australian military base, which the Australian government uses to house refugees and asylum seekers.The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that such a practice was illegal last year, and the centre is scheduled to close at the end of October.
Multiple human rights groups, including Amnesty International, claim that refugees are systematically deprived of mental health care at Manus Island.
Mylvaganam, of the Tamil Refugee Council, said that Rajendran was suffering from depression for over a year, and had tried to cut his own throat just three days before his death.
He said the situation was further evidence the detention center should be closed, and all refugees and asylum seekers there granted protection.
