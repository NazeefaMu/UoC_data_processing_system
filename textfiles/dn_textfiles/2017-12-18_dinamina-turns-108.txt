Dinamina turns 108

Our sister paper, the Dinamina celebrated its 108th anniversary yesterday (17). With a proud record of over a century of dedicated service to the nation, Dinamina has entered the market with a new dynamism and a new focus.
Dinamina, the oldest Newspaper in Sri Lanka began publishing on December 17, 1909 adding a new chapter to the Sri Lankan Mass Media and Printing Industry. The name “Dinamina” was proposed and sanctioned for this National Newspaper by late Ven. Rathmalane Sri Dharmarama Thera.
Late H.S. Perera was the first Editor of the Dinamina. Subsequently, Perera transferred the ownership of the Diamina to late D.R.Wijewardene, the founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon.
