Sharma plays a  double role in  ‘Pari’

After showing off her calibre in two of her home production ‘NH10’ and ‘Phillauri’, Anushka Sharma is back with her third venture ‘Pari’. Her character and look in this upcoming horror film has had audience hooked in anticipation.
Although not much is known about her character in the film and the storyline, if the trailer and screamers are anything to go by, Anushka seems to be playing a double role in the film.
While we wait with bated breath to find that out, we managed to get some details about her character and her look. Speaking about the same, British Prosthetic designer Clover Woottoon stated, “There are many shades to Anushka’s character in ‘Pari’. But, most importantly, we wanted people to forget Anushka the person, and think about Rukhsana (her character) alone.
Anushka being a strikingly pretty face, we didn’t do too much with her. We just made her eyebrows bushier, added lenses and darkened the under eyes so that she looked more tired.
We blurred the edge of her lips so that it looks drier and that is literally all that we did. Depending on the scene requirements we made her cheeks a little pinker but that’s about it…nothing more was done and yet, she looked so different!” ‘Pari’ is slated to release on March 2. TNN
