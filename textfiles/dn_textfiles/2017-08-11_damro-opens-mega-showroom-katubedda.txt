Damro opens mega showroom in Katubedda

Damro that has earned the trust of customers for over 30 years has made a name in the furniture market for their unique creations, opened their largest showroom at Katubedda on August 4.
The showroom network of Damro consists of 170 showrooms in Sri Lanka and 68 in India. The newly opened five-storey showroom in Katubedda has a floor area of 50,000 sq. ft. enabling Damro’s valued customers to select their purchases of Damro products more conveniently.
The selection comprises household items from the living room to the kitchen such as Sofas, Bedroom Sets, Spring and Foam Mattresses, kids’ furniture and home décor items, office, restaurant and hotel furniture and Damro-branded Safes. Customers could also purchase home appliances under the Damro brand and other reputed brands such as Innovex, Panasonic, Pioneer, Hisense, Jack and Preethi.
Easy payment sachems are also available for customers for their prospective purchases offered from all major banks for their credit cards.
Arrangements are being made to open another mega Damro showroom of this nature in Galle before the end of this year. Mega showrooms of this magnitude are expected to be opened in Galle Road, Colombo 03 and Kandy in the year 2018 and thereafter to expand the network of mega showrooms to Grandpass, Wattala, Ja-Ela, Malabe, Gampaha, Matara, Kaduruwela, Moneragala, Marawila, Kiribathgoda and Nittambuwa respectively.
Even though it is difficult to provide sufficient parking space for customers in speedily developing urban areas such as Katubedda, this mega showroom has its own car park dedicated to customers facilitating them to take as long as they need in their Damro shopping experience leading to their ultimate satisfaction and convenience.
Damro Group is planning to establish such mega showrooms in each main city of India as well. Damro Group has already obtained approval from the Government of India to invest Indian Rupees 12,000 million in the furniture retail trade in India. In the Indian furniture industry, such approvals have only been granted to foreign companies Damro and IKEA.
Damro exports over one thousand 40-feet containers to India per annum at present and, as a result of the new investment, the Group is expecting to increase the market potential to export over 10,000 40-feet containers per annum.
