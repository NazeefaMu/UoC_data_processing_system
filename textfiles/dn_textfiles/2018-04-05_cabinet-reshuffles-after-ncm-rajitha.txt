Cabinet reshuffles after NCM - Rajitha

A substantial cabinet reshuffle is expected to take place based on the voting patterns of the SLFP members in cabinet.
Co-cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne addressing the cabinet media briefing amidst the No-confidence Motion (NCM) in Parliament yesterday said SLFP ministers who vote in favour of the NCM would be removed from Cabinet.
“They cannot ethically stay on”, he said.We have suggested to the President that after this, a new cabinet be appointed with ministries allocated on a scientific basis, said the Minister further. “Those who abstain however are not voting against the Prime Minister so we should be able to work together”, he added. At the time of writing, the SLFP vote on the NCM had been split with some choosing to abstain whilst others stated that they would vote in favour of it.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Gayantha Karunathilake in the meantime said the Prime Minister, after this will move forward with a stronger government and Parliament.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne also stressed that President Maithripala Sirisena was not backing the NCM against the PM, “He simply asked his party to come to a common consensus among themselves”, he said.
The President has asked that the SLFP work with the UNP to set up the Local Government councils and we have been doing that all over the country. So I do not think he is against the UNP, clarified Minister Senaratne.
At the last meeting held between the President and the SLFP MPs on Tuesday night, Minister Senaratne said the President had informed them that he could not announce his stance on it. Either way however, changes are expected in government as a consequence of the NCM.
