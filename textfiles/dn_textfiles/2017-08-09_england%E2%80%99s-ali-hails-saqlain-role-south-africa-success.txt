England’s Ali hails Saqlain role in South Africa success

MANCHESTER: Moeen Ali has paid tribute to the “amazing” Saqlain Mushtag for his role in helping the England all-rounder enjoy a record-breaking Test series against South Africa.
Ali, a 30-year-old off-spinner and left-handed batsman, became the first man in cricket history to score more than 250 runs and take 25 wickets in a four-match Test series during the course of England’s 3-1 victory over the Proteas.
Ali has often been regarded, even by himself, as a “second spinner” when the likes of Hampshire left-armer Liam Dawson have been in the England side.
But under the guidance of England spin-bowling coach Saqlain, a former Pakistan off-spinner and star of a Surrey side that won English County Championship titles at the turn of the century, Ali’s bowling has improved markedly.
“Saqqy has been amazing for me in terms of helping with my fields, helping me understand my bowling a lot more than I had done previously -- and I think that has been the biggest difference,” said Ali after bowling England to a 177-run win in the fourth Test at Old Trafford with more than a day to spare on Monday.
“Little things like that can make a big difference,” explained Ali, who ended the match with two wickets in two balls for an innings return of five for 69 after finishing England’s victory in the third Test at The Oval with a hat-trick.
