Doctors launching strike just for President’s statement is unfair: Senaratne

Doctors launched a strike just to obtain a statement from the President; it is very unfair, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He said so addressing the gathering during a ceremony held at Bulathsinghela recently.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, President Maithripala Sirisena had presented the same set of proposals which was formulated by the government and given publicity through newspaper advertisements in order to educate the public.
The minister pointed out that the doctors should have been asked to release the statement without taking trade union action, putting patients in trouble. The set of proposals will be gazetted after get the Cabinet approval on June 27.
If the doctors encourage university students to take arms, they are not doctors or scholars, the Minister added.
