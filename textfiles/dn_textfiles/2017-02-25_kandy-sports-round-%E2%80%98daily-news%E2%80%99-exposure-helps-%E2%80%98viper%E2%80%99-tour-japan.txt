KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP: ‘Daily News’ exposure helps ‘Viper’ tour Japan

The ’Daily News’ report last Saturday that Nihal ‘Viper’ Gunaratne, 1976 captain, needed help to make the tour to Tokyo for a coaching course has paid rich dividends. Antonians around the world were extremely proud to read about the invitation extended to their prominent past ruggerite Nihal ‘Viper’ Gunaratne to attend the World Rugby & ARFU Performance Development Workshop in Tokyo, Japan, and a group of die-hard loyal Antonians around the globe, known as the Global Antonian News Network (GANN) has stepped forward to sponsor Viper’s air ticket to Japan. GANN was formed as an informal whatsapp group to share news of Antonian sport.
This is run by volunteers who share all news which are of interest to Old Antonians. Its members are spread worldwide from Canada to New Zealand with some active members from the Middle East. Maufer Usoof, and Riyaz Usoof, a live wire in GANN had this to say about Viper, “Viper was an excellent rugby player from St. Anthony’s College. I had the pleasure of watching him play for school and for the Kandy Sports Club.
He is one player who had rugby always in his heart. We are very proud of Viper’s achievements on the rugby field and happy to sponsor him. Thaiyar Mohamed, the Antonian cricket captain of 1977 who incidentally went on to captain the Singapore national team, now domiciled in Perth, Australia and a member of GANN said,
“Viper has brought pride to St. Anthony’s, Kandy and Sri Lanka in particular with his achievements in rugby both as a player and coach. I thank the Kandy Sports Round-up in the Daily News for breaking the news. I am sure he will continue his invaluable contributions to the success of Antonian Rugby.”
N. Bashkaran, an old Antonian who left school in 2001 and an active GANN member said, “I did not have the privilege of watching him play, but we have been privileged to have him share his expertise as a coach of our school team.. I am very proud to hear of his selection to go to Japan.”
Viper and the other Kandy ruggerite Anil Jayasinghe left last night for Tokyo. They will be back on 5 March. Thanks to Referees Society, Anil got his sponsorship from the Sports Ministry.
