Corruption in admitting foreign students to medical faculties - Parents’ Union

The State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union has complained to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption yesterday on the method of recruiting foreign medical students to state medical faculties, State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He said complaints were made against the University Grants Commission Chairman and the Higher Education Ministry Secretary.
Corruption and malpractices had taken place when recruiting foreign students to state medical faculties.It is alleged that some foreign students had paid around Rs. 3 million to certain persons.
Alwis said that recruiting foreign students to the faculties had not been transparent.
A large number of highly qualified local medical students lose the opportunity to study in in the faculties because of this corruption and malpractices.
It was found out that some of the foreign students admitted to the faculties do not posses the required minimum educational qualifications.
This means that the Government subject highly qualified local students to pure discrimination and prevent them from receiving free education, the Union said.
