A Midnight Spell at this New Year's Eve

The best New Year's Eve experience is what is guaranteed at Mount Lavinia Hotel's 'A Midnight Spell - One Ticket to a Night of Excess, a Journey of Discovery'. After successful events such as 'Gatsby at the Mount' in the preceding years, the colonial heritage hotel is creating an atmosphere of excessive frolic through the all-inclusive 'Leave your purse at home' concept.
The Governor's Mansion will open its doors to all guests to a wide spread of international cuisine, premium beverages, gaming and entertainment to which one has access through simply ONE TICKET. The spacious venues will serve as different food corners including a traditional seasonal spread, Nippon Express Sushi Bar, Road to Munich, Slamat Datang Indonesia, China Town, Little India and a Hopper Rave for the Sri Lankan food lovers.
Free flowing premium beverages will be the call of the night with Chill Out performing at the famous Terrace. Added to the excitement are the gaming opportunities available and of course the best fireworks display in town.
