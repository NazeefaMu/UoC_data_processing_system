Grand opening of Shangri-La Hotel Colombo

Changing the tourism landscape of Sri Lanka and adding a landmark property to the Colombo skyline, the highly anticipated Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts Colombo was opened yesterday. This is the second property in Sri Lanka from the Group, after Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa.
The hotel, built adjoining the Galle Face green, would offer 500 rooms and suites and 41 serviced apartments under the first stage. Built on a 10- acre plot of land with an investment of over Rs. 2.3 billion for the first stage, it would have a large retail store as well.
Lim Beng Chee, Chief Executive Officer of Shangri-La Asia, said that they were one of the first international hotels chains to open up in Sri Lanka with their first hotel in Hambantota in 2012.
“We also see a surge in tourism in Sri Lanka and we are looking forward to the 5 million arrival target set by the government for 2020.”
Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts would invest for the second stage which would include an office tower, two residential buildings and a high-end shopping mall.
Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau said that the opening of Shangri-La Colombo would add brand value to Sri Lanka. “Their presence would help Sri Lanka Tourism, to position the country at a different level.”
Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts currently operates over 100 hotels with a room inventory of over 41,000. (SS)
