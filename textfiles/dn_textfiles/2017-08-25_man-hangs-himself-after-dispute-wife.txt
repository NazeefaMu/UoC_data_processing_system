Man hangs himself after dispute with wife

A man had committed suicide by hanging himself from a beam of the roof of a building at a shopping complex building site where he had been living alone for a period of about four months. He had left his home for the site after a dispute with his wife.
Ratnayaka Mudiyanselage Weerasingha, a 44-year-old father of three residing in Dodamwatte, Mahiyanganaya had previously attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself on five occasions and even attempted to consume poison mixed with alcohol, but failed as onlookers had rescued him.The coroner has recorded a verdict of death caused by suffocation.
During the inquest, Akveediye Gedara Mallika, the wife of the deceased had told the coroner that her husband had been an alcoholic.
“My husband earned a living by carrying out odd jobs daily. He used to drink thrice a day. Virtually all of his earning were ruined by his alcoholism. He left home about 4 months ago after a quarrel with me. I was told that my husband was under the influence of liquor at the time he hung himself,” she said at the inquest.
Weerasingha used to cut himself with a razor blade or a piece of glass used to look at the bleeding while intoxicated, according to further evidence collected at the inquiry held by the coroner.
