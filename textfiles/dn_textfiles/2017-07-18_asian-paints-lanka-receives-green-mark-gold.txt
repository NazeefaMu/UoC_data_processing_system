Asian Paints Lanka receives Green Mark Gold

Asian Paints Lanka has been awarded the Green Mark Gold certification by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) in recognition of the eco-friendly characteristics of‘Apex UltimaProtek’, the company’s durable exterior emulsion paint.
The certification, in the ‘Green Building Products’ category, is attributable to the product’s conformation to international Volatile Organic Compounds(VOC) criteria and the usage of only sustainable and eco-friendly raw materials in its manufacture. Exposure to increased levels of VOC is associated with respiratory problems and other health complications.
Moreover, ‘Apex UltimaProtek’ contains no hazardous heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium or cadmium and is also free of toxic materials that are carcinogenic or cause mutagenesis and reproductive toxicity.
Asian Paints (Lanka) Limited Director Jacob Kuruvilla said: “We are delighted to be honoured with this certification. In ‘Apex UltimaProtek’, we have a product that is engineered for durability and protection of surfaces while being safe for its users and the environment, which is a great combination of attributes. It is a great finish for some of the landmark structures which will soon grace the skyline of Colombo.”
Besides being safe and environmentally responsible, ‘Apex UltimaProtek’ also comes with the assurance of a 10-year durability warranty, thereby eliminating the need to re-paint at frequent intervals.
Asian Paints attests to the product’s superior washability, effective waterproofing and corrosion preventive features like anti-carbonation that in turn lead to structural protection, and to its unique fibre reinforcement that aids in efficient crack bridging.
Catering to a wide cross section of consumer preference in aesthetics, ‘Apex UltimaProtek’ is available in more than 1,000 shades as per the Asian Paints colour spectrum.
This is the second Green Mark Gold certification awarded by CIOB to Asian Paints in the last one year. In 2016, the company received the certification for ‘Royale Matt’ interior emulsion paint.
