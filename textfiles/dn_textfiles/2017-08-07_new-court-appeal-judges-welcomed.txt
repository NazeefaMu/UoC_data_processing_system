New Court of Appeal Judges welcomed

Attorney-General Jayantha Jayasuriya, P.C.,at the ceremonial sitting to welcome Justices Gamini Rohan Amarasekera, Anthony Lalith Shiran Gooneratne and Janak De Silva as judges of the Court of Appeal, said:
My Lord the President of the Court of Appeal, Your Ladyship and Lordships of the Court of Appeal and Members of the Judiciary;
We are gathered this morning to welcome three new Justices who were sworn in before the President, as Judges of the Court of Appeal. When we look into the individual careers of Your Lordships, we see three gentlemen who have come along three different paths, joining together, bringing in a blend of competency and skills, enhancing and enriching the overall quality and value of the second highest Court exercising appellate jurisdiction in our country.
My Lords, nearly three decades of judicial service in different capacities starting from a Magistrate, a District Judge and a High Court Judge has provided a strong foundation for Your Lordship Justice Gamini Rohan Amarasekera to build his career as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. Your Lordship’s tenures as a Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court and as a Judge of the Commercial High Court would no doubt have further strengthened Your Lordship’s ability to meet all challenges that may arise when dispensing justice. Your Lordship’s academic excellence is well-demonstrated by successfully completing Preliminary and Intermediate years at the Sri Lanka Law College, successfully completing those examinations with Honours.
Your Lordship’s quest for academic excellence is further demonstrated by the successful completion of his Bachelor of Laws Degree at the University of Colombo. Your Lordship’s academic achievements go beyond oceans. Your Lordship’s competency was well-recognized by the University of Aberdeen when they awarded Your Lordship the Master of Law in Commercial Law Degree with Commendation. We have no doubt that the commitment and efficiency Your Lordship demonstrated as a Judge will continue to brighten up Your Lordship’s career as a Judge of Court of Appeal.
A 17-year span in the Attorney-General’s Department followed by a 10-year span holding judicial office would be of immense help to meet all challenges when dispensing justice, as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. What Your Lordship brings in will further enrich the quality of justice delivered in the Court of Appeal.
International Relations as well as Commercial and Corporate Law are areas Your Lordship had ventured upon in with equal success. University of Colombo and Kings College, London recognized Your Lordship’s competency in those areas and decorated Your Lordship’s career by awarding Post Graduate Degrees such as Master of Arts and Master of Laws.
The experience Your Lordship acquired as a prosecutor as well as being involved in Consultative Committee for Radio and Television Broadcasting and Technical Project committee of the Coal Power Development Project at Norochcholai, mixed with experience Your Lordship acquired as a High Court Judge would facilitate a well balanced career as a Judge of the Court of Appeal.
Specialised skills Your Lordship developed as a trainee in Asser Institute in The Hague, Netherlands, Judicial and legal Training Institute, Malaysia and three judicial academies in India and experience accumulated during Your Lordship’s tenure as Senior State Counsel at President’s Office in Republic of Seychelles will guide Your Lordship’s judicial career in its proper course.
It is said, “The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love.”
These words reflect thoughts of the 38th Vice President of the United States, Hubert Horatio Humphry Jr. In the year 1978, a Full-bright Exchange Programme was created in honour of the public service and career of this leading political figure.
This programme that is administered by the United States Department of State, provides ten months of non-degree academic study and related professional experiences in the United States. Humphrey Fellows are selected based on their potential for leadership and their commitment to public service.
Appointments of Your Lordships Justice Shiran Goonaratne and Justice Janak De Silva as judges of the Court of Appeal in the year 2017 stand in testimony on the accuracy of the judgment made by the administrators of this Exchange Programme several years ago. Your Lordship was conferred with this prestigious award and paved way for a 10-month long stay for mutual exchange of knowledge and understanding at the Law School University of Minnesota and Michigan State University, in the United States of America, respectively.
Your Lordship Justice Janak De Silva’s Degrees of Bachelor of Civil Law awarded by the University of Oxford and the Master of law with merit in International Business Law awarded by the University of London are clear reflections on Your Lordship’s academic excellence. The strong foundation laid at the beginning of his legal education, passing with First-Class Honours in the Preliminary and Final Examinations at the Sri Lanka Law College would have been of immense support for the subsequent remarkable achievements.
Your Lordship’s skills in strong and effective advocacy with which cases were pursued before all Courts in your capacity as State Counsel, Senior State Counsel, Deputy Solicitor-General and Senior Deputy Solicitor-General, while representing the Attorney-General, are those which have prominent roots, even deep within Your Lordship’s student life. Your Lordship led both the Sinhala and English moot court teams and the English address to the Jury team at Sri Lanka Law College.
The Hector Jayawardane gold medal is awarded to the winner of the English address to the jury contest. Your Lordship’s oratorical skills were well-acknowledged and recognized with the awarding of this prestigious prize. Your Lordship’s interest, commitment and dedication as a Law Student are well-portrayed by another significant achievement.
Academic excellence combined with active participation in extra-curricular activities is rewarded by awarding the Walter Ladduwahetty gold medal. Your Lordship’s balanced and successful student life was further decorated and illuminated with the award of this prestigious gold medal.
Your Lordship’s commitment, dedication and seriousness with which a case would be pursued and the ability to take challenges, is aptly demonstrated in the hard-fought litigation relating to regulations promulgated by the Health Minister in pursuant to powers vested in him by the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, relating to warnings on health hazards including pictorial health warnings on packets of cigarettes.
Constitutional Law, International Trade Law, International Economic Law and Legal Environment of Business are the areas in which Your Lordship undertook to impart your knowledge on the students pursuing their legal education at several institutions such as Sri Lanka Law College, University of Colombo and University of Sri Jayawardenepura.
My Lord Justice Janak De Silva, experience, expertise and skills Your Lordship acquired while serving as a Counsel and a Legal Advisor at the Attorney-General’s Department, coupled with the commitment and dedication Your Lordship demonstrates in discharging duties, no doubt would be of immense help to dispense, justice without fear or favour.
The Canadian Judicial Council recognizes; “Litigants and others scrutinize judges very closely for any indication of unfairness. Unjustified reprimands of counsel, insulting and improper remarks about litigants and witnesses, statements evidencing prejudgment and intemperate and impatient behaviour may destroy the appearance of impartiality. On the other hand, judges are obliged to ensure that proceedings are conducted in an orderly and efficient manner and that court’s process is not abused. An appropriate measure of firmness is necessary to achieve this end. A fine balance is to be drawn by judges who are expected both to conduct the process effectively and avoid creating in the mind of a reasonable, fair-minded and informed person any impression of a lack of impartiality.”
Your Lordship Justice Gamini Rohan Amarasekera, Justice Anthoy Lalith Shiran Gooneratne and Justice Janak De Silva, we have no doubt that all virtues and qualities possessed by Your Lordships and expertise, experience and skills acquired while serving the society in Your Lordships’ respective capacities would guide and illuminate the path in Your Lordship new voyage.
My Lords, while assuring fullest cooperation of the Bar, may I wish Your Lordships be blessed with courage, strength and determination to meet all challenges successfully and travel through this path and reach greater heights, while dispensing justice to all parties who would appear before you.
Thank you.
