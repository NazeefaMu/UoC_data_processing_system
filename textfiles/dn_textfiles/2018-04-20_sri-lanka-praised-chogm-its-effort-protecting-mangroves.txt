Sri Lanka praised at CHOGM for its effort in protecting mangroves

Sri Lanka was feted as one of the top countries that comprehensively protect its mangrove forests at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) 2018 in London yesterday
During Commonwealth Heads of Government Executive sessions, Sri Lanka was chosen to spearhead efforts in restoring and protecting mangroves in commonwealth countries.
A decision had been made to appoint a working committee under Sri Lanka’s leadership to monitor and carry out programmes to preserve mangroves.
Since 2015, the programmes launched to protect mangroves under the leadership of the President garnered world praise.
