Officials fail to solve teachers’ and principals’ issues

The Teachers' and Principals' Trade Union Collective yesterday charged that Education Ministry officials failed to provide solutions to the issues faced by teachers and principals.
Addressing the General Convention of the Teachers' and Principals' Trade Union Collective at the Viharamahadevi Open Air Theatre yesterday, All Island United Teachers' Union Chairman Ven. Yalwela Pagnnasekara Thera said political interference in promotions and transfers of teachers and principals has not changed.
They demanded the government to give due salary increments and promotions of the principals and to appoint qualified principals. They also demanded to bring amendments to the principals’ service minute to avoid issues related to promotions and the salaries of principals.
"Some officials of the Education Ministry act like uneducated people without finding solutions for the issues in the country's education sector. They are attempting to fulfill their wishes by supporting the political leadership," the Thera said.
All Ceylon Teachers' Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin and Common Professional Teachers' Association Chairman Gnanaratne Weerakoon also spoke.
