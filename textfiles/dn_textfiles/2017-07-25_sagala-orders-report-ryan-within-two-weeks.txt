Sagala orders report on Ryan within two weeks

 
Law and Order and Western Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka told Parliament today he had requested Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara to produce a report on the alleged abduction of Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath, within two weeks.
The announcement comes hot on the heels of a meeting between the Minister and the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), after which the GMOA suspended a 24-hour token strike begun this morning citing a ‘favourable response from the Law and Order and Southern Development Minister.
Five among eight demands made by the GMOA pertain to the alleged abduction of MFSAC Convener Ryan Jayalath: The GMOA have asked that the identities of the Police officers involved in the alleged abduction incident are revealed and a public apology and assurance is given by the Police that they would no longer act in that manner.
On Friday (21) a group of policemen had attempted to arrest MFSAC Convener Ryan Jayalath outside the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) where the GMOA together with other trade union representatives were conducting a meeting on trade union action scheduled for July 25.
