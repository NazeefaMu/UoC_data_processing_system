EU, Govt. gives priority to its full implementation

The full implementation of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Resolution of October 2015 has been declared as a priority by both the European Union and the Sri Lankan government delegation headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The above was communicated through a communique released by the EU delegation yesterday after the second meeting of the Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights under the European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission held in Colombo on March 13-14, 2017. The Prime Minister as well as Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had at the meeting reaffirmed their political commitment to move forward on reforms in sectors covered by the Working Group.“Both sides reaffirmed their joint commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights domestically and globally and to collaborate on the effective implementation of international human rights instruments”, stated the communique while it stressed that the EU did recognised the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka in various areas, including the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the passing of the Right to Information Act, legislation on the Office on Missing Persons and symbolic steps taken to advance reconciliation.
Constitutional reforms too were taken up for discussion along with the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in keeping with international standards.
In the meantime, the EU promised to continue supporting the Government in its reforms, including with financial assistance.
The parties also discussed Sri Lanka’s application under the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) which is currently under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council.
“The two institutions have until mid-May to discuss the European Commission’s assessment and adopt their position. Therefore, the EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labour rights and environmental protection”, according to the statement.
