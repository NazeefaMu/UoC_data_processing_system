Students selected for Australia Awards 2019

The Australian High Commission in Colombo yesterday said the Australia Awards selection for the 2019 intake is now completed and Australian universities will host 36 Awardees from Sri Lanka and eight Awardees from the Maldives.
The Australia Awards are prestigious international Scholarships and Fellowships funded by the Australian Government. They offer an opportunity for the next generation of global leaders to undertake study, research and professional development in Australia.
Australia has been offering scholarships in the region for almost 70 years. The 2019 Awardees will undertake Masters degrees at Australia’s top universities in a range of fields including public policy, international trade and development, speech therapy and project management.
The Australian High Commission together with the Australia Awards Sri Lanka will hold a series of pre-departure briefings for the successful awardees to give them the best start in Australia.
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson will host two farewell events in Sri Lanka and the Maldives in November to congratulate the successful Australia Award recipients.
