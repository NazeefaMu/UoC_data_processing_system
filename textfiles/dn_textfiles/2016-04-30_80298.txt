Sensational Pathana overcome Science

Isipathana College staged a spectacular display of running rugby to down Science College Mount Lavinia by 29 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 23 (3 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) in their Singer inter-school ‘A’ Division league rugby tournament match played at Havelock Park yesterday. Pathana led 21-8 at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. Isipathana drew first blood in the 13th minute of play when off a turn over ball they worked their line where centre cum vice-captain Sumudu Rankothge gave a timely off load to dashing winger Chamod Fernando who side stepped his way beautifully and went over for a superb try near the left corner flag. Full back Gayan Wickramaratne made a fabulous touchline conversion for Pathana to go into a 7-nil lead.
In the 22nd minute off a scrum Isipathana scrum half Bandara set his line in motion where Rankothge foxed the Science defence and gave a off load once more to his number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe who made the overlap and darted down for a brilliant try under the post. Wickramaratne made the conversion to extend their lead to 14-nil.
Pathana further increased their tally in the 25th minute when off a sweeping three quarter move Bandara came like a flash, collected the ball from flanker Devin Gunaratne and scampered through for a sensational under the post try side stepping the entire Science defence. Wickramaratne made the conversion and Isipathana further extended their lead to a hefty 21-nil.
In the 28th minute Science cut down the lead with a 30 metre penalty put over by fly half Hansaja.
On the stroke of half time Science scored again when off a three quarter move the ball changed hands from Supun Dilshan to speedy winger Thanuja Maduranga who sprinted his way over for a superb try. Hansaja missed the conversion and the score read 21-8 at half time.
After resumption in the 42nd minute Science scored once again when off a Pathana three quarter move Science winger Thanuja intercepted the ball and scampered through nearly 60 metres to score a try under the post. Hansaja put over the conversion to reduce the margin to 21-15.
In the 48th minute Isipathana’s hero of the day and wing three quarter Chamod Fernando collected a loose ball through an aimless kick made by Science full back Dilshan and went through side stepping the defence to score near the left corner flag. Wickramaratne missed the difficult corner flag conversion and Isipathana led 26-15.
Science cut down the lead immediately when in the 61st minute fly half Hansaja fired across a neat 30 metre penalty to take the score to 26-18.
In the 70th minute, off a ruck Science prop forward Silva crashed through for a try. Hansaja missed the conversion and the score read 26-23 in Isipathana’s favour.
Isipathana who had a sensational game virtually sealed it when in the 79th minute Wickramaratne put over a spectacular 35 metre corner flag penalty to take the final score to 29-23 in the end.
Soon after the final whistle, an angry section of the crowd set upon referee Roshan Fernando, who was with great difficulty taken into the club house for safety with the assistant of a large number of club security personnel.
