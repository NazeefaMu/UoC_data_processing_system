Port City steaming on - Ranawaka

Fifty percent of the sea sand reclamation of the total sand requirement of the Colombo Port City is complete now, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Ranawaka said the project is progressing on time and 35 percent of the total requirement of the delivery of rock material is complete while 30 percent of construction of precast concrete elements is over. He also added that 20 percent of the ground improvement work of the reclaimed area is also completed.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Colombo Port City premises.
Minister Ranawaka said sand reclamation of 269 hectares in Colombo Port City will be completed by 2019. He added that the expressway from Katunayake will be extended from the Kelaniya Bridge upto the Colombo Port City entrance as a flyover and then the same will be connected to the Marine Drive.
The expressway will run underground from near Galle Face Hotel and connected onto the Marine Drive near the Colpetty railway station.
The Galle Face Green will be extended as a result of the sand reclamation project benefiting people.
Minister Ranawaka responding to a query said that so far no Memorandum of Understanding have been signed for the construction of the Smart Buildings in the Colombo Port City, but only proposals.
“After the completion of the reclamation work, the President has to declare this area as a part of Sri Lanka and then he will ask us to declare the same area as a special area of Urban Development,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“Thereafter the Sri Lankan Government and the Chinese partners will be able to call for construction. No government agency other than the President and the UDA is entitled to enter into MOU or such agreements in this connection,” he said.
Ranawaka said the Prime Minister’s Office is working on the legal basis and the other soft part of this project to formalised under a new legal and tax system. “But the entire real state business is done by the Megalopolis Ministry,” Minister Ranawaka said.
Colombo Port City Project Director Nihal Fernando said fishermen’s issues have been solved under the Livelihood Improvement Programme but some who claim to be fishermen attempt to create issues.
