Supply & Material Management education reaching great heights in Lanka   
The Institute of Supply and Materials Management (ISMM) which was founded in 1972 and incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1981 is making arrangements to conduct its 25 landmark convocation on January 22 at the BMICH in grand style.
The diploma of ISMM Corporate Membership with three years experience in executive capacity in a reputed organization is recognized by the Department of Public Administration to be as equivalent to a first or second class degree of any university in Sri Lanka, asserted Noel Wickramasinghe, President ISMM in the sidelines of its preparations for the 25 convention. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom will attend as the Chief Guest and Mahinda Saranapala, CEO, Director Kelani Cables will grace the 25 ISMM Convocation as the guest of honour.
ISMM has also obtained ISO Quality Standard for training and 35 to 50 students pass out annually. Some years the institute had to initiate two diploma courses during the year due to the high demand and this year 35 students will receive their graduate diploma at this year’s convocation, Wickramasinghe said. The course directors of the 25 convocation passing out batch are Sajith Edirisuriya and Jayantha Wijesinghe. A total of 714 diploma holders have passed out so far from ISMM.
Elaborating on the ‘graduate diploma’ the ISMM President said the renaming took place three years ago after adding a project and thesis to the diploma. Supply Chain Management was very important for any organization because when organizations earn money, supply chain professionals should be there to manage the cost during the purchasing process and proving services. They give the fullest contribution to make the highest profit for the organization. When purchasing capital items, buildings or providing various other services, supply chain professionals were essential to manage each and every point to give cost effective solutions to the organization, the ISMM President said.
Wickramasinghe said the third batch of ISMM graduate diploma holders will pass out on January 22 and these diploma holders could pursue their post graduate studies for their MBA at the Open University as the ISMM has signed a MoU with the Open University. He said there was also a keen interest from the Supply Chain MBA Division of the Moratuwa University to enlist ISMM diploma holders for post graduate studies there. Very soon a MoU will be signed with the Moratuwa University for MBA programs, he said. Also ISMM is making arrangements to offer their own degree for Supply Chain Management which will be open for school leavers and for those working in Supply Chain. Presently negotiations were on with the Higher Education Ministry to obtain its approval together with the University Grants Commission.
Commenting on the 25 convocation, the President said it was a landmark for ISMM and as pioneers of supply chain education; they had come along way and done justice to students by giving quality education when compared with other competitors. As a nonprofit organization ISMM was performing in the best interest of the country to develop supply chain professionals and groom them as ethically sound personnel to go ahead with their profession to develop the country, he said.
“Presently our profession has been recognized by the business world. All this time this scope of job was handled by engineers, accountants and various other professionals. They are not specialized in this area. Therefore organizations had to face a lot of issues. Now organizations are going all out to get supply chain professionals for their procurement and other service areas,” he said.
The Supply and Materials Management section of any organization does hold themselves responsible to approximately 60 % of an establishment’s expenditure budget. Some even go up to about 65-80 % if involved in trading or manufacturing. The amount identified is a substantial amount of working capital of an organization’s expenditure budget and it is very important that such commitments are professionally handled to get the best return on investment.
