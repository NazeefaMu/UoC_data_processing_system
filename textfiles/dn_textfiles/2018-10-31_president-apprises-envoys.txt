President apprises envoys

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday explained to the diplomats regarding the conflicting grounds that existed within the previous government, which led to the appointment of a new Prime Minister.
The President was addressing the Ambassadors and High Commissioners in Sri Lanka at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday, to apprise them regarding the prevailing political situation in the country.
Several diplomats expressing their views said they wished Sri Lanka would adhere to the constitution of the country and will conduct activities in a manner that would assure law and order in the country.
President Sirisena emphasised that the new Prime Minister was appointed according to the powers vested in him in the Constitution and further said the new government is expected to further strengthen existing ties with countries in keeping with the non-aligned policy and requested the cooperation and assistance of all the countries for the development activities of the government.
The President also said that the expectation of the new government is to ensure and take forward the measures taken to strengthen democracy, human rights, media freedom, peace and reconciliation among all communities.
All Ambassadors and High Commissioners designated to Sri Lanka participated with Ministers Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Mahinda Samarasinghe and former minister Prof. G.L. Peiris.
