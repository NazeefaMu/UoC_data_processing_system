Ayurvedic treatment upgraded in NCP

The North Central Provincial Ayurvedic Department has embarked on an Ayurvedic treatment upgrading programme.
Provincial Ayurvedic Commissioner and in-charge of the Ayurvedic Panchakarma section of the Anuradhapura Ayurvedic General Hospital Dr. Kumara Alwis told the Daily News that the programme included the expansion of services at hospitals, opening of new rural Ayurvedic hospitals, establishment of 37 Ayurvedic villages in the province, kidney diseases prevention project and the strengthening of hospital staff.
Steps are also taken to obtain the support of the registered and unregistered native physicians in the province to implement the proposed development venture through the grass roots level Ayurvedic preservation sabhas.
Around 1,000 native physicians are practicing Ayurvedic and native treatments.
"We will hold special clinical service to the needy. We need Rs. 30 million for the programme," Dr. Alwis said.
"It is also intended to make the people aware of the importance of consuming native food and beverages instead of imported items. Nature has endowed the people in Rajarata with nutritious food such as Kurukkan, Cawpe, green gram, traditional rice, pumpkin, melon, kekiri neeramulliya and ikiriya," he said.
He said arrangements are underway to establish 37 Ayurvedic villages at the Divisional Secretariat Divisions level in the province.
Dr. Alwis said the Provincial Ayurvedic Department aims at opening an Ayurvedic hospital in each Divisional Secretariat division in the province.
