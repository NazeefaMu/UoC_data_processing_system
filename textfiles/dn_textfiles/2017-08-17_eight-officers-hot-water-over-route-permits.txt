Eight officers in hot water over route permits

Eight officials of the Wayamba Passengers’ Transport Authority are to be interdicted over an incident of misplacing four route permits.
The Board of Directors of the authority has made the decision at a meeting held last month.
The investigations officers have recommended that the eight suspects must be given show-cause charge sheets to interdict them after conducting a disciplinary inquiry over the issue, a senior officer of the Wayamba Passengers’ Transport Authority told the Daily News.
