mCash rewards key stakeholder groups at Infinity Awards 2016


The National Mobile Service Provider Mobitel’s mobile money platform, mCash, held its mCash Infinity Awards 2016 for the second consecutive year in recognition of the outstanding contribution by key stakeholder groups, for mCash Retailers, Distributors and Sales Staff.
Held at the Taj Samudra Colombo, this edition of the mCash Infinity Awards 2016 was for stakeholder groups in the Colombo District. Channel partners received a total of 150 awards ranging from return air tickets and cash prizes for the stakeholder groups. Similar awards events will be held for other regions, bringing the total awards distributed by the second quarter of 2017 to 1,000. The mCash Infinity Awards is a key motivational tool for stakeholders and a fitting way for the company to show its appreciation to partners for their contribution through the year.
