Bieber’s ‘Despacito’ remix sets Guinness World Record

Justin Bieber has broken his own Guinness World Record as his ‘Despacito’ (Remix) with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee has become the most-streamed song across the globe.
The revamped version of the catchy Latin tune, which featured Justin singing a few lines in Spanish for the first time, has been streamed almost five billion times since its release in April, 2017, surpassing the 4.3 billion hits Bieber had previously earned for his 2015 hit Sorry.
The news earns the collaborators a mention in the upcoming 2019 Guinness World Records book, documenting records set by May, 2018, but they aren’t the only pop stars to feature.
Ed Sheeran’s ‘Shape of You’ single has been named the best-selling digital track to date, shifting 26 million units worldwide, and the most-streamed track on Spotify, with more than 1.65 billion listens, while his third studio release, ÷ (Divide), has been declared the biggest-selling album across the globe.
There was recognition for Ed’s pal Taylor Swift, too - her ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ promo has gone down in history as the most-watched music video in a 24-hour period after racking up 43 million views online last year (17), and rockers Maroon 5 now boast the most-viewed group music channel on YouTube with more than nine billion video views.
Meanwhile, Guinness World Record officials are also keeping watch on social media - Selena Gomez is noted as having the most followers on Instagram with over 120 million, and One Direction, who are currently on hiatus, still hold the title for most Instagram followers for a music group, with 17.2 million.
Katy Perry is the first Twitter user to reach 100 million followers, and dance star David Guetta has the most micro-blogging fans for a DJ with 22.2 million.
And K-pop stars BTS have reason to celebrate as well - they beat One Direction’s Harry Styles to score the highest tally of average retweets, earning on average more than 300,000 reposts, compared to the ‘Sign of the Times’ hitmaker’s 147,000 on the same date, according to Guinness World Record officials.
