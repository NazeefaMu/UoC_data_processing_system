While Southern Province recorded two outright wins to be the team with most number of outright victories; NP, UP, CP, NCP and EP failed to record a single outright win.
The two finalists, NWP and SP finished the league stage on a high note when they became top two teams in each group on points to book their places in the final.
In group A, there was a swaying battle between NWP and WPN from the inception before WPC also joined the party pulling off two remarkable wins against Uva and NP in their last two encounters. However, NWP at last won the race to the finals after they collected first innings points over WPN and beat NP by 6 wickets in two crucial fixtures.
In group B which consisted mostly of outer provinces such as SP, CP, NCP and EP, Southern Province maintaining a winning streak right from the start dominated till they became one of the finalists on the back of poor show by the other three outer provinces. However, WPS gave leader, SP a tough fight before they lost the decider to SP in which SP needed only to avoid defeat by WPS to clinch the top spot.

Gunawardene, Dias to coach SL A and U-19 sides
The former batsman, known for his ‘explosive style’ is a current member of the SLC Coaching panel, and has just completed a stint as the Assistant coach of the Sri Lanka under 19 Team.
Gunawardena who was the Head Coach of Sri Lanka premier club the SSC for 9 consecutive seasons, also functioned as the Director of Cricket for Royal College Colombo prior to taking on his National appointment.
An old boy of Ananda College, Gunawardene was a left-hand opener for Sri Lanka scoring a century and top-scoring in the semi-final defeat to South Africa at the Commonwealth Games in 1998 at 21 years. He ended his national career with best figures of 132 against West Indies in 2000, having represented Sri Lanka in 6 Tests, 61 ODIs and 6 T20 matches.
First Sri Lankan Cricketer to reach 1,000 test runs, veteran coach Roy Dias, has been appointed as the Under 19 Coach, and will guide the stable through their forthcoming tours in England and South Africa. The former National coach, who was also in the hot seat in Nepal and Malaysia, is an experienced campaigner and is a widely acclaimed coaching professional.
Dias, already an experienced cricketer when Sri Lanka achieved Test Status, was pivotal in Sri Lanka's maiden Test victory, and series victory, over India 1985-86.
Dias knocked a brilliant 106, in the 3rd test, after scoring 50s in both innings of the previous test, ensuring the series clinch. Known for his classical style and great timing, Dias scored 1285 runs in his Test career of 20 Tests and 1573 ODI runs in 58 ODIs.
Sri Lanka Cricket’s focus on Youth squads to build International Cricket future players, is well-established with the recently concluded Super Under19 Provincial Tournament seeing stellar performances worthy of notice, and is further cemented by the above appointments.
