Suresh Raina back in India ODI Squad for Series vs New Zealand

Suresh Raina has made a return to India's ODI squad for the series against New Zealand. A 15-man squad was named by the new BCCI selection committee, chaired by MSK Prasad, in Mumbai on Thursday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni will lead.
The squad is for the first three ODIs. The first match will be played in Dharamsala on October 16. India have rested three key ODI players - Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami -- to keep them fresh for the long home season ahead.
Suresh Raina last played an ODI match against South Africa in Mumbai in October 2015. He scored 12.
Raina was left out of India's ODI squad for the tour of Australia in December-January, the tour of Zimbabwe in June and the T20I squad for the two matches against West Indies in the USA in August.NDTV
