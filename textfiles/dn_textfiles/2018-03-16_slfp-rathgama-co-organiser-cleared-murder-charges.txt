SLFP Rathgama co-organiser cleared of murder charges

Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakaratne acquitted and released two suspects in a double murder case on the grounds of failure to prove the charges against the respondents beyond reasonable doubt.
The freed defendants are Sri Lanka Freedom Party Co-Chief Organiser for the Rathgama electorate Agampodi Asanka Mendis Geeth Gunasekara and Pubudumani Vidura Zoysa Wijemuni of Tahgama, Galle - the first and second respondents in the case.
The second respondent, since the beginning of the trial, was absent from Courts and subsequently, he had been issued arrest warrants. However, he was represented by his lawyers during the process of the lawsuit. The Galle High Court had indicted the two suspects on the charge of homicide of Pettahandi Lesley Asoka and Agampodi Sunil, and attempting the murder of Pettahandi Sujatha Asoka, Pettahandi Harshani Priyadharshani and Kravage Lalith Kumara by shooting and inflicting injuries during the course of the same criminal act in the company of other suspects unknown to the plaintiff on April 25, 2004 at Palliyapitiya in the Rathgama police division in Galle.
The first respondent was represented by Pemachandra Gamage, attorney-at-law and the interests of the second respondent were looked after by Counsel Nalin Indratissa in association with Solicitor Anura de Silva. State Counsel K. V. Indika prosecuted.
