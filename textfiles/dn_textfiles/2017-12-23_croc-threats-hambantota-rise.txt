Croc threats in Hambantota on the rise

Threats posed by crocodiles in the Hambantota district on the rise, residents complain.
A crocodile farm was to be set up in the Hambantota district, but it has not been established yet, the residents who undergo threats of crocodiles said.
Hundreds of residents in the district depend on water from tanks since they cannot afford pipe borne water. They said they have to wade into tanks for water amidst crocodile threats.
They suggest that the proposed crocodile farm will be the only solution for the issue.
