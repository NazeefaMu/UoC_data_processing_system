B:Hip Global launched in Sri Lanka

B:Hip Global, a health and wellness brand developed and produced in the United States, launched in Sri Lanka. B:Hip Global's arrival to Sri Lanka makes it the 41st country in which the products, including gender-specific energy supplements made in the United States and cosmetics and skincare products made in Scandinavia, will be distributed.
Allan Nielsen, a former footballer from Denmark and the CEO of B:Hip Global's Middle East and South Asia region, inaugurated the launch at the Movenpick Hotel alongside Nishan Herath, the company's Sri Lankan representative. The products range in price from USD $20 to $70 and are supposedly made of all-natural, organic ingredients.
However, little time was spent discussing the actual products, which Nielsen admitted “might not be the world's best, but are very good.” Instead, it was the brand's model of “network marketing,” also known as multi-level marketing, which Nielsen spent most of his introduction emphasizing.
Advertised to people who are looking for part-time or flexible work, network marketing is a business model which requires a distributor network and in which payouts occur at more than one level. For B:Hip Global, this means recruiting local product distributors, or “ambassadors,” rather than traditional retail outlets to market and sell the products, with the marketers making commission for each sale.
In his pitch, Nielsen espoused countless empowering if overly general platitudes to explain why such distributors or ambassadors would want to work with B:Hip. In doing so, he presented working for B:Hip as the solution to a person's professional and personal, woes.
“B:Hip is a global online system. You can build your own business, have your own organization, work from where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want. Which is to say, be your own boss.”
Nielsen added, “We try to open up people's minds and tell them there is another way, you can have it. You are good enough, you are strong enough. We make people see. We show them, you can have it all.”
Yet when pressed, no statistics were presented to evidence the average a B:Fit ambassador makes, nor ones that would confirm whether or not the switch from “active work,” such as a regular, office-based job, to “passive work,” which Nielsen categorizes the B:Fit ambassadorships as, is beneficial for most people in the long-term.
In response to these queries, Nielsen reiterated that the network marketing and direct selling industry is not for everyone.
