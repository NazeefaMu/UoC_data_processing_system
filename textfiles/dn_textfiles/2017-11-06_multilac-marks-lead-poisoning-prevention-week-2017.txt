Multilac marks Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017

Multilac, the nation’s heritage brand and paint exporter, among the only top three global brands to archive lead safe paint certification from IPEN America, joined the global community to mark International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017 recently.
This call to action has been initiated by the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint, a global partnership led by UN Environment and the World Health Organization, with an aim to eliminate lead in paint globally by 2020.
IPEN is a network of public interest non-governmental organizations working in more than 100 countries to reduce and eliminate the harm to human health and the environment from toxic chemicals.
In Sri Lanka, Multilac collaborated with the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ), a social service environmental organisation working towards environmental justice for all through community actions, conducting several activities and events to increase awareness and create a sense of urgency on the importance of lead safety.
Explaining the company’s commitment towards a lead safe standard, Mizver Makeen, Managing Director Macksons Holdings said, “As a 100% home-grown company we has always been committed to manufacture high quality paint products to meet global standards making a positive impact in the industry, in people's health and safety, and in environmental protection.”
“By observing the Lead Safe Week we hope tohave contributed towards promoting a more conducive lead safe environment, especially for children.”
Commencing activities for Multilac’s Lead Safe campaign, the company donated lead safe paint to several pre-schools ensuring the children are not exposed to lead from paints while at school. The event took place at the Cotta Road, Rajagiriya.
Multilac also conducted an awareness campaign in the vicinity of the Castle Street Hospital for Women in Borella, especially for pregnant women and parents of infants and young children, on the importance of lead safe surroundings. Information leaflets and placards were used to increase awareness on the issue.
Commenting on their collaboration, Hemantha Vithanage, Executive Director CEJ said, “At CEJ we continue to advocate tirelessly towards making Sri Lanka completely lead safe. Working together with Multilac during Lead Safe Week we put children at the center of our activities to ensure the health of children are protected.”
In 2016, Multilac achieved global recognition earning the prestigious Lead Safe Paint certification from IPEN America, becoming one of the top three global paint companies to receive this milestone.It is indeed noteworthy that Multilac’s entire product range has also received the lead safe certification.
The company’s extensive export range includes decorative and weather resistant paints, water proofing, wood care products and auto paints. Multilac Colourbank, Multilac Platinum, Ital wood, Multilac Auto, Micron and Mitsuko are among its popular brands.
