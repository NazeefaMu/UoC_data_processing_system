HP Designjet celebrates 25 years

HP Designjet launches innovative experience centre at Trident Corporation, to commemorate the Event Building on the famous HP 7550A, HP DraftPro and HP DraftMasters pen plotters and the industry standard HP Graphics Language (HP-GL).
HP reinvented large-format design in 1990, launching the first inkjet large-format printer called HP DesignJet. A new way to print AEC drawings was born.
Printing was made easier and faster than ever before. Back in 1990, it was a printing revolution with HP DesignJet leading the way. Soon after launching a monochrome model, HP introduced color printing, faster speeds, and higher quality images for new applications such as GIS. We stayed true to our identity, making technology better for everyone, everywhere.
With each new printer, with each new detail, from light-resistant prints to multi-functional devices with Wi-Fi, we collaborated with our customers to make the improvements they needed. Our innovations have not only brought reakthroughs in speed, quality capabilities, workflow, consumption and cost, but have enabled the development of new technologies such as HP Latex printers, HP PageWide XL and HP 3D printers.
Now, with more than 3 million HP DesignJets around the world delivering prints after prints, HP DesignJet is a synonym of large-format printing.
In Sri Lanka HP Designjet Partners have been actively promoting HP DesignJet printers and this has helped the Sri Lankan market to grow substantially .
The commitment of Sri Lankan HP Designjet Partners to increase market share of HP DesignJet printers has increased market penetration in key provinces throughout the island.
Sashika Vishan Country business Manager for Singapore and Asia Emerging Countries for Designjet Printers in his keynote speech said, “HP Designjet printers give customers cutting edge technology which is unmatched and have created instruments where customers can share their complex technical content with confidence.”
As we look ahead to the next 25 years, we strive harder to find solutions and more possibilities keeping our customers at the center of everything we do. Design is in our name, it’s who we are, and we reinvent our technologies so that technical and graphic design professionals like architects, engineers, construction professionals, colour proof readers ,fine art and professional photographers can work in new and better ways as they design the world we live in.
To celebrate this momentous occasion HP Distributor Trident Corporation -a member of the Thakral Group launched a next generation Experience Center at its head office at Union Place Colombo 2. This centre will feature the latest HP DesignJet printers & customers will be able to use these printers and see first hand the true quality of HP Designjet printers.
