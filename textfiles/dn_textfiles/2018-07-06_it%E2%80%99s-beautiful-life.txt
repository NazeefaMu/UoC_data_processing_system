It’s beautiful life!

The 2018 edition of the Japanese Film Festival will take place at the National Film Corporation (NFC) Theatre in Colombo on July 21 and 22. The launch ceremony will be held on July 20. Entrance for all movies is free on a first-come first-served basis and the movies will start on the exact times specified. The festival is being organised by the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the NFC, National Youth Services Council (NYSC) and the Ship for World Youth Alumni Association.
The festival will feature four recent Japanese films representing different categories that have won rave reviews at home and abroad. All four movies to be featured at the festival will be subtitled in English. The movies are:
It’s Beautiful Life (2012, Drama)
Set in the small town of Kamikatsu, where 48% of the population consists of the elderly, a group of elderly women come together to sell vegetable leaves which are used by restaurants for decorative purposes. Since the tangerine industry collapsed in Kamikatsu, the town seems to have slowly withered away. Eda, who works at National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, tries to give the town a boost. Eda’s plan is to sell vegetable leaves from the area. Residents do not like the idea, but three women stand up for Eda’s proposal. Even though her husband strongly opposes her, for the first time in their relationship, she goes against her husband and accomplishes her will. Her business blooms into a Yen 260 million enterprise. This is a movie based on a true story.
The Complex (2013, Horror)
Acclaimed Japanese film-maker Hideo Nakata, perhaps best known for the hit J-horror classics Ring, Ring 2 (both Japanese and Hollywood remakes) and Dark Water, heads back into supernatural territory with his chilling new film The Complex. It might lack the high-concept conceit of Ring, but the director is a master at combing urban horror with ancient terrors and this nicely fraught and twisted tale will appeal to lovers of classic J-horror.
The film, which had its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival, trades on the easy Japanese acceptance of the supernatural having a very real impact on modern life, with Hideo Nakata again making great use of grim modern buildings – with the flickering lights, dingy shapes and stained walls – as the perfect backdrop for spirits terrifying the living. The film stars Atsuko Maeda (the former lead singer of J-pop group AKB48, and who starred in 2007 Japanese horror film The Suicide Song) as nursing student Asuka, who has just moved into an apartment with her parents and younger brother in the rather dilapidated Kuroyuri Building Complex.
She is woken by a strange scratching sound coming from the apartment from next door, and by an alarm clock that goes off at 6.30 a.m. When she tells college friends where she lives there are whispers about the complex being haunted. Asuka then makes friends with a young boy in the playground at the centre of the complex who seems to have no friends.
Golden Orchestra (2016, Comedy)
Toru Hosokawa’s Golden Orchestra is that rare light, charming comedy that not only brings laughs, but will also resonate with audiences on a deeper, personal level. This is a testament to the dedication of the filmmaker and the entire cast, many of whom are senior citizens. Based on the 2008 novel of the same name, the story revolves around a young schoolteacher, Chizuru (Anne Watanabe, daughter of actor Ken), whose lifelong dream of playing in an orchestra is reignited after attending the Umega High School concert. Intending to sign up for that same orchestra the next day, she mistakenly joins a similarly named group consisting of elderly locals who are not exactly good musicians. When the senior conductor (Takashi Sasano) suffers a heart attack during Chizuru’s first session, she feels obliged to handle the baton for the foreseeable future with hilarious results.
Time of Eve (2010, Sci Fi Anime)
Sometime in future Japan, androids are involved in every aspect of people’s lives. One day, upon checking his android’s behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android’s returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the “people” in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy’s behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society.
