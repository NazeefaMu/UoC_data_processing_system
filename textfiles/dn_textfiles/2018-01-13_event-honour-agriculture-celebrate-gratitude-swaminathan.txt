Event to honour agriculture, celebrate gratitude -Swaminathan

“It is my pleasure to convey my warm wishes on this Thai Pongal day to all Tamils in Sri Lanka for a happy, peaceful and prosperous Thai Pongal day, which is an extraordinary festival to Tamil people,” Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan sayes in his Thai Pongal message.
“As an honour to agriculture, Tamil people offer their worship to the ‘God Sun’ on this Thai Pongal day for helping them to achieve a bountiful harvest and also this day is celebrated as a festival which gives gratitude to cattle for their massive help for farming. There is a proverb that, with the dawn of Thai Pongal new opportunities will open.
“Therefore, in order to create prosperity and advancement of the people of this country within this peaceful environment where our country is going towards the development, this day is important as the day of national co-existence where all Sri Lankans should determine to further strengthen the peace, co-existence and collaboration between all the nations beyond race and religion.
“As the Hindu Affairs Minister, with the credibility of that the future of Tamil people will be fortunate, I take this opportunity to convey my warm wishes for a Happy Thai Pongal day to all Tamils in Sri Lanka and around the world.”
