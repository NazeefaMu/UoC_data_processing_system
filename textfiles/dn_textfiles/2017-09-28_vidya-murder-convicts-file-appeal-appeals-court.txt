Vidya Murder: Convicts to file appeal at Appeals Court

 
Attorney-at-Law Mahinda Jayawardena who appeared on behalf of the seven convicts who raped and murdered Sivaloganathan Vidya said today that an appeal would be signed and handed over to courts within fourteen days.
The Attorney-at-Law added that the seven convicts are falsely accused by the media, and another person is actually responsible of the charges made against his clients.
Furthermore he said that Mahalingam Shashikumar alias ‘Swiss Kumar’ and the six other convicts denied the charges pressed against them.
The seven accused including ‘Swiss Kumar’ were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya of Punguduthivu in 2015 by the Trial- at-Bar of the Jaffna High Court yesterday.
