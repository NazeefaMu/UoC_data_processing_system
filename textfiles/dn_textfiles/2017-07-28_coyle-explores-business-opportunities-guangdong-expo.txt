COYLE explores business  opportunities at Guangdong expo

An eight member high-profile delegation comprising of key Chinese officials representing the Maritime Silk Route Expo Secretariat and the Peoples Government of Dongguan, Guangdong China, met the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) recently.
It was held as part of an ambitious business promotional visit to Sri Lanka for the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road International Expo to be held in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, in China, from Sept. 21t to 24.
The meeting whilst promoting the exhibition, was held with a view to spur lucrative business deals, open new markets for Sri Lankan goods and services and forge new trade and investment ties.
They explained that the trade fair covers a broad range of sectors with potential for trading in tea, apparels, rubber products, gems and jewellery, food and beverage, spices and allied products, etc. The bottomline was the probability of reaping maximum business and economic benefits for participants, by engaging in viable and sustainable partnerships.
The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka stated that they would facilitate this trade exhibition and assured logistical support to COYLE.
Consular, Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, Yang Zuo Yuan re-iterated that a special counter to handle the visa requirements of COYLE members would be implemented.
The COYLE team comprised of Chairman Kushan Kodituwakku, Senior Vice Chairman Dinuk Hettiarachchi, Vice Chairman Aminda Rodrigo and the membership of COYLE.
Kodituwakku welcomed the delegates with an engaging presentation and said, “The Maritime Silk Road gives COYLE companies an opportunity to expand outside Sri Lanka and go global while penetrating the Chinese markets; in line with COYLE’s vision of building billion dollar global companies.”
The strategic meeting was a step in furthering trade ties between China and Sri Lanka and presented an opportunity for building strong commercial connections between Guangdong and local businessmen, arising from the One Belt One Road project. Several COYLE companies confirmed their participation at the Guangdong exhibition.
As a follow-up, a COYLE team met State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe and discussed the formation of a twin-city concept offering trade ties between Guangdong and Colombo to promote income and wealth creation for local companies.
COYLE’s aim of the initiative is for partnerships to be formed and deals to be brokered so that businesses can expand regionally and globally, with the ultimate goal of increasing economic growth outside Sri Lanka.
