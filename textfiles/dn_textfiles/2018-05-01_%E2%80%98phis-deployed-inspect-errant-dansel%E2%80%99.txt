‘PHIs deployed to inspect errant dansel’

As several complaints regarding the quality of food served at dansel were raised recently, around 2,500 Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) had been deployed to conduct inspections at such places, All Sri Lanka PHIs’ Association Secretary Mahendra Balasooriya said when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday, in Kurunegala.
Around 2,635 dansel countrywide had been registered with the government for this year’s Vesak festival. Most of the accused dansel were inspected on Sunday (29), whereas the remainder were to be investigated yesterday, Balasooriya added.
