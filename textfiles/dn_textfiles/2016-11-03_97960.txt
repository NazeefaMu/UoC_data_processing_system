AFC Solidarity Cup Football : Sri Lanka takes on Laos today

 Sri Lanka will take on Laos in their opening match of the AFC Solidarity Cup Football Championship at the Sarawak International Stadium, Malaysia today. The group ‘B’ match will see the two of the strongest teams of the group fighting for their first victory in the tournament.
Sri Lanka is ranked at 193 while Laos is slotted at 177 in world rankings. The match record between the two nations implies Sri Lanka has a slight edge over Laos. The last three games have produced mixed results as each country won a match each with one game drawn.
The Sri Lankan team is coached by Dudley Steinwall who led the nation to a 3/0 win in the 2003 World Cup qualifier. Laos has registered their only win against Sri Lanka in 2013 on home soil, beating the visitors by 4/2.
Laos savoured mixed fortunes this year winning three games and losing five with two matches ending in draws. In contrast Sri Lanka were beaten in all their three matches.
Coach Steinwall said that our players are in high spirit to face the challenge and it is very advantageous to bring out their best for the country. “We know that if we win this game, our path to the semis will be a comfortable one. At least a draw will make our position strong in Group ‘B’,” he explained.
“I have limited our practices due to overnight heavy rains, as I do not want to take the risk of causing injuries to players. But if our players perform to their best of ability, the victory is within our reach,” Stanvol said.
