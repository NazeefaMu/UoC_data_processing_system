UNP won’t have Rajitha removed

The UNP yesterday stated that it is against removing Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at UNP headquarters, Sirikotha UNP back bencher Hector Appuhami said Minister John Seneviratne has no moral right to make such a request. “Minister Senaratne was in the vanguard of creating the ‘yahapalana’ government and he was with us from the beginning. He speaks straight. He has undertaken a huge task on behalf of the people. We, in the UNP, do not agree to his removal from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post. Minister John Seneviratne who joined the Cabinet later has no right to make such a demand. We don’t think that Dr. Senaratne made any wrong statement or said anything against the country,” he said.
When asked on the Cabinet reshuffle, the MP said the truth about the rumours would come out after the Cabinet meeting.
