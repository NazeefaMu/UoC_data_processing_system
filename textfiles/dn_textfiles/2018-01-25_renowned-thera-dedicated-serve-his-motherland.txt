Renowned Thera dedicated to serve his motherland

Viharadhipati Houstan Buddhist Viharaya USA, Theravada Buddhist Viharaya Taiwan and the Attanagalla Raja Maha Viharaya Mahopadyaya Ven. Dr. Pannila Ananda Chief Sanghanayake Thera of Seenadi Four Korales is a renowned Dhamma teacher who has been rendering a valuable sasana, religious, educational and social service.
The knowledge gained and the wide scale international bonds he has established during nearly four decades of Buddhist Missionary work in Europe and Asia had helped him to muster support for his socio-religious and educational development work in Sri Lanka. He has been able to launch the Sri Pathiraja Bhikkhu Training Centre at the Attanagalla Raja Maha Viharaya and provide it with two buildings valued at Rs 30 million and Rs 10 million to facilitate Bhikkhu Training in the Tripitake and foreign languages.
The viharayas which had benefited from his munificence are many. Among them are the Hakgalla Sri Nagawanaramaya, Maimbulkanda Purana Gallen Viharaya and the Kamburagalla Sri Bodhirukkaramaya. He had also been instrumental in helping people in distress by pioneering a project to build 336 houses for people affected by the Tsunami in Telwatta, Peraliya, Daluwathumulla, Hambantota and Ridiyagama.
He has built two pre-school buildings for children in Ampara and Kalmunai affected by the Tsunami. In his capacity as the President of the Wathupitiwala J. P. Obeysekara Base Hospital, he has been able to equip the hospital with much needed buildings and other facilities. He has been awarding monthly scholarships amounting to nearly Rs. 300,000 to nearly 1,260 students in universities including medical students.
He has also provided the Veyangoda St. Mary's Maha Vidyalaya with a three storied laboratory building and two other three storied school buildings to the Thihariya Al Ashar Maha Vidyalaya and the Alawala Maha Vidyalaya.
A three storied school building gifted by him to the Nittambuwa Sanghabodhi Vidyalaya is due to be opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on January 26 in the presence of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
