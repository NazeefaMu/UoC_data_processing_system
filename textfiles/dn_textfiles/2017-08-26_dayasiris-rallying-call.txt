Dayasiri's rallying call

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has called for the strict enforcement of collective Cabinet responsibility henceforth. This is in the wake of the Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe episode. Rajapakshe was forced to step down for violating collective Cabinet responsibility when he aired contrary views to a Cabinet decision to lease out the Hambantota port to a Chinese Company. It was not just Rajapaskhe, even minister Susil Premajayantha had gone public being critical of the agreement and in addition making statements that are diametrically opposed to government policy. So far he has escaped unscathed while Wijeyadasa's head rolled.
True, like the minister explained, one may have divergent views, which may be thrashed out inside Cabinet. But once a collective decision is taken the entire Cabinet is bound by it. It is also true that there is a clash in ideology and economic policy between the UNP and the SLFP, whose polices, one may even go onto describe as chalk is to cheese. Or is it? Not any longer, by a long way. Chandrika changed this equation, with the result that both major parties are now on even keel in terms of economic policy and also social outlook. Hence, there is no reason for a head on collision of the type one witnessed down the decades. MR himself embraced the market economy of the UNP and even made the UNP blush with some of the changes he effected, in contrast to the SLFP's traditional way of thinking. Perhaps, the SLFP ministers, still clinging to the past, may baulk at some of the Cabinet decisions taken. It is also understandable why they take a different stance. They have a constituency which still clings to the Bandaranaike ideals.
But, it is obvious that there has to a bit of give and take in a coalition government comprised of the country's two major political parties. Old ways should give way to the new. Whatever differences, though, should be ironed out within Cabinet and the Ministers speak in a unified voice in public.
Speaking at the press briefing to announce Cabinet decisions, minister Jayasekara also expressed the view that ALL members of the Unity Government should speak in one voice. This is perhaps after the plethora of divergent views being expressed by both sides in the Yahapalanaya government, that obviously is sending the wrong signals to the public, suggesting disunity. Jayasekara is himself guilty of this, along with Cabinet colleague Champika Ranawaka. They both are vocal in their opposition to SAITM, placing the government in an embarrassing position. There are others like Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya who is even casting aspersions on the Prime Minister and deriding UNP policies.
Jayasekara also hinted that the Unity Government will continue till 2020 when he said that both parties should be united and speak in one voice. "This animosity is not healthy for the Yahapalanaya Government as we expect to govern the country until 2020". Therefore it is the responsibility of the UNP and SLFP to go forward with a mutual understanding, he emphasized. Even SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake had hinted, more than once, the certainty in continuing with the alliance, beyond the expiry of the agreement between the two parties although the President had asked his men to give him time till December 31, obviously to quell the rumblings of discontent within his camp.
Be that as it may, both sides should ensure to keep the alliance intact beyond the realms of a marriage of convenience. The Rajapaksas are sniffing around to pounce on any differences or discontent to claw their way back to power. The way Mahinda Rajapaksa seized on the Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe saga to make political capital is a good example of the
modus oprandi of the Joint Opposition. Today, they have made Wijeyadasa, a hero, nay, a martyr, who they single out to be a victim of those bent on sale of national assets, a refrain often heard from members of the JO. They are similarly on the lookout for others expressing similar sentiments, so that they could claim to the public that government members too were on the same wavelength as they.
UNP members too should stop baiting their SLFP colleagues in the government. Both sides should desist media conferences where dirty linen is being washed in public.
SLFP MPs should be prevailed upon not to attack or criticize the Prime Minister. Not a single UNP parliamentarian has so far spoken ill of the President. The PM, after all, is the leader of the government and head of the Cabinet. It would be unbecoming of any member, therefore, to target the Premier. It should be recalled that the UNP is in a majority in parliament and it could have formed a government of its own following the election by inducing crossovers. Thankfully, saner counsel prevailed and the protagonists opted for a Unity Government, as much as to keep the Rajapaksas at bay, as to develop the country and the economy jointly. Hence it is important that the alliance stays firm to achieve the country's long term objectives.
