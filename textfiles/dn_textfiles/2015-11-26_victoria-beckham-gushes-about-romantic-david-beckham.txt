Victoria Beckham Gushes about 'Romantic' David Beckham

Despite being responsible for the cutest family around, David and Victoria Beckham are constantly plagued with split rumours, with many ominous sources and mysterious insiders trying to claim that all is not well behind the scenes.
However, Victoria has once again gushed about how much she ruddy loves her husband, her family, and her life - and if this isn't enough to silence the haters then we have no idea what is.
Speaking to People magazine, the fashion tycoon explained: "David is very romantic and we regularly do lovely things to surprise each other.
"The first time I met David, nearly 20 years ago, we were at a football match. After the game all the other players were having a drink with their friends and David was standing with his mum and dad and his younger sister Joanne. Family is important to him.
"When he proposed he asked my dad first, which is such a respectful thing to do."
Alright, Vic, we're already seriously jealous that you are the one lucky enough to be married to him - no need to rub it in.
The star also revealed that even though she and her hubby are busy being two of the most famous people on the planet, they always dedicate time to their four children, 16-year-old Brooklyn, 13-year-old Romeo, 10-year-old Cruz, and four-year-old Harper, adding: "Both of us have to travel with work, but we always make time for each other and time for the children.
"We always support each other and our family."
Meanwhile, David, who was named People's sexiest man alive last week, revealed that when he told his kids about his award they all burst out laughing.
He shared: "We kind of laughed about it with the boys and the boys kind of laughed at me and said, 'Really?! Sexiest man alive? Really?'
"My oldest son, Brooklyn was the one who was like, 'Are you sure it's not me that's meant to be there today?'"
And with Brooklyn fast-approaching his dad's level of fame, we wouldn't be surprised if he is the one to nab that title from his pops in a few years time.
