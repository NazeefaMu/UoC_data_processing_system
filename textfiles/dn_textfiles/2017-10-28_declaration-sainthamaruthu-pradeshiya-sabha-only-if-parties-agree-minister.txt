Declaration of Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha, only if parties agree - Minister

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said that a decision regarding the request to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu will be taken only after discussions with all relevant political parties in the area.
“All political parties should agree unanimously to make a change,” the Minister addressing the media at his Ministry yesterday. The people have been demanding for a separate Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu, from the Kalmunai Municipal Council area since 1988. However, it gained momentum only after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised during his election campaign that he would declare a Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha on the request of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauf Hakeem.
Minister Mustapha said the Prime Minister is happy to establish a Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu.There are issues in declaration as there were also suggestions to divide the Kalmunai Municipal Council into four Pradeshiya Sabhas.
"Therefore, a final decision pertaining to declaring Sainthamaruthu Pradeshiya Sabha cannot be taken without the consent of all political parties in that area," he said.
