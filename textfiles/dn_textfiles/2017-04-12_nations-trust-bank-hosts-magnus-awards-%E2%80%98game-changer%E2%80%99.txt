Nations Trust Bank hosts Magnus Awards ‘Game Changer’

Nations Trust Bank recently held the Magnus Awards 2016 at The Kingsbury Colombo’s Balmoral Ballroom recently.
The theme of the Magnus Awards 2016 was ‘Game Changer’ and its purpose was to recognize and reward individuals and teams that found the courage to disrupt the established order, change the game and deliver excellence. Eleven prestigious awards in eleven competitive categories were handed out at the ceremony.
Speaking at the event Renuka Fernando, the CEO of Nations Trust Bank, said that, ‘Today innovation, excellence and synergy are the key drivers of success in the marketplace.”
“The only way to foster these qualities is to create an environment in which people are unafraid to excel and actually rewarded for doing so. That is why we host the Magnus Awards. Also, nothing brings a team together quite like an evening of colour, entertainment and camaraderie.”
The crème de la crème of Nations Trust Bank was present at the Magnus Awards 2016. The two most sought after awards of the night, the award for Employee of the Year 2016 in the Non-Management Category and the award for Employee of the Year 2016 in the Management Category were won by Matheesha De Silva and Manoj Perera, respectively.
