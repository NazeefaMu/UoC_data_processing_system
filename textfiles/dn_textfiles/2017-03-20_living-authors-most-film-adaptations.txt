The Living Authors with the Most Film Adaptations

It seems as though every other day there’s an announcement of a new forthcoming film adaptation of a beloved (or just new) novel—after all, where else would great films come from? It’s a huge deal to have your novel adapted for the big screen, but some authors probably don’t even notice it anymore. There are plenty of writers whose works have been made into many, many films—William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Arthur Conan Doyle being the high rollers that immediately spring to mind. But with contemporary—read, living—authors, the field is a little slimmer. So I wondered—which living authors have had the most films adapted from their work (so far)? I wondered, I searched, and then I made this infographic.
Some notes on methodology: first of all, this information doesn’t exist in any organized place (until now), so I had to search film adaptations author by author. If I’ve missed someone, this is why. In fact, I’m sure I’ve missed someone, but all research has to stop somewhere. Next, I wasn’t picky about source material: movies adapted from novels, short stories, and novellas all count, though original screenplays written by novelists do not. I didn’t count sequels of films not themselves based on an original work—so The Mangler counts, but not The Mangler 2 or The Mangler Reborn. (I’m also not counting anthology films in which not all of the segments are adaptations, though this is only an issue for Stephen King, who doesn’t need any more of a lead.) On the other hand, single works that have been adapted twice (or split into two films) do get counted twice. Here’s a big one: I’ve only counted films that were theatrically released—so no made-for-TV movies. This changes the data a lot—for instance, Danielle Steel has more than 20 TV movie adaptations to her name (and only one theatrical release, in Australia)—but I think this way is more faithful to what we mean when we talk about film adaptations.
You had to clear five “actual” films to get on my list, which is a pretty high bar. Anne Rice doesn’t cut it. James Patterson doesn’t either. I’ve counted films slated as 2017 releases where appropriate, but nothing only announced or “in production,” because the movie business is unreliable and projects crash and burn all the time. Finally, for my sanity, I’ve only counted films based on books written in English.
