Perfect your life at UFO

UFO personal training studio was opened at 75A, Kynsey Road recently. It is the brainchild of Himal Alahakoon with his team of personal trainers, each of who has at least eight years’ experience, led by Raghvan Roshan, whose 20 years of experience as a leading personal trainer for VIPs in Colombo leads the team to be multi-faceted in their training regimes.
Alahakoon also introduced the Brand Ambassador for UFO, multi-award winning actress Yashodha Wimaladharma, who stated that she’s been working out with Raghvan for a long time. From Core training to fitness for all ages, pre-natal training to assist expectant women, sport training for school and collegiate sports and specialised personal training to meet specific goals, UFO’s customised training formulae focus on weight loss, strength building, posture, flexibility, stability, balance and healthier lifestyles.
Alahakoon who was inspired to launch UFO due to every gym he tried being crowded and not having sufficient personal time with a trainer said the UFO environment is peaceful and comfortable for both client and trainer. “Our competitive edge at UFO is that each personal training programme is individualised and given its smaller more intimate setting, UFO is able to give our clients maximum results,” he said.
Equipped with the latest cardio and weight training equipment, UFO’s head fitness trainer Raghvan is the Cross-Fit Consultant for the Sri Lanka Commando Regiment, Sri Lanka Military Academy, CR&FC Tennis Academy and HSC Basketball teams, while also functioning as Fitness Coach for leading schools in Colombo including St. Peter’s College, St. Joseph’s College and Holy Family Convent.
