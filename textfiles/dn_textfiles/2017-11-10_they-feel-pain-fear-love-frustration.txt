THEY FEEL pain, fear, love, frustration

PETA, the largest animal rights organization in the world, with more than 6.5 million members and supporters operates under the simple principle that ‘animals are not ours to eat, to wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment.’ PETA Asia Vice President of International Campaigns Jason Baker talks to the Daily News on PETA’s latest achievements, campaigns and limitations.
Elaborate on PETA Asia’s vision and mission?
PETA Asia is an affiliate of PETA US, the world’s largest animal rights organization. PETA US and its affiliates have more than 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide.
PETA Asia is dedicated to establishing and protecting the rights of all animals. We operate under the simple principle that animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment, and we focus our attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including spaying and neutering of companion animals.
What are PETA’s main focus areas?
One of the main areas PETA focuses on is China. We’re working hard to urge the next generation of Chinese residents to condemn the idea that animals are ours to use in any way.
We’ve also created Chinese leaflets—on topics ranging from vegetarian eating and fur to spaying and neutering and zoos—that we supply to local groups and activists free of charge. We actively visit schools and universities across China, set up information tables at events around the country, and partner with companies to inform people about the need to make compassionate choices. Grassroots work is essential to the success of the animal rights movement, so we also work closely with local activists and groups throughout China.
What are the latest animal welfare projects initiated by PETA?
As just one example, PETA has been touring with an animatronic bear, Bobo, to popular locations in Beijing in order to inform people of the way in which bears used for entertainment are typically taken from their families as cubs and hung by their necks to force them to learn to stand on two legs, before being shipped around the country to perform tricks such as Hula-Hooping and riding a bike.
What’s the latest situation of Mali, the elephant, who is being kept in a tiny enclosure at the Manila Zoo?
Mali is still at the Manila Zoo. We are in constant communication with all relevant government authorities and are working with them to attempt to secure her freedom. We regularly check up on her and the other animals at the zoo. We work with the media, getting her into the news, both locally and internationally. We also work through online marketing, public education, media and celebrity campaigns, and other strategies to draw attention to her suffering, and we won’t stop until she has the life that she deserves. Social change doesn’t happen overnight, but we have faith that the relevant authorities will make the right decision—to free Mali—if we continue putting pressure on them to do so.
As we know PETA has no legal authority to talk against international animal exchange. In which ways can PETA reach out to such innocent animals?
Animal advocates don’t have the legal authority to stop this cruelty or to take the animals away, because such activities aren’t illegal. Our best hope for helping these animals is to encourage caring people not to visit zoos or any other institution that exploits animals for profit.
As an organization that supports animal freedom, have you launched any campaigns to promote safari parks and ban zoos?
PETA works through public education, eyewitness investigations, research, advocacy for animal-protection legislation, celebrity involvement, and protest. As long as people continue to buy tickets, animals will continue to suffer. Zoos will be forced to stop breeding and capturing more animals from the wild if their financial support disappears. We encourage people to family, friends, and coworkers—especially those with small children—who may be inclined to go, and explain to them that every ticket purchased directly contributes to animals’ misery.
International organizations such as UN are thoroughly concerned about human rights violations of its member countries. Would it be possible to establish a similar international organization to address animal rights issues? Can PETA initiate that?
Many of our victories across Asia have been achieved by working with local governments—instead of against them—in order to cultivate positive relationships with them that will benefit our work for animals in the future. Unfortunately, getting the animal rights message to the public isn’t always easy and straightforward. Unlike our opposition—which is mostly composed of wealthy industries and corporations—PETA must rely on getting free “advertising” through media coverage. We often do outrageous things to get the word out about animal abuse, because sadly, the media usually don’t consider the facts alone sensational enough to cover. Using these tactics, we’re able to grab headlines, thereby bringing the animal rights message to audiences around the world.
PETA’s positions may be controversial, but they are always true to its driving mission: to stop animal abuse worldwide. Is this what sets PETA apart from other such organisations?
PETA has always been known for having uncompromising, unwavering views on animal rights. Our purpose is to stop animal suffering, and we use all available opportunities to reach millions of people with powerful messages. We aren’t afraid to make the difficult comparisons, say the unpopular thing, or point out the uncomfortable truth if it means that animals will benefit.
What is the most animal friendly country? What are the worst countries for animals?
Taiwan made headlines earlier this year after its decision to outlaw the consumption of cat and dog meat, a first in Asia. In addition, Taipei earned the top spot on PETA’s list of the Top 10 Vegan-Friendly Cities in Asia. Taipei’s vegan scene is the most dynamic in Asia, thanks to numerous restaurants that offer cutting-edge vegan meals and a powerful community of animal advocates.
In China, on the other hand, the abuses perpetrated against animals throughout the country are often incomprehensible. Animals languish in substandard zoos all over the country, entertainment parks where patrons can purchase live animals to feed to tigers continue their cruel operations, and dog and cat markets flourish all over the region. Working against awful situations such as these isn’t usually possible from a legal standpoint because, for the most part, no penalties exist for cruelty to animals. For this reason, PETA focuses on China, and several employees frequently travel to cities such as Beijing, Jining, Nanjing, and Shanghai to meet with government officials in order to discuss ways of helping to improve the treatment of animals.
What are PETA’s remarkable achievements? Are you satisfied with your achievements up to now?
Our work in China is changing hearts and minds. Last year, we blew the lid off Chinese circuses and caused a huge stir. An investigator saw bear cubs chained to the wall with rings through their snouts, lions and tigers being hit with heavy metal poles, and monkeys shackled by the neck, defecating in fear as they tried to escape from their handlers. One of the videos from the investigation was viewed more than 60 million times, and media outlets and state newspapers came down hard on the perpetrators. The investigation also prompted China’s State Forestry Administration to conduct a raid on a circus and confiscate more than 20 bears when trainers failed to produce a license for them.
Those forward-thinking attitudes are also reverberating throughout the fur industry. China is the world’s largest fur exporter, but as abuse on fur farms—where millions of foxes, minks, dogs, and other animals are strangled, electrocuted, and skinned each year—has come to light, exports have dropped. Fur is losing popularity domestically, too. More Chinese celebrities, including A-list actorsSun Li, Yang Mi, and Chen Bolin, are speaking out against fur.
We know that change comes incrementally in any movement, but we’re making progress, especially among Chinese youth. The way that humans treat animals is changing in China and around the world.
Is PETA dedicated to promote vegetarianism?
Not only does following a vegan lifestyle save the lives of countless animals, a UN report concluded that factory farming is one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems at every level—from local and global.
Almost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to circuses and zoos, but we realize now that all animals have the capacity to feel pain, fear, love, frustration, and loneliness—and to suffer just as humans do. They deserve to lead lives free from suffering and exploitation. Every time that we make a choice—right down to what meal to eat or what shoes to buy—we can choose to be cruel or to be kind, and something as seemingly small as choosing a veggie burger over a beef burger can make a world of difference for animals.
