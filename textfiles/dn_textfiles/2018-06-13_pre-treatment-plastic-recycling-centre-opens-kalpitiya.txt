Pre-treatment plastic recycling centre opens in Kalpitiya

As a sustainable solution to waste and the struggle with garbage disposal, the Maritime Conservation and Research Unit of Sri Lanka Navy recently introduced the Naval Pre Treatment Centre for Plastic Recycling - a new methodology for plastic recycling.
Accordingly, the newly constructed and first of its kind centre was opened at Naval Detachment Anawasala in Kalpitiya in the Northwestern Naval Command by the Northwestern Naval Area Commander Rear Admiral Sujeewa Perera and senior officials of MAS Holdings.
Commanding Officer SLNS Vijaya, Captain Prabath Rathugamage, Senior Staff Officer Naval Maritime Conservation and Research Unit, Lieutenant Commander Kasun Nuwarapaksha, naval officers, members of MAS Holdings, officers from the government institutions and residents of the area were present. MAS Holdings had sponsored the Pre Treatment Centre for Plastic Recycling that is operated with no motives of profit making. The residents in the region can handover their plastic waste to this centre, for which they are offered a reasonably high price.
Following the initial recycling process, the compressed substance is channeled to other agents who undertake further recycling into plastic waste.
