Couple weds in toilet

A bride and groom tied the knot in a courthouse bathroom after 'unusual circumstances' nearly saw their dream wedding cancelled.
The big day was underway for Brian and Maria Schulz at Monmouth County Courthouse, where the couple's family and friends had gathered to see the pair wed. But not long after the ceremony had begun Brian's mother began to have breathing difficulties and felt an asthma attack coming on.
Quick-thinking sheriff officers took the mother-of-the-groom to the bathroom where they gave her oxygen while waiting for the paramedics to arrive.
The couple were worried for her health, but also faced the prospect of not getting married there and then.
If they did not marry that day they would have to wait 45 days for a new marriage license, and the ceremony could not continue without the groom's mother as she had signed the marriage license and needed to be present.
Not being able to leave the bathroom for fear her condition would worsen, the Schulz's were left with few options. It was then suggested the ceremony continue - in the women's bathroom.
The pair accepted the venue change, and the wedding party including Honorable Judge Katie Gummer relocated to the restroom to continue proceedings on January 2.
he new husband and wife tied the knot by the paper towel dispenser, and are said to be grateful for the courthouse staff for being so accommodating, Eyewitness News reports.
Sheriff Shaun Golden said: "I commend the sheriff's officers and EMTs involved in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the groom's mother.
As for the nuptials, the quick thinking and determination of our officers and commitment from the judge to perform the ceremony in unusual circumstances led to one happy couple. I congratulate them both and wish the mother continued health."
