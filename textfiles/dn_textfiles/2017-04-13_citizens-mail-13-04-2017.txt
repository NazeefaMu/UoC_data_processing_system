[CITIZENS' Mail - (13-04-2017)

Thank you Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka
I am delighted to send this letter to Daily News in great appreciation of the aforementioned Minister’s kind thought which prompted him to cause action to ease the terrific traffic congestion at Rajagiriya, between Rajagiriya Junction and Ayurveda Hospital, specially in the mornings.
I am a daily traveller from Welikada to Kollupitiya in No 177 Kaduwela-Kollupitiya bus. Earlier, invariably in the mornings, buses plying from Kaduwela to Kollupitiya took about more than half an hour to pass this short distance.
Minister Patali Champika thank you very much. Now owing to your efforts it takes even less than 10 minutes to across this vulnerable point.No one dreamt of such a smooth vehicle movement plan in the said area earlier.
The entire travelling public in this area will appreciate your kind gesture indeed.
D W Nandisena, Rajagiriya
