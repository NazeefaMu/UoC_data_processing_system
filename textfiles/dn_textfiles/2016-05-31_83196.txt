Colourless love

Communal harmony is a subject that had been repeatedly discussed and preached over many decades in this country. Yet the progress towards the object is very low.
The 30 year separatist war greatly tarnished harmony within Sinhala and Tamil communities. Religions, castes and various dogmas too are exploited by parties with sinister motives to create more division between communities adding insult to injury.
Our country is now on a revival phase. Thus it is of vital importance that significance of communal harmony and harmony within people are communicated effectively to masses at this juncture.
Cinema is a very effective tool that can be used in this communication drive. In the recent past we saw quite a few films made to serve this purpose. ‘Adara Kathawak’ (A Love Story) made by Chandran Rutnam decades back still linger in the minds of local filmgoers. However the film ends with a negative note.
The seasoned film director V Sivadasan has now joined the bandwagon to make a film on communal harmony. Keerthi Ruwan Lalson is the co-director of the film.
Muhurath ceremony of the film; ‘Paatak Nethi Adarayak’ (A Colourless Love) was held recently and shooting is now in progress.
The story revolves around two youngsters of different communities and different religious backgrounds falling in love amidst heavy resistance from their parents. ‘Paatak Nethi Adarayak’ according to its screenplay will progress towards a happy ending unlike Rutnam’s film. Thus it is for the families to watch and enjoy.
The cast comprises; Sathischandra Edirisinghe, Jayalath Manoratne, Dilhani Ashokamala, Meena Kumari, Buddhika Kalindu, Poshini Nadee Kumari, Wasanthi Ranwala, Chanaka Madushan and Yohan Perera.
Camera is handled by Sujith Nishantha and the film is edited by Buddhika Ranasinghe. Renowned musician Somapala Ratnayake has done the music scores. Sunil Dharmasiri is the lyricist. Sanjeewani Weerasinghe, Poorna Sachintha, Manisha Chanchala and Sathish Lakshan have contributed as playback singers.
‘Paatak Nethi Adarayak’ is Sivadasan’s tenth film direction. The film is produced by S Thumilan of Blue Ocean Entertainment fame.
