Sticker campaign to promote trilingual policy

The National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry has initiated a programme to paste stickers with the wording “Sri Lankan: our identity, diversity, strength” on vehicles towards implementing the trilingual policy of the government.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganeshan and Deputy Minister Alishahir Mowlana formally commenced the campaign by pasting stickers on vehicles at the Batticaloa bus stand. The motive is to infuse the spirit of oneness among all Sri Lankans. Additional Secretary to the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry R. Ravindran, Director General Prasath R. Kerath, Additional Director G. Gopinath and Batticaloa District Director Planning R. Nedunchelian participated.
