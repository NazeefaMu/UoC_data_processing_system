India vs Sri Lanka first Twenty20 International today
Skipper Thisara Perera confident of bouncing back

CUTTACK, Tuesday: Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera insisted that his side would look to “flush out” the negativity following heavy defeats in the preceding Tests and ODIs and is confident of a comeback in the Twenty20 International series.
Sri Lanka lost the Test series 1-0 that was followed by the one-dayers which the visitors lost 2-1 against India. Sri Lanka caught India unawares with a surprise bowling effort in the first One-day International, but could not capitalise on the momentum.
As the long tour enters its final leg, both teams are looking to shift to T20 mode.
“It was a bad ODI series but we have to take good things from the first match. There were a lot of positives. We have to flush out the negatives. It's a new series and we hope to start well,” Perera said on the eve of the Twenty20 International series opener at the Barabati Stadium.
“We have good talents, death bowlers, power hitters. We will do our best tomorrow (Wednesday). I've to give more confidence to the young players. I don't think they have pressure, they have to give 100 per cent. Personally I know they have good mindset and they can come very strongly.”
“We got a good start but then we didn't execute our plans, that's the main reason why we lost. It won't happen again and again. It was a one-off game,” Perera said two days after India bounced back through spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav.
India have rested many of their main team players, including skipper Virat Kohli and Perera said: “We don't think about just one player. We are concentrating on playing our game. I want to play my natural game.”
Tharanga attacked the Indian bowling en route his 82-ball 95 and Perera gave credit to their batting coach Thilan Samaraweera.
“He made some technical changes which was the main reason to his success. I've to thank our batting coach.”
Sri Lanka trained in the morning session but the team think tank sent a few players in the evening to check on dew.
“With a 7pm start, both teams will have to deal with dew. We have to look for a good start and build pressure. The main target is to get 150-plus.”
With the Test and ODI series in pocket, India will aim for another dominant performance and look to bag the T20 series as well. Without the services of skipper Virat Kohli, India did not have a dream start to their ODI series campaign at Dharamsala but bounced back in style as stand-in skipper Sharma took the attack to the opposition with his fearless batting.
However, Twenty20 is a different ball game and India would look for a smooth transition to the shortest format, having endured a batting disaster in the first one-dayer.
India do not have a happy memory of the solitary Twenty20 International at the Barabati Stadium. The Men in Blue had folded for 92 against South Africa in 2015 as crowd trouble brought infamy to the venue.
India lead Sri Lanka 7-4 on head-to-head count and are yet to lose against them in the last four outings, the hosts will aim to give a better account of their batting.
The T20 squad will also see different players in action. Saurashtra left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who last played in a T20I against Zimbabwe in June last year, has been recalled and India have three first-timers in Washington Sundar, Basil Thampi and Deepak Hooda.
