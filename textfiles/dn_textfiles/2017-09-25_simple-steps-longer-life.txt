Simple steps for a longer life

Many of us resolve to make dramatic health improvements, such as joining the gym or giving up an addiction. But some of the most dramatic changes we can make are incredibly simple.
Here are some easy steps that really will make a difference to your life.
Floss
Flossing at least twice a day is essential to prevent decay. Very few people floss, putting themselves at risk of life-threatening diseases such as mouth cancer and heart disease.
Have your eyes tested
A thorough eye test is a health check that can detect underlying conditions that leave you predisposed to sight loss. So get your eyes tested at least every two years.
Eat ‘good’ bacteria
‘Good’ bacteria or probiotics are essential for our digestive health and helping the immune system to work. In certain circumstances, for example prolonged use of antibiotics or a severe bout of vomiting or diarrhoea, the gut is stripped of its good bacteria.
One of the best sources of probiotics is natural yoghurt.
Take a cholesterol test
Coronary heart disease is the biggest killer. Everyone over 40 should know their cholesterol level and then aim to reduce it.
Stop slouching
Better posture is the single most effective weapon against chronic back problems. Simply stopping your slouch habit at your desk and not lugging around heavy bags can make a huge difference.
Switch to unsalted butter
The recommended amount of salt per day is 6g, but most of us routinely consume around 9g.
Cutting your salt intake by one teaspoon a day can halve your risk of coronary heart disease.
Eat a can of sardines a week
Omega 3 fatty acids in oily fish (such as sardines, tuna and herring) play an important part in the development of the central nervous system - and in countering a range of conditions including heart disease and Alzheimer’s.
Reduce your waistline
A recent study found that people who had the biggest tummies were 40 per cent more likely to suffer from a heart attack, and that the waistline was a better indication of health than your Body Mass Index.
Women should have a waistline of less than 31.5 inches and men 37 inches.
Stop making plans
Live for the moment. When people reflect on the past and make plans for the future, if you have too many regrets or set yourself unachievable goals, you’ll end up disappointed.
