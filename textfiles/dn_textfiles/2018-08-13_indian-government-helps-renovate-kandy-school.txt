Indian government helps renovate Kandy school

To commence the construction of new buildings at the Saraswathy Central College in Pusselawa, Kandy, a foundation stone-laying ceremony was conducted with the participation of Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu on August 10.
State Education Minister V. Radhakrishnan and Central Province Agriculture and Tamil Education Minister M. Rameshwaran participated in the event as well and laid foundation stones along with the Indian High Commissioner.
Several other Members of Parliament, provincial councillors, senior government officials, the school principal and teachers as well as present and past students of the college were present.
The renovation of the college is being carried out using a grant of Rs.96 million from the Government of India. The new buildings will accommodate science laboratories, lecture halls and teachers’ quarters. The project also involves the renovation of existing buildings, including parapet and retaining walls, provision of offices, ICT equipment and furniture, as well as the renovation of the school playground.
The project is a continuation of the Indian Government's efforts to partner with the Government of Sri Lanka in people-oriented development projects, especially in the field of Education, including construction and upgradation of schools, provision of IT and science laboratory equipment to schools, organising English language programmes as well as other training programmes, apart from granting scholarships to Sri Lankan students to pursue their studies in Sri Lanka and in India.
India’s overall commitment of development assistance to Sri Lanka currently stands at a total of around US$3 billion, out of which US$550 million is pure grant assistance.
