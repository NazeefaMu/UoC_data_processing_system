SLMA proposes for committee to discuss Medical Ordinance

The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) yesterday proposed that a committee comprising all stakeholders be set up to facilitate the consideration and identification of issues pertaining to the Medical Ordinance and propose solutions in a timely manner.
“The SLMA is willing to provide a facilitator forum for the function of the proposed committee,” the SLMA in a statement said.
The Association, clarifying its position on the current situation pertaining to the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggested to ensure continuity of the functions of the SLMC to provide academic, professional and ethical leadership to the medical, dental and other healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka.
The full statement:
“As the apex professional medical association representing all grades of doctors in both the state and private sector in Sri Lanka, the SLMA is concerned about the current situation in the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
We note that the current situation prevalent in the SLMC is not an isolated event or incident but a culmination of a series of events and processes occurring over a period of time. These have had their origins in the interpretation and implementation of the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105).
The SLMA notes the following;
1. The primary purpose and duty of the Medical Ordinance and the Sri Lanka Medical Council established under it is to act and protect the interests of the Sri Lankan public.
2. The Medical Ordinance also regulates the academic, professional and ethical standards of medical practitioners, dentists and other healthcare professionals.
3. The present composition of the SLMC as per the current ordinance consists exclusively of medical practitioners other than one member representing the dental profession. This may have led to a misperception that adequate action is not been taken against medical professionals alleged to have committed offences.
While self-regulation of professionals through regulatory professional bodies is most desirable, such self-regulation should not be in the self-interest of the professionals but should be in the interest of the general public and the healthcare system.
In this context, the SLMA is of the view that the composition of the SLMC needs revision to protect the interest of the Sri Lankan public while preserving professional self-regulation and the efficiency of the healthcare system.
In light of the recent development, the SLMA suggests the following;
a. Ensure continuity of the functions of the SLMC to provide academic, professional and ethical leadership to the medical, dental and other healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka.
b. Review the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105) to ensure (a) with a specific focus on the composition of the SLMC.
To achieve the above, we propose that a Committee comprising all stakeholders be set up to facilitate the consideration and identification of the issues pertaining to the Medical Ordinance and propose solutions in a timely manner. The SLMA is willing to provide a facilitator forum to the functioning of the proposed Committee.”
