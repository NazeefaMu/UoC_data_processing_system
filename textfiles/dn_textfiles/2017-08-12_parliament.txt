Govt. repeals two legislations under Judicature Act
The Government yesterday, repealed the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill and Regulations under the Judicature Act.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament that the two pieces of legislation would be withdrawn.
The Bill to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act was presented on May 25, to make provisions to ensure the rights of an Attorney-at-Law who represents a person held in police custody.
Regulations under the Judicature Act states that all prosecutions, proceedings or matters in respect of offences under the Atomic Energy Act must be taken up only in the Colombo High Court.
Both legislations come under the purview of Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
Samurdhi allowance will not be slashed:SB
The Minister of Social Empowerment S B Dissanayake, assured that the Samurdhi allowance would not be slashed.
He made this observation yesterday, responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on Thursday, with regard to matters which drove the House into chaos on Thursday.
"The Government has decided to adopt a multi dimensional poverty survey to select Samurdhi recipients. Under this system, marks would be given to all potential recipients. Marks are given for the properties they own and the level of education of children. Accordingly, recipients who own less than 10 cows, 20 goats, 50 cockerels and who does not have appliances such as TVs and radios, would get more marks," the minister said. This he said, is a globally accepted system.
Deputy Minister Nimal Lansa said government should not create a mess with slashing the Samurdhi allowance.
He said the Samurdhi allowance of families which consist of a child who has passed the Ordinary Level Examination should not be cut.
Minister Dissanayake said the government would not cut the Samurdhi allowance of families who had a child who has passed the Ordinary Level Examination. He added that only one mark of the 100 would be cut if there was a child who has passed the O/L examination.
'Why were not former CB Governor and sister summoned before PCoI'?
The UNP backbenchers yesterday, questioned as to why former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal or his sister Shiromi Wickremasinghe were not yet summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry(PCoI) on the bond issue.
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe speaking at the Parliamentary debate yesterday, pointed out that the PCoI would need the help of informed advisors as it has so far failed to summon the most relevant witnesses.
Cabraal’s sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe was a director at Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. The names of former CB Governor Cabraal and his sister have also been implicated in the Treasury bonds allegations.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara bolstering Marasinghe’s position, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was the Finance Minister when the PTL was set up, should also be summoned before the PCoI if former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was summoned.
“Those in the AG Department have not been able to verify the signature of the former Defence Minister for two long years.
How can we believe in their competency to handle these investigations? A large number of files have been sent to the AG's Department after the completion of investigations. The AG's Department should expedite investigations into them,” Prof Marasinghe charged.
“We urge the Attorney General’s Department to do justice in their investigations. If not, they would fail to deliver what people expect from them,” the MP added.
