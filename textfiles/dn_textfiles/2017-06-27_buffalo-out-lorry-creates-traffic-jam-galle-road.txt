Buffalo out from lorry creates traffic jam on Galle Road

A pandimonium reigned for about one hour on the Galle Road at Kaluwamodera in Alutgama on Sunday when a buffalo jumped on to the road from a lorry which was transporting bufferloes. The public proceeding along the road ran helter-skelter obstructing traffic.
Police rushed and control the bufferlo with the help of the public. The animal was taken to the Alutgama police station and tethered. A police motorcycle and several other vehicles were damaged. Alutgama police are investigating,
