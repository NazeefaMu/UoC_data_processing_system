AIA inspires students to study insurance

AIA Insurance congratulates Uresha Sharangi who topped the batch for the degree in Insurance and Valuation from the Wayamba University.
Wayamba University of Sri Lanka is the only Campus in the country to offer a Degree in Insurance and Valuation. Nine years ago, AIA partnered with the University to recognize the best amongst the best in Insurance studies and since then, AIA has been presenting a scholarship every year to the student with the most outstanding academic performance in the Department of Insurance and Valuation.
This year’s winner of the AIA Scholarship for Excellence in Insurance Studies is a final year student, Uresha Sharangi, who will receive a monthly study allowance with a six-month internship programme at AIA Sri Lanka.
AIA’s Director HR, Thushari Perera, presented Uresha with a Certificate in recognition of her outstanding academic performance last week and congratulated her on behalf of the company. She said in this regard, “AIA is dedicated to encouraging academic excellence, especially when it is related to insurance studies. We’re happy to extend an internship at AIA Sri Lanka that will expand her horizon in insurance and pave the way for rapid upward mobility in her career.”
Uresha thanked AIA for this recognition and opportunity, saying “I look forward to my experience at Asia’s leading Insurer, which I am sure will be invaluable in terms of learning and hands-on experience that will give my career a great boost.” Uresha’s family along with the senior lecturers from the university joined in congratulating her on this momentous occasion.
