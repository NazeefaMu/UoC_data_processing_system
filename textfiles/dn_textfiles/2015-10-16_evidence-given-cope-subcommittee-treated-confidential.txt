Central Bank Treasury bond issue
'Evidence given before COPE Subcommittee treated as confidential'

The evidence given before the COPE Subcommittee to look into the controversy surrounding the Central Bank Treasury bond issue was treated as confidential, Parliament Assistant Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera said.
Speaking to the Daily News, she said the information revealed during the COPE Subcommittee Sittings and the people who gave evidence before it were not divulged to any outside party as its report did not come out officially.
"There was no official report, but only a draft. The content of it remains secret until it is tabled before the House. According to the Parliamentary Privileges Act, all documents and oral witnesses given before a Committee can not be revealed unless an official report comes out," she said.
However, she did not rule out the chance of certain information pertaining to it leaking out, stating that it was all beyond their control.
Meanwhile, it was reported that Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake had informed the Government that no information pertaining to the sittings of the Subcommittee was given to any external party.
He had made this observation following an inquiry by the Government. The Government has initiated the inquiry following the charge levelled by UPFA Opposition MPs that the Central Bank Officers, who had given evidence before the COPE Subcommittee, had been transferred.
