Thambuttegama water project protesters granted bail

Fifty one persons arrested and remanded in connection to the protest in Thambuttegama over a water supply project, were granted bail by the Thambuttegama Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
Following the protest, 51 persons, including the President of the Rajanganaya Unified Farmers’ Association, were arrested and remanded until yesterday.
A large group of people held a protest at Thambuttegama town on February 28 blocking the Kurunegala -Anuradhapura road and later they pelted stones at the Police.
Later, 51 protesters were arrested for causing damage to public property, unruly behaviour and holding the protest despite a court order.
Meanwhile, Anuradhapura District Secretary R. M. Wanninayake told the media recently that a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend the drinking water supplying project in Thambuttegama following the protest by farmers.
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials emphasized that this project was implemented with the bona fide intention of providing clean potable water to the people in the area where a high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases was reported.
Government authorities emphasised that the water project will not affect the water released to cultivations from the Rajanganaya tank.
