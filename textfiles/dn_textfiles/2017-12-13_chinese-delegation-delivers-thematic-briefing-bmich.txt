Chinese delegation delivers thematic briefing at BMICH

The President of the Sri Lanka – China Friendship Association, Ananda Goonatilleke, warmly welcomed to Sri Lanka the visiting Chinese delegation headed by Deputy Minister Wang Yajun, a high ranking personality of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Vice Minister Wang arrived in Sri Lanka to deliver a thematic briefing at the BMICH today, on the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which concluded on October 24 this year. During the past few days he also visited Bangladesh and Pakistan where he made presentations on the importance of the recent CPC Congress.
As the people and the intelligentsia of Sri Lanka are very keen to understand the latest political developments in China, this briefing would definitely be timely. The nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of China, demarcated principles and guidelines for the next five years and hailed General Secretary Xi Jinping’s thoughts on Socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
The Report of the Congress ensures the international community that no matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony and engage in expansion.
Wang Yajun, comparatively a younger leader who is 49 this December, served as a leading diplomat in Belgium, France, European Union, and held several high positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was also the Director General of the Policy Research Bureau of Foreign Affairs Office of the Party Central Committee.
