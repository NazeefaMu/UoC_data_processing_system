Bangladesh ready for massive foreign investment

The confidence of foreign investors in Bangladesh has increased, as the country has taken a series of measures to: build up investment-friendly infrastructure; develop the energy sector; provide necessary facilities and support to set up industries; and simplify rules and regulations.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the country has almost tripled during ruling Awami League’s nine years in office.
Central bank data shows Bangladesh received $961 million in fiscal year 2008-09, while FDI inflow increased to $2,454.81 million in FY16-17. The country received $2,607 million’s-worth of foreign investment from July to May in FY17-18, according to the latest data of Bangladesh Bank (BB).
According to economists, stakeholders, and regulators, Bangladesh has been able to attract the increasing amount of FDI thanks to consistent policy support from the government.
In his budget speech in June, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said that the government has seriously reviewed failures to attract FDI and taken steps to identify the obstacles, as well as take necessary action, to overcome them.
He said, “I firmly believe that with the ushering in of a stable and advanced economy after 2015 we were able to attract more foreign investment.”
He mentioned: the introduction of the One-Stop Service, performing well in the Ease of Doing Business Indicator, establishing the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), and the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA)—as a part of developing an environment for investment.
“One of the pre-conditions for rapid economic development is increased investment. We are gradually increasing public investment. However, the purpose of this investment is to create an investment-friendly environment for the private sector as well as attract foreign direct investment,” he said.
The availability of electricity, gas and water connections, timely processing of investment proposals, availability of undisputed land, etc., play a crucial role in attracting investment, said the finance minister adding, “We have enacted a number of laws and regulations to make these services easily available to the investors.”
