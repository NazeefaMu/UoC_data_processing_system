Has SLC lost the plot on Chandimal’s alleged ball tampering?

Having viewed the purported footage released by ICC of Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal’s alleged ball tampering during the 2nd Sri Lanka – West Indies Test match, it would appear there is MERIT in the allegation.
This does no credit to this country and is reflective of what is happening in the wider arena of its governance. Nevertheless this must be viewed in the context of current realities which apply to this allegation which include:
Over a long period of time no one in authority in the ICC has objected to players (i) applying saliva on the cricket ball during matches (ii) having eatables in the mouth which could include sweets. Under the circumstances, why has ICC selectively cherry picked on Chandimal applying saliva on the ball even if it is after allegedly having a “sweet” in his mouth?
It is now reported that Chandimal has been found Guilty of ball tampering by Michael Beloff, QC - Chairman, ICC Code of Conduct Commission.
I suggest that SLC:
1) Appeal to the ICC to forthwith rescind the finding of guilt on the basis of current realities.
2) Urge ICC to forthwith ban (i) applying of saliva on the cricket ball at all matches (ii) Spitting on the ground during matches. This should be done at least for reasons of hygiene and decorum.
It is puzzling that ICC is tolerating such practice.
Being neither a cricket nor legal expert but merely a lover of the game, I seek the views of knowledgeable persons whether Sri Lanka Cricket by and large not known for its professionalism or integrity has lost the plot in its approach to the alleged ball tampering charge against Chandimal?
