‘Aan Devathai’

Filmmaker Thamira made his directorial debut with the film ‘Rettai Suzhi’ following which after a long hiatus is back with the film ‘Aan Devathai’.
The film features Samuthirakani and Ramya Pandian of Joker fame in lead roles. With the film hitting screens on October 5, filmmaker Thamira says, ‘The film has come out decently well!
I see this film as a reflection of the present society and its people.
The movie depicts the trials and tribulations as to how the people of the current generation and even the future generation are subjected to due to factors such as globalization.
A film can achieve success in two different ways. In the first place, it follows the existing successful formula and wins.
In the 2nd category, the film attempts something unique, different from the usual tend, and thus becomes a new trend-setter! So, I am confident that Aan Devathai would be a sure success and will be a trendsetter.”
