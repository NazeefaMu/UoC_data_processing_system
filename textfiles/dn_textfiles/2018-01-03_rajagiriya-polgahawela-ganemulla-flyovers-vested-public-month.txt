Rajagiriya, Polgahawela, Ganemulla flyovers vested in public this month

Newly constructed flyovers in Rajagiriya, Polgahawela and Ganemulla to minimise traffic congestion will be vested in the public this month.
A spokesman from the Higher Education and Highways Ministry said the Rajagiriya flyover would be opened on January 8, the Ganemulla flyover on January 11, and the Polgahawela on January 17.
He said the flyovers were built with Spanish aid under the supervision of the RDA. The new ones were completed within the shortest time possible following the international construction standards, he said.
The flyovers will ease traffic congestion, reduce road delays, minimise accidents, lower the vehicular operational cost and ensure safe and efficient transportation for the people.
The 533-metre long Rajagiriya flyover construction commenced on April 19, 2016 and it cost Rs. 4,514 million. Rajagiriya is the main entry point to the Colombo City and its suburbs, Kollupitiya, Welikada, Nawala and Borella.
A huge traffic congestion was evident during the office hours wasting man hours of working people, loosing billions of rupees of income to the Gross National Product, he said.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover cost Rs.2,203 million. It will greatly benefit Polgahawela and Kurunagala (A 19) road users.
The town is the entry point to a number of cities.
It comprises a two-lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side. The 504-meter long Ganemulla flyover cost Rs 1,768 million. Around 87 trains travelling to and from Colombo, Badulla, Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomolee, Mannar and Batticaloa pass the Ganemulla railway station causing the closure of the rail gates as frequently as 90 times per day resulting severe traffic congestions. "After the flyovers are commissioned, the long standing problem will be resolved," he said.
