After the ideas and views of the peoples’ representatives were obtained, it would be presented for public discussion too.
“Let alone a new Constitution, even a Constitutional Bill had been formulated up to now. The Steering Committee report included features like the nature of the state, devolution of power, the Executive Presidency, the system of the Prime Minister, system of elections and other ideas and views. When it was debated it may crate understanding as well as various other views” the Prime Minitser said.
“A Constitution should be formulated in a manner that would protect the unitary status of the country, unite all communities, give pride of place to Buddhism and create a background for Sinhala Buddhists as well as others to live without fear or suspicion,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added. The Prime Minister said the President and he would never act without the agreement and approval of the people.
