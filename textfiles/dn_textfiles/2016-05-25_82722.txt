Next govt. should be a SLFP government- Dilan

 
 The next government should be a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)government and everyone should work toward creating a SLFP government, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
To achieve this goal, the SLFP should win the next local government election.. The success of the next local government election will send a message to the public that the SLFP is strong and to create a winning attitude.
The Minister was addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday in Colombo. Even though the persons, who do not know arithmetic say that a SLFP government could be formed based on the last general election result those with a clear mind-set know that the SLFP was not mandated to form a SLFP government. However, the SLFP was tactful not to let the UNP to form a government by creating a coalition government, he said.
Perera further said that the SLFP is launched on a winning path. With passing of the 19th amendment to the Constitution neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor Chandrika Kumarathunga can contest the next Presidential election. Maithripala Sirisena has also stressed that he would not contest again.
“I’m ready to contest if I am informed earlier. As ab media friendly person I believe that I am suitable for contesting the next Presidential election” he said.
He added that this is the last chance to change the election system and implement a people friendly constitution. This can only be done when having a cordial rapport among political parties and within the SLFP.
“This is the last bus to change the election system and implement a people friendly constitution. Once these two targets are achieved,there is no use of being in this government anymore” he said.
When questioned what will be the future of this coalition government, The State Minister said that this government may end up in two years once the agreement period is over.
When asked if the SLFP would take disciplinary action against those who participated in the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Kirulapona, he said while the Central Committee of the SLFP was currently analysing various reports regarding the Kirulapona rally, the chances of their being disciplinary action taken against them was not high.
