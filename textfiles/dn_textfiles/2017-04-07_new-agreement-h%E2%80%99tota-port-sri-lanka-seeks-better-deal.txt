New agreement on H’tota port: Sri Lanka seeks better deal

Discussions are being held to reduce the 99 year lease of the Hambantota port. A new agreement will be signed within this month, MP Nalin Bandara said.
He was speaking at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
Bandara said the initiative taken by the government to reduce the lease from 99 years was the reason to delay the singing of the agreement.
He said Sri Lanka will not lose control over the security of the port.
“The government, ports authority, police and navy has the responsibility of the port. The presence of the Chinese at the port won’t be a threat to the security. A Sri Lankan attached to the ports authority will be appointed as the Harbour Master," he said.
Bandara said no discussions were held before signing an agreement during the former regime. The government wants to increase Sri Lanka’s stake in the port deal.
MP Mujibur Rahman said the government is having discussions with China Merchants to reduce China’s stake in the Hambantota port.
He said the agreement will be presented to Parliament once it is finalised.
