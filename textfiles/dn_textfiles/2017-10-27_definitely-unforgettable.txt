Definitely unforgettable!

In 2011 they broke the barrier and their dream came true when they were victorious at the All Island Shakespeare drama festival organized by YMCA in collaboration with the Rotary Club of Colombo. Dramatic Moves features Girl’s High School Kandy whose creativity and innovations, along with their zeal for drama and hard work have made them admirable thespians.
“I need to mention Mrs. Halpe who had helped us a lot. I would also like to thank Anoji Madasekara the subject coordinator for English and Shyamali Pussalla, the teacher in charge of LMD society for their support and encouragement. Our victory took place after 19 years! We bagged almost all of the trophies. We were absolutely elated and over the moon. That was a shining milestone,” said English teacher, Teacher in charge of Junior and Senior Drama, Sumudu Dhanapala.
Dhanapala is mainly involved with the juniors. They are still growing up and are very active according to their age. “When I look at the seniors I remember how they were when they were juniors. I have seen how they have improved year by year up to now. They have their own personalities.
A/L English Literature teacher, Teacher in charge of Shakespeare drama, Shyana Naseem said that it was mainly the hard work put in by the girls that has produced favorable results. She stated that they are very active and practice makes perfect. The girls have had their ups and downs but have taken it all in their stride.
“Our girls are remarkably versatile writing their own scripts. In 2014, Dhakshika Wijesekara wrote the script for the play the ‘Company’ which came all island 1st. I definitely think that drama makes personalities. It develops speech and rhetoric. You learn posture. Definitely it contributes to all spheres of student life in school. I have seen with my own eyes, children changing. You learn to face rivalry and opposition. Drama I feel is essential,” said Naseem.
Naseem stressed that what these girls learn and what they achieve have an influence on their university entrance. It is education at its best, education that can be obtained by doing drama.
“The girls are very good at doing their own thing – costumes and lighting. One thing Professor and Mrs. Halpe taught us was not to be too extravagant with the costumes and props. So we have had to adapt at some competitions which required minimal props. And we had to have something good and simple. Mrs. Halpe really taught us a lot. They advocated local attire because they said that Shakespeare is universal,” pointed out Naseem.
Naseem also pointed out that there is such a thing as the hot-seat! Where one girl has to get into character while the other thespians question her! She is given an opportunity to get into her role. They question her and she responds. If she is Bassanio, they ask her questions about Bassanio and get her to be Bassanio. They touch on very personal thing such as his likes and dislikes and tastes! They touch on his attitudes. That is called the Hot-seat!
Friendships for life

Literature, Music and Drama Society, President Sayuri Mohotti, said Anne of Green Gables is definitely unforgettable to her. In fact they won the all island first place. It was very memorable because most of the actresses were students in the same class.
The girls did Merchant of Venice in 2016. Shakespeare fans would remember the vengeful Shylock demanding his pound of flesh and the extremely intelligent Portia. The irony of the play and the outrage of Shylock are so enthralling. It certainly is a play where right or wrong is not in black and white but there is a grey area, the reviled shylock seeking his justice for how shabbily he is treated in society.
“In most of our dramas at Girls’ High School we are very independent. Last year we did Merchant of Venice for Shakespeare (2016). At first I must say that I had stage fright. But my years of doing drama have tempered me. And now I am able to go up on stage and face the audience. Drama can help a young girl a lot. I have learnt a lot of patience because doing drama means everyone has something to say. I have made new friends from all age groups. All these friendships are friendships for life,” said Mohotti.
The last scene in Bernarda Alba made her very emotional because there was such sadness in the play.
Overwhelmed by emotion

Shakespeare Drama cast member, Samadhi Kasthuriarachchi started her drama career in grade five. She is extremely experienced at drama having seen it take place at college.
“It has been a great privilege for me doing drama at Girls High School because the amount of information you gather and the amount of experiences you receive, it is mind blowing. What you learn stays with you. It makes you a better person. I have worked with my akki’s and they have taught me a lot,” said Kasthuriarachchi.
Both Kasthuriarachchi and Mohotti took part in the Merchant of Venice and found it challenging because the language is different. Portraying Shylock needs an extra effort since Shylock is the focus of the drama. The teacher in charge and the girls all agreed that Shylock is a difficult role to enact. Not only is he a male but a complicated male at that!
“I was also very timid and shy and drama gave me the opportunity to interact with people. We get to know people more when getting involved in drama. During certain performances some scenes have made me cry. Our girls were so good at one drama it made me cry. They were the older batch and they were that good! We have had girls overwhelmed by emotion before dramas,” said Kasthuriarachchi.
Practices can be tedious but it is very educative because of the camaraderie and because the teachers always try and inspire the girls. Both girls agreed that initially it is hard because you need to learn the lines.
When it came to Shakespeare the language is different so they had to constantly ask their teachers for the meanings. You cannot act if you do not know the lines. The Shakespearean characters are different from people you might meet today even though you do see these characters in society. You get plenty of Romeo and Juliet’s in life.
Both girls have dreams of becoming lawyers. They have the ability to address a crowd and have become more observant than they were before.
