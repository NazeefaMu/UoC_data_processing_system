Government set example for selfish politicians: Thalatha

“Soon after establishing the ‘Yahapalana Government ‘, we eliminated hypocritical attitude from politics and set an example for selfish politicians,” Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
She was participating at a reception accorded to her by United National Party supporters and residents of Eheliyagoda at the Eheliyagoda PS Auditorium recently.
Minister Atukorale received blessings of the Maha Sangha at the Eheliyagoda Sri Madarasingharamaya Temple before attending the reception.
She said she has to handle two different ministries but she was committed to perform her duties honestly for the well-being of the people and the country.
“A group of narrow-minded persons say that the government did nothing for the past two years. Establishing peace and harmony throughout the country and taking steps to re-build the nation that the government committed in the past two years is admired by the citizens,” she said.
She said previous regime allowed their henchmen to cheat people and earn money.
“We will provide 10,000 land deeds for the landless and we are now paving the way to provide more and more employment opportunities for the youth and to supply electricity for the needy citizens,” Atukorale said.
She said garbage disposal issue in the Ehiliyagoda town would be resolved very soon and another land would be allocated from the Beruwana Estate in this regard.
Iddamalgoda Denagamuwa Viharadhipathi Ven. Pohorabawe Wimalatissa Thera, Sabargamuwa Provincial Councillors Siripala Kiriella, Nimal Wijenaike and K.L.Ratnaike spoke.
