Many incidents mistakenly perceived as religious or ethnic violence: PM
Some incidents which had taken places of worship and business institutions during the recent past had mistakenly perceived to be incidents of ethnic and religious violences, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made this observation yesterday, in response to a question raised by MP S M Marikar during the round of questions to be raised from the Premier.
He also said that there had been instances where some business establishments had caught fire due to power leakages and due to accidents, though perceived to be burnt by extremist forces. The Premier further said there were few incidents where one of two persons had set fire to a few shops. The Premier added that those who had been behind those incidents have been already arrested.
“There have been no state patronage to these incidents as it was during the previous regime,” he said.
“Those incidents increased during the previous regime as there was state patronage to those incidents. Even now, there are some persons who try to spread ethnic and religious hatred. We should beware of those forces and people. Those who had lost power are doing so.” The Premier also said that the government would take steps against such persons and nobody need to protect them. “Some sections in the media too are spreading ethnic and religious hatred,” the Prime Minister further said.
He said there are others who use extremists to gain political power. He assured that the government would never move away from its responsibility of bringing about reconciliation.
The premier further informed

Tense situation at question time
A heated argument erupted yesterday between the government side members and JVP Parliamentarians during the round of questions for oral answers on the appointment of persons other than public representatives to the Chairmen and Co-chairmen to the District and Divisional Coordinating Committees in Parliament yesterday.
The tense situation erupted while the Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Nalinda Jayathissa from the Prime Minister and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister. The JVP MP inquired the names and designations of persons who are holding positions of Chairmen and Co chairmen in the district and divisional coordinating committees that are functioning throughout the country.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that there were 25 District Committees and 331 Divisional Coordinating Committees and tabled the list of names of the Chairmen. He added that there were 82 chairmen and co chairmen who were not public representatives.
Nalinda Jayathissa said that SLFP and UNP organizers who were not members have been appointed as chairmen. “There is no such law that prevents those persons other than public representatives being appointed as chairmen,” Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said.
At this stage Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that there was no issue if they were party committees. “But these are committees to oversee the implementation of the development projects of the government in the respective areas,” JVP MP Dissanayake said. “So public representatives should be appointed to chair those committees.”
At this stage, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said the previous circular had said that public representatives should chair those committees. “But it was amended by including the representatives of the President and Prime Minister could be appointed as the Chairmen and the Co-chairmen,” Minister Abeywardena said. “It was done as the Constitution was decided to be amended and many other reasons. On the other hand if the JVP needs, they could nominate their representatives and we can appoint them as co-chairmen”.
“Those who were defeated at the elections have been appointed as chairmen of those committees,” Anura Dissanayake said. “Some Parliamentarians sit as members of those District and Divisional Coordinating Committees, while those who lost the elections and persons who did not at least contest, chair the committees.”
At this stage Sydney Jayaratne raising a point of order, said the JVP had no right to talk of the scenario as it had appointed persons to Parliament who did not contest at the election leaving aside those who contested at the election.
“It cannot be allowed, It is not a point of order,” observed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
“We have asked the question from the Ministers,” said Anura Kumara Dissanayake. “We know as to how naked women were in the double cab when it collided. How does an MP answer a question.”
“I stopped the point of order,” observed the Speaker.
