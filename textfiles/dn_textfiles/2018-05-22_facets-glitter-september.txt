FACETS to glitter in September

The Gem & Jewelry Industry of Sri Lanka gears for the 28th edition of its premier exhibition, FACETS Sri Lanka 2018, which will be held from August 30 to September 2, 2018 at the BMICH.
This International event is organized by the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association (SLGJA) in collaboration with the National Gem & Jewelry Authority (NGJA) and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB).
Over its 28 year history FACETS has earned itself a slot in the international event calendar as an important gemstone sourcing fair. Foreign visitors looking to source Sri Lankan sapphires also appreciate the availability of a wide array of merchandise from many producing countries under one roof.
The 4-day exhibition will feature everything from exquisités to fashion jewelry. Diamonds, branded watches and other finer luxury creations from our local jewelers will be on display at this all glittering event.
FACETS 2018 will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, who will grace the event.
