Hirdaramani supports  future of Sri Lanka apparel

As an Official Industry Patron at MBFW, Hirdaramani’s emerging leadership talks about the future of Sri Lanka Apparel while lending its resources and expertise to support emerging designers showcasing at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka.
As Sri Lanka’s apparel industry looks to reinvent itself to meet a new fashion future, one of Sri Lanka’s oldest and most respected apparel makers, the Hirdaramani Group, have taken on the challenge of channeling fresh, young energy towards this move.
While the apparel manufacturer still boasts veterans of the industry to guide the business, at the helm of the company today is the next generation of leaders, bringing a tide of fresh energy and ideas to the business. Hirdaramani presents the perfect balance of seasoned expertise and new influencers ready to disrupt traditional thinking. It is the future-forward thinking of the company and the synergy between this and the core theme of MBFW that led to the partnership between the two. The Hirdaramani legacy began in the 1890's and has steadily grown into a multimillion dollar apparel manufacturing businessthat has diversified into a global conglomerate.
Representing this next generation for the company and Sri Lanka apparel as a whole, Aroon Hirdaramani, Director of Hirdaramani, was part of a key panel discussion on the future of the industry at the South Asian Apparel Leadership Forum held as part of the weeklong event. Aroon is also part of the JAAF future leaders committee and frequently represents Sri Lanka Apparel at global forums as part of his position with JAAF.
Simultaneously, the Hirdaramani Group has also lent its support to channel young fashion energy on the runways of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka. Collaborating with AOD— the country’s best known private fashion educator, Hirdaramani powered the cutting-edge collections of several young fashion designers who were showcased at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka runways.
Shehani de Silva, Oshini Perera and Ishara Jayathilake presented their fresh fashion collections that were created via Hirdaramani’s superior manufacturing and finishing technology.
Hirdaramani’s patronage to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week reflects this vision to constantly transform, invent and reinvent. With this bold spirit that embraces the power of fresh talent and young thinking, Hirdaramani promises to be one of Sri Lanka’s leading fashion makers of tomorrow.
