A bid to defang dengue

Talavou Allailima founder of Power World is a strong man of muscle, yet not even he could prevent the silent killer, the angel of death from biting all three of his sons. Allailima nearly lost all three of his sons to this menace, but through the grace of god as Allailima puts it, all three recovered. How secure are you that your loved ones will survive this menace? For Allailima this is a personal vendetta against Dengue. He has started a campaign to wipe this menace out of Sri Lanka for good.
Promoter Death to Dengue Campaign and Founder Power World, Talavou Allailima, said we in Sri Lanka face challenging times. Allailima stressed that now is the opportune moment to strike with all our strength.
“The message I have for you today is very important and needs to be carried across Colombo and the nation of Sri Lanka. I want to complete this mission that we all have in mind. This must be the end game. Dengue has weakened. Last year we did a campaign in August when it was at its peak. In January it was supposed to peak but it did not.
The enemy is weak and we must hit it harder and end this. You do not realize how horrible Dengue is until your child is affected badly. My baby at the age of five months got Dengue. The doctors told me that there was a 90 percent chance that I would lose my baby boy. Because of God’s grace the worst that could happen did not happen. My boy came out of it. At the same time my other son was in Nawaloka hospital fighting for his life. These experiences really shook me. I then wrote an article called ‘Beating Dengue’ which went Viral. I basically spelt out the steps we need to take to prevent dengue and steps to beat Dengue if the child gets Dengue. I was interviewed on it. Some schools handed it over to parents as a hand out. People have walked up to me and thanked me for the article saying the article had helped,” said Allailima.
Allailima said there is a plan right now with a few initiatives that need to be implemented. These initiatives have been thought through thoroughly since last August.
“I have spoken to a lot of people about how to beat Dengue. I have spoken with all kinds of experts. In addition to spraying from helicopters, they have tried different methods to beat Dengue. What really works? What really helps beat Dengue? The result of my conversations was that the best method was the neighborhood taking the responsibility for their neighborhood. And that is what nations have done to bring Dengue to minimal levels. So how do you get the neighborhood committed? How do you sustain the interest to continuously clean up Colombo and keep the Dengue problem at bay? We needed to come up with not only a program that will get the neighborhood involved but one that will be successful – a dengue free zone in the neighborhood. How do you keep people hooked right through the year every single week? So the initiatives have been planned with those ideas in mind. Hopefully in the next three weeks by July 28 we will have at least 5,000 neighborhood leaders in place, so that when the cleaning takes place on the 28, the whole community and most of Colombo will get together to clean their area and neighborhood,” explained Allailima.
Former Commander of Army General Daya Ratnayake, Promoter Death to Dengue Campaign, with his insights on the battlefield commented that we must completely crush this enemy that is dengue.
“Dengue is not only Sri Lanka’s enemy it has a reputation around the world and is recognized as a fearful disease. One problem is that when Dengue weakens, we tend to relax, discontinue our efforts and lose focus on the need to eliminate it completely. So we need to re-organize. On the battlefield when engaging the enemy, we must annihilate the enemy and do so in such a way that the enemy cannot recover. We must become an example to other countries when destroying Dengue. Our weapon must be that of spreading awareness. In our battle against the LTTE we used land, air and sea power. It was a combination. These initiatives are very promising and we can win this battle against Dengue,” said Ratnayake.
Provincial Director of Health Services, Dr. Anil Samaranayake, commented that he is fully aware of the difficulty of the task that we are all faced with.
“As a public sector we have come a long way but the journey is not over. To reach the end we have to join hands with the other organizations. From the beginning I believe in the multi-sectoral approach because the mosquito born viruses change. You won’t believe how fast the viruses change. It is a real problem for us as doctors. I, as a doctor, I am open to any idea. We even encourage any idea when it comes to mosquito traps. If there is any efficiency I am for it. That is a principle I follow, so I totally support Talavou’s ideas. We have to change our strategies. I am impressed by these new initiatives. These APPS are very exciting in my opinion,” said Samaranayake.
Additional Secretary to the President, Nalaka Kaluweva, said there is a great need for these kind of initiatives.
“I wish to congratulate Allailima for his bold and refreshing initiatives. From the point of view of the Presidential Secretariat this should indeed be a multi-sectoral approach. The government cannot do this alone. We cannot combat this kind of menace alone. Last year we had a very bad period with the Dengue Epidemic. During that period as a government we had a lot of programs and recorded many successes also. But again if the government stands alone they cannot win this war against Dengue. We need support from the civil society, private sector and all the stake holders.
These initiatives proposed can really help us eradicate this problem. Getting the active support of the private sector is not that easy. So we need everyone to join hands with each other and finally bring about an end to this problem. So I feel very encouraged from what I am hearing today, and from the governments’ side we really endorse this,” said Kaluweva.
Executive Committee Member Death to Dengue Campaign, Priyanath Peiris spoke of this campaign to wipe out Dengue as the vision of Talavou Allailima.
“This is a needy cause that all of us face in this country and it affects all of us regardless of whatever background we all come from. Last year we saw an attempt being made to clean up Dengue breeding spots in many parts of the country.
We have planned something much bigger than that this year with the help of the provincial councils. We have invited them to join us. This campaign will go on, until we see no Dengue in this country,” said Peiris.

INITIATIVES PLANNED OUT TO ERADICATE DENGUE
Rapid Response Team
They are planning on positioning Vehicles all over Colombo and in the greater Colombo area. These are positioned so that when a patient enters hospital, immediately the information goes to the vehicle and the vehicle goes to treat that area where the person came from. So they need to set up these rapid response teams. They are working with certain companies. They have some commitments saying that they will be given a vehicle for a year. These vehicles will be positioned with people who can treat. So they have invited organizations to step in and join them. They have also developed an APP. The hospital clicks the APP, the information travels to the vehicle and the vehicle takes off. The rapid response will work in that way.
Developing a Child Friendly Leaflet
This needs to be handed over to every child in Colombo. Every child will be provided information. If we get the children on board, and if they are able to understand what is needed to keep them safe, we will cover a lot of ground. They will influence the parents to keep these instructions in mind. This will help bring about the protection that is needed. There is a plan to distribute it to 500 children in Colombo and suburbs. The target date for the Death to Dengue Campaign to take place is July 28 (Saturday).
Introduction of Mosquito Traps to schools
We need to get the more affluent schools to have these traps so the parents who are affluent can invest in this. When children see this protecting their schools, the message will go to their parents. And in turn the parents will try and buy some for their homes. So 20,000 of these traps in these homes will have a mitigating effect in our city. But we now have to settle on which trap works because there are so many out there.
Death to Dengue Campaign will take place on July 28
We will ask the Colombo and Greater Colombo residents to Watsapp an image of the location with the address- what they feel is a dengue hotspot in their vicinity. We will map it (like last August where we covered 150 – 200 locations). On the 28th the Pest Control Companies will go and attend to those areas. They will know if it is really a hotspot or not. And they will address on how to treat it. What the people will do is they will send the information about what they feel threatened about.
The Death to Dengue Mobile App
This is where we really need help. This is what is going to bring everything together. This is the solution to disrupt Dengue. So how it works is that you download the APP like you do any APP. So then you register, you log in, you put in your password and then you set it up. You will also have a profile where you can put your information in, and a profile is built for you. There are actually three objectives of the mobile APP. The first, primary and the most important is the neighborhood takes care of the neighborhood to make it a Dengue Free Zone. Once you have downloaded the APP and your neighbors have downloaded the APP, one person would be designated as the leader. He/she signs up the neighbors who will allow him or her to visit their homes – to see whether there are mosquito breeding sites. So these people will be added into his/her group. So systematically the checking will happen every seven days. The leader is expected to go into each house and see that everything is in order. At the end he will say ‘submit’ and then the Head of the home will get a message saying – ‘your house was checked’. So for that particular home the checking has been done. The owner of the house in turn will respond saying that it was cleaned. So that is how the systematic checking will take place in every neighborhood.
SOS Button
When people go on the road and see a possible mosquito breeding hotspot, there is an SOS button that you can also use in the APP and take a photograph of the location and then hit ‘send’. And when that is sent, that message goes to the closest neighborhood leader asking him if he can handle it. If he can’t handle it the message will go to one of the vehicles. Within a couple of hours the rapid response vehicle will go and check the site. If that does not happen it will be escalated to the central command who will alert the private pest control companies, who will pay a visit to that location. 
The neighborhood stands with each other to build a secure neighborhood
Let’s say a thief jumps into your house at one in the morning. You see the rogue coming but you don’t know what to do. There is a watchman button on the APP. So you press the button if some emergency happens. And that in turn alerts all the houses. So within two minutes you will come to my home. The beeping sound will go on until you switch it off. This is a security function that is there. If someone gets sick and you need help and you are desperate, then you press that button. So it helps a lot since everyone in the family have that APP. We also put a sticker on every gate saying it is a Watchman activated home. So everyone knows that the particular house has the Watchman button. It brings security and protection.
This APP is available on Google Play to be downloaded at this point. APPLE by next Monday, all Apple phones can download this.
