Sugar cane harvesting  season opens amidst  record Rs 1 bn profit

As state owned sugar manufacturing industry reported historic profit levels, Sri Lanka thanked its cane harvesters for their supportive role in unprecedented success heard for the first time in years.
“Thanks to your contribution, today our government owned sugar production industry is earning profits without any need for privatisation,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said in Buttala.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration event of sugar cane harvesting ceremony of Pelawatte Sugar Industries owned by Lanka Sugar Company (LSCL) under his Ministry.
“We start another round of sugarcane harvesting today. For years, similar harvesting ceremonies have been taking place but local sugar production was incurring losses and likelihood of privatisation has been in the air,” said Minister Bathiudeen.
This is a state owned business success. I thank you for your contribution and wish for success in your harvesting. Let us build on this trend.
We are producing less than 10% of our annual sugar needs locally and we need to increase this. Meanwhile Maximum Retail Prices (MRP) on sugar sales are not helping our sugar development efforts. I believe removing MRPs can help the sector to be more competitive.”
LSCL reported a Rs one billion loss (US $ 6.6 mn) but this trend reversed by September 2016 when LSCL reported a Rs one billion profit (US $ 6.6 Mn) a turnaround not seen in any other Sri Lankan State Owned Business Enterprises in recent times.
