Look like an Egyptian!

Having seen an abundance of the black eyeliner in the form of winged and sexy, smudged, greasy, matte and shiny, this season, it is time for a Cleopatra inspired eyeliner that is super graphic, pointy dramatic, and heavier along the bottom lashes!
We associate this magical style of applying eyeliner with Cleopatra, a woman of such legendary sex appeal and who is still very much present in popular culture today who wasn’t just a beauty, but her presence and charm made her irresistible.
The Egyptian queen still reigns supreme this spring on runway shows, although makeup artists have taken the Cleopatra’s signature look further and made it thicker, bolder and more dramatic than usual.
The key to nailing the Cleopatra liner is bringing the black lines down into sharp points at the inner corners of the eyes to mirror the winged liner on the outer corners.
Wanting more drama?
Draw a straight line along your upper and lower eyelashes. Continue drawing the line on the upper eyelid without stopping at the outer corner of the eye. Give a finishing touch by making the line into a tail accompanied by accentuated eyebrows to acquire the dramatic iconic look.
