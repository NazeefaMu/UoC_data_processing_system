UNP condemns Vijayakala's remarks

The UNP condemned the recent statement by State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran where she claimed there is a huge need for the LTTE in the North and East.
Minister Harin Fernando speaking at Sirikotha yesterday said that it is only a personal statement by the State Minister and not the view of the UNP.
“The Party Chairman has informed that a disciplinary inquiry will be carried out against the State Minister,” Fernando said.
He said that Maheshwaran will address a media briefing on Friday and reveal the reason behind her statement and what she really expected by making such statement.
Both a Hitler from the South and a Prabhakaran from the North will be repudiated by the UNP as they are unwanted, UNP media spokesman Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
