“Floods affect 23 police stations’

Twenty three Police stations were affected by the flood situation in the country, Police Media Spokesman Priyanta Jayakody yesterday said at a media briefing held at the Disaster Management Ministry.
“Documents at the police stations are safe,” he said. The affected police stations are operating from temporary establishments, Police Media Spokesman said.
“Robberies, and assaults and other crimes were not reported from the affected areas - a much better situation in comparison to the tsunami duration in the country,” he said.
