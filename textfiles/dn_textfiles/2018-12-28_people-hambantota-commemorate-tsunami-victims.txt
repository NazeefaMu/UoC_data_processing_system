people in Hambantota commemorate tsunami victims

Hambantota District Secretary Bandula Harischandra said 3,064 locals and 144 foreigners died and 964 disappeared in Hambantota in the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka 14 years ago.
He was addressing the 14th Tsunami Commemoration organised by the Hambantota District Secretariat and the Disaster Management Unit opposite the Hambantota bus stand,
He said he was in the Galle Kachcheri at that time and came to know about the tsunami from a news telecast. Sri Lanka had not experienced such a devastation earlier and there were no plans and facilities in the country to face such a situation. Former USA President Bill Clinton was in a hotel in Sri Lanka when the tsunami hit.
Hambantota ASP Sanath Amarasinha, Hambantota UC Opposition Leader D.A. Gamini and officials were present.
