Students who fail O/L get opportunity to sit A/L

 

The Ministry of Education has decided to give an opportunity to students who have failed the Ordinary Level examination to sit for the Advanced Level examination based on four factors.
The pilot project of this program will start this year.
Under this programme it is expected to develop human resources to suit the new world, develop the technical, vocational and social skills of all children and get them to contribute to the economy of the country.
It is expected to ensure the education rights of the child, develop skills and thereby create a workforce by this program.
The pilot project will be launched next month in 42 schools, states the Education Ministry.
