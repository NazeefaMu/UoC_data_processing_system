Joint proposal to be handed over to President

A set of proposals jointly signed by the Government Medical Officers' Association, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association and the Parents' Union of State Medical Students will be handed over to the President today at 10.30 am at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the document will be released to the media after handing it over to the President.
At the same time, an appointment will be requested from the President to explain the content of the document. Several other trade unions and organizations will join the three main organizations to hand over the document, he said.
This is a historic event where justice is demanded for the SAITM students by all three groups together. The basis of the joint agreement is that all SAITM students be given a state (KDU) or foreign MBBS recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and not an MBBS SAITM which is internationally blacklisted and locally illegal, he added.
