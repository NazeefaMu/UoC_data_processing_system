Elephants invade temple in Agbopura

Wild Elephants attacked the Seenipura Viharaya in Agbopura twice within the last 20 days and caused damage to its Sanghavasa. The pachyderms had broken a window in a bed room and the toilet door during one of the attacks.
Only three Samanera Bhikkhus were present at the time of the latest attack. They managed to alert some dayakas over the mobile phone and get them to bring neighbours to drive away the elephants, Viharadhipathi Ven. Kamburawala Ratanapala Thera said.
He said the rest hall was damaged by the wild elephants during the previous attack. About 93 coconut trees in the vihara compound had also been pulled down by the elephants.
