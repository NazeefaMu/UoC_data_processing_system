‘Construction sector, a major contributor to our economy’

The construction sector is making a major contribution towards the country's economic progress. According to statistics, the construction sector has achieved the second position in the industrial sector in the third quarter of 2017, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
‘‘The construction sector has been making vast strides in projects such as the Colombo International Financial City, Southern Expressway extension, Colombo outer circle highway and Colombo metropolis and suburban housing projects.’’
The Minister was addressing the gathering at the CIDA Awards 2017 ceremony, held at the BMICH, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena recently.
The Minister who said that they hoped to streamline strategies and the legal framework relating to the construction sector through five gazette notifications, added that the national construction policy approved on the initiative of the President and the Prime Minister, had fulfilled a dire need for the progress of the construction sector.
The demand for construction technicians outnumbered the supply available. The dearth of trained and talented technicians and professionals was a great drawback in the development of the construction industry. Many firms in the construction industry clamoured for permission to bring technicians from abroad to fill the gap. However, the government could not approve that request as a matter of policy, Minister Premadasa said.
When the yahapalana government assumed office, the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) launched a programme titled ‘Shilpa Saviya’ under which nearly 12,000 masons, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and iron benders have been trained. Minister Premadasa said the import of foreign labour was not a proper solution to the shortage of construction technicians. The government and the private sector should make a joint effort to resolve this problem locally. He therefore requested the private sector to provide worksites for training of technicians under the ‘Shilpa Saviya’ programme and also provide them with additional allowances.
