GMOA strike on May 5

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) led trade unions and organisation<U+200B>s will launch the final token strike on May 5 ( next Friday) at 8.00 am against the SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said. Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that health and education sectors will be crippled on May 5 due to the token strike. The GMOA Central Committee will meet on May 9 to take a decision on an extended continuous strike. The struggle will not stop until the Government take over SAITM, he said. The GMOA has over 20,000 members countrywide and another 21 trade unions will join the strike, while 160 trade unions support it in various ways such as implementing work to rule campaigns<U+200B>. The SAITM has not created even single doctor so far even it offered so called `MBBS’. There is no other country in the world which further train, educate and make `doctors’ sit for another exam/exams in order to allow them to become doctors, he said.
GMOA Media spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said that for the first time in the world Sri Lanka is going to create doctors without Medical Council approval and for the first time in the world, two Cabinet ministers appointed by the people through their universal franchise to protect and develop health and education sectors are destroying those sectors.
If this were ancient Sinhala Kings’ era, they would have been killed by putting them on a spike, he said.
