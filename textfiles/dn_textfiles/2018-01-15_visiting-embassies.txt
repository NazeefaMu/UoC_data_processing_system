Visiting embassies

The LAC also raised awareness among the international community on the elimination of violence against women by visiting embassies, pinning white ribbons and distributing leaflets among Ambassadors and embassy staff. As a part of this campaign, LAC officers visited the High Commissions of Australia and Canada, Embassies of Netherland, France, Germany, Cuba, Norway and Switzerland.
