Weerawansa further remanded

 
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa was further remanded till April 7 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate today.
Earlier today Weerawansa’s second bail application citing his 15-year-old daughter's mental health condition, was rejected.
Weerawansa was arrested on January 9 for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC), while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
