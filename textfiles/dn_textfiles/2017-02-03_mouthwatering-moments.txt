Mouthwatering moments

The ceremonial inauguration of Black Pepper was done in spectacular style last week with mouthwatering innovative dishes beings served to the guests who attended. The ambience was just right making it a memorable evening. Black Pepper is surely going to be a popular destination located in the Dutch Hospital, which will grow in popularity over the coming months, with more and more visitors falling in love with it.
Daily News spoke to Earl’s Court Group, Group Director Emal Gunasekara about the Restaurant.
“The crab is the King of Sea Food. We export crab to Singapore and they make Black Pepper Crab and provide it to their customers. So we thought, why don’t we go ahead and why don’t we initiate it and why don’t we cook it ourselves and produce something better? We can do it because we have a skilled staff. Hence the creation of Black Pepper King of Spices,” said Gunasekara.
He said that there was a trial period with experimentations, which culminated in a grand opening.
“Earl’s Court Group is mainly into the hospitality industry such as hotels – accommodation and food. So as a restaurant we are not moving forward. So this is our new venture by me because my father asked me to come up with something and go ahead. So I thought that Dutch Hospital is a very good market in the heart of Colombo which people know. It is a very happening area. So we thought about this concept with providing good food,” pointed out Gunasekara.
Under Earl’s Court Group there are many hotels such as Earl’s Regency, their first hotel which came up in 2000. Then moving on Earl’s Regent in Kandy came up and Earl’s Reef Beruwala came up very recently along with Kandy City Hotel.
“This is our first restaurant and in this restaurant there are around 20 to 30 staff. After the success of this business we want to move with the franchise. So we thought of going out of this area and into developing areas and going out of Colombo, such as Kandy and down South. We are thinking about spreading our chain. This is my father, Earl Gunasekara’s concept,” explained Gunasekara. Under Earl’s Group there are financial services, hospitality industry, Black Pepper restaurant and transport services.
