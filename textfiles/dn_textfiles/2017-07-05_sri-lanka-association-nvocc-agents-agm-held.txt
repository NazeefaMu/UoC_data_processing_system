Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents AGM held

SLANA (Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents) which was formed in May 2016 had its first AGM on May 26 2017, with Ajith Seneviratne Director General of Merchant Shipping and H. D. Premachandra, Managing Director of Sri Lanka Ports Authority as the guests of honour.
SLANA has been the voice for the NVOCC Operators and Agents, highlighting the difficulties faced by the entire shipping industry. The key issues that have been highlighted to the Minister and the officials.
The constraints and restrictions imposed by the government upon the service providers in December 2013 forcing and preventing the service providers in the shipping industry from collecting legitimate fees and charges from their customers for services offered.
The regulation was imposed by way of gazette 1842 / 16 (of 27th Dec 2013), which was against all international norms and practices.
Parties with vested interest not directly involved in the shipping industry, pressed upon the Finance ministry officials of the then government to introduce such regulations in an unethical manner, without any discussions with any of the industry stake holders.
These regulations have been detrimental to the Shipping and Logistics services industry and has tarnished the image of our country.
The Gazette 1842 / 16 also prevents the NVOCCs and the Shipping lines from recovering the Terminal Handling Charges (THC), a land based cost which is a direct cost arising from the payment to the Port Terminals. The THC which is a land based cost is recovered in all countries globally, expect in Bangladesh.
Due to the THC charges not being paid locally, there is also an unnecessary erosion of foreign exchange out of our country.
The need to introduce a separate category for the NVOCC agents in the Licensing of Shipping Agents Act, providing due recognition to the members of SLANA.
The former Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunge instructed the ministry officials to get new proposals from all the industry stake holders (about 10 days prior to his portfolio being changed) and formulate a new gazette in regularizing the charges in the shipping industry, considering the adverse effects that were brought upon the industry by gazette 1842 / 16. The matter is in process.
