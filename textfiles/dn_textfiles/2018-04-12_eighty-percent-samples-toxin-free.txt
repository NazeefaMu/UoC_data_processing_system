Govt. Analyst’s Dept. conducts fruit, vegetable inspection:
Eighty percent samples, toxin-free

The Government Analyst's Department recently inspected selected fruit and vegetable samples from all 25 districts in the country and assessed that 80 percent of those samples were toxin-free. The rest of the samples (20 percent), had chemicals below the danger (approved) level, Deputy Director General (Public Health) Dr. Lakshman Gamlath said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said that although majority of the public believe that there are toxins such as pesticides and insecticides in fruits and vegetables available in the country, it was not so. Fruits and vegetables are safe to consume. But this inspection would continue island-wide, in order to ensure the safety of food consumed by people.
According to Dr. Gamlath, this year, arrangements would be made to test all fruits, vegetables, rice and other common food items from all parts of the country for pesticides, insecticides and heavy metals. Therefore, food safety could be ensured. The required standard had already been certified for a total of 101 food items.
"There are four current laboratories in the country that test food. The laboratory located in Anuradhapura tests food for heavy metals, while the laboratory at Kalutara tests for chemicals. The Government Analyst's Department tests food for insecticides. Through the recent inspections, the safety of food has been ensured under Food Act Number 26 of 1980," he added.
