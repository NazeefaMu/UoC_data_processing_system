Superb century by Nipuna Deshan

The Captain of Sri Sumangala College Panadura Nipuna Deshan scored a magnificent chanceless 100 runs in their inter-school annual 25th limited overs cricket match against their arch rivals Moratu Vidyalaya which was worked off at De Soysa Stadium, Moratuwa after their 66th Bit Match. His epic knock guided his alma mater to defeat Moratu Vidyalaya with ease by 90 runs. Nipuna became the first cricketer and captain from both schools to score a century in this two and a half decades year old inter school limited over series. Now the tally stands at Sri Sumangala twelve wins, Vidyalians Eleven and two no decisions.
Nipuna had ten hits to the rope and occupied the crease for 186 minutes and faced 117 deliveries. Batting first Sumangalians scored 224 runs and in reply Vidyalians were all out for 134 runs. Nipuna was adjudged as the Man of the Match while his team mate Anuka Jayasinghe carried away the Best Bowler’s Award.
