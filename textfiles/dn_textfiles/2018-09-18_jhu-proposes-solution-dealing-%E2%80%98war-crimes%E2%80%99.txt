JHU proposes solution for dealing with ‘war crimes’

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday urged the President, Prime Minister and Tamil political leaders to work benevolently to safeguard the rule of law in the country.
All political parties should sincerely and logically intervene in this matter, Minister Ranawaka said, speaking at a media conference at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
“Everyone should realise that the rule of law in the country cannot be safeguarded by recalling past memories. Forgiveness is the best, easy and logical alternative to ensuring peace and reconciliation in the country,” he said.
The JHU yesterday presented five proposals to the government for ensuring that the rule of law prevailed in the country.
The JHU proposed the appointment of an expert committee under the Attorney General’s Department to separately identify the crimes committed by military personnel in attaining war targets and crimes committed for personal reasons.
They also proposed the granting of a common pardon to the persons who are accused of committing crimes while attaining war targets.
That relief policy should also be applied to former LTTE cadres in custody, former LTTE cadres who are currently undergoing various punishments and former LTTE cadres against whom there are pending cases and who are still at large.
The JHU underlined the importance of taking immediate legal action against those who committed crimes for their personal benefit, taking advantage of the war. All the political parties should come to a common agreement not to recall past memories after implementing these proposals successfully, the Minister said.
“It is useless to implement this procedure if there is no such agreement nationally as well as internationally,” he said.
JHU Co-Chairman Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera, Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and JHU Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe were also present.
