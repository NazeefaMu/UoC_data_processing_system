Former Lanka Sathosa Chairman remanded

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday ordered the remand of former Lanka Sathosa Chairman Nalin Ruwanjeewa Fernando until May 9.
Fernando has been arrested by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport when he attempted to leave the country.
The suspect was arrested in connection with the investigation carried out by the FCID on the misuse of state funds amounting to Rs 39 million for the purchase of carrom and checker boards in 2014 during the time Mahindananda Aluthgamage was Sports Minister. The court had already issued an order preventing MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage from leaving the country in connection with the same incident.
