Treasury releases Rs. 5 million to buy excess pumpkin crop

The Treasury has released Rs. 5 million to the Agriculture Department to purchase the excess pumpkin crop from farmers this season, in response to a request made by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The money had already been disbursed among district agriculture officers to facilitate the purchase of pumpkins from farmers saddled with excess crop unable to market their produce, the Agriculture Ministry said in a media statement.
It said the problem had arisen due to a bumper crop harvested by farmers and resultant drop in the market price of the produce. The Ministry has also directed agriculture officers to ensure that the purchased stock is released to the market in a planned basis to prevent flooding of the market.
Minister Amaraweera, who disclosed this arrangement during an inspection tour of the Agrarian Service Department head office in Colombo, added that he had also directed the Agrarian Service Department to formulate a scientific approval to direct farmers to undertake pumpkin cultivation taking the market and climatic conditions into consideration.
Ministry Secretary B. Wijayaratne and Commissioner General of the Agrarian Service Department W. M. B. Weerasekara were associated with the Minister during the tour.
