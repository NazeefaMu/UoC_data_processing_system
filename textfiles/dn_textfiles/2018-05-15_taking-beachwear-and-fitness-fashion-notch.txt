Taking beachwear and fitness fashion a notch up

Designer Aakriti Grover showcased her collection for this season – Clematis Bloom – on Day 3 of Bombay Times Fashion Week 2018. For those looking at making beachside statements, this was it! The chic range comprised glamorous yet everyday outfits. The models sported beachwear in a unique combination of red and lavender, while the guys too flaunted their beach bodies in shorts.
