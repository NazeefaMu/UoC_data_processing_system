Dmitri to perform with the SOSL

The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka will feature the talented young Soprano Dmitri Gunatilake at its Young Soloists concert on July 7 at the Ladies’ College Hall. It has long been one of the SOSL’s primary aims to foster young talent in Sri Lanka, to promote classical music, and to enable young musicians to discover the joys of communicating through music.
Consequently, the SOSL dedicates one concert each year to exposing and nurturing young musicians, and in this they have been generously assisted for over two decades by HSBC.
Dmitri is no stranger to the stage, having been involved in drama and musical theatre from a young age. A distinguished past pupil of Bishop’s College, Dmitri has played key roles in musicals such as The Sound of Music (Maria) Evita (Eva Peron) and The Phantom of The Opera (Christine) –directed by Jerome de Silva—as well as a host of other productions, including many shows directed by Jehan Bastianz and Neidra Williams and works by Sri Lankan writers like Jehan Aloysius.
On July 7, Dmitri will be performing a programme of four beautiful and well-known arias. Starting with Mozart’s Dove Sono from the Marriage of Figaro, where a broken hearted countess laments a once-sweet romance, Dmitri will move on to the immediately recognizable and beautifully melodic O mio babbino caro from Puccini’s Gianni Schichi, and Magda’s story (from La Rondine) of Doretta, who realizes that riches are nothing compared to love.
Apart from this very appealing set of Arias, the SOSL will be performing some of the music world’s most beloved waltzes and dances that are at once haunting, dramatic, delicate and melodic. Beginning with Johann Strauss Jnr’s extremely popular overture to “Die Fledermaus” the SOSL will move through Brahms’ stirring Hungarian Dances and Shostakovitch’s Jazzy waltz No.2, before coming back to the iconic dances of Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty.
