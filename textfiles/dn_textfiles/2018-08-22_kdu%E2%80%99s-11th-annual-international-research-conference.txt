KDU’s 11th Annual International Research Conference

The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University’s (KDU) 11th Annual International Research Conference (IRC) will be held on September 13.
KDU Deputy Vice Chancellor (Defence and Administration) Major General Indunil Ranasinghe, addressing a media briefing held at the Defence Ministry’s Media Centre, yesterday, said the theme of this year’s IRC would be ‘Securing Professional Excellence Through Collaboration’, with Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the chief guest.
The keynote speech would be delivered by UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4) Vice Chair Prof. Mohan Munasinghe. The guest speaker for the event would be Prof. Sarath Gunapala, a fellow at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The Conference holds its sessions in fields of Defence and Strategic Studies, Engineering, Basic and Applied Sciences, Computing, Information Technology, Management, Social Science, Humanities, Law, Medicine, Built Environment and Spatial Sciences, and Allied Health Sciences.
The conference enriches contribution towards academic research, with the participation of local and foreign academics, professionals and practitioners who would present their research. KDU Deputy Vice Chancellor Prof. M. H. Jayantha Ariyarathne said the KDU had called for research papers for the 11th edition of the IRC, and interested researchers had already submitted either their extended abstracts or full papers under two categories to the conference. We received over 602 papers submitted by both local and international researchers, of which 375 papers would be published.
This year’s IRC would have several new features, including the use of Skype for presentations, and participants would be able to utilise the Digital Library facility. Selected papers would also be published in the KDU journal. Several researches based on papers submitted during last year’s conference regarding dengue and chronic kidney disease, are in progress.
