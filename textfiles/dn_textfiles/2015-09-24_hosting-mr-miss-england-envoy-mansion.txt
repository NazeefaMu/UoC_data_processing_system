Hosting Mr. & Miss England at the Envoy Mansion

Hameedia's premium brand Envoy London recently hosted Christopher Bramell and Natasha Hemmings, the winners of the prestigious Mr. & Miss England 2015 pageants, at the Envoy Mansion in Colombo.
Hameedia Managing Director Fouzul Hameed also presented Mr. England 2015 Christopher Bramell with an exclusive, tailor-made menswear collection from Envoy London which includes an array of casual and formal fashion staples.
Envoy London recently provided the finalists of the Mr. England competition with stylish, specially-designed attire for the grand finale of the pageant, which took place in Coventry, UK. For the finale, Mr. England finalists took to the runway in a range of exquisitely designed ceremonial suits from the Envoy London collection which featured three unique looks and styles. The winners of both pageants are now being hosted to a holiday in Sri Lanka by Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts - the official hospitality partner of the Mr. & Miss England pageants.
"It is an immense honour for us to host the winners of the Mr. & Miss. England pageants at the Envoy Mansion. The Mr. England pageant provided the Hameedia and Envoy London brands with an opportunity to showcase our collections and expertise on a prestigious international platform. I'm delighted that our two guests have been able to experience the world-class tailoring and textiles that hail from Sri Lanka. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to gift a collection from our premium brand Envoy London, to Christopher Bramell, I hope that this versatile collection will be a valuable addition to his wardrobe", Fouzel stated.
