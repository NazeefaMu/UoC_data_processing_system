Inter-church rally to mark feast of Pentecost

The Inter-Church Fellowship - an informal movement comprising priests, pastors and lay people of all Christian denominations will hold its annual rally at the Methodist Church in Kollupitiya on June 17 from 9 am to noon, to celebrate the feast of Pentecost.
‘Together in the Spirit’, will be the theme of this year’s rally, calling on all Christian denominations to be one with Christ, one with the Spirit and with one mind. The prayers, praise and worship, and the singing will be in all three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English.
Prof. Anton Meemana, one of Sri Lanka’s highest qualified Catholic Scripture scholars will give a talk in English on the theology of the ecology and how Christians of all denominations need to come together to win the battle against climate change and to save God’s creation.
Pope Francis also, in his message on June 3 at a Rome rally to mark the Golden Jubilee of the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services (ICCRS) called for ecumenism quoting from John 17. He called on the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) to unite with the Catholic Church on three priority issues-- the battle against climate change, the mission for world poverty alleviation and the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue without resorting to war or violence. WCC and the WEA leaders attended the rally. The Pope told the Rome rally that if there was Christian unity, then there would be unity among all world religions on the three priority issues.
Dr. Vijeya Corea of the Anglican Church will give the Sinhala talk while Pastor John Issac of the Calvary Church will give the talk in Tamil. Choirs from all denominations will sing. All are invited.
