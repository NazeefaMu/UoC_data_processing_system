Lessons from Lessing

It is not uncommon for feminist readers to make heroines of great female writers, and view their books and lives as personal models. In My Life in Middlemarch (2014), Rebecca Mead presented a study of George Eliot’s greatest novel alongside her own changing understanding of its meaning. In a lighter vein, Nina Lorenz Collins’s What Would Virginia Woolf Do? (2018) addressed contemporary women over forty about their problems with fashion, health, work and sex. Lara Feigel, a scholar, writer and journalist who teaches modern literature and culture at King’s College London, is in this line, but in Free Woman she takes her passion for Doris Lessing beyond academic admiration, intellectual identification, even fan adoration, to a risky obsession.
As she turned thirty-five, Feigel realized that although she had a husband, child, house, job and book, plus a second book in progress and a second child on the way, she found her situation not only oddly unsatisfying, but a betrayal of her adolescent ideals of freedom from “the smug structure of middle-class life”. But was there a way to integrate her questioning of those structures with her academic career and family responsibilities?
Freedom-seekers
She had been re-reading The Golden Notebook (1962), a novel that spoke to the lives “of girls and women with an honesty and fullness I had not found in any novelist before or since”, and she decided that writing a book about Doris Lessing, “the most compulsive of freedom-seekers”, would give her an opportunity to learn “how to liberate myself from the conflicting desires that stopped me being free”.
Then, at a time when she was grieving over a miscarriage, she received a research award from the Leverhulme Trust which allowed her to travel to Africa and California as well as British Library archives in Sussex and East Anglia in search of “lessons from Lessing”. “If my obsession with Lessing had begun with her work,” she realized, “I was now equally preoccupied with her life.” Moreover, she envisioned the book as her own story too, a blend of memoir and biographical criticism.
Feigel was particularly drawn to questions about being a female writer and a mother, and the problem of reconciling a desire for freedom and independence with a need for security and heterosexual love.
She noticed a recurring image of a slammed door in Lessing’s writings, and wondered whether freedom could “come from slamming the door, and discarding the parts of your life that constrain you?” Surprisingly, in her analysis, she doesn’t link that image to the foundational feminist moment of Ibsen’s Nora slamming the door of the doll’s house, as she chooses the terrifying freedom that comes from leaving husband, home and children.
Yet it becomes a motif of her study. She asks, for example, whether “Lessing had gained freedom from slamming the door on her first marriage”, and concludes that she did not. It had provided only a negative kind of freedom, from one sort of constraint, and motherhood was an even stronger constraint. “When I first decided to turn my preoccupation with Lessing into a book,” Feigel notes, “I knew that the moment would come when I had to confront her leaving her children” when she divorced her first husband, and then when she moved from Southern Rhodesia to London.
Research trips
That’s the nagging question all of Feigel’s friends brought up when she talked about her book. Indeed, “it quickly became tiresome how many people mentioned it”.
Tiresome, perhaps, because Feigel herself was leaving her little son to go on various research trips, and feeling ambivalent about it. In one of her best chapters, “‘I’m setting you free’”, she looks at Lessing’s self-deceiving rationales for having and giving up her children. Feigel argues that “leaving her children behind was . . . a necessary condition of Lessing’s bid for freedom”, but she is conflicted about leaving her own child even for a short break, and impressively honest in admitting not only her doubts about her bid for freedom, but also her gratifications.
She had always felt vaguely that motherhood would conflict with her literary ambitions: “it does seem significant that so many female writers across the centuries have avoided having children”. But she wanted them anyway, and knew that she would have childcare support and professional resources unavailable to “a young 1940s mother” like Lessing.
Conflicting explanations
Still, taking care of a small child can be constraining. When she decided to go away for a while to look at Lessing’s archive at the University of East Anglia, her three-year-old son was very upset. His tears were wrenching for her, but by the time she got on the train, he “was pushed comfortably into a corner of my mind as I read through my notes about Lessing” and looked forward to dinners with Norwich friends.She was searching the archive to figure out why Lessing had a third child with her second husband, Gottfried Lessing, when she had so recently abandoned the first two; they had already decided to divorce; and she was about to leave Southern Rhodesia. But Feigal quickly discovered that Lessing gave conflicting explanations in her autobiography and letters – they both wanted to have a child; Gottfried was keen to have a child; neither of them wanted a child and the pregnancy was an accident.
In any case, when Lessing’s son Peter was born, she was ecstatic, and took him with her to London, where, Feigel suggests, she “spent the rest of her life attempting to reconcile her guilt about the children she had left behind with her anxious love for the child who remained”. Overall, Feigel discovers that Lessing’s maternity choices came at considerable costs for the children and did not set her free; but she observes that for her, taking short absences from her son “did seem a necessary freedom for both of us. Going away was a method by which . . . the frightening, joyful ties of love could be kept from strangling us”.
