Thundenek  soon  in cinemas

The latest Sinhala language movie ‘Thundenek’ or ‘Her, Him, the other’ produced by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and directed by Asoka Handagama, Prasanna Vithanage and Vimukthi Jayasundara will be screening in film halls island-wide soon.
A Special show and a discussion of the movie for Government officers, Security Forces and Police officers was held this week at the National Film Cooperation, Tharanganee Hall.
Thundenek is a feature film by the three veteran, renowned, directors where the characters reflect on the social impact of the three-decade-old war in Sri Lanka. The discussion following the special screening was attended by Asoka Handagama and Prasanna Vithanage.
Asoka Handagama said: "For many years had been planning to do a film, not on the war, but the impact of the war. Still, there unresolved issues and we wanted to make a movie that would prompt a dialogue on such issues."
He said that the premiere had received positive feedback with requests from both Sinhala and Tamil communities to show the movie in their communities, some had offered to organize public screenings and such received great interest with engaging post-screening discussions.
Prasanna Vithanage, in his remarks, said “Our film is about the aftermath of the war. The war created many stories - stories without closure. All three stories in Thundenek are about people who are looking for closure." He pointed out that the Sri Lankan people could easily relate to the polarization of communities, thus the title ‘Her. Him.
The Other’. "For the Sinhala people Tamils have become The Other and vice versa; the same goes for Muslims."
Vithanage said that no matter the audience if the emotions conveyed were truthful, it would be well received. All the Tamil speaking actors for Vithanage’s film were from Jaffna.
His team conducted a two-day workshop for 25 aspiring film-makers.
The movie has already been invited and highlighted at international film festivals and the public release in cinemas will take place soon.
