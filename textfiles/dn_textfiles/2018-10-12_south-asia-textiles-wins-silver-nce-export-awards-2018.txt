Commenting following his company’s win at this awards ceremony, Prithiv Dorai, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of South Asia Textiles Limited, said, “We are pleased to have once again walked away with a coveted NCE Export Award in 2018, which is the second consecutive time we have won in the ‘Suppliers and Service Providers to Exporters Extra Large’ category. This is not only a singular honor for us but also a testament to the consistency and superior quality standards that are our focus year in and year out, which are values shared across the larger Group.”
Now marking its 26th year, the NCE Export Awards recognises and rewards exemplary Sri Lankan exporters. Organised by the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE), which is widely respected for its high standards and professionalism, the 2018 awards witnessed the highest number of applicants vying for these highly sought-after accolades.
