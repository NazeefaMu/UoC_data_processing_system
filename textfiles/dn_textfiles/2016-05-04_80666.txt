‘JO was protesting against Fonseka’s speech on MR’s security’

An unfortunate incident occurred when the Joint Opposition(JO) protested when Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka rose to speak in Parliament to answer the question on the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Joint Opposition Leader, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He added that Fonseka who started reading out of a prepared speech, criticised Mahinda Rajapaksa and it was this that the Joint Opposition protested against.
Gunawardena made these statements at a media briefing at Battaramulla yesterday and mentioned that despite them asking the Speaker not to allow Fonseka to speak thus, the former simply did not heed their request and chose to leave his seat instead.
He explained that the situation got heated as Fonseka kept addressing the Chamber even after the Speaker had left his seat.
MP Udaya Gammanpila said that they were simply interrupting the illegal speech of Fonseka which was not in line with Parliamentary procedure.
“Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma came in and hit MP Prasanna Ranaweera and it is then that a fight broke out. The fight has caused minor injuries to many. We came to Parliament to solve problems through the exchange of ideas, thus the people are watching as to what action the Speaker and government would take with regard to this. We will not be subjected into silence or make us forget about the danger to Mahinda Rajapaksa’s life,”he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said that Rajapaksa’s life was under threat from the LTTE diaspora and local and international separatists.
