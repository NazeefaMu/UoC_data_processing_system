New speed-detecting system on Expressways

A new speed-detecting system was introduced on all Expressways from yesterday to reduce accidents caused by speeding along the expressways.
Under this system, vehicles that have exceeded 100 Km per hour can be nabbed and fined at the exit points, Expressway Operation Maintenance and Management Division Director S.Opanayake told the Daily News.
It is revealed that high speed contributes to about 30 percent of accidents on Expressways and these measures are intended to reduce such accidents.
The system would capture the vehicle number,observed time and speed of vehicles exceeding speed limits and vehicles exceeding the limit would be displayed on the tabs installed at all exit points.
Drivers will be given a photograph taken at the time the vehicle had exceeded the speed limit and fined at the exit points.
The new system enables the capturing of these details even at night.
The new detection system will monitor speed freaks on the Southern (126 kilometres from Kottawa to Matara) and Katunayake (25.8 km from New Kelani Bridge to Katunayake) Expressways as well as the Outer Circular Highway. Expressways Police will operate the system.
