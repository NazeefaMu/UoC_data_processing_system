Ampara gets ready for Haj

Muslims in the Ampara district are getting ready to celebrate Eid-Ul-Alha Haj festival on a grand scale this year.
The people in the district are busy purchasing their requirements.
Shops in Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Kalmunai, Sainthamaruthu, Maruthamunai, Pottuvil, Sammanthurai and Ampara are open till late night for the convenience of the people as they have to fulfill their religious obligations during the early part of the night in mosques.
The towns have turned into a hive of activity. Large numbers of pavement hawkers from other districts have come into the district and are selling goods at cheap rates.
Both sides of the main roads are illuminated with bulbs by payment hawkers to attract crowds.
