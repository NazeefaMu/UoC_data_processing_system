Chinese FDI to Sri Lanka still very low

Although China has been a major FDI source and lender to Sri Lanka in recent years, FDI is still very low compared to Chinese FDI to other Asian countries, said The LKI Working Paper series done by LKI Research Director, Ravindra Deyshappriya, on “Sri-Lanka China Economic Relations in Comparative Perspective: Ample Room to Grow” says that, similarly, although China is now the second largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka does not rank among even the top 25 outbound destinations of Chinese tourists.
While a flood of imports from China and sluggish exports to China have resulted in a dramatic trade deficit of Sri Lanka, imports from China remain vital for Sri Lanka’s garment industry, which drives Sri Lankan exports.” “This relative gap, together with Sri Lanka’s status as a founding member of the newly-established AIIB, indicates that Sri Lanka has potential to seek and attract more investments, grants and loans from China.”
Sri Lanka is currently not even among the top 25 tourist destinations of China, although China is the fastest growing source of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka and the share of Chinese tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka is just 0.06 percent of China’s total outbound tourists, and it is drastically lower than the number of outbound Chinese tourists to other Asian countries.
For more beneficial economic relations, the paper recommends that Sri Lanka needs to develop new export products that are increasingly demanded in Chinese markets, and which have lower or no tariffs applied to Sri Lankan exports.
