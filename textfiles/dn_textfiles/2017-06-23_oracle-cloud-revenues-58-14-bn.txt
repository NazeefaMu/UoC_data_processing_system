Oracle cloud revenues up 58% to $1.4 bn

Oracle Corporation Wednesday announced fiscal 2017 Q4 results and fiscal 2017 full year results and comparing Q4 2017 to Q4 last year, SaaS (Software as a Service) cloud revenues were up 67% to $964 million, and non-GAAP SaaS revenues were up 75% to $1.0 billion.
Cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service) plus IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) revenues were up 40% to $397 million, and non-GAAP PaaS plus IaaS revenues were up 42% to $403 million.
Total cloud revenues were up 58% to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP total cloud revenues were up 64% to $1.4 billion. Cloud plus on-premise software revenues were up 5% to $8.9 billion, and non-GAAP cloud and on-premise software revenues were up 6% to $8.9 billion. Total revenues were up 3% to $10.9 billion.
Operating income was up 3% to $4.1 billion, and the operating margin was 37%. Non-GAAP Operating Income was up 5% to $5.0 billion, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 46%.

“Our fourth quarter results were very strong as revenue growth and earnings per share both substantially exceeded the high end of guidance,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz.
