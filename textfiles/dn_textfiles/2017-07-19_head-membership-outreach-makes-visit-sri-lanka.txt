Head of Membership & Outreach makes visit to Sri Lanka

Head of Membership and Outreach of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (UK), The Governance Institute Theresa Minnie, was on an official visit to Sri Lanka recently, held a meeting with ICSA students and members in Colombo to update them on the Institute's latest developments globally and also briefed them on the proposed constitutional changes put forward by the respective divisions.
She also discussed the new educational structure for students which now cater to new areas such as Governance for Health, Charities and Sports bodies all of which have been widely recognised and accepted internationally. During her stay, she took the opportunity to hold meetings with several of the regulators and other allied bodies which will be a precursor to the visit of Simon Osborne, CEO-ICSA and others early next year.
Theresa also mentioned that the Institute takes a very serious view in providing a viable and strategic road map for making the qualification a specialty in both Corporate Secretaryship and Corporate Governance which will be of more acceptance to the Sri Lankan business community.
