For the first time in Sri Lanka, a new ‘easy do-it-yourself’ Admission Badge will be introduced at the 13th edition of the Hotel Show Colombo 2018 which will be held from July 20 to 22.
“It will give you quick and easy access to hundreds of innovative exhibition stalls as well as exciting live competitions,” said Samantha Gunarathne, Chairman CHSGA.
“Over the past years The Hotel Show Colombo has established itself as a major force in the hospitality industry; it’s the ultimate diary date for anyone in the sector.”
The event is organized by the Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association (CHSGA) together with event partner CDC Events.
The mega event attracts products and services representing thousands of brands from all over the globe while many visitors and buyers from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Seychelles, India and other South Asian countries will be present. It also provides hotels the opportunity to showcase the talents of their staff in various competitions under the purview of international judges.
The forthcoming gala event promises to be an unforgettable occasion for the hospitality industry.
The hotel show includes events such as the National Barista Championship, National Tabletop Cooking, National Room Stylist Competition, Culinary Master Class, Ceylon Tea Masters Cup and Colombo Food Fest which will be held concurrently.
This year at the Colombo Food Fest, more leading hotels will be showcasing their culinary expertise, catering to the taste buds of all food lovers.
