IGP has prerogative over transfers

The transfer of Criminal Investigation Department’s OIC, IP Nishantha Silva was a transfer over which only the Inspector General has prerogative over and nothing to do with President Maithripala Sirisena, Police sources told the Daily News.
IP Nishantha Silva who handled several high profile cases involving high ranking officials in the government sector and tri-forces, was transferred to the Negombo Division with immediate effect.
Inspector General Pujith Jayasundara however told the Daily News that the transfer was cancelled by him citing service requirements.
 Sources told the Daily News that transfers of OICs of stations and certain divisions do not require National Police Commission approval.The transfer of IP Silva was the prerogative of the IGP, who is vested with powers to transfer personnel based on service requirements or vacancies.
He denied the involvement of NPC or higher ranking officials adding that the IGP makes such transfers on a regular basis which often goes unnoticed.
IP Silva was the OIC of the CID’s Organized Crimes Unit handling many high profile cases including the murder of Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr. The daughter of late Wickrematunge, Ahimsa wrote to the President asking him to reconsider the transfer of IP Silva, citing that it was his efforts which helped further the case.
IP Silva is also handling investigations into crimes committed by the LTTE, the rape and murder of schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vithya, the abduction of 11 youth in Colombo among many.
