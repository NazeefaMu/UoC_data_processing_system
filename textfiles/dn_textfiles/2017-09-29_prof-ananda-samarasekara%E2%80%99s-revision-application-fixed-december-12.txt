Prof Ananda Samarasekara’s revision application fixed for December 12

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday fixed for December 12 by the Colombo High Court.
When the application was taken up before High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi, counsel appearing on behalf of Prof. Samarasekara filed written submissions in court and the Attorney General was directed to file written submissions before the next inquiry date.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
Earlier former Colombo chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen.
On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail for the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof.Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to refuse him anticipatory bail.
Prof. Samarasekara denied allegations leveled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando with Counsel Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO. Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the Attorney General.
