‘Police empowered to control subversive activities’

The Cabinet of Ministers decided to hand over the responsibility of handling and controlling subversive activities in various parts of the country to rouse racial and communal violence to the police stations in the respective areas, Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Parliament Affairs and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday said.
The Minister made this observation yesterday addressing a press conference held in the Parliamentary Complex.
He said the government would not permit the activities seeking to create communal disharmony.
He said the government would not approve any such action paving the way for religious or racial violence.
"President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Ministers have reached this decision since several religious places had come under attack," Minister Karunathilaka said.
"A decision was made to hand over the OICs in all police stations with the responsibility to maintain normalcy and take action to prevent any incidents that create communal disharmony," he said. He said the government would ensure that there would be no room for creating disharmony and disturbances to change situation. Parliament Affairs and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana was present.
