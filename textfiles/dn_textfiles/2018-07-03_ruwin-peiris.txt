RUWIN PEIRIS

Another outstanding cricketer who touched the surface but couldn’t emerge to Test level was Ruwin Peiris. He was dark charming and had ruggedly good looks akin to a West Indian, it was nice of him to come to my abode for this interview.
I would not be wrong to state that Ruwin was the best cricketer to emerge from the Colombo suburb of Piliyandala. His outstanding talent was spotted by the scouts of other famous schools such as Ananda, D.S. and Trinity but for some reason he was faithful to his school Piliyandala Central.
Ruwin although blazing a trail in both domestic and Lancashire league was a down to earth guy who has not lost his balance and knew where his roots were. He was a cricket mad brat who used to play cricket at every conceivable opportunity. He mentioned to me that he used to wrap his bat up with a piece of newspaper and hop into a bus and go to the public park at Piliyandala and play softball cricket with the likes of Hashan Tillakaratne who was living next door to the park those days.
During his formative years at Piliyandala Central he was selected to play for the first eleven team at the tender age of 14 and blasted 7 centuries during his first eleven days. Deepal Madurapperuma another cricketer from Piliyandala area who played for Thurstan, invited Ruwin to attend practice at Nomads and as time went by he got a call to play for Nomads first team as ex-Sri Lanka player Jayantha Amarasinghe was injured. The opponents of Nomads were the star studded CCC which had stars such as Sanath Jayasuriya and Roy Dias. Ruwin was 17 years old at that time. Although he did not get any wickets he batted at no 3 and made a brisk 25 unfortunately run out by a direct hit from Roshan Jurangpathy. The selectors at Nomads recognized his talent and invited him to play for the subsequent ODI match and batting at no. 3 he got a whirlwind 40 which enabled Ruwin to seal a permanent place at Nomads.
In ‘89/90 Ruwin was going great guns at Nomads and they were the ODI champions. He ended up as the Man of the Series and in the final against Bloomfield he was the Man of the Match. Ruwin was 18 years old at the time. People then were wondering who this wonder boy was and speculating whether he was an Anandian since he came from a suburb close to Colombo, stated Ruwin. He was in demand amongst the clubs and Champaka Ramanayake the then captain
of the Tamil Union invited Ruwin to join them. Tamils were one of the clubs selected to play in the President’s Trophy where top clubs like CCC, Colts, Tamil Union and SSC participated together with Sri Lankan Board eleven and another Sri Lankan Board under 23 side. Ruwin had the opportunity of opening with Chandika Hathurusingha for Tamils in this tournament.
According to Ruwin Chandika was a well organized player who studied the opposing bowlers well and also encouraged Ruwin to go for his shots. He mentioned to me that he learned a lot about cricket from Hathurusingha and during his 10 year tenure at Tamils he got 10 centuries and over 10,000 runs.
His next pit stop was at the NCC where Asoka de Silva the famous umpire beckoned him to join in 1998. They became the ODI champs and Ruwin in his customary position was the Best Batsman. During his stint at Tamil Union he blasted the first three balls of a match against NCC for three sixes, pint sized Ruwin was a natural timer of the ball - shots came to him through innate impulse.
It was unfortunate that Ruwin was born in an era where star players were in abundance and he stated that even a class player like Marvan Attapattu was not in the playing eleven then.
There was no doubt that he was a prolific scorer in the club arena and one wondered whether he was side lined because he came from a Central school, then it’s the height of absurdity! Ruwin’s coaching career started at Moors where he was their head coach from 2009-11, a provincial coach in 2012 and cricket board development squad batting coach. He had a stint in Dubai for 2 years at Aravinda de Silva’s Academy. Ruwin is now the head coach at NCC, he filled the vacancy left by the former coach who was a national selector till the recent past. His contract with the NCC is 2 years renewable. Ruwin had a 12 year stint at Lancashire League and played for Middleton and Etherly in the main. All in all Ruwin has notched up 40 hundreds and
accumulated 14,000 runs in those leagues which to me should go into the record books. Here are some headlines in those papers singing the praises of Ruwin; Ruvin grooving By Chris Ostick of THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN-06/08/2001
“Improving Peiris has his sights set on a Test place”* By Ray Simpson of the Northern Echo-08/06/1998 Apart from his cricketing feats in UK, Ruwin has done yeoman service for the communities affected by the tsunami and he was modest enough to inform me not to go to town so as to get mileage like the politicians of this day and age do. Finally he had a kind word for Lasith Malinga, according to Ruwin Lasith is no mug, he has 9 A’s in his ‘O’ levels and helps the under privileged in a big way. Example once a boy with an incurable illness came with his parents to see Lasith at the NCC nets and after giving a patient hearing Lasith straight away wrote a check for Rs 3 lakhs and gave the child to get treatment. On another occasion Lasith has donated whole sets of books to a daham pasala worth lakhs and lakhs of rupees. Ruwin being the chief coach at NCC knew what he said and concluded by saying that one must not judge people by their hair styles. Lack of space denies me to write some other interesting stories related to me by Ruwin.
