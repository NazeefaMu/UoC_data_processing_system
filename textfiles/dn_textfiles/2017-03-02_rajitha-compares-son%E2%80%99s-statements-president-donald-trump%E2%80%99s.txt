Rajitha compares son’s statements to President Donald Trump’s

Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne has compared his son MP Chathura Senaratne’s statements to that of US President Donald Trump.
“It is good that he is getting popular, look at Trump? He became so popular that he was voted as the President of the United Staes of America”, said a visibly amused minister when questioned on the outrageous statements made by his son.
Chathura Senaratne who was involved in the formation of the Pivithuru Hetak Movement of Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, caused an uproar when he publicly claimed that he was involved in Vijaya Kumaratunga’s political campaign, as a toddler.
He said he first took part in the ‘banned May Day rally’ of 1987 at the age of five and that he conducted a rally at his pre-school to support Kumaratunga in 1986.
In addition, his statements made during a BBC Sandeshaya interview with regard to the above led to his statements going viral on social media,
Minister Senaratne however remarked to the above, “It is not my fault if the foolish choose to make him famous”.
