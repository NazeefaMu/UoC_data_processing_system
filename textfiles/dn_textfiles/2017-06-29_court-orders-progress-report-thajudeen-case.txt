The Colombo Chief Magistrate's ordered the CID today to submit a report in court on July 27 regarding the progress of the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case.

They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s murder and conspiring to commit a murder.
They are currently out on bail. 
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.

The CID added that muscles in his legs were cut with a piece of a broken class.
Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was had lost control of his car while driving to the airport and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita.
In addition to this they said that his vehicle exploded within seconds after the crash.
