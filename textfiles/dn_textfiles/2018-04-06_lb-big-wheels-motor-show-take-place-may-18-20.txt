LB Big Wheels Motor Show to take place on May 18-20

The LB Big Wheels Motor Show, a one-of-a-kind motor show that focuses on providing only superior quality vehicles from the world’s leading automotive manufacturers, is set to take place on May 18-20, 2018 from 10am to 10pm at the Nelum Pokuna - Colombo 7.
The inaugural LB Big Wheels Motor Show is organised by Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL), the leading voice representing the brand-new and reconditioned automobile importers in Sri Lanka and powered by LB Finance, one of Sri Lanka's most trusted financial institutions.
The motor show will showcase a diverse range of small cars, luxury sedans, all sizes of SUVs, powerful jeeps and even supercars.The show will include over 35 stalls and a total of over 200 brand new and reconditioned vehicles including hybrid and electric models.All the leading makes and models from Europe, Japan, Tailand and Australia will be present at the event.A broad selection of some of the finest classic cars in the island that are always a hit with automobile enthusiasts will also be made available.
The LB Big Wheels Motor Show is different to other motor shows in Sri Lanka primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, all vehicles displayed at the show will be models manufactured for the local market in the respective country of manufacture. It is widely known that vehicle manufacturers across the globe manufacture the best quality products for their domestic market. As the used car dealers of VIASL import domestic models of each make and model directly from these countries, these models are invariably of the very best quality in terms of safety standards, technology and features and are thereforefar superior to the export market models imported to Sri Lanka by franchise dealers. Secondly, during the event, LB Finance will be providing a host of special offers and deals that are tailor-made for the event, which are special rates below their current market rates.
Addressing the gathering at the press conference, Ranjan Peiris - President of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) stated, “The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka was formed almost 35 years ago with the objective of becoming the leading voice representing the brand-new and reconditioned automobile importers in Sri Lanka. While the LB Big Wheels Motor Show is our very first attempt in putting together such an event, we wanted to make sure that it does not become yet another, run-of-the-mill motor show. Therefore, we have made it a very focused effort to ensure that we educate the Sri Lankan consumer about the top-quality brand new and reconditioned vehicles all our association members bring down while through our Title Sponsor LB Finance we are able to assist prospective buyers to purchase their dream vehicle by taking advantage of the special offers and deals available at the show. Through this motor show, they will be able to purchase a high-quality vehicle at a reasonable price with the required Euro-6 standard that we strongly believe all vehicles in Sri Lanka should possess.”
