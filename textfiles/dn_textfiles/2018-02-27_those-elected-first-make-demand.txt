Those elected first to make demand

Usually, elections held in most countries provide a reason to rejoice. We recently held elections for 341 local authorities (24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils, 276 divisional councils). The total number of members in local government has been increased from 4,486 to around 8,356 members. The voter, this time around, cast a single vote for his or her party of choice at the ward level and was not required to choose a candidate of choice. What followed was unrelated to local government, local governance and local issues. We don’t even know yet the identities of those named to local bodies.
The SLPP came out in front with the UNP, SLFP, UPFA, ITAK etc. following thereon. We thereafter saw political turmoil at the centre. A large of majority of our populace likely has contempt and is sickened by what transpired. This is in a context where the UNP has 106 seats in the Parliament, while the combined strength of the two groups of the UPFA led by the President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa totals 95. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by Opposition Leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan holds the balance.
The number of votes collectively received by the two main parties in the Government at the local election exceeded that received by the SLPP, while the UNP losing its vote bank by 1.5 million compared to what they had polled in 2015. The UNP was attacked from within as has the ITAK in the North!
Economic challenges
This government has a shade under two years left in office. It has had to contend with extremely serious economic challenges. Whilst the 2015 mandate was for reforms there were significant achievements combined now with ever increasing delays.
It’s this writer’s view that we are over-governed by layer upon layer of elected bodies. Holding them to account is no small feat. More often than not the thread is lost in terms of accountability. The ultimate sufferers are citizens. They vent their frustrations for example at elections.
The bigger picture requires leaders keeping an eye on what matters most and working on those issues cutting across party lines.
I will give an example.
The Auditor General’s report on Public Debt management states -- “It is such a mess that, if we start to clear the mess now, maybe in about ten years we will be able to get a proper idea,” he said.- “Some loans we don’t even know if they have been paid in full or not, as we have been paying instalments and interest but proper records have been kept. “This is all we can say now, there are loans totalling to trillions, which we will uncover as we go on. The main one is the bond. The Finance Ministry does not record the face value of the bond issued, but when it matures we have to pay the amount. But this is not in our records now, and it is difficult to rectify this immediately,” he said.
“The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) estimates that about 4.7 million people of the 21 million population of Sri Lanka, or over one-fourth of the population, do not have sufficient food to sustain a healthy life.”
“Plants are the fundamental backbone of the world’s ecosystems. They nourish the atmosphere with oxygen produced via photosynthesis, and are crucial to maintaining the balance of the hydrological cycle”.
AG’s report
The AG’s report is mind-boggling. Part of the problem is why if any was needed, action not taken for close on a decade on a matter of National Debt? We have had innumerable COPE reports. Are we bereft of laws and institutions which are mandated to act if the law is violated? The Central Bank Governor calmed the waters a bit in an interview where he seemed to imply all was not that bad. Do we need an endless stream of Commissions to look into these matters?
The second and third set of issues highlighted is interrelated affecting farmers, people and the population as a whole at the mercy of climate change. It’s not merely a matter of fertilizer subsidies. While farmers are indebted our crops may not survive in the searing heat. It requires deep thought. Cape Town is scheduled to run out of water very soon. Can we escape such vagaries of the weather?
Over in the North the monolithic hold, the TNA/ITAK had on the electorate is no longer true. There are winds of change. The investment, commitments and the will to continue to focus on former conflict-affected areas will wane due political necessities in the rest of the country. Have the two PC’s made full use of the offices they hold? There is one caveat. Recognising and dealing with human losses and the manner in which it occurred cannot be erased. The longer it remains unanswered there will be discontent, unhappiness and grief. It's though becoming harder to sustain the early promise around issues of reconciliation etc.
Issues of justice and accountability are spoken in terms of action prevented from being taken etc. Can we plausibly say that law and order and justice are all determined by political masters and the Police, AG and Courts are at their beck and call? It's nonsensical. We then enter the realm of a despot dictator’s banana republic.
Passive sufferers
When corruption is discussed the reality nowadays is all contracts have commissions built into the cost/price. There are layers of beneficiaries and interestingly not all are politicians. The truth is corruption is endemic.
An unfortunate insight this writer had most recently was to the pure and simple individual ambitions of scores of politicians. It's primarily about trappings of power, earning potential and an occasional look in the direction what matters most and best for the country. However, the manner in which voters turned out recently is a sign that citizens are not inclined to be passive sufferers. Leadership though is sorely needed at all levels and not merely in government. This country has potential to do better. It also has the capacity to lose a whole lot more if politics continues to destabilize us.
