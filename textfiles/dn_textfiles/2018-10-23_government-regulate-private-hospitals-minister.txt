Government to regulate private hospitals: Minister

Private hospitals will be regulated by the government, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said that a case had recently been filed against the government's plans to regulate private hospitals, but all private hospitals would be regulated as planned in order to provide better health services to the public.
He was addressing a gathering at the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) sales agents’ get-together held recently in Colombo.
The minister said that the shortcomings of private hospitals needed to be corrected and added that instructions had been given to establish SPC outlets in every electorate.
The main objective was to open 150 SPC branches by 2020, he said.
It is to offer free and high-quality health services to people.
