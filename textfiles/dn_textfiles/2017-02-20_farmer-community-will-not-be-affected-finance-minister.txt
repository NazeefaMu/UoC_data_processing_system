Farmer community will not be affected: Finance Minister

No room will be left to affect the farmer community due to the decrease of duty on imported rice varieties, says Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. He pointed out that the responsibility of the government is to protect the consumer on one hand, while on the other hand to safeguard the farming community.
The minister expressed these views at a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone for a Dharmasalawa at Sri Kalyani Gangarama Temple in Mattakkuliya yesterday (February 19th). The Dharmasalawa will be built from the personal wealth of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at a cost of Rs. 25 million.
Speaking at the gathering, Minister Karunanayake said that serving the people without bias is the duty of true politicians. He said it is natural to target such politicians by the corruption taking place in the country when they attempt to fulfill the aspirations of the people. The minister also said that such baseless accusations would give more courage in the forward march towards serving the people.
The Finance Minister further expressed his views in this manner:
“Various factions make allegations that the cost of living has gone up. But as members of a government which abides by its policy to practice what is preached, we should say clearly that the prices of essential commodities are lesser than to that of the prices that prevailed in the market before January 8, 2015. Prices of 25 essential commodities were dropped under the 100 day programme of the Good Governance. Except rice prices, prices of all other goods are still unchanged,” he said.
“We removed the duty on imported rice.
“Accordingly, the dispute on the rice issue was brought to a minimal level. We are ready to take stern legal action against unscrupulous traders who attempt to sell rice at exorbitant prices,” he further said.
President Maithripala Sirisena is a leader who has a good awareness about agriculture. We took action to control the price of rice on the guidance of the President. At the same time, we should mention that no room would be left to affect the farmer community by the dropping of duty on imported rice.
Simultaneously, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been winning the international community today and is trying to strengthen the future of the country. We will be able to make a new change in the country in the near future,” the minister said.
Chief Incumbent of the Sri Kalyani Gangaramaya Ven. Kudaheelle Rathana thera, Ms. Mela Karunanayake and former Municipal Councillor Chaminda Aluthgedara and several others participated in the event.
