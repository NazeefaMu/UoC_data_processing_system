Rugby Referees Society appoints Charlie Brown for crucial ‘A’ division match

The Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) at a meeting held yesterday has decided to hire Charlie Brown to officiate the key Dialog ‘A’ division rugby match between Kandy SC and Havelocks SC at Nittawela on Sunday.
Earlier the SLRRS appointed Roshan Fernando to referee the match but at the request of Havelock SC who requested that an overseas referee be appointed as both teams are unbeaten for the season so far, the change was made.
Brown an Irishman is a top referee and has refereed in Sri Lanka earlier. He started refereeing in 2004 and has since refereed matches in America, P.R. China and other countries around Asia. Charlie joined CIS in 2012 and the Singapore Society of Rugby Union Referees. He is currently Singapore rugby development manager.
