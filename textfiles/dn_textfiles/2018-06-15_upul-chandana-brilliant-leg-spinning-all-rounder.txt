UPUL CHANDANA - a brilliant Leg Spinning all rounder

Leg spinning/googly bowling all-rounders are born and not easily found or made. That type of bowling is the most difficult art in the aspects of bowling.
In the pre Test era the best ever in this style of bowling produced by the country were Gamini Goonasena and C.I. Gunesekera and several others who I have mentioned in previous articles and need no reiterating.
Going down memory lane in addition to Goonasena and Gunesekera, surprisingly others who bowled this difficult art were all all rounders and defies explanation. After entering the elusive Test playing portals the best leg spinning all rounder that the country produced was D.Somachandra de Silva who also went on to captain the country.
Most captains inexplicably have little or no confidence in leg spinners and by not playing them, chop their careers that could have won games for the country and could be classed with this style in world cricket.
Buy their wickets
The axiom was that leg spinners have to buy their wickets. Meaning that they have to leak runs to dismiss batsmen. Most captains fearing and not wanting to concede runs rarely preferred going in with a leg spinner. That was cowardice, that was because they did not understand the mayhem a good leg spinner could cause, fooling batsmen and getting wickets.
Before going on to describe the prowess of CHANDANA, it would be of interest to mention the bulls eye throw by CHANDANA who was fielding as a substitute from square leg that hit the wicket and had England’s Alec Stewart run out by yards at the London Oval.
That Test ended in a historic victory for Sri Lanka with the 'Matara Mauler' Sanath Jayasuriya making a double hundred and the dashing Aravinda de Silva making a century. That was the Test match where the best off spinner in world cricket Muttiah Muralitheran took nine England wickets.
If not for CHANDANA hitting the wicket to run out Stewart, who knows Muralitheran would have gone on to capture 10 wickets in an innings and join the famous Jim Laker of England and Anil Kumble of India who have captured 10 wickets in an innings. On a lighter note, Muralitheran would surely love to hate CHANDANA!
From Mahinda College, Galle
CHANDANA began his cricketing career at Mahinda College, Galle and from poor beginnings. He lost his father when he was seven.
His was a big family of 10 and they had to make do with the earnings of his elder brother.
However it did not deter him, but made him determined to one day make good. Continuing to play the game and showing immense all round talent, his career progressed and it was not long when his dream of playing for the country materialized.
CHANDANA played many eye catching knocks as a hard hitting middle order batsman, taking blinding catches and mesmerizing batsmen with his spin magic.
His one disappointment was that being in the squad that won the World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan he was not given a game. The other was former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu.
One disappointment
He was delighted that he bowled and troubled great batmen of the calibre of Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar although troubling them but not being able to pocket them.
He began his international career in 2002 when he was named captain of the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team against Kenya in an unofficial Test series where his talent blossomed both in batting and bowling where he headed the averages.
One innings that he still remembers is the big hitting 92 he made at Bridgetown in Barbados chasing massive West Indian score of 300 plus to help his side win which put the century by Brian Lara and Chris Gayle’s 94 to second best.
I have been on tour with CHANDANA and I remember the fifty odd he made against Australia in one-dayer in Melbourne peppering a strong Australian attack. He is modest, no big talk and is easy going and I can vouch for his simplicity.

BATTING - TESTS 16 – RUNS 616 – HIGHEST 92 – FIFTIES – 2. ODI’S – 147 – RUNS 1627 – HIGHEST -89 – FIFTIES 5 – FIRST CLASS – MATCHES 165 – RUNS 6360 – HIGHEST 194 – HUNDREDS 8 –FIFTIES 36 – T20s 12 – RUNS – 157 – HIGHEST 36 – BOWLING – TESTS 16 – RUNS – 1525 – WKTS – 37 – BEST FIGURES – 6/179 – FIVE WKTS – 3 – TEN WKTS – 1 – ODI’S 147 – RUNS 4818 –WKTS 151 – BEST FIGURES – 5/61 FIVE WKTS 1 – FIRST CLASS – MATCHES 165 – WKTS – 469 – BEST FIGURES – 7/60 – FIVE WKT 20 – TEN WKTS – 1 – T20s – MATCHES – 12 – RUNS 257 – WKTS – 16 –BEST FIGURES 4/17.
