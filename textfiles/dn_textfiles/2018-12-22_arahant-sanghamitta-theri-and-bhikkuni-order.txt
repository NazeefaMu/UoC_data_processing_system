Arahant Sanghamitta Theri and Bhikkuni order

Arahant Sanghamitta Theri, who established the Bhikkuni Order in Sri Lanka has a very special recognition in Sri Lankan history and she has been highly respected for more than 2300 years in our country. Therefore, this poya day is unique to Sri Lanka as it commemorates the arrival of Bhikkuni Sanghamitta, daughter of one of the greatest sons of India, Emperor Asoka.
Her arrival is also of significance to Buddhists all over the world as Bhikkuni Sanghamitta brought a sapling of the Bodhi Tree from Buddha Gaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment after meditating for forty days under this holy tree. The sapling was planted in Mahamevnawa Park in Anuradhapura and today this Bodhi Tree is regarded today as the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world. Thousands of devotees come to Anuradhapura on Unduvap Poya day to pay homage to the sacred Bo tree and observe the five precepts in order to lead exemplary lives.
With Sanghamitta Theri came a contingent which included artisans from 18 trades. They were people skilled in architecture, masonry, jewellery making, irrigation, engineering and other sophisticated arts. They would transform Sri Lanka completely.
Her arrival was well received and Princess Anula was ordained as the 1st Bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka, followed by a thousand women from different ranks of society. Since then, Bhikkhuni Order continued to flourish for many centuries bringing about the wellbeing, status and contribution of women as well as the people in the country.
Disappearance
However, the Community of Bhikkunis eventually disappeared from the soil where it had originated as a result of many factors.
As for the Bhikkunis of the Theravada school, their most important centre was in Sri Lanka. Many details of the early days of the Bhikkuni community are given in our Chronicles. The Bhikkunis benefited from the Royal patronage for many centuries, and also from the material support of women of the aristocracy.
In 5th century AD, Sinhala Bhikkhunis are said to have gone to Nanking in China to start the Bhikkuni order. Bhikkhuni Tisara was the leader and conferred higher ordination upon over 300 Chinese nuns in 434 AD. The bhikkhunis living in Chendu in Sichuan province are convinced that they belong to the same Bhikkhuni order introduced to SL in the 3rd century BC by Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta. Inscriptions also indicate that the Bhikkuni order existed in Sri Lanka as late as the tenth century. There is no evidence that Bhikkunis of the Theravada tradition existed after the 10th Century.
Why did the Community of Bhikkunis disappear by end of 10th century while the Bhikkhu community continued existing? To answer the question, we need to consider little deeper some of the reasons for the disappearance of the Bhikkunis community from Sri Lanka.
First of all, we should understand that, even before 10th century, at several stages in the history of Buddhism in this country, the Community of Bhikkunis was weakened because of dissension among the monks.
Garudhammas
Due to the controversies among themselves, Bhikkus began to be divided into different schools (or nikaya) from the first century onwards. Each of these schools had its own Community of Bhikkus and its Community of Bhikkunis. When a school lost its influence or disappeared, the Bhikkunis of that school disappeared too. The eight Garudhammas were said to have been added to allow more acceptance of a monastic order for women, during the Buddha's time. They are controversial because they clearly put women in an inferior position and also because many Buddhists, especially those from the Modern Theravada view, have found evidence that the eight Garudhammas are not really from the teachings of Buddha. The Garudhammas made Bhikkunis dependent on the Community of Bhikkus. The Bhikkus could continue without any Bhikkunis, but the reverse was not possible. Going through the history, it seems that early Buddhism did not programme for an independent existence for the Community of Bhikkunis.
In some periods of history, there were nuns who received higher ordination only from the Community of Bhikkunis and did not receive the second ordination from the Community of Monks. This second ordination, of course, was part of the Garudhammas laid down for Bhikkunis at the very beginning of their Community.
Enthusiasm
Moreover, the Bhikkus who lived in forests (vanavasi) did not seem to manifest any enthusiasm when it came to helping the nuns. It is possible that from the very beginning, they would have thought nuns as an unnecessary element or even a hindrance to an ardent ascetic life.
In periods where the forest dwelling Bhikkus became very influential in the country sometimes even with royal admiration, they would not have recommended or encouraged the existence of the Community of Bhikkunis, nor did they would have advised Kings to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of that Community.
Invasions
But the most important factor for the disappearance of the Community of Bhikkunis, was the political warfare that the country had to face from time to time. Especially detrimental to Buddhism in Sri Lanka were the invasions that frequently came from South India.
At the end of the 10th century CE, the rulers of Sri Lanka were too weak to protect Anuradhapura, which was not only the capital city but also the religious centre of the country. Around 1014, there were serious defeats at the hands of Chola invaders who came from South India. They were anti-Buddhist and destroyed monasteries and other Buddhist sites.
During the period of these foreign occupation, chronicle records make no mention of a community of Bhikkunis.
This situation lasted until King Sanghabodhi Vijayabahu (1056 -1111) freed the country. He re-instituted Buddhist temples and brought back ordained monks from Burma together with some Sinhalese Bhikkus who had gone there during the time of occupation returned and re-established higher ordination in order to revive the Community of Monks.
However, the Chronicles do not say whether he or his successor, Parakramabahu I (1153—1186), tried to bring Bhikkunis from other countries like Burma in order to re- establish the Community of Bhikkunis. Even if those kings wanted to re-establish the Bhikkuni Community, that they could have done it, as there were no more credible Theravadin Bhikkunis in Burma or anywhere else.
