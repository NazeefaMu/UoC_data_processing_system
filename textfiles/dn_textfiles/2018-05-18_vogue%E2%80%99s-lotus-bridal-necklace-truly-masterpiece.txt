Vogue’s Lotus  bridal necklace,  truly a masterpiece

A grand necklace handcrafted by eminent master craftsmen using the finest quality 22 karat solid gold - an adornment that brings so much prestige, a valued family treasure beyond weddings is the dream of any bride who appreciates bridal jewellery of real value. In a day and age where that sound more like a description of wedding jewellery of yore, the awe-inspiring Lotus necklace outshines as the grandest 22 karat gold wedding jewellery of our times.
The symbol of purity, beauty and divinity, the exquisite Lotus is a deeply entrenched metaphorical element of Sri Lankan culture. With its strong association with spiritual awakening and faithfulness, the Lotus takes a supreme position among the Sri Lankans. The grand Vogue Lotus necklace, another masterpiece of Vogue Tusker Collection distinguishes itself from all the rest. A truly grand centerpiece- a padakkama-style pendant depicting an exquisite lotus blossom adorns multi strands of chains, which are held together by “Pure brilliance SWAROVSKI” Cubic Zirconia-studded gold beads denoting those of traditional beaded chains. The cascading delicate strands of thread like tassels, studded with Cubic Zirconia add to the stature of this divine masterpiece and it is topped up with a quarter sovereign Vogue Tusker Collection trade marked coin. It is truly a masterpiece only a legendary giant in the industry can - or dare to create in the current times.
Today, Sri Lankans tend to be very lavish with wedding celebrations. However, with a growing trend to spend colossal amounts on short-lived aspects of a wedding, some Sri Lankans appear to lose the foresight to invest in elements such as solid gold bridal jewellery that have been traditionally considered as sentimental and prestigious while being a lasting investment. With a view of re-awakening Sri Lankan traditions and values related to weddings, Sri Lanka’s most trusted bridal jeweller for generations - Vogue continually offers the best in bridal jewellery that can be enjoyed beyond weddings and handed down to the next generation with confidence.
Vogue Lotus necklace is a classic example that encompasses contemporary and traditional aspects of aesthetics and craftsmanship. Unmatched in design, stature and value in its own class, this classic creation is a milestone in the art of jewellery making. It is a creation painstakingly handcrafted by veteran craftsmen with decades of hands-on experience - a team moulded and guided by the legend, late Mr. Sarath Hemachandra, the founder Chairman of Vogue Jewellers. Today, such highly skilled craftsmen are fast disappearing from the industry, and we will soon feel the void without their handcrafted creations. Therefore, the value of this rare Lotus necklace is augmented further by the great aesthetics and exclusivity that is embodied in it.
This one-of-its-kind Lotus necklace - the exotic blossom of the Vogue Tusker Collection is available at the Vogue flagship showroom on Galle Road, Colpetty.
