The Body Shop launches Body Yogurts

The Body Shop in Sri Lanka launched its exciting new range of Body Yogurts with an intimate event at the Fairline Body Shop outlet. The Body Shop invited its clients from Colombo to join them at the launch, alongside special guest and popular lifestyle and beauty blogger Doll House Colombo. Rush Razzack is the face of Doll House Colombo; she spoke to guests about the benefits of body yogurts, and why she was already a fan of its versatility- in particular the premium quality Fair Trade ingredients used, and ease of application.
The Body Shop Body Yogurts were recently launched globally, with the promise of 48 hours of quick-absorbing lightweight moisture and a 100 percent vegan friendly tag.
