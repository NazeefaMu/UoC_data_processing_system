MAHESH GOONATILLEKE a stylish gloveman

There were wicket keepers that the country produced before and after gaining Test status who were top class and who could have equaled or outshone leading glovemen in world cricket.
Before cocking a snook at our detractors - the lords at Lord’s and being admitted a full member of the International Cricket Council, great men who wore the big gloves and stood with distinction were Ben Navaratne, Telus Fernandopulle, Mahes Rodrigo, Dr. H.I.K.Fernando, Ranjit Fernando and Russel Hamer.
After entering the portals of the big league came MAHESH GOONATILLEKE, Guy de Alwis, Amal Silva, Romesh Kaluwitharne, Kumar Sangakkara, Prasanna Jayawardene and Gamini Wickremasinghe. GOONATILLEKE although his stint in the game was short, he has legend status.
Wicket keepers of class
Scanning through the names it will be noticed that down the ages the country had produced wicket keepers of distinction whose work behind the stumps were astonishing, clever, stylish, safe and sound and were the pride of the country.
Wicket keeping is no easy job. It requires that the WK concentrates every minute and every ball. What is funny is that when slacks for a moment in concentration that snick is made, a stumping or a run out comes the wicket keeper’s way.
In addition a wicket keeper has a big responsibility and that is this : He has to read how the wicket is playing, whether it is conducive to pace or spin and proffer advice to the captain on how he should make the bowling changes. So it will be seen that the job of a wicket keeper is not a bed of roses.
Style and efficiency
Now to the first wicket keeper that Sri Lanka produced and stood behind after the country gained Test status and did so with great style and efficiency in the Inaugural Test against England at the P.Sara Stadium was MAHESH GOONATILLEKE.
GOONETILLEKE learnt his wicket keeping skills at St. Anthony’s College, Kandy, captaining the school in 1971 Those in the know of what wicket keeping was all about, saw in GOONATLLEKE, the manner in which he performed that a star has been born.
After donning gloves for the Peradeniya University, he joined the Colts Cricket Club on the invitation of a stalwart at the club and former Antonian opening batsman Ranjit Samarasekera who ended up as President of the club and also served on SLC in various positions.
One if not the best
This stylish wicket keeper who some saw him in his early years predicted that he had the talent of being one if not the best in the business in the country. After playing in four Tests and six one dayers, he had his career nipped in the bud when he decided to tour Apartheid South Africa with a rebel team that toured the Protea country in 1982.
That tour stunned the local cricket world because teams were banned from touring the Apartheid country. With Sri Lanka babes in Test cricket, it upset the apple cart and rocked the boat and the end result was that those who toured were slapped a ban for life.
That Rebel team that shamed the country needs mentioning.
It was led by Sri Lanka’s First Test Captain Bandula Warnapura and the other members were – Mahesh Goonatilleke, Lalith Kaluperuma, Ajit de Silva, Anura Ranasinghe, Flavian Aponso, Hemantha Devapriya, Lantra Fernando, Nirmal Hettiarachchy, Susantha Karunaratne, Bernard Perera, Bandula de Slva, Jerry Woutersz and Tony Opatha who was player/manager.
Has no regrets
However GOONATILLEKE has no regrets. On that tour he was delighted to meet some big name in South African cricket who could not show their superb talent on the world scene because the country was isolated from international sport due to the inhuman Apartheid.
When I toured South Africa with the Sri Lanka under-25 cricket team covering the tour for the ‘DAILY NEWS ‘ and ‘SUNDAY OBSERVER’ with photographer K.D.S. Gunesekera, I experienced what Apartheid was all about, although by that time the inhuman system had ended, yet practiced on the sly.
We were having our lunch in the company of the driver of the bus who was a black. Once lunch was over, the driver wanted the white guy who was serving the food to parcel the remnants for him to take it home.
Man’s inhumanity to man
What happened and what we saw next which was disgusting and a taste of Apartheid was to see the white guy dumping the remaining food in the thrash basket instead of offering it to the driver.
Man’s inhumanity to man.
GOONATILLEKE has no regrets that he made that tour. He says he was looking for an opening to earn more money and also see a new country.
On that tour he enjoyed meeting the big names in cricket in Vincent van der Bijl, Barry Richards, Jimmy Cook, Graeme Pollock and Clive Rice. They were all tremendous players and contesting them was an experience. Incidentally Pollock was one of the greatest left hand batsmen that the game has seen.
Allan Knott his idol
GOONATILLEKE’S idol was England’s wicket keeper Allan Knott. He admits he tried copying Knott’s style and it did him no good and his advice to all wicket keepers is not to try to copy any one, but to believe in ones natural talent.
After the ban was removed GOONATILLEKE served as a selector and also helped in developing talent where he worked with Romesh Kaluwitharne and Kumar Sangakkara, GOONATILLEKE a graduate does not take money from the players he trains. He has a successful garment business and lives a happy and contended life.
