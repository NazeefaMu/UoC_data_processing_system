Franco-German Human Rights Prize awarded to Abdul Saroor

The Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law will be awarded for the second time since its inception. It is granted to persons who show significant engagement in the protection and the promotion of human rights and the rule of law.
It was awarded for the first time in 2016 in Berlin by the German and French Foreign Ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Jean-Marc Ayrault to honour the work of 15 outstanding human rights activists from around the world, and will be taken forth on an annual basis.
The French and the German Embassies in Colombo announced, that this year, a Sri Lankan has made it into the rows of the 15 winners that have been selected by the two countries’ Foreign Ministries out of 36 applicants. Saroor,a human rights defender, specialising on women’s rights and empowerment and engaged in reconciliation work between Muslim and Tamil displaced communities has been selected.
Challenges faced by Shreen in her own experience of being forcibly evicted and displaced by the LTTE in 1990, along with members of her community, laid the foundation for her activism.
The medal will be awarded to Saroor by France's Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Jean-Marin Schuh and the German Ambassador, Jörn Rohde, in the presence of the chief guest, Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Monday, December 11, at the German Embassy.
