I banish conservative thinking to serve society: Wedaarachchi

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said he goes out of the box thinking to serve the society.
The minister was addressing a meeting with senior government officials in Tangalle recently.
Minister Wedaarachchi said: “I am willing to go beyond new and old models of ‘think tanks’ to deliver productive results to the society.”
“It is high time to think of a new model for “Think Tank”, one that takes full advantage of managing resources and some of the best practices from more established think tanks across the world,” Wedaarachchi said.
He said he is planning to set up a think tank on blue economy concept with a constructive policy, targeting a boomin the fisheries industry, by using the expertise of other ministries, institutes, freelance researchers, fisheries community and the public. The State Minister sketched up a roadmap for a sustained and ambitious urge from the government perspective towards reaping the benefits presented through the marine resources surrounding the island.
He is of the view that embracing the ‘Blue Economy’ concept via policy making in respective fields is key towards such an endeavour.
He emphasized the importance of a holistic approach towards such initiatives involving all stakeholders. This will not at all override the concept of Green Economy. The word “Blue” is new to the arena of economy, but nothing other than the colour of the Ocean packed with enormous resources, just as same as the formation of the blue colour by collection of various shades of colours, he said.
The minister said Sri Lanka is surrounded by sea which is 8 times larger than the land. However, we have to reconsider how much this great resource with high production capacity has been optimised to the economic development of the country, he said.
