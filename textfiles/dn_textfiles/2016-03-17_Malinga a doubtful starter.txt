Malinga a doubtful starter

KOLKATA: Sri Lanka's champion fast bowler Lasith Malinga looked a doubtful starter for today's (Thursday) opening World T20 match against Afghanistan at Eden Gardens here.
"We are yet to get a 'yes' or a 'no' from the team physio. Malinga will have a net session tomorrow to test his bowling out and we will get to know his condition. He bowled a couple of overs today with his short run up. He will bowl with his full run up tomorrow then the physio will assess his fitness and let us know," said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
