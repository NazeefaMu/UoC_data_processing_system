‘Fair & Lovely Men’, MCA ‘B’ Div. 50-Over League final: MAS Silueta takes on Power-Tech Cement

Unbeaten, MAS Silueta and Power-Tech Cement advanced to the final of the 01st 'Fair & Lovely Men' Trophy, MCA 'B' Division 50-Over League Tournament 2018.
In the semi finals worked off over the week end, MAS Silueta beat Commercial Credit 'B' by 06 runs on the DLS Method and Power-Tech Cement took sweet revenge over John Keells 'B',beating them by 07-wickets.
Both Matches were played on October 7. The top half semi final between MAS Silueta and Com. Credit 'B' at MCA grounds was abandoned without a ball being bowled and went on to the reserve day, October 8.
The bottom half semi final between John Keells 'B' and Power Tech Cement at FTZ Katunayake too was marred by rain, but managed a result.
The match got off to a late start and reduced to 47 overs-a-side. John Keells 'B' came into the game 'Cock-a- hoop' having beaten Power Tech Cement by 09 wickets on the DLS Method in the league stage on September 25 at MCA. Power Tech won the toss and elected to field; their decision proved absolutely correct, as John Keells treaded on a mine field and got caught in the cross fire of Lahiru Fernando (10-01-29-5) and Dasun Seneviratne (4.5-15- 3) and were all out for a paltry 149 runs in 44.5 overs.
With evening showers in their mind, Power-Tech raised to their target in a double quick time reaching 151 for 3 in 21.3 overs with Malindu Maduranga hitting a brisk 50 and Dineth Thimodaya stroking a fine 40.
John Keells 'B' – 149 (44.5) (R. Kodituwakku 24, K. Bandara 39, Lahiru Fernando 5/29, Dasun Seneviratne 3/15)
Power Tech Cement – 151 /3 (21.3) (Malindu Maduranga 50, Dineth Thimodaya 40, M. de Silva 28 not out, Dasun Seneviratne 20 not out, S. Perera 2/47)
The top half semi final played on the reserve day was once again marred by bad weather. The match got off to a very late start, reduced to 34 overs a side. Commercial Credit, sent into bat struggled for runs and managed only 120 runs for the loss of 05 wickets.
As the heavens opened once again, MAS Silueta faced a new target of 149 in 29 overs (RPO 5.13).
In order to keep up with the required DLS par score they kept on losing wickets in regular intervals. As the wickets were tumbling on one side, 'Mr. Reliable', Denuwan Rajakaruna (24 not out) doggedly held on when the rains came down again to terminate the match with the score board reading 115 for 7 in 22 overs, MAS Silueta 06 runs ahead of DLS par score.
Commercial Credit 'B' - 120/5 (34) ( A. Inham 51 not out, Anura Dias 29, D. Hemantha 3/26)
MAS Silueta (given a revised target of 149 in 29 overs) - 115/7 (22) (Denuwan Rajakaruna 24 not out, N. Madushanka 22, D. De Silva 3/17, M. Fernando 2/31)
The final between MAS Silueta and Power-Tech Cement will be held on October 14 at the MCA Grounds, commencing 10.00 am. MAS Silueta beat Power Tech Cement by 25 runs on the DLS Method in their league stage match at the same venue on October 4.
