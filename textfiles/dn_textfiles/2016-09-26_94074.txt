Lyceum, Wattala crowned 2016 Under 17 Division Three Champions

Lyceum-Wattala, an international-school that dominated in cricket among the international schools in the island over the years winning the International School’s U19 Championship in 2015 and 2016 took another big step forward when they won the 2016 Under 17 Division Three Championship September 19(Monday) at Thurstan ground becoming the first international school to claim a championship of a tournament conducted by SLSCA.
St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena who were beaten by 13 runs in the finals became runners-up after a great game of positive cricket in which both teams fought till the end for the supremacy. Lyceum on their way to this championship beat Kekirawa MV and Galahitiyawa Central and finally St.Benedict in the final round.
A combined batting-effort, after Lyceum won the toss and took the first lease, with a well-made 55 from Shabik Ifthary followed by three more decent knocks by Shaleem Usama (43), Chandima Gayan (32*) and Pasal Eshan (37) put Lyceum on a strong footing with an imposing score of 270 though they were bowled out inside fifty overs. Irushan Saranga (4/43) and Buddhima Wijesundara (2/38) bowled well for St.Benedict. Lyceum’s final total would have been an enormous one had they batted out full fifty overs.
St.Benedict’s who won the final berth beating Wickramabahu and Royal Institute in the final round got off to the exact start they needed in pursuit of this bigger target scoring 115 for three halfway through their innings. After Deshan Vimukthi (68) and Nisalka Fernando (56) provided the initiative in a sensible approach Chandima Gayan batted-out the full fifty overs to remain unbeaten on a solid late flourish of 29, but eventually they fell short by a mere 14-run to loss the final by 13 runs. Imantha Fernando and Imashu Malinga shared 5 wickets between them to lead a bowling attack that in the end won the match and the championship both for Wattala International school.
Lyceum :270 in 43.5 overs (Shabik Ifthary 55, Shaleem Usama 43, Chandima Gayan 32*, Pasal Eshan 37, Irushan Saranga 4/43, Buddhima Wijesundara 2/38)
St. Benedict’s : 257/7 in 50 overs (Deshan Vimukthi 68, Nisalka Fernando 56, Chelaka Jayalath 29*, Imantha Fernando 2/44, Imashu Malinga 3/51)
