If your husband is not willing to claim the amount, you can ask him to say it in writing by way of an affidavit. Then you can recall the case again by filing a motion and withdraw your appeal notice. You can record these facts in court. However, the court may consider all the facts and make an order.
Violation of Right to Equality
Question
I am a government officer attached to a department. I sat for a promotion exam with an interview and scored high marks. Recently, I got to know some officers who scored less marks than me and same marks have received said promotions in Colombo and outstations. I inquired from my department head, but they avoided and didn’t respond. I feel that my right to equality has been violated. Can I file a human rights case in court to get my promotion?
Senarath - Polonnaruwa
Answer
You can file a Fundamental Rights case under article 12(1) of the Constitution on Violation of Right to Equality before the Law and discriminating you by giving promotions for the same marks holders and less marks holders in your department. The Supreme Court has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right. You have to file the case within one month. You can also complain to the Human Rights Commission and also to the Public Service Commission.
Entitlements of a Life Interest holder
Question
I have a house with an upstair. I gifted the ground floor to my elder daughter, reserving my life interest 5 years ago. Now she has stopped the water supply to the upstair and she also harasses me in many ways. My husband has also passed away. She is threatening me to leave. My son is also angry with me because I gifted this house only to my daughter. What is the legal remedy available to me as I am the life interest holder?
Samadara - Wijerama
Answer
As you have reserved life interest you are entitled to enjoy benefits in the property. If your daughter is trying to interrupt your life interest, then you can go to courts establish your right to life interest. You can revoke the deed of gift given to your daughter, proving her gross ingratitude towards you in court. You can go to the nearest LAC Centre for further assistance.
