Govt paving way for foreign interferences - Eliya Convener

Eliya Organisation Convener Ven. Prof. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera said the government is now paving the way for foreign interferences into the country's domestic affairs.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday,Ven. Abhayatissa Thera said the loss from the bond issue which amounts to around Rs 11,145 million will affect the country’s economy negatively.
"The problem won’t be solved by naming Arjun Mahendran or Ravi Karunanayake in the Bond Commission report. Whenever the economy is destroyed, we will have to beg from the other countries,"the thera said.
The imperialists want to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to achieve their interests. Their aim was not to ensure prosperity for Sri Lankan people through the so called January 8, 2015 revolution,but to allow Diaspora groups to carve out the separate state.
"They want the Prime Minister to implement the Federal Constitution. That is why many western countries directly contributed for the regime change on January 8, 2015 and We can already see the results as the Hambantota Magampura port now has a Chinese flag in the main position," he said.
The country will be trapped-in-debt- when the economy is destabilised after selling our resources. Both UNP and the SLFP must held responsible for hunting war heros, selling national assets and an attempt for creating separate state through the new Constitution.
He further said that JVP always sabotages any attempt to rebuild the country by misleading the people. Although, that JVP promised to 'regulate' the Yahapalana government if it goes on the wrong path,it has not happened yet even after the lapse of three years.Now people have to decide on February 10, whether they will further support to destroy the country or rebuild the country. Veteran artiste Shriyantha Mendis said that imperialists who destroyed Sri Lanka in the past are repeating it in a different ways today. Both rulers are indeed moving the country backward today.Therefore, We urge the public to take a correct decision at this election for the sovereignty of the country,” he added.
