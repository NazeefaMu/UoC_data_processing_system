Splash, splat an aqua balloon battle bash!

What I miss seeing most is screaming kids running around uninhibited, freely wheeling, causing chaos and raising cane which is how my generation grew up. We got the bumps and bruises to show for it. I call this thing active free play.
More than half a century may have passed since those adventuresome times of our own childhood but we boomers often revel in conjuring up those exciting images with an aching nostalgia. Sad really, because play time is in short supply for children these days and the lifelong consequences for growing children can be more serious than many people realise.
Unfortunately, children today are not given the freedom to frolic. Are their opportunities for free play the same as ours were? Emphatically not! Spending hours riding a bike, climbing trees and exploring their environs are no longer part of everyday life for many kids. They are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children.
They are not enjoying the opportunities to play outdoors that our parents would have thought of as normal when we were growing up. I am not talking about regimented extra-curricular sports activities organised by most schools under the supervision of coaches. Organised sports are imperative, but so are spontaneous romps through mud puddles, climbing trees and catching fish in nearby streams. Flashbacks often pop up in our minds of we as children racing towards a large mango or other indigenous tree and hauling ourselves up on to the lower branches and then scrambling up as high as we could get.
We loved our contact sports, colliding with one another without safety gear or, for the most part, any structured set of rules about how and where one could smash an opponent. We called concussions ‘Stunner Stars’ and stoically cajoled the injured party to ‘walk it off,’ as if somehow walking would make your star-spangled head feel better. Sure, we may have diced with death and injury on a daily basis. We realise now that by today’s safety standards, every baby boomer should have been dead by the time we were 12.
We defied danger on a daily basis. We never knew that we were doing risky things, of course. We just thought that we were having fun. Nonetheless, we spent our days immersed in activities that we’d never for a second allow our children or grandchildren to do. Or even think about doing.
At a recent luncheon get-together I decided to give the kids a chance to enjoy the daring frolicking of my own childhood. But if you, like me, are the type who cares for a bit of asinine over-indulgence, then we seem to be on the same wavelength. You see, with a little imagination and temerity you can be assured of a memorable yahoo free-for-all fun with the kids and achieve near immortality as an incomparable avuncular hero. Observing the horde of kids languishing in boredom I was zapped by a burst or rather splash of inspiration.
Remember our childhood days when nothing constituted a scream like pulling out the garden hose and going a little bonkers in the yard while watering the grass? Getting blasted with a stream of cold water on a hot dog-day afternoon is a thrill for any kid – or anyone attempting to escape the heat, for that matter. From water bazookas and Super Soaker water guns to buckets and garden hoses, I taught the brats to discover the wet and wild delights of a modern water fight. And it’s not for the faint hearted!
Another great way to beat the heat is a good old fashioned wet and wild day with a water balloon conflict.
The simplest ideas are often the greatest and with prevailing sanity came the thought of the most humble and effective ballistic ever invented: The water bomb. The formula for fashioning one is no big deal either. Simply fill a balloon with tap water and tie a knot at its mouth. And presto! You're ready for battle.
Water balloon battles could be considered one of the most exciting games imaginable. To tell the truth they are simply irresistible for both kids and bratty adults. Plan them with a group of adults, the next time you have a get-together, and see them getting all charged up, cheery and uncontrollable like kids. There was a moment's astonished silence as the water balloons burst on impact, showering their contents in a silvery cascade on opponents.
Yet, getting nailed over and over again with bursting balloons until the backs of their legs were red and their clothes were soaked would rank as one of the very best memories of their childhood. At the moment, however, it was a blast, even though it kind of hurt and seemed it would take them forever to come down off the adrenaline they worked up trying to dodge that sweet sting of bursting latex-encased liquid. The impromptu event was also the ultimate in imperfect science, while the adversaries had hardly the time or patience to figure out the amount of force necessary to soak the enemy.
Certainly, by epic Homeric battle tradition the gods appeared to have looked out over the fighters, making their legs swift with courage and their arms sharp with thrust. No individual faces could be seen in the haze of violent action. Neither were gender differences evident as the combatants gave no quarter in the confrontational fun. The girls around 11 were togged out in shorts and t-shirts - ideal battle gear to drench and be drenched.
In all, it took speed and strength and skill and courage as the contenders faced one another with shrieking battle cries that resounded across the lawn. It was full scale war where you might get sprinkled, sprayed, or saturated. But watch out, retaliation comes quickly!
Ryan, 6, the littlest warrior, like brave Odysseus before him, grabbed three water balloons and thrust them like daggers into oncoming enemies. He was targeting an older boy who he called “Boogerface’ and his sole aim was to “douse him to his Spiderman briefs”. His older cousin, a pretty 11-year-old held her fire until she was certain she had her main male antagonist in the cross-hairs of her sights. But all was not daring and vigour. The worthless coward she pursued with grim determination, fled from the battlefield and dove frightened into a herbaceous hedge
And finally, fighters were discouraged from head shots and told to ‘aim lower,’ which means a good many adolescent male warriors were constrained to cover their groins with their palms – not the most dignified nor practical method of retreat while fleeing for their lives. At the end of the monumental conflict the fighters, soaked and panting with exhaustion, noticed that all of the ammunition was gone. What remained of them were scattered shards of latex, strewn about the battlefield. Watching the kids revel in the battle was magnificently restorative to my jaded senses and one of life's sweetest moments.
