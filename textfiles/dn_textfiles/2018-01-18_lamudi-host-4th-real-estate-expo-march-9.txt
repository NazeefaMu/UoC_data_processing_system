Lamudi to host 4th Real Estate expo on March 9

Sri Lanka’s leading online property portal, Lamudi.lk is proud to host its 4th Real Estate Exhibition on the 9th and 10th of March 2018 at the Taj Samudra Hotel, starting from 10 am onwards. The event will welcome a plethora of leading developers, buyers, investors, sellers and industry experts, offering participants a one-stop-shop for their real estate needs.
Lamudi.lk’s 3rd Real Estate Exhibition took place in June 2017 was a very well received and successful event. The event was an ideal avenue for over 1,000 visitors to fulfill their property needs by meeting experts from different facts of real estate industry, all under one roof.
While Blue Ocean, Global Housing, Summerlands, Raintree Residencies, Dusit Thani, Iconic Galaxy and Prime Group exhibited Luxury & Mid-range apartment projects, Sanken showcased Mixed developments (residential and commercial) projects. Singer offered lifestyle products and RIU & Acquest highlighted Research and agent facilities.
The 4th Real Estate Expo will double-down on the success of the third edition and will bring Sri Lanka’s leading realtors, developers, agents and real estate research companies under one roof. The event aims to simplify the process of buying and selling properties, by allowing property seekers and sellers to browse through the wide variety of residential and commercial projects, meet real estate professionals personally and receive latest updates on the current real estate industry. Real Estate in Sri Lanka has witnessed a secular rise in demand aided by the growth of Sri Lanka’s economy, improvements in infrastructure, access to the latest technologies and the growth of the internet in the country. Demand is expected to remain strong in 2018, further boosted by the rapid shift of mid-income individuals to the high middle-class income.
Lamudi.lk endeavors to provide not only online means of accessing and searching for property, connecting buyers and seller, it also strives to connect offline property seekers with developers across the island through such real estate exhibitions, giving visitors access to both online and offline properties. Launched in 2013, Lamudi is a global property portal focusing exclusively on emerging markets.
