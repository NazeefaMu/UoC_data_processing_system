Pillars of  strength

Head Prefect of Zahira College Mafaz Mihular, is a man who believes in making the right choices in life and being held accountable for ones actions. Perfect Prefects features Mihular who feels that as humans we all have the potential to be so much more than what we are now.
Zahira College is a Sri Lankan leading Muslim school which inculcates with multi- cultural values of our nation according to Islamic principles. The importance of Brotherhood, Obedience, Persistence and Patriotism has molded and lead him to be the Head Boy.
Islam has had a huge influence in his life. It has taught him to be the kind of man the world places their hope and faith in.
Decision-making
“The Islamic teachings I value in life are the very qualities of our beloved Prophet Muhammed such as Motivating people, Affection and sympathy to the followers , Conviction, Self esteem, Awareness of accountability, Unbiased, Swift decision making powers, Empathize with people undergoing hardships, Effective Communication and the ability to consolidate material, Executing strategy, Planning long term goals. And the scripture that I read to understand the leadership values in Islam is the one and only Holy Quran,” said Mihular.
Mihular believes in being tough on crime and fighting injustice. In the world we live in many young people believe that they can do as they like and get away with it. They must be given a clear message that transgressing the law will carry its punishment. You break the rules and you try to hurt other people you will go behind bars. If you knowingly join organizations that commit violent acts you have to face the music.
“No system of governance will be ideal, if punishments are not sentenced for corruptions. And the development of a country is not dependent on the system of the Government, but it depends on the attitude, Norms and values that every citizen follows,” explained Mihular.
We live in a day and age when some youth do not place value on education. It is only after they miss the opportunity that they realize how foolish they have been. Education allows you to understand how the world works. It teaches you how to become a citizen of the world. How to converse with people. How to contribute to a conversation. How to be knowledgeable. It helps you understand people. It gives you control over your life. No education means no control. And no control means you are in serious trouble.
Practical life
“I consider my education as a part of practical life, since it has taught me to make decisions effectively and efficiently. As a business studies student, information gathering, evaluation and time management have dramatically improved my quick decision making skills,” explained Mihular
Like those before in this column, he feels that his fellow prefects are his strength. Their backing is something he counts on.
“Even though I’m the Head Prefect, I believe that gathering my fellow colleagues and explaining to them the real situation would result in the best possible solution ever to be made, this is my game plan, and this is my strategy,” said Mihular.
Equality between the sexes is something that indicates the society is progressive. These days women have conquered all field previously male dominated.
Equal rights
“From the lessons I have learned in the practical world regarding women’ issues and rights, some are that they should not be discriminated and should be given equal rights like Men. In this 21st century ‘women power’ should be encouraged and accepted by our community,” pointed out Mihular.
Mihular feels that scarcity of resources which leads to poverty, corruption and other issues make him want to stand up and do something about it. He tries to keep in mind not to waste food, time and other resources. He says that there should be Awareness Programs on Poverty alleviation, minimizing resource wastage and looking at resources which are not optimized.
Faith in his lord and faith in himself is what has enabled him to become a Leader. He believes in himself and he believes in something greater than himself.
“My words to my younger brothers and sisters is ‘Believe in yourself and have your own strategy when working on a plan. Be conceptual, and tactically implement your strategy after understanding your stakeholders’. As a leader give first priority to your followers before taking decisions. Have a good bond with your stakeholders, and adapt to the changes in the Environment,” stated Mihular.
Mihular also looks at other religious leaders and their philosophies when debating as to what to do when a pressure situation arises.
“It makes me recall the quote of the Buddha saying “With our thoughts we make the world”, Being optimistic and thought preventive is the only way I calm myself. I trust on Time, because it heals everything,” said Mihular .
Tower of strength
“First and foremost, I would like to thank Almighty Allah. My Parents and my grandparents who were a tower of strength. Our College Principal Trizviiy Marikkar, Our vice Principal and the Master In charge of the Board of Prefects, M T A Rauf and all the other respective Vice Principals for sharing me their wisdom. My teacher Dayal Jayathilaka who taught me the practical way of life, my English teacher Meadows who played the role of a Mother in times of hardship and all the other teachers who motivated me to follow my dreams. Finally, my Board of Prefects who were behind my every success.”
