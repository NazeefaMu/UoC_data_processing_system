England’s Vince determined to enjoy Test debut

LEEDS, TUESDAY: England's James Vince said Tuesday he was determined to enjoy his Test debut come what may at Headingley this week.
The Hampshire batsman is in line to fill the middle-order vacancy created by the shock retirement of James Taylor with a heart condition last month, when the first of a three-Test series against Sri Lanka starts at Yorkshire's headquarters in Leeds, northern England, on Thursday.
Vince, 25, has been compared to former England captain Michael Vaughan because of his batting style and there is also the view that he too will thrive in international cricket despite a solid rather than spectacular county record. Now Vince, who has already played limited overs cricket for England, is looking forward to seeing if he can make the step up to Test cricket. AFP
