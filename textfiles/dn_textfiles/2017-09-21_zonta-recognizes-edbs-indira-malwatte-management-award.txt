Zonta recognizes EDB's Indira Malwatte for management award

When public sector officials are hardly recognized for their contribution to national development, particularly management of public organizations and meeting set goals, Zonta has recognized Indira Malwatte, Chairperson and Chief Executive of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), for the Woman of Achievement award in Management for her outstanding contribution in reorganizing the EDB to meet new challenges and adopting a model of private-public sector partnership in developing and promoting exports and her 40 years' commitment in the export sector. The Zonta awards on recognizing 'Woman of Achievement' reinforces their commitment to acknowledging women’s contribution to the national economy.
The Zonta Club of Colombo has actively recognized and celebrated women who have achieved outstanding success in Sri Lanka in their respective fields of work.
Incidentally Malwatte is the first woman Chairperson and Chief Executive in the 38-year history of the EDB, which is indicative of the importance the Government gives to gender equity.
