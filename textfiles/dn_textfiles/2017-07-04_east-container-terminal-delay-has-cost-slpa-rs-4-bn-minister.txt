East Container Terminal delay has cost SLPA Rs 4 bn - Minister

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) during the last two years has lost approximately Rs.4 billion due to the delay in completing the East Container Terminal (ECT), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
However, SLPA is to come up with an ambitious plan to develop and market the Colombo port whilst taking necessary arrangements to fast track the delayed development work on ECT.
“This is the money that could have been earned by the Ports Authority easily. It is a shame that we have wasted two years in not developing the East terminal. As you know the previous government went through a tender process and Cabinet approval was also received.
It was a question of implementing it. When this government came into power it was put on hold; we were not able to start the development that was needed so that the East Terminal could be made use of.
“I’m the minister responsible and as such I will always express my point of view. Finally it is up to the government and the Cabinet ministers to take a collective decision. I have instructed the SLPA Chairman and the Board to give thought to this and come up with a strategy giving priority for this development of the East Terminal,” Samarasinghe said.
In addition, planned have been made to embark on a comprehensive national maritime policy to regularize industry activities and to address the key issues that hamper the industry growth to a greater level.
Moreover, SLPA is in the process of drafting a National Port Master Plan.
