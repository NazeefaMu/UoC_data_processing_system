Tight security in Kataragama to protect devotees

Tight security is established around the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya and Sella Kataragama Devalaya, and its outskirts to protect devotees from unruly elements. Kataragama Police sources said a special police team is deployed to protect devotees from being fleeced by guesthouse owners.
The police request devotees to be vigilant about pickpockets who haunt sylvan shrines and traders who ruthlessly harass and fleece devotees.
The police said the Pooja sellers cause inconvenience to devotees.
