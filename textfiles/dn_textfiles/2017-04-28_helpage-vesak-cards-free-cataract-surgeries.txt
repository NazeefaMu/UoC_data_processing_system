HelpAge Vesak cards for free cataract surgeries

The name of HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) comes to the minds of people, especially who send HelpAge Vesak Greeting cards to their loved ones during Vesak seasons.
Like in previous years, this year also HelpAge has printed 50,000 new designs of greeting cards to coincide with the forthcoming Vesak festival. The proceeds from card sales will be utilized to perform free cataract surgeries and free mobile medical and Eye camps for underprivileged Senior Citizens.
The greeting cards are adorned with 10 colourful graphic designs and depict the important events from the Buddha’s Birth to Parinibbana.
HASL’s Fundraising Manager, Ruchilalani Batuwantudawa said the cards are printed on Linen Board and are sold at very affordable prices. She said for large orders customers can have their official logo printed on cards free of charge.
HASL, Executive Director, Samantha Liyanawaduge said many underprivileged people in the country are not in a position to go for cataract surgeries in private hospitals due to unbearable cost. “We therefore utilize the proceeds from the sales of cards to conduct free cataract surgeries for Elders at HelpAge Eye Care Hospital, no- 14, Sinsapa Road, Wellawatta, Colombo 6.
Cards are available at all leading book shops and Super Centres and at HASL Head office at no- 102. Pemananda Mawatha, Raththanapitiya , Boralesgamuwa.
