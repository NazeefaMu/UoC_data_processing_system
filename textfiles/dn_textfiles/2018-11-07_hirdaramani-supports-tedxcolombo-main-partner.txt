Hirdaramani supports TEDxColombo as main partner

Promoting its culture of knowledge and learning, the Hirdaramani Group sustained its partnership with TEDxColombo at a ceremony held recently at Nelum Pokuna, as main partner for the fourth year in a row.
This year’s TEDxColombo was themed ‘I, You, We’ and focused on sparking an actionable understanding of identity and how it can be used as a tool for building empathy, trust and solidarity within and across cultures. TEDxColombo talks have sparked curiosity and innovation amongst listeners in Sri Lanka and echoes Hirdaramani’s pursuit of innovation in its own operations and in its interactions with the wider society.
The speakers at the event encompassed renowned individuals who embody the spirit of innovation, who shared their views on the implications of behaviour, the psychology of an aesthetic world, the fluidity of how we communicate and the power of storytelling. TEDxColombo speakers are innovators from the field of Data Science, Arts, Architecture, Behavioural Psychology, Activism and technology. Reaching over 1200 people in the flesh, and many more through livestream, TEDxColombo celebrated its 8th year in 2018 as one of Sri Lanka’s oldest and largest TEDx events.
“Hirdaramani was proud to continue as the main sponsor of TEDxColombo for the fourth consecutive year. TEDxColombo 2018 explored the theme of collaborative ‘community’ needed to create an exciting future for Sri Lanka. This year’s theme was particularly interesting as it related to the Group’s core sustainability in business strategy and complements the work we do with various communities around Sri Lanka. More and more we see that the future is about collaboration and not isolationism if we are to successfully surmount emerging challenges,” commented Siddarth Hirdaramani - Director, Hirdaramani Group.
Safra Anver Licensee and Organizer, TEDxColombo said, “We are thrilled to have Hirdaramani as our pillar of support for over 4 years as we continue to grow this exciting initiative in Colombo. TEDxColombo is all the richer for support of innovative partners like Hirdaramani who understand the value and inspiration that this annual event brings to listeners. This year, we are particularly pleased to explore the calibre of collaborative ‘community’ we wish to create for the future of Sri Lanka through art, entertainment, data science, behavioural psychology and technology.”
