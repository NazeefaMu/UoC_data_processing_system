Compensation for wild elephant attack victims increased

Compensation to be paid to the next of kin of a person killed by wild elephants will be increased by Rs. 300,000 Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said.
The Deputy Minister said the compensation for wild elephant attack victims will be increased from the current Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 500,000. Speaking at a public event in Moneragala, Jayasena said the proposal in this regard will be presented to Cabinet by Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera.
The minister said efforts will be taken to build electric fences in all identified areas, following a threat assessment. She said building electric fences covering another 40 kilometres in the Moneragala district has already begun.
Compensation given to property damage due to wild elephant attacks too will be streamlined, she said.
