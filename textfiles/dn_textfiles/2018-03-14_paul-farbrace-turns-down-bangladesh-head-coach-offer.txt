Paul Farbrace turns down Bangladesh head coach offer

England assistant coach Paul Farbrace is believed to have turned down an offer to become Bangladesh head coach.
Farbrace quit as Sri Lanka coach in 2014 to take up his role with England under Peter Moores.
The 50-year-old former Kent wicketkeeper then stayed in position after Trevor Bayliss replaced Moores.
