Four-year-old drowns in Minuwangoda

A four-year-old boy named A.D. Deneth Chandira had drowned in an unprotected well in Minuwangoda on December 6. Police investigations revealed that his mother had bathed him at the well earlier. While she was dressing the boy, some people had visited the house and she had gone to talk to the visitors. Meanwhile, unknown to the mother, the boy had gone to the well and attempted to draw a bucket of water and fallen inside.
The mother, who went in search of the boy, seeing him inside the well, quickly took him out and took him to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on admission. The Benmulla inquirer into sudden deaths returned a verdict that the death was due to asphyxiation.
