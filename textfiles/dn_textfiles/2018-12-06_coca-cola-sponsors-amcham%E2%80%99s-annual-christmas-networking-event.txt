Coca-Cola sponsors AMCHAM’s annual Christmas Networking Event

The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka (AmCham) recently held its annual Christmas Networking Evening at the Mövenpick Hotel in Colombo.
The event was graced by the presence of the U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Alaina B. Teplitz, and was also attended by representatives from a variety of organizations who have worked closely with the chamber throughout the year.
Founded in 1992, The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka brings together over 400 members representing 267 leading Sri Lankan and American companies based in Sri Lanka. The chamber plays an important role in fostering stronger ties between Sri Lanka and the United States of America, whilst supporting trade, business and investment activities between both countries.
The main sponsor of this year’s event was Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd, a long-time member of AMCHAM in Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola’s journey in Sri Lanka began 57 years ago and today the brand has become one of the best-loved beverages in the market. The company plays a key role in contributing to economic growth and is dedicated to empowering communities, engaging in water stewardship programs and recycling PET plastic across Sri Lanka.
