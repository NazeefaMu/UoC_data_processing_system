MP highlights woes of Laggala residents

The Moragahakanda Project leaves many a problems unsolved in the Laggala area, UNP MP Rohini Kaviratne said.
"People in the Laggala area have many problems regarding obtaining water for irrigation and for drinking," Kaviratne said.
"Water in the Bowathenna and We-medilla resoviors is diverted from the Laggala area. We are left with dejection only. I request President Maithripala Sirisena to utilise this water only after providing water for irrigation purposes in Laggala," Kaviratne said."Otherwise, people in Laggala will be forced to do fishing instead," Kaviratne added.
