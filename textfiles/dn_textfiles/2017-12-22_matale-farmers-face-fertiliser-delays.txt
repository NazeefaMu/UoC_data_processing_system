Matale farmers face fertiliser delays

Although nearly 50,000 acres have been brought under paddy cultivation under large and small-scale irrigation schemes in the Matale District during the current Maha Season, farmers have faced great inconvenience due to their inability to obtain fertiliser for their paddy lands in time.
The situation had aggravated as they have not received adequate supplies from the Agrarian Service Centre in the area. Farmers said they are yet to receive the fertiliser subsidy from the government. Private sector traders have cashed in from the situation by hiding available fertiliser stocks and selling it at black market prices.
Farmers said private traders charged Rs. 5,500 per bag containing 50 kg of urea. State officials maintained stoic silence when questioned about the fertiliser subsidy and as such, they had fallen into dire straits, unable to bring the grown paddy under proper care. Farmers said they had to skip the past two Maha Seasons without planting their lands due to lack of rain.
Although they had cultivated their lands this Maha Season after receiving rains in time, they had faced unexpected difficulties, being unable to obtain their fertiliser requirements. They request authorities to intervene in this matter and rush fresh paddy stocks to their areas.
