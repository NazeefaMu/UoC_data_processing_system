Amaya Resorts & Spas welcomes 2018

Amaya Resorts and Spas celebrated in style and simplicity to say goodbye to 2017 and welcome 2018 with a bang. Each of the resorts had their own way of celebrating NYE with their patron guests such as sit down dinners at Amaya Langdale, buffets at Amaya Hunas Falls, Amaya Lake and of course a grand NYE party featuring DADDY and Yes FM DJs at Amaya Hills.
Here are some highlights.
