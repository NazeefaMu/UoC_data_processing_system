Raid rounds up 48 child beggars in Kataragama

Children begging in the Kataragama sacred area were taken into custody by officers of the Probation and Childcare Department of the Uva Province yesterday.
An officer said they had taken into custody 48 children in the age group of 2 to 16. The raid was carried out assisted by police.
Several children were forced to beg by their parents, while others were used in an organised manner by certain individuals absconding police. Heated arguments broke out during the raid and several parents attempted to flee with their children to prevent their arrest. about 50 child beggars fled the area upon hearing the news that officials were on their way to apprehend them, sources said.
Probation and Child Care Services are expected to take care of the children taken into custody yesterday.
