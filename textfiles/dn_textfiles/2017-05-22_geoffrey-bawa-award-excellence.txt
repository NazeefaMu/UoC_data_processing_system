Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence

Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence in Architecture 2016/2017 is the fourth cycle of triennial awards hosted by the Geoffrey Bawa Trust, and it has certainly contributed in no small way to enhancing the contemporary architecture in Sri Lanka.
What distinguishes the Award is that the shortlisted projects are visited by the judges, as well as a technical team, and does not depend merely on images. The Geoffrey Bawa Trust celebrates the shortlist, as well as the awards.
This year's panel of judges are the distinguished Singaporean architect Mok Wei Wei, Ward Beling representing the Geoffrey Bawa Trust, President elect D.H. Wijewardene representing the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, and Sharmini Perera of Raking Leaves the founder of the Sri Lanka Archives for art, architecture & design, Jaffna. (as the informed lay person.) The Bawa Trust has received 65 submissions.
"The judges felt that most of the submitted projects show a high calibre of architecture. The judges, having deliberated in January, visited 15 projects, out of which 11 have been shortlisted. Also for the first time, we have two unexpected projects which have been shortlisted. One by a non- architect who is Sri Lankan and the other by a foreign architect.
This suggests that Sri Lankan architecture has attained a level of maturity of design, where non-professional Sri Lankans are also able to participate in this prestigious project."states the Bawa Trust in a press release.
The judges will make their final deliberations, and select the winner who will be presented with the prestigious Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence in Architecture on Sunday , July 23, 2017.
