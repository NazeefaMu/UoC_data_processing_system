Rs. 2.5 million for flood destroyed house: Rajitha

A Rs. 2.5 million compensation will be granted for a house completely destroyed in the floods, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said all houses were insured after the government came into power, and a completely damaged house will receive Rs. 2.5 million from the insurer. The rest will be granted by the government.
He was addressing the gathering of a ceremony held at Bulathsinhala to construct new houses for poor families affected by the floods. Minister Senaratne said the country has no insurance system for houses in the past.
He said the government cannot do everything and private sector partnership is required. "The contribution made by the rich with the understanding of the difficulties faced by the poor should be lauded," he said.
