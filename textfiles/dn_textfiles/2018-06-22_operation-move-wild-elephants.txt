Operation to move wild elephants

A major operation to drive away wild elephants from Kiri Ibbanara, Nugegalayaya, Edison Kanda, Weliwewa and Meegahajadura areas bordering Sooriyawewa and Sevenagala DS division was launched yesterday morning.
Nearly 30 Wildlife officers drawn from Hambantota, Bindala, Matara, Mirissa and Kalametiya Wildlife officers and 50 youth from the areas concerned joined in the operation. The elephant drive aimed to minimise the human elephant conflict in the region was spearheaded by Range officer J. A. P. Wijayakumara and Bundala Park keeper R. G. R. S. Ranatunge. They said their main objective was to drive the human life threatening elephant herd to the Meegahajadura Elephant management Reserve.
