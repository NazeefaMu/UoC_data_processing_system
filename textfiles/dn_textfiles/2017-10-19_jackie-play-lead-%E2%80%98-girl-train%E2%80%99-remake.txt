Jackie to play the lead in ‘The Girl on the Train’ remake

After the success of her last film, ‘Judwaa 2’, Jacqueline Fernandez will now play the protagonist in Ribhu Dasgupta’s Hindi adaptation of Paula Hawkins’s 2015 novel, the psychological thriller ‘The Girl On The Train’.
The book has been adapted into a Hollywood film featuring Emily Blunt. Ribhu has the official adaptation rights of the book and the film.
“I have just finished the script. Jackie has come on board as the protagonist. While the novel had an ensemble cast, our film will revolve around her character. I have been looking forward to working with her and this seemed like a perfect project to collaborate. You get together to make a film when people think alike in many ways and when I had met her I discovered we were on the same page,” informs Ribhu, whose last directorial was the 2016 thriller ‘Te3n’, featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Vidya Balan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui in pivotal roles.
