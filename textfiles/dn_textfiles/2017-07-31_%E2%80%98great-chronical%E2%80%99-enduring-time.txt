The ‘Great Chronical’ enduring time

The text gives a date of 1,840 years prior to the death of the Buddha. So this is one example, but it is significant insofar as it shows us that even those monks who were in charge of preserving the Mahavamsa may themselves have had more of an expansive view of the early history of the island than we’re allowed to account for when we look at the Mahavamsa as a single text
The Mahavamsa, or ‘Great Chronicle,’ is an ancient Pali text about the Buddhist kings of Sri Lanka that is foundational to Sinhala identity and Theravada Buddhism today. In a lecture last week, Dr. Justin W. Henry, an American scholar of Sri Lankan religious history, said that the Mahavamsa is one of the earliest texts in the world to define such a concrete idea of nationhood and national identity. But, he argued in a lecture at the Open University, it should not be read and interpreted by itself, as many do today. He said that historically, before the arrival of the British, the Mahavamsa was understood alongside other commentaries and histories written in Pali and Sinhala, which added to and complicated its story about Sinhala kings and Buddhist identity.
Henry is an American scholar of Sri Lankan religious history. He holds a PhD in the History of Religions from the University of Chicago Divinity School and currently teaches at Loyola University in Chicago. He was a visiting research fellow in the Department of Linguistics at Kelaniya University from 2008-09 and has spent several years in Sri Lanka studying Pali, Sinhala and Tamil religious literature.

An English translation of the Mahavamsa 
by Dr. Wilhelm Geiger.
Q: As an introduction, can you speak the significance of the Mahavamsa to Sinhala, Buddhism and to the study of world religions more generally?
A. It’s remarkable to have a document that’s so old and that draws from a previous tradition. The prior chronicle to it, which is called the Dipavamsa, or the ‘Chronicle of the Island,’ dates to either the late 3rd or early 4th century. So there was an even older tradition, and likely other chronicles that were circulating that the Mahavamsa first installment was derived from. It has a pretty clear normative vision of the duties of a king of the island, and it has a fairly orthodox perspective about what the obligations of Buddhist laypeople are, at least the Buddhist rulers of the island. And that stuff conjoined, political charter, religious orthodoxy, and a sense of national boundaries, is very unique to find in a document that early. The famous historian of Buddhism Heinz Bechert is right; it does contain an idea of ‘the nation’ very early on. So the Mahvamsa is unique. We don’t talk generally about nationalist consciousness until the very modern period, the modern national states of Europe.
But the Mahavamsa shows us that there is an idea of Sinhala identity, or at least an idea of Sinhala kingship, very early on. And so for that reason you can’t in any way discount its immense significance for Sinhala Buddhist people, or as a cultural artifact attesting to this very early national consciousness.
Q: But, as you said in your talk, the text has been interpreted by historians in different ways over the years. Can you walk me through that?
A. Today, I first made a point about the earliest impressions of the text by the British, who first retrieved it and committed it to print from the written manuscripts and there was an immense amount of excitement because in the early 1800’s the actual history of India was just beginning to unravel. We have the Edicts of Ashoka being dated to Greek Seleucid Empire and we realized that it was possible to date the history of India in the same way that we feel confident dating, for instance, the Greeks and the Romans.
So that prospect of finding a chronicle that old, it was seen as a skeleton key to ancient dynastic chronology. It was very exciting. I mean, the Mahavamsa does give exact dates for the reigns of the kings of Sri Lanka, measured from the time of the Buddha’s death. So we have at least an approximation of those things. There’s no other record, there’s no record in India or anything like it at all.
Now, as I said today, the excitement on the part of some gave way to skepticism on the part of others who said that portions of the Mahavamsa that looked exaggerated or miraculous meant that the text as a whole was of little historical value. But I think a compromise between those two positions was reached. I mentioned Thomas Rhys Davids and Wilhelm Geiger, who are writing in the early 20th century, who said well, there are some interpolations in the text, but so what? It’s still a very helpful document. It will tell us not only about the history of Sri Lanka but of Southern Asia, too.
The second movement in Mahavamsa studies is the mid-20th century scholarship that looked at the text influenced by its political applications at the time of Sri Lanka emerging as a nation state. I mean it became a highly-charged political document; a source of identity for the Sinhala people, and it was presented as kind of a political charter, and sometimes as a justification for the reasons Buddhism should be given a special place in relation to other religions in Sri Lanka—
Q: Which it has been given?
A: Yes. And indeed, through successive new constitutions Buddhism has legally been given a special place in Sri Lanka. There were some historians that would either say that the very consolidated Sinhala identity, the idea that the Sinhala people are descended from Prince Vijaya, some scholars would make the case that this idea, we can trace back 1,500 years. There are others who are incredulous of this idea, saying that Sinhala, being the colocation of being descended from Vijaya, speaking Sinhala, and being a Buddhist, is a modern thing, a product of basically the colonial period, basically from the Portuguese period in the 16th century. I mentioned the Sri Lankan historian Evelyn Ludowyk today, and also the German historian Heinz Beichert, who were worried that the Mahavamsa would be used in an anachronistic way, in a way that it wasn’t necessarily historically accurate.
Q: So you argue that there’s an emerging third way of reading this text?
A: Yes, I do. And it’s a new way that, kind of ironically, is more in keeping with what was likely the original way of reading the Mahavamsa before the root Pali text was isolated as an object of philological scrutiny by the British in the early 19th century. I mean, the first collectors of manuscripts and translators, like the Rev. Buckley Fox, Sir Alexander Johnson, George Turnour, were all told by their monastic contacts that the text itself was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend on its own, and that it required a commentary to read it.
Now for George Turnour, the commentary he was supplied was one text in Pali, which is called a ‘tika,’ and this was the supplementary text he needed to unlock the origin of the document, the root text. And the other manuscript-hunters before him were told it’s not just the Pali commentary, you can use Sinhala texts too, a host of Sinhala texts. The Rev. Fox and Edward Upham seemed to have relied on two Sinhala chronicles, the Rajaratna-cariya and the Rajavaliya. They relied on those in their first attempt to make a translation of the Mahavamsa. It seems that the tradition of actually reading the Mahavamsa was one that began with the core text itself, but that relied on other commentary materials, other supplementary materials.
Q: And those other materials both sometimes add on, and maybe contradict, things that are in the Mahavamsa itself?
A: Add, elucidate, and sometimes perhaps contradict. I’m interested in my own research about when the history of the island as a civilized place begins. And in the Mahavamsa, a big to-do is made about the three visits of the Buddha to the island to expel the resident demons, and clearing the way for Prince Vijaya to arrive from India. He touches Sri Lanka’s shores, at that moment of the death of the Buddha, and I call this a ‘singularity;’ the genesis of recorded time in Sri Lanka, according to the Mahavamsa.
Heinz Bechert has argued that the story of the Ramayana, which is the story of Rama retrieving his wife Sita from Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, was intentionally excluded in the Mahavamsa. He argues that the monks who wrote it knew about it, and intentionally left it out, so as not to give any precedent to a Hindu history of Sri Lanka. Later, that changes, even in the Rajavaliya, one of these Sinhala texts that we know was used as a supplement to the Mahavamsa. We get the mention of Ravana, the demon king of the Ramayana, having inhabited Sri Lanka prior to Vijaya. And I think the text gives a date of 1,840 years prior to the death of the Buddha. So this is one example, but it is significant insofar as it shows us that even those monks who were in charge of preserving the Mahavamsa may themselves have had more of an expansive view of the early history of the island than we’re allowed to account for when we look at the Mahavamsa as a single text.
Q: So in your research, can you tell me some of the histories that you’ve found in these more vernacular texts?
A: We get in the ‘Rajavaliya,’ in addition to other Sinhala texts and commentaries, the notion that Sri Lanka was at one point geographically much larger than it is now, that it was some 12 times its current size. And that great extent of Sri Lanka was washed away by the sea following the reign of Ravana. This notion of Sri Lanka having been much larger is interestingly resonant with the stories from South India concerning the ancient capitals where the great Tamil literary products, called the Sangam poetry, emerged from.
We have in South India this idea of three successive capitals that are periodically washed away by the sea.
And I think that it’s here, looking at some of these shared narratives and points of influence and synthesis, that we can see a conversation outside the boundaries of the Mahavamsa regarding the ancient history of Sri Lanka and the subcontinent going on. It’s an interesting window into the religious interface that was happening, and most of this, I argue, begins in the 14th century and carries into the Portuguese period. It was really the 14th and 15th century that a lot of this expanded historical imagination was going on.
Q: And you argue that we lose these narratives because of the strong insistence on the printed text of the Mahavamsa.
A: I think there’s a strong case to be made for that, yes.
Q: You said in your talk that British manuscript collectors and translators ‘tricked’ people into misreading the island’s history with their focus on the Mahavamsa. Is that a fair characterization?
A: I think so; or at least mislead Sri Lankans into a narrower view of their own history than they perhaps had prior to the British period.
Q: And you believe that the work of scholarship now is to kind of re-open that history.
A: Hopefully, yes.
