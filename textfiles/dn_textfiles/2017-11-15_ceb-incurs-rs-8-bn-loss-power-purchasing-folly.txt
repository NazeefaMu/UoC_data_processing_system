CEB INCURS Rs 8 BN LOSS ON POWER PURCHASING FOLLY

United National Party MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said the Ceylon Electricity Board has incurred a loss of Rs 8 billion during the past four years.
This is due to the failure by the CEB management to amend the power purchasing agreement of West Coast Private Power Plant.
MP Marasinghe pointed out that the power purchasing agreement had to be amended by the management four years ago and they had not done it so far. He added that according to CEB officials, the loss incurred by the CEB is Rs 2 billion each year.
He queried as to what measures the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry would take in this connection. He made this query as a supplementary question during the round questions for oral answers.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said a Committee has been appointed and the said Company will have to settle the due amounts to the CEB in future.
