The under 13 division one inter school cricket tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy was won by Tissa Central Kalutara by beating Prince of Wales College on points recently.
The twelve year old all rounder and vice captain of Prince of Wales College Vinuja Ranpul became the leading run getter of this division from the whole island with 984 runs at a Bradmansque average of 98.5 and he was very unlucky to miss the magical 1000 runs and this total is highest ever by a Cambrian Cricketer for his alma mater in the under 13 Division one Tournament since participation.
