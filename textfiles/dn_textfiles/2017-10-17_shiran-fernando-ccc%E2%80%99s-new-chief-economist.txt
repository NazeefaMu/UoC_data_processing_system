Shiran Fernando is CCC’s new chief economist

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has appointed Shiran Fernando as its new Chief Economist, effective from October 16, following the resignation of Mr. Anushka Wijesinha.
Fernando, who holds a Bachelors in Economics and Finance from the University of London International Programmes, previously functioned as the Lead Economist and Senior Product Head at Frontier Research, where he was responsible for the growth and strategic direction of the economics research division.
He will be directly in-charge of the Economic Intelligence Unit of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which is the focal point of the Chamber for economic research and policy advocacy and is engaged in providing policy level support and strategic advice to the Government to shape the national economic agenda.
“It is an exciting opportunity to join the Ceylon Chamber, the leading Business Chamber in the country and shaping the economic discussion in Sri Lanka,” said Fernando, on his appointment as the Chief Economist of the Chamber.
Fernando is no stranger to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce as he is already functioning as a member of the Steering Committee on Economic Policy of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which meets regularly for policy discussions. He has also been providing economic expertise at the monthly Exporters Association of Sri Lanka Management Committee meeting.
The new Chief Economist of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has been a part of numerous economic and business forums as a panelist, speaker and a moderator. He is also a contributing writer to LMD's Economic Outlook Column.
A CIMA Passed Finalist, Fernando also holds a Post-Graduate Diploma in International Relations from the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) and is a 2018 Level 3 Candidate in the CFA program.
