Raux Brothers unveils Tempotest Home by Parà

Raux Brothers (Pvt.) Ltd., a furniture manufacturing and sourcing company, launched “Tempotest Home by Parà”.
The collection will consist of high quality fabrics adorned with Italian designs, manufactured by the global leader in home textiles - Parà Group.
These performance fabrics are delicately spun and weaved to exquisite Italian designs by the Parà Group, and are sent for final treatment at six high technology plants near Milan. The special fabric comes with six years of warranty on colour fading, which can occur due to the exposure to UV rays (sun light) or washing. Manufactured with 100% solution dyed acrylic fibre, these fabrics have the ability to retain their superior colour tones to the core of the yarn. UV resistant colours are incorporated in the production, ensuring fabrics to gain a long lasting fade-proof quality.
The fabric is also made to protect itself against dust mites and bacteria, thanks to its highly specialized Antimicrobial Hygiene material. This is exclusively developed by the Swiss Company – Sanitized AG possessing 50 years of expertise.
The fabrics at Tempotest Home by Parà also hold the Oetotex-Standard 100 Certification, attesting their safety and assuring the fabric to be free from harmful substances.
Since 1921, Parà Group has served the world with an outstanding collection of textiles brimming with refined aesthetic value, and made to last for generations with its superior technology.
“With the rapid surge in growth in Sri Lanka’s hospitality industry and the unveiling of a number of internationally recognized brands within the next four years, we are all set to deliver world class furniture and furnishings. Apart from the partnerships drawn with reputed brands in furnishing from around the globe, we are geared to meet the special requirement of any large scale project in furniture, complemented with overseas expertise and value addition in place,” Director of Raux Brothers (Pvt.) Ltd. Kalani Raux said.
