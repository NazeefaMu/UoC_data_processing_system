Deepika is marriage material!

During the rapidfire round on Koffee With Karan, Ranveer Singh was given a choice between Anushka Sharma, Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone in the kill-marry-hook up section. While Ranveer said he would marry Deepika as he thinks she’s marriage material, he chose to kill Anushka as “she’s very mean to him for no reason”.
Lastly, he said he would hook up with Katrina, softly saying sorry to his fellow couch member and Kat’s ex, Ranbir Kapoor!
Incidentally, Ranbir and Ranveer also spoke about wanting to star in a film together.
Temporarily called Project X, the film would be directed by the Kapoor scion. The actor duo offered host Karan Johar a chance to produce the film.
Ranveer said, “This is a great opportunity for Karan as leading actors rarely agree to do two-hero films these days!” Wonder, if Karan will take up the offer.
