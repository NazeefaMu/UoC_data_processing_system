Citizens' Mail

Sugar prices
The government has increased the import duty on sugar by Rs 10 due to the reduction of world market prices. Immediately sugar price was increased by Rs 10 by retailers and fares of all sugar items has been increased. Now it has been learned that world price has come down to the extent of Rs 13 per kilogramme and Sugar Importers’ Association has agreed for a pro-reduction of Rs 3 on original sugar price.
I regret to state that this will have no effect on prices of sugar items (Buns, cakes, tea etc) which has already been increased by Rs 10. Nobody will ever give effect to a price deduction of Rs 13 on those items.
Strictly speaking, the government should have increased the export duty by Rs 13 per kilo. So that excess fund could be transferred to a development fund. It would have kept the sugar prices stable. Now, this price deduction will encourage consumption of sugar and NCP decreases will increase. Our media should point out this to the government and advice a wise countervailing action always when world prices are reduced.
