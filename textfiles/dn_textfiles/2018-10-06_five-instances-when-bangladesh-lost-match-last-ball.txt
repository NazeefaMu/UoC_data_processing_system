Five instances when Bangladesh lost a match off the last ball

Bangladesh lost the Asia Cup 2018 final to India off the last ball of the contest. It was the third Asia Cup final that Bangladesh failed to win. The previous two defeats came against Pakistan and India. Despite Mashrafe Mortaza and his team being heavily committed to clinching the trophy this time around, they failed due to horrible batting collapse in the final.
It was not the first instance when Bangladesh lost a match on the last ball. They were on the losing side when were defeated in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan back in 2014.
In this article, we relive five instances when Bangladesh lost an international match off the last ball.
#5 Asia Cup 2012 final against Pakistan
Despite not being a strong ODI contender, Bangladesh played excellent cricket in 2012 Asia Cup to see themselves in the final against Pakistan. They beat India and Sri Lanka to earn a place in the final.
Mushfiqur Rahim was the captain of Bangladesh during that edition of the Asia Cup. He won the toss and elected to bat first. Pakistan posted a modest total of 236 runs on the board. Bangladesh failed to chase it down.
The hosts got a steady start as Tamim Iqbal hit a half-century while opening the innings with Nazimuddin. Bangladesh short of 10 runs to win the match in last over. Aizaz Cheema came to attack and conceded only seven as Bangladesh lost the final in front of the home crowd.
#4 World T20 super 10, 2016 against India
Bangladesh's loss to India in the World T20 2016 remains as a deep wound to their fans. They hurt, even more, when the premature celebration of Mushfiqur comes to the mind.
Bangladesh won the toss in Bangalore and decided to bowl first. India scored 146 by seven wickets, and that score seemed like a chasable total for Bangladesh. But, they failed to register a historic win.
Bangladesh needed 11 runs from the last over that was bowled by Hardik Pandya. As Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur were on the wicket, Bangladesh had nothing in the mind but a win.
Mahmudullah rotated the strike in the first ball, and Mushfiqur started celebrating after smashing Pandya for the two consecutive fours. The celebration of Mushfiqur came to an end when he and Mahmudullah got dismissed on the next two deliveries of Pandya. Bangladesh needed two runs from the last ball, but Shuvagata Hom failed to accomplish that.
#3 Final game of the 2018 series against Afghanistan
After losing first two matches of three-match series against Afghanistan earlier this year, Bangladesh looked eager to avoid a shameful whitewash on the third encounter. But, they failed to skip the inevitable.
Afghanistan posted 145 on the board batting first. The Tigers failed to chase it down. They needed 30 in the last 12 balls. Mushfiqur hit Karim Janat on the 19th over for five consecutive fours, and Bangladesh needed only nine in the closing over.
Rashid Khan came to bowl the 20th over and dismissed Mushfiqur in the first delivery, subsequently, Bangladesh lost the match by one run. Ariful Haque failed to manage two from the last ball. And thus, Bangladesh whitewashed by Afghanistan for the first time in their history.
#2 Nidahas Trophy final 2018 against India
Bangladesh reached the final of Nidahas Trophy 2018, beating the hosts Sri Lanka twice. But, they finished the event as runners-up after losing the final to a tremendous effort from Dinesh Karthik.
Bangladesh posted 166 on the board, batting first at Colombo. Sabbir Rahman smashed 77 by 50 balls. India needed 34 in the last two overs. Bangladeshi players were doing nothing but waiting for their first ever trophy in a multi-national tournament.
But, the feat was written for India as Dinesh Karthik hit Rubel Hossain for 22 runs in the 19th over. India needed five from the last ball, and Dinesh Karthik finished the job, hitting Soumya Sarkar out of the park for a massive six.
#1 Asia Cup 2018 final against India
Bangladesh had a little chance this time around. They managed to score only 222 in the Asia Cup 2018 final at Dubai. Despite Liton Das scoring 121, Bangladesh's middle order was fragile to add more runs on the board. India won the toss in the final and invited Bangladesh to bat first. Bangladesh scored 222 and lost the match off the last ball. It seemed like chasing 222 could be as another day at the office for India at the halfway mark. But, Bangladeshi bowlers made things tough for Rohit Sharma and co. Brilliant captaincy of Mashrafe had kept Bangladesh's hope alive till the last ball.
India required only six from the last over. Mashrafe gave the ball to Mahmudullah Riayd, and the right-arm slow bowler made India wait till the final delivery. Yet, Kedar Jadhav's calmness ensured that India clinched the game.
