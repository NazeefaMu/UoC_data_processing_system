Has Super T20 tournament served the purpose?

 
The Super T20 provincial tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket as a prelude to giving players the opportunity to showcase their talent ahead of picking the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming Asia Cup and World T20 tournaments draws to a close at the R Premadasa Stadium today with Colombo Commandos meeting Galle Guardians in the final starting at 7 pm.
More than the result of the final what is more important is how much beneficial the tournament has been to the national selectors who have the envious task of picking 15 of the best T20 players to defend not only the Asia Cup in Bangladesh but more importantly the World T20 in India.
The alarming facts to emerge from the 12 matches played so far is the spate of low totals made by the five teams in competition and the fact that no batsman has single-handedly gone on to win a match for their side. The highest totals recorded are 182/5 by Colombo Commandos and 181/7 by Galle Guardians the two teams playing in today's final. Furthermore no batsman has made a big impact in the tournament with 80 not out by Dhananjaya de Silva of Colombo Commandos being the highest individual score.
The pitches we understand have been prepared similar to those Sri Lanka are likely to encounter in Bangladesh and in India. If that is the case the national selectors will certainly have a huge problem ahead of them in selecting a team that could defend the two titles.
The performances of the batsmen on these pitches which have seen the ball keep low and offer appreciable turn has not been encouraging. There appears to be a distinct weakness against playing spin which was quite evident with the national team in their recent encounters against Pakistan and India at home.
The key to encountering spin on a low track is to play straight but most of the dismissals have been to batsmen playing across the line, which certainly is not a good sign and a worrying factor. It shows that there is a huge deficiency in our batting against spin that needs to be rectified.
The national selectors we learn have been following each and every game in the provincial tournament and will also keep a close eye on the upcoming three T20 internationals in India before picking the final 15 to play in the Asia Cup and World T20.
The two finalists met in the opening match of the tournament with Colombo emerging winners by three wickets in a close encounter with two balls to spare. It could turn out to be different today.
The champion team will collect a cool Rs. One million and the runner-up Rs. 750,000. Individual prizes include Rs. 150,000 for Man of the Tournament, Rs. 100,000 each for Best Batsman and Best Bowler of the Tournament and Rs. 50,000 for Man of the Final.
