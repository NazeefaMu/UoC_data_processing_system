Cabinet approval to set up Committee of Ministers

Implementation of 2015 UNHRC recommendations:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this week received Cabinet approval to set up a Committee of Ministers chaired by him and a committee of officials to assist in the implementation of the 2015 UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) recommendations, co-sponsored by the government.
In March of this year, the UNHRC granted an extra period of two years to implement the recommendations as per the government’s request.
The committees are expected to set up a mechanism to coordinate the implementation process across various ministries, initiate follow ups of programs and to help in requesting technical and other expertise for implementation from member countries in the UNHRC.
