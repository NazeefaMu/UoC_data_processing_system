India's $32 bn bank bailout isn't enough

India just gave its banking system a $32 billion shot in the arm.That's how much cash the Indian government plans to pour into state-run banks that are saddled with mountains of dodgy loans.
Official estimates show 12% of all loans made in India - $150 billion worth - have gone bad.
The government, which announced its intervention on Tuesday, has repeatedly faced calls to shore up the banking system.
Analysts hailed the cash injection as a "significant" and "much needed" move that should help revive the country's flagging economy.
Investors agreed. Shares in State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, gained over 26% Wednesday on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Punjab National Bank gained 46% and Bank of India advanced by 33%.
Yet some analysts questioned whether the government bailout is big enough to fully repair the damage caused by bad loans.
Indian banks need a much larger infusion of $65 billion to comply with new international regulations that will come into force in 2019, according to Fitch Ratings. The fresh government funds should be enough to tide the state-run banks over for a couple of years, but analysts say more uncertainty awaits.
"I think they probably will need even larger-scale [infusions] beyond the next two years," said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics.
The current bailout also doesn't guarantee that public sector banks will be in a position to give their customers new loans, analysts say.
