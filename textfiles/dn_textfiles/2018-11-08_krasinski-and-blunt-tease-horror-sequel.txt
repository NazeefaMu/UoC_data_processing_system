Krasinski  and Blunt   tease horror   sequel

Back in April the post-apocalyptic horror ‘A Quiet Place’ hit cinemas and was a critical and financial smash hit. The $17 million A Quiet Place stormed the box office taking a whopping $338.5 million world.
With such success, it should come as no surprise that a sequel will be arriving in 2020. Now husband and wife Krasinski and Blunt, who starred together in the movie, have teased what’s next for the Abbott family.
Blunt said, “In some ways, the idea of seeing who these people were before this all happened would be interesting. But I’m not quite sure because I think actually it’s now what’s the next chapter and what happens next. I think people feel very invested in this family…. I think it’s such an open book right now, and certainly for John who is lasering into something as we speak.”
Krasinski added, “This is a world you can play in, this isn’t just a character to remake…. it’s actually a world, which is a whole different, very unique experience.”
He continued, “It’s not like ‘Alien’ or ‘Jaws’ where the main villain is the thing you’re repeating; it’s an actual entire set of rules and the circumstance that the world has undergone that you can play in very different facets.”
