Hotline for informing food allergies during Vesak

The hotline, 0112676161, at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), is operative round the clock on Vesak Day (Sunday) for the public to report any type of food allergy, poisoning and similar incidents, CMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Wijayamuni said swelling of ear, lips and tongue is visible within few minutes after consuming food in an allergy. Persons suffering from an allergy experience stomach pain,fever, vomiting, and diarrhea within eight hours of consuming food.
People who experience the symptoms along with fainting among others after 12 hours of consuming food have to seek medical attention. Certain diseases such as Typhoid fever can appear even after a month or two from the day of consuming contaminated food. Therefore, the public should be careful during Vesak days about food items they consume, he said.
So far, about 40 dansel were registered with the CMC and the number will be around 100 by Vesak. Many are rice dansels. Certain types of dansels such as Ice Cream dansel promote NCDs.
Registration forms for dansels can be downloaded through http://colombo.mc.gov.lk/ downloads/dn.pdf MOHs. PHIs are deployed to inspect the dansels, he said.
