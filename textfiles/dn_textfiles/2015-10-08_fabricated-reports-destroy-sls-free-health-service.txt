Fabricated reports destroy SL's free health service

Fabricated media reports destroy Sri Lanka's entire free health service. All drugs imported to Sri Lanka are of the highest quality and recommended by committees of experts and professionals, Cabinet Spokesman and Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday, he said only qualified and experienced medical experts and specialist doctors sit for the Formulatory Committees which approve drugs.
"We import over 1,000 drugs. All drugs have a formulatory note. Each new drug has been tested at laboratories. If we find low quality drugs, we withdraw such batches and blacklist the supplier," he said.
Dr. Senaratne said persons who fail to obtain tenders approach specialist doctors and ask them to prescribe their drugs and inform patients that drugs available at hospitals, especially at the Cancer Hospital, are of low quality.
The drug mafia is the second largest mafia in the world. It is same in Sri Lanka. This is why it took 40 years to get the National Drug Policy passed in Parliament, he added.
Dr. Senaratne also said if the school boy taken into custody in connection with the murder of Seya Sadewmi murder was assaulted by Police it was wrong.
The minister also praised Police for solving all past crimes.
All crimes should be solved after investigations, he said.
