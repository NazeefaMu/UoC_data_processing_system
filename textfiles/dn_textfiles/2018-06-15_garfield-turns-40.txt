Garfield turns 40 !

Jim Davis reveals how the lasagne-loving star was born
Who hates Mondays, loves lasagne, has no filter and is orange all over? I’m talking about another creature, one that added laughter, value and insight to most of our livesQ: You guessed it, it's Garfield. The cat that said what we were all thinking, and he turns forty in the coming week. I had my first brush with Garfield at age 8 or so, the little strip would come in a supplement of a national daily, and it would be the only part of the newspaper I read for the next six years. I’d cut out the comic strips and paste them in my scrapbook; Garfield was snarky, honest, fat, always hungry and little lazier than acceptable. He was my spirit animal and in many ways still is. The strip that started out in 1978, now holds the Guinness World Record for the most widely syndicated comic strip, with over 200 million people reading it every day. To add to this, Garfield has dozens of record-breaking best-selling books, award-winning animated television series, movies and over 400 licensed products ranging from toys, games, backpacks, and costumes to bedding, credit cards, diapers et al. Garfield is the brain child of famed cartoonist Jim Davis, who came up with the idea when he was an assistant on a comic strip called ‘Tumbleweeds’. Before Garfield, who shot to be an instant success, Jim was working on another strip called ‘Gnorm Gnat’ which was scrapped before it could take off. But like they say, whatever happens, happens for the best. We had the honour of speaking to the 75-year-old legend to get an insight into what went into creating the most iconic cat character that continues to resonate with all ages, ethnicities, genders and races through the years.Q: When did you know you wanted to be a cartoonist? There’s an old joke in cartoonists’ circles – it helps to have been dropped on your head as a baby. But honestly, I knew I wanted to be a cartoonist after I made my mom laugh with one of my drawings.Q: Are you more Garfield or Jon? I’m more Jon. I’m a daydreamer, easy-going, and some would say wishy-washy. But, like Garfield, I do love lasagne, coffee, and cat naps. I’m also an optimist and I love Mondays – not very Garfield-like.Q: What is the most memorable story about working on Garfield? This was recent and it came out of the blue. In March 2017, we started getting word that there was an entire debate about Garfield’s gender that was heating up the Internet, and in particular on Wikipedia. Someone started an editing war on Garfield’s Wikipedia page – over a 60-hour period Garfield’s gender vacillated back and forth from male to not male. Wikipedia had to put the page on lockdown to stop the editing war. Then it spilled over onto other social networks and raged on over a quote I’d made years ago when I said “Garfield is very universal. By virtue of being a cat, he’s not really male or female or any particular race or nationality, young or old.” The Washington Post finally called me for comment to stop the debate – and I did. I said, “Garfield is a male. He has a girlfriend, Arlene.”Q: Did you expect it to become so successful and keep going for over 40 years? You know the old saying, "timing is everything"? When Garfield was introduced in 1978, there was a pent-up demand for anything to do with cats -- the New York Times even referred to the late 70s-early 80s as a "Cat Culture" and a cat was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Garfield happened to be there at exactly the right time. It was also the dawning of the "me generation" and Garfield was the perfect spokescat. He defended his right to be fat and lazy, and he didn't feel guilty about anything. He said and did the things most humans would love to say or do if we had the courage.Q: Do you still draw the comics? Are you still part of the ideation? Yes to both the drawing and the ideation, though I confess I have a couple of assistants who help me with both. I still consider the comic strip to be the most important thing I do so I’ll never let go of that part of the job. But, admittedly, the demands of running the licensing company and working on other projects like TV and movies can be a bit much at times. It helps to have people to bounce ideas off of.Q: You have had a long and successful career, is there any particular achievement that you are proud of? It meant a lot to me to be recognized by my fellow cartoonists. I won the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the year from the National Cartoonists Society. TNN
