Over 500 train accident deaths in 2017

According to the latest records of the Government Railway Department, 510 persons have been killed in train accidents during the past year.
Government Railway Security Service Head Anura Premanath told the Daily News in Kurunegala that these persons have faced tragic deaths due to their carelessness, while walking on railway tracks. Some have died while taking selfies while travelling carelessly. Parents and school principals countrywide should educate students on how to safely travel on trains and walk on railway tracks, with the outset of this new year, to prevent deaths on railway tracks, he added.
