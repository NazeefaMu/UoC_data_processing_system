Starc creates history with second hat-trick in same match

Mitchell Starc became the first bowler in nearly 40 years - and the first in Australia - to claim two hat-tricks in the same first-class match when he blasted out Western Australia’s last three batsmen to claim outright points for New South Wales against Western Australia at Hurstville Oval.
Having gone wicketless in the second innings up to that point, Starc had Jason Behrendorff caught behind and then bowled David Moody with the last two balls of his 15th over, then returned to have Jon Wells caught at slip by the captain Steven Smith with the first ball of his 16th. This hat-trick followed another on day three of the Sheffield Shield match, when he had dismissed Behrendorff, Moody and Simon Mackin.
Starc’s feat was the first instance since Amin Lakhani managed to do the same for a Combined XI against the Indian tourists in a match at Multan in 1978. Overall only seven other bowlers have taken two hat-tricks in the same match, and only one Australian T.J. Matthews doing so against South Africa at Manchester in 1912. Matthews’ feat is also the only time two hat-tricks have been taken by a bowler in the same Test match.
Smith said that Starc’s old-ball angle from around the wicket and reversing the ball away was fiendishly difficult to deal with for any batsman. He also complimented Hazlewood for his excellent rhythm throughout his first match back from injury.
“They’ve found it pretty hard for a long period of time, the shape that he gets, the angle that he creates when going so wide,” Smith said. “It’s difficult for batters, let alone tail-enders. To take two hat-tricks in a game ... most people are lucky to take one in their career. They’re not easy to come by.
“I thought [Hazlewood] bowled like an absolute genius, he’s a superstar. Starcy, I think, has probably taken a little more time to get going and get some rhythm. But the back end of today showed why he’s world-class. Patty Cummins has had a couple of good games as well. They’re up and going and bowling really well.”
Starc and Cummins will rest from the final round of Shield matches before the first Ashes Test while Hazlewood will play against Queensland in Brisbane.
