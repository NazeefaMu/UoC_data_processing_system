Army Para Games are meant to raise the morale of soldiers who fought the war against the LTTE. “With the introduction of the Games our disabled soldiers are involved in many sporting activities. Their hidden talents have brought good results and they reached qualifying standards to compete at international level. Competing in these international meets they brought glory to the country winning many medals”, he said.
This mega event will undoubtedly instill a new glimmer of hope among more than 800 differently abled War Heroes who have displayed their sports skills in the past two months with the intention of receiving accolades in the final tournament, Major General Dampath Fernando further said.
Wheelchair Basketball, Badminton, Cycling, Wheelchair Marathon, Archery, Weightlifting, Volleyball, Volleyball (sitting), Beach Volleyball, Table Tennis, Cricket, Swimming, Wheelchair Tennis, Air Rifle Shooting and Athletics are among major sports, billed to be competed by those sportsmen during the tournament.

Dialog Axiata PLC has provided the sponsorship for the fourth consecutive year for the Army Para Games as an encouragement for Para sports.
