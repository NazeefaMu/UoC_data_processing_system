Sri Lanka Automobile Service Provider's Association formed

The Sri Lanka Automobile Service Provider's Association (SLASPA) was inaugurated by entrepreneurs representing the industry for progress of the automobile repair business.
With a history spanning over 100 years, the automobile repair industry plays a pivotal role as a fundamentally important cog in the overall economic scenario.The formation of the new body of industry stakeholders provided a window of opportunity to collectively address and resolve longstanding common issues confronting the trade.
The chief guest at the inauguration in Colombo held recently was German Technical Institute Killinochchi Principal Erwin Shulz, while Sri Lanka Boat Builder's Association Secretary-General, Gamini Herath was a guest-of-honour, along with Hemantha Dambadeniya, an insurance industry engineer.
The vision of the new Association is to offer a service on par with international standards to customers in the automobile repair sector, clear obstacles that hinder the forward-march of the industry, provide a training on an international level to professionals in the industry to improve their skills and update their knowledge, attract modern global technology to this industry in Sri Lanka, in addition to many other objectives to take this key segment to greater heights.
SLASPA President Rajitha Gomes said the Association is a longstanding need for the whole automobile repair industry, including service stations, mechanical repairers, body shops and auto a/c repairers to express their views and also voice concerns on diverse issues pertaining to their business activities in providing automobile related services.
The Association will endeavour to ensure an efficient, courteous and expeditious service to clients of the members, whilst improving the standards and quality of their workshops. The Association will negotiate with government establishments, regulatory bodies and insurance companies on behalf of the members, and will address the need for skilled and trained staff to face the challenges in repairing modern motor vehicles, he stressed.
Shulz said that the formation of an Association to represent the interests of the automobile repair industry is essential as there was not a single body to set out the skills needed by young person's entering this industry in Sri Lanka. He invited SLASPA members to visit the German Technical Institute in Kilinochchi to acquaint themselves with the training facilities and see for them the young community receiving training in the area so that they could be employed as apprentices among SLASPA member establishments
SLASPA Secretary Amal Piyatilake said the Association will help stakeholders in the automobile service industry to improve their capacity and quality of services provided, while building networking opportunities. “We will liaise with all relevant institutions as a group to safeguard the automobile service industry”, he emphasised.
Major Automobile Service Providers from all major cities in the country were represented by their owners at the inauguration to support the Association to achieve their common objectives.
The head office of the Sri Lanka Automobile Service Providers Association (SLASPA) is at No. 106, Arnold Ratnayake Mawatha, Colombo 10, moves are also underway to establish branch offices in major cities.
The Association's official website and Facebook page will be launched soon.
