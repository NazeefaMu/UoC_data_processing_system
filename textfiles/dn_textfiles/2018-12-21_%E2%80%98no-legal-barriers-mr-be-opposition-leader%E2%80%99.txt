‘No legal barriers for MR to be Opposition Leader’

SLFP MP Dr. Ramesh Pathirana yesterday said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa does not have any legal impediment to become the Opposition Leader as he is still a UPFA member. UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera has informed it to the relevant authorities, he said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the SLPP Head Quarters in Baththaramulla yesterday. Several politicians who opposed the appointment have proposed that a Parliamentary Select Committee must be set up to probe former President’s suitability for the post.
The Speaker has no power to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee on the matter. A committee can be appointed in this regard only if the UPFA General Secretary requests the Speaker in writing,” he said.
He said a Parliamentary Select Committee cannot abolish a membership of an MP.
“None has legal basis to form a national government at this situation. We are receiving reports that the UNP and the SLMC are discussing to form a national government to increase the number of ministers. This is illegal and the mainstream political party cannot form a unity government with another party or a group,” he said.
“We formed a broad anti-UNP collision and provided numerous benefits and relief to the people in 51 days. A massive paddy harvest was reported across the country since we provided the farmers with the fertilizer subsidy,” he said.
MP Roshan Ranasinghe said that for last 30 years, an Executive President was not elected from the UNP. “UNPers cannot conspire anymore since the country has a President elected by the people. UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said MPs who contested under the alliance and won will be in Parliament as UPFA MPs. Rs.3,000 is cut from our salaries for our SLFP party membership every month. We request for the SLPP membership but we did not receive them. Our party leader said the MPs who oppose the unity government can stay in the opposition,” he said.
