NFF cannot be accepted as one independent party: PM

The National Freedom Front (NFF) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa cannot be accepted as an independent party in Parliament. However, the five members could be accepted as five independent members in the Opposition, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier thanked and appreciated Weerawansa for deciding that they could not go forward under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He made this observation yesterday when MP Weerawansa demanded to know the decision of the Speaker on his request to accept the NFF as an independent party in the Opposition.
Reminding of the request made on Wednesday to allow five members of the National Freedom Front to function as an independent group, MP Weerawansa said he originally made the request from the Speaker on April 5, 2016. He added that in the same request, he said the NFF would act as an independent group. He added that he did not express his decision to be independent on April 5 last year and not on last Wednesday.
At this stage, the Premier said the NFF MPs can sit independently individually and not as a party.
He said he is grateful that Weerawansa had decided to be independent as it means that they can no longer work with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
MP Weerawansa said his party will continue to work with the joint opposition although it has decided to leave the UPFA.
Opposition MP Gajadeera said he is an MP from the Communist Party. He added that he decided to become independent even before the joint opposition was formed. He added that it would be appropriate if the Speaker allows members belonging to various political parties to act independently.
The Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the usual procedure of the Parliament is that only the parties from which a member has contested the election from are accepted as a party which represents the House. He added that if MP Weerawansa says he would act along with former President Rajapaksa, he had not deviated from the norm.
The Speaker said he will give a ruling after speaking to all relevant political parties.
