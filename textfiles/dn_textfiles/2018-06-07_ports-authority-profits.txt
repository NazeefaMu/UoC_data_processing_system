Ports Authority profits up

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) profits increased to Rs.13.2 billion in 2017. This is from Rs. 1 billion a year earlier.
An official from the SLPA said that one of the biggest issues they faced was the debt repayment for the Hambantota harbor loan to China. “However, with the lease of the Hambantota Port this has stopped and this was a major saving.”
Meanwhile in container handling, Port of Colombo recorded a 16.2% growth for the first quarter of 2018, according to Alphaliner Monthly 2018. Among container Ports worldwide, Colombo growth rate is the second only to Port of Singapore which has recorded 16.5% growth over 2017.
It is also a very significant achievement when compared against Port of Colombo 2017 figures with 8.3% growth of 2017 against 2016.
