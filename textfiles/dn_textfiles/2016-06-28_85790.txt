Dickwella replacement for Thirimanne

 
Sri Lanka’s top order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne has returned to Colombo with a lower back strain sustained on June 23.
Thirimanne has been replaced by Niroshan Dikwella, who was immediately available in UK with the A-Team. Meanwhile, hamstring soreness that saw captain Angelo Matthews sit out the bowling attack for the 2nd ODI, and the subsequent hamstring niggle sustained by vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal are being carefully monitored.Recent updates indicate that both players are available for the 3rd ODI which began yesterday.
All-rounder Farveez Maharoof, is also sporting an injury to his left hand, but his current assessment also indicates that he will play.
