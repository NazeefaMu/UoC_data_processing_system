GMOA in open political mode

The GMOA has got into open political mode and is set to swamp the Colombo city with a vehicle parade today, similar to the ratha pelapaliyas and jana goshas and what have you, reminiscent of the salad days of their mentor, nay benefactor, Mahinda Rajapaksa. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge has gone to the extent of issuing a warning to the public not to arrive in the capital city today, lest they be caught up the vehicle jam. This, by a group of medical professionals who have taken the Hippocratic Oath to devote their lives and time in the care of the sick and the suffering.
One is unable to say how many pregnant mothers, about to deliver, heart patients needing prompt treatment, accident victims etc. will be caught up in this traffic snarl. It will also be anybody's guess as to how many of these patients, needing immediate attention, will depart this world after being denied urgent medical attention, with their being stranded by the vehicle parade or remaining at home, heeding the dire warning of the good doctors, not to arrive in the city.
The GMOA has already launched token strikes in several districts, to give added impetus to today's grand finale, not caring a whit about the plight of patients whose interest and well-being they claim to have at heart, in fighting for abolishing SAITM. Interestingly, the CEB Trade Unions too have launched a strike that coincides with GMOA's deventha ratha pelapaliya which may or may not be a grand design by the state health and power sectors to place the government in difficulty. With mini elections fast approaching (According to the Election Commissioner the LG poll will be held in January), disruptive activity and sabotage can only escalate, with the unlimited financial resources commanded by the Rajapaksas put to good use. A sample of this was on display when former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa was brought before the CID the other day, where, busloads of supporters descended on police headquarters, in a show of strength, which only a government in power has the capacity and resources to muster. A sustained campaign of the type carried out by the anti-SAITM brigade cannot survive without a massive fund infusion. The agitators are not confined to medical students, who are large enough, but students of other disciplines and even schoolchildren who may be in the dark as to what it is all about. The candlelight vigils and the present relay ‘fasts’, in front of the Fort Railway station tells a tale.
Be that as it may, the government should act firmly to prevent anarchy to reign in the guise of trade union action. All measures should be taken to ensure normal life prevails in the city today. As is all too clear, the SAITM issue is only a smokescreen in a larger political design to bring the Rajapaksas back to power. That the GMOA, is in the forefront of this sinister campaign is quite obvious, given that it remained mum when SAITM first came into being in 2012 and made, not a whimper of protest, when a private medical facility was established at the Kotelawala Defence Academy.
The speech made by the GMOA President Dr. Anurudhdha Padeniya opposite the Fort Railway station, that followed yet another anti-SAITM protest, also showed in which direction the GMOA campaign was heading. His (Padeniya's presence at a book launch of Wimal Weerawansa is also indicative of where the GMOA's sympathies lay. It's (GMOA's) exclusive choosing of a private TV channel, that makes no bones of it's support for the Rajapaksas, to cover a doctors health camp, during the recent floods, could not have been an accident.
It is time the government took stock of the situation and acted accordingly. As a government, it behoves on it to ensure normal civilian life continues smoothly without disruption. A few Trade Unions should not be allowed to have its own way, at the expense of the public. Besides, a country's capital city lain siege frequently by demonstrations, protests and vehicle parades is going to send a wrong message to would be investors. It is plain that the trouble makers are taking advantage of the government's tolerance of democratic dissent and are overstepping their bounds.
The vehicle parade demonstration is held while solutions are being worked out to both, the GMOA's issues and the matter of the salary anomalies of the CEB engineers. Hence, it is clear that today's grand show is being held under political sponsorship.
It is indeed strange as to why those members of the Sangha who are making a big song and dance and collecting money from the public to pay the fines of two convicts, who were sentenced for misusing millions of public funds, are maintaining a deafening silence when doctors are turning their backs on suffering patients, leaving them to die. Has even one of these good Samaritans come forward to ask the GMOA doctors not to shirk their responsibility of tending to the sick, which is a core precept in the noble teachings of the Buddha?
