88th Battle of the Maroons: Ananda confident of win over Nalanda

Ananda College captain Kavishka Anjula expressed confidence that he had a team that can beat their arch rivals Nalanda College in the 88th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter which commences at the SSC grounds today. The two teams are vying for the P de S Kularatne Memorial Trophy.
“Our team had good preparation for the big match. We have a good bowling attack and a strong batting line too. We are ahead of the Nalandians and hope to win this encounter,” said Ananda skipper Kavishka Anjula.
Ananda coach Rohan Soysa also going along with his captain stated, “We played well this season and our batsmen are in good form with a lot of runs behind them. We have good spinners and fast bowlers and we know a thing or two about our opponents. We have planned to go for an outright win over.”
Nalanda were a bit more cautious with their chances of winning. Skipper Dasun Seneviratne said, “I think both schools have well balanced teams. But Shammu, Kavishka and Sahan are good players and that’s why I think it is a big challenge for us. We have a good bowling squad to face that challenge. We also have stylish batsmen like Malinga and Lakshitha and, Umeksha and Kalana will give their fullest support to our team.”
Nalanda coach Keerthi Gunaratne said, “We have good bowling attack and our bowlers will control the game. The Anandians have a good batting line but I think their bowling is weak. We can see a very tough game on the cards.”
These two schools started their big match series in 1924. R.S. Rajakaruna (Ananda College) and B.S. Perera (Nalanda College) were the captains of those teams. The game was ended in a draw. The first win of the Maroons Battle was recorded by the Nalandians in 1925 under B.S. Perera and when N.M. Perera was the Ananda captain. For the next two consecutive years Ananda beat Nalanda under the captaincy of W.W. Dep.
In the history of the ‘Battle of the Maroons’ Ananda has won 12 times in 1926, 1927, 1930, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1965, 1982 and 2003 and Nalanda six times in 1925, 1928, 1947, 1949, 1950 and 1953. The last Ananda victory was under Duminda Kularatne in 2003 while Nalanda have not tasted victory for the past 64 years their last win coming in 1953 under W. Wimalaratne Silva.
Ananda established a record for the most consecutive victories in the history of the encounter by winning the Big Match during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939. The match was not played in 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to the Second World War. The Maroons encounter was also not played in 1948, the year in which Sri Lanka gained independence.
This season both Ananda and Nalanda have recorded five outright wins. Ananda against St. Joseph’s, Trinity, St. Benedict’s, Wesley and Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Nalanda against Mahanama, Prince of Wales, Dharmpala Pannipitiya, St. Mary’s Kegalle and Maliyadeva Kurunegala. It seems that two evenly balanced teams will clash with each other at this year’s edition of the Maroons.
