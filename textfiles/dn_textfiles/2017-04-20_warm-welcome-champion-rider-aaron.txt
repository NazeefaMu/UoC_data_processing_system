Warm welcome to champion rider Aaron

The champion rider Aaron was warmly welcomed by the Sports Ministry and Sri Lanka Automobile Sports officials as well as friends and family on his arrival at the Bandaranike International Airport after Sri Lanka secured another Asian victory in the premier event ARRC. Initially it was the Daniel Brothers from Hellibees Racing team who represented Sri Lanka at the Asian rounds and thereafter the 600cc rider Mohamed Basith and Jaden Gunawardena gave it a go for a podium finish. However, who would have ever imagined a 13-year-old school boy would out do everyone and bring glory back home. The Gunawardena duo has made our country proud in many Asian events, but it is the first time a Sri Lankan has ever got on to a Podium of an “Asian Road Racing Championship” event.
Aaron had a rough start with a wrong selection of gearing in race 1 at the Chang International circuit in Thailand on April 14. However, race 2 on the following day was somewhat different. Aaron went on an incredible winning run leading throughout the last 3 laps to finish in second place behind the Japanese rider Fujita.
All eyes were on the Lankan who was on a decisive course to determine this year’s Championship. Aaron knew he had to extract every point he could to put the pressure on the five Nations behind him on the points table.
Currently Aaron is battling it out alone for his country with other countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia having 3 riders each and India has 2 representing their country. Currently the young Lankan has got his country on the 4th slot of the rankings and a head of 12 riders from 6 Nations.
Round 3 in Suzuka Japan will be crucial, as taller and heavier riders like Aaron would have it tough. The Japanese rider Fujita who is currently the smallest and lightest rider among the selected team would be the one to watch out, as besides Suzuka been his home track, he would have an advantage with his weight too.
