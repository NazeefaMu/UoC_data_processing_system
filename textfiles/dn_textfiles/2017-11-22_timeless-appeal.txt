Timeless appeal

There are two reasons you should buy a ticket for ‘Timeless Classics’. You will be able to enjoy an unforgettable evening of music by an amazing line up of talent including Soundarie David, and Shehara (Shey) Liyanage. And you will have the opportunity to make a difference in this world. Your compassionate act will do a lot of good to a lot of people.
“Timeless Classics”, is a concert to raise funds toward two of the Rotary Club of Colombo East’s anchor projects namely, Project BEAP—Accident and Emergency Trauma Unit Centre at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa, and the eradication of dengue which has been a terrible scourge.
The Rotary Club of Colombo East is proud to partner with Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo for this worthy cause.
The musical show is directed at raising finances to support the National Trauma Service in Sri Lanka, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and also to purchase an Ultrasound machine for the Batticoloa Teaching Hospital. All funds remaining will benefit the Dengue Eradication Program, commissioned in conjunction with the Ministry of Health.
Daily News speaks to Soundarie David about this unforgettable night.
“Working towards a performance is always an exciting and challenging experience, and that is what I like the most when preparing for a show. Further working with talented Shehara, who I have known for years, both from her days in the HFC school choir, to now – in Soul Sounds - has always been a creative experience. Music is personal to me, so this concert like all other concerts is special. What is interesting is the fact that it will showcase some of the well- known “Timeless Classics” through the ages. Further, my original works will be featured as part of the performances, and I am privileged to work alongside some great musicians for this. The well- known Jerome De Silva will be a Guest Artist at this show. Jerome being the theatre person he is, has always brought in something new, fresh and dynamic to any show, and I look forward to this component of the show as well,” said David.
Certainly the combination of talent promises a mesmerizing evening. Soundarie will be collaborating with Shehara on the piano. The songs are Timeless Classics.
Young or old, the audience is bound to have a favorite from their repertoire list. From the likes of Nat King Cole, to Whitney Housten, to Adele, it has a local twist to it. Also what is special is the unique arrangements to each and every song. You need to be at the concert to experience this.
For Soundarie working with Shehara has also been a rewarding experience, watching Shehara grow in voice and personality. Shehara is a talented singer and performer and this collaboration is eagerly anticipated by both women.
“We started raising funds for the BEAP project as early as March 2017, where we did a similar concert in order to raise funds in Melbourne, Australia.
This concert was a success – both in terms of fund raising as well as the concert, which was well received.
Hence we decided to do something similar in Colombo, to not only give our local audiences a treat in terms of the whole concert experience, at a brand new venue, but also a chance to contribute to a good cause. So by coming to this concert and buying a ticket for it, you will definitely be making an impact in helping someone,” explained David.
For a concert with a difference, for a good cause, Timeless Classics is where you need to be on November 26 at 5 pm. It is bound to be something special.
“Yes, Shangri- La is a new venue, and having gone to the site for initial meetings, I can guarantee that it will be something grand, unique and special. The entire concert has also been conceptualized by our talented production team to go with the theme and venue. So it is going to be spectacular,” pointed out David. David stressed that the concert will be refreshingly different while still being one of high quality. It will have the stamp of musical genius. It will live up to the expectations of the crowd, maybe even more! It will be an umbrella of music covering a wide variety of songs. It will be refreshing.
“I anticipate an audience of music lovers, and not just specific to any genre of music, because like I mentioned this concert will cater for all.
So we invite all those who want an evening of good music with a difference, difference in terms of the type of repertoire, the type of arrangements, the ambiance, the show and of course added to this, the unique talented voice of Shehara, the unmistakable Jerome De Silva, and Soul with unique original music,” added David.
David remarked that rehearsals are going well, it is fun and challenging, because they are always trying to create something new. David’s debut at Shangri-La makes this performance special. Timeless Classics will take place at the Shangri-La Ballroom, and as the largest ballroom in the city, this is the ideal venue for an event of this nature.
“The night will truly be one to remember – an unforgettable night. Every concert, every experience, and every challenge that is thrown my way, is something that I am thankful to god for. So I look forward to the experience, the concert, and will cherish the memories,” said David.
