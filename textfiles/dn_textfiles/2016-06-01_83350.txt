SLC's Cricket Aid flood assistance gets underway

Consequent to the recent flood crisis in Sri Lanka, it is estimated that over 500,000 have been displaced. Over a 100 have lost their lives, with as many as 100 still missing and now presumed dead. Many of the displaced are from the Greater Colombo area, where the un-paralleled flooding caused by the Kalani River spilling its banks has led to close to 200,000 persons being severely affected.
Sri Lanka Cricket's Cricket Aid, which is due to launch officially on the June 4 at Lord’s in London, began immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of this catastrophe and to date have collected several millions of Rupees in aid.
As a primary phase, over 300 volunteers of Cricket Aid comprised of staff, coaches, cricketers and well-wishers spent the day on last Saturday (28) at a Shramadhana to assist the flood affected with resettlement.
Cricket Aid distributed over 3000 aid packages that contained dry rations, bedding, clothing and toiletries and 10,000 Litres of potable water whilst volunteers cleaned and helped in resettlement of over 500 houses.
The campaign is set to continue in the coming week with School books and uniforms being distributed as a second phase.
