Why translation matters

Senaratne Weerasinghe has earned reputation as a translator equipped with the capacity to capture the essence and nuances of the original novels effectively. With his wide experience as a translator, Weerasinghe does justice to whatever the work at hand. The latest batch of translation to come from Weerasinghe’s desk includes Kung Fu saha Vilangu, Kung Fu saha Vandage Pilivetha, Dugi Sittarage Adaravanthiya and Kung Fu saha Andha Vishvasaya.
Why does translation matter? The subject is so huge, so complex, and so dear to heart. In a world where English is everywhere, translation is an absolute necessity. English is the third most widely-spoken language in terms of native speakers, of which it has at least 330 million. But if you count the people who speak it as a second language, it’s the most popular language in the world.
According to Chinese belief, kung fu is as fast as wind, as stable as mountains and as powerful as fire. Its origins come from manual labour and the imitation of animals, and today it is practised by all, no matter their age, gender or size.
Dating back thousands of years, the ancient tradition of Chinese kung fu has been passed down throughout generations to help preserve the essence of Chinese culture. Derived from the words g ng and fu, which roughly translated means “achievement through great effort”, it’s about using fighting skills in combat to defeat and kill, requiring coordination between the hands, legs, steps, body and mind.
Composed of extensive systems of codified practices, each system requires long-term practice to master. However, Chinese kung fu values practice of the body as much as that of the heart and the mind.
Practice not only makes one stronger, healthy and well-toned, but also cultivates the mind and enhances one’s inner beauty. One common misconception surrounding kung fu is that every Buddhist monk practices it, since the religion teaches that body and mind must be cultivated to achieve enlightenment. However, some monks practice Taiji, a slower form of kung fu, or even yoga.
It is not mysterious, everyone can undertake training. Kung fu is good for health and self-defence. Now, kung fu is widely practiced around the world.
Practitioners have different many reasons to begin kung fu, ranging from improving their health and becoming stronger to improving self-discipline and self-confidence. Senaratne Weerasinghe deserves much kudos for introducing a wide array of the Kung Fu tradition to the Sri Lankan readership.
