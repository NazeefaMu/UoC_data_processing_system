Accused in sexual case acquitted

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Dhamith Thotawatte acquitted the accused in the Panadura sexual case as the prosecution was unable to prove the indictment against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
When the trial concluded on October 3, the Judge directed the State Counsel to file indictment against the first witness for giving false evidence before Court.
In another case, an accused was indicted by the Attorney General with committing rape on his underaged daughter. When the case was taken up the accused was produced before Court by prison officials.
He was remanded till December 11 and the Judge fixed further hearing of the case for that date.
