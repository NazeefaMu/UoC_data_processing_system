Park that boosts country’s agro industry

The first ever agro technology park in Sri Lanka, Chamal Rajapaksa Agro Technology Park, at Bata Attha, Hungama in the Hambantota district was set up by the Information and Communication Centre of the Department of Agriculture under the initiative of the then Agriculture Minister, Chamal Rajapaksa
OIC of the park K.R.W. Keerthi said the park was set up to provide knowledge and new technologies of farming to the farming community and to make the tourists aware of the traditional techniques that ancient Sri Lankans used in farming.
He said farmers in paddy farming are given training in new farming technologies at the park.
An orchard can be seen in the park where native plants such as veralu, uguressa, madan, hibatu, galsiyabala, anoda, and nelli grow. Papaya, mangoes, pineapples, and rabutan plants are also seen at the orchard.
Keerthi said a model of traditional chena cultivation was set up where maize, cowpea, and kurakkan are cultivated right throughout the year. Not only from the Hambantota district, but from the adjoining districts, farmers value the service they receive from the park very much, Keerthi said.
