We are hoping to build on Galle win - Root

GALLE, Friday - England’s victorious captain Joe Root said that his team will want to build on their victory at Galle and there was still room for improvement.
“It’s not just us, like we’re the only side that struggles away from home. It’s very difficult to win Test matches abroad now. I think that makes it even sweeter when you do come to a very difficult venue, like Galle, and manage to win games. Hopefully we can build on this and it’s not just a one-off for us. We can go to Kandy with huge amounts of confidence and look to still improve and get better,” said Root.
“The win was very special. We played some really good stuff. We were consistent throughout the four days. That partnership between Jos and Foakesy was vital after lunch and from that point on we were pretty much in control of things. We said we were going to do things slightly differently at the start of the series and we’ve really backed that up and given ourselves a really good chance to go to Kandy with a lot of confidence,” he said.
“We had some clear plans about the way we were going to approach this game in particular on this surface. To see them work, to see the hard work leading into the game pay off, is great. The way we played in the summer was a sign of this team moving forward and we’ve really backed that up in this performance. The challenge will be to be really consistent.” - ST
