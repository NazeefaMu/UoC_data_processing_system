A tribute to senior journalist Sarath Malalasekera

Covering the Courts is one of the most challenging and fascinating beats at any newspaper, one rich with human drama. The stakes too can be enormously high when the defendant’s freedom, dignity or even his life are at issue.
Sarath Malalasekera was in charge of this most challenging, fascinating and highly responsible task for the Daily News for nearly 40 years.
This highly respected and much loved journalist who was fondly called “Sarath Aiyya” by many, is no more. He passed away last Friday at the age of 80.
Sarath Aiyya, we bid you “adieu.”
The following article based on an interview with Sarath Malalasekera was published with the Daily News special supplement to mark the newspaper’s centenary on January 03, 2018.
