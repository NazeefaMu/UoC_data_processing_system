Additional food crops failing

A large number of paddy farmers in Anuradhapura who have started cultivating additional food crops due to the prevailing drought using limited water resources have fallen from the frying pan to the hearth as the seeds have failed without sprouting.
This issue was raised by the Inter Provincial Deputy Agriculture Director G. A. P. Wimalaratne at the district agriculture committee meeting, recently. He said paddy and other food crops including chili have been destroyed in large scale in the Anuradhapura district due to the severe drought.
Wimalaratne said the crop failure was due to seed varieties being bought by farmers from the open private seeds market which is not legally recommended. As such, the agriculture department cannot be held responsible for this loss, he pointed out.
Farmers despite the instructions of agriculture officials regarding the selection and sorting out of suitable seed varieties through workshops, seminars and illustrations are still buying seeds from the market despite warnings, he alleged.
Provincial Agriculture Director B. P. S. V. Pathirana said unwarranted illusive businesses are taking place in the seed market hoodwinking the farmer. He said these malpractices will stop once the Seeds Act is effective.
