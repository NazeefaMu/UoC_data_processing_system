Karunakara Guru’s teachings can ensure world peace: Ranjit Madduma Bandara

The teachings of Karunakara Guru can impart peace to the strife-torn world, said Public Administration Minister Ranjit Madduma Bandara, while inaugurating the 18th Nava Oli Jyotirdinam celebrations at the Santhigiri Ashram in India on Saturday.
The teachings of Karunakara Guru closely resemble Buddhist tenets. Buddha spoke about compassion and the guru of Santhigiri is also known by the name ‘Karuna,’ which is compassion, said the minister.
The dignitaries included ministers Anoma Gamage and Dayadharma Pala Gamage, Provincial Council member Chandra Kithsiri Kashatapitiya and Kataragama Monastery chief incumbent Don Piyatissa Kumarage.
Kottayam Bishop Thomas Mar Timotheos, Santhigiri Ashram General Secretary Swami Chaitanya Jnana Tapaswi and Organising Secretary Swami Gururatnam Jnana Tapaswi, were present. The Nava Oli Jyotirdinam celebrations commenced with floral tributes in the parnasala at 5.00 am, followed by other rituals.
