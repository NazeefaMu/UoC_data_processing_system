Campaign to clean courts premises held today

An islandwide programme to clean court complexes will be held today as those premises have been identified as dengue mosquito breeding grounds, Sri Lanka Bar Association President U. R. de Silva said.
He said all judges, lawyers and staff members would join in the cleaning campaign that would cover all Court complexes in the country.
