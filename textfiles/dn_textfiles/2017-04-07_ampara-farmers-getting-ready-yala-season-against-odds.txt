Ampara farmers getting ready for Yala season against odds

About 45,000 acres of paddy lands will be cultivated during the Yala season in the Ampara district. About 58 percent acres of paddy lands will not be cultivated during the Yala season in view of lack of rainfall.
Preparatory tillage and canal cleaning are under way for the Yala season cultivation in the Ampara District with the help of excessive water flowing into the plantation area from the D. S. Senanayaka Samudra.
About 10,080 acres of paddy will be cultivated in the Akkaraipattu Irrigation Region under irrigation tanks, Akkaraipattu Irrigation Engineer T.Mayooran said.
