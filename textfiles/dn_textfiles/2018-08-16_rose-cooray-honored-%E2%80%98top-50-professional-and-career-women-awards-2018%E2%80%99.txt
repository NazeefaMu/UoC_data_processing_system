Rose Cooray Honored at ‘Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards 2018’

Recognizing her leadership and her significant contribution to the financial sector in Sri Lanka, Rose Cooray, Chairperson of HNB Assurance PLC, HNB General Insurance Limited, Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust PLC, Ceylon Investment PLC, Ceylon Investment PLC, Sithma Development (Pvt) Limited and Director of the Hatton National Bank PLC, HNB Grameen Finance Limited and Guardian Capital Partners PLC., was felicitated with the Judges Award at the “Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards” 2018, held recently at the Hilton, Colombo.
The occasion organized by Women in management and IFC honoured 63 outstanding women leaders from Sri Lanka and Maldives with Gold and Silver awards.
Having served the Central Bank for over 35 years culminating with her appointment as the Deputy Governor, Rose Cooray has contributed enormously to the development of the financial services sector of Sri Lanka.
She has been an integral part in policy making in the financial sector as well as in implementing economic development projects across the country. She has served the Ministry of Finance as Director General Fiscal Policy and Economic Affairs and has represented the Government on many Boards including DFCC Bank, Sri Lanka Telecom, Ceylon Electricity Board, Export Development Board, and National Housing and Development Authority.
Sharing her views on the award Rose Cooray said, “I am indeed happy and encouraged. However, I do not see this as a purely personal achievement. Unlike in the past, women in Sri Lanka now have many opportunities to reach the top and to achieve their ambitions and it is heartening to see many women reaching great heights in their careers. This indicates that commitment and hard work with integrity at the highest level can get women to the top irrespective of the challenges they may face. I am thankful to the organisers as these kind of events inspire career women to reach the top.
This accolade marks another milestone of my journey and it indeed is a great honor to be the recipient of this award and to be recognized for the contribution rendered to the development of the financial sector of Sri Lanka. In today’s society, women play an important role and have immensely contributed to the development of our economy.”
“Women of our nation have proven to be inspiring leaders, influencers, exceptional achievers and great entrepreneurs and I would like to consider this accolade a testament to the hard work, dedication and commitment of all women in our country,” she said.
