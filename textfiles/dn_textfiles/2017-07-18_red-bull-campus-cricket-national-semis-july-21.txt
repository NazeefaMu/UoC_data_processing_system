Red Bull Campus Cricket National semis on July 21

The Red Bull Campus Cricket National Finals 2017 that began on the 3rd July has ended in 4 out of the 22 competing colleges triumphantly booking their place for the semi finals, which is to be held on July 21. Business Management School (BMS) - reigning World Champions 2016, Saegis Campus, Thurstan College and Kothalawala Defense University (KDU) have pulled through the pack to semis.
The 1st quarter finals held the reigning World Champions, BMS against Richmond College, Galle. Richmond failing to adjust to the tight bowling of BMS led by Ranitha Liyanarachchi hiccoughed to a modest 115 before BMS with the help of Supeshala Jayathilake’s unbeaten 27, overhauled Richmond’s total to win the match by 4 wickets.
Though the target was just 116, BMS batsmen too failed to make it a confident run-chase as they also lost wickets at closer intervals after the 35-run first-wicket stand between Geshan Wimaladharma and Hashan Dumindu. However, when they were tottering at 67 for five in the 13th over, Supeshala Jayathilake pulled things back in their favour with an unbeaten 26-ball 27 to ensure their victory with three overs and four wickets to spare. Amshi de Silva and Thaveesha Abhishek bowled well for Richmond.
Saegis Campus against Lyceum International School looked to be a tight contest from the Group Stages onwards. When Saegis decided to take the first lease, three good knocks by Thikshila de Silva, Oshada Fernando and Lasith Abeyratne helped them reach an imposing 193 from their 20 overs. Chasing an imposing 194 to win, Lyceums got up to their hundred in the 10th over with just four wickets down after openers put on a quick fire 30 from just 20 balls. With No.3 batsman, Sanjeewa Kumaraswami setting the base for a confident run-chase. However, loss of a few wickets following Sanjeewa’s departure slowed down Lyceum’s approach towards the end to fall short by 30 runs.
Meanwhile, Thurstan College made their way into the semi finals without a contest as they received a walkover from their quarter final opponents, Ananda College.
KDU completed the semi final lineup eliminating the Foundation of Goodness Academy (FOG) with a 51-run win, which was assisted by a 43-run opening stand in just under 5 overs between Ramith Gunarathne and Ravindu Uyanhewa.
The two semis, Thurstan College vs BMS and Saegis Campus vs KDU will be worked off on July 21 at P Sara Stadium with the finals on the following day at the same venue.
