Case against Rohitha Abeygunawardena; order regarding preliminary objections fixed for Feb.23

The Colombo High Court yesterday set a date for order regarding the preliminary objection raised by former Minister and Kalutara district Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena over a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission for alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs. 41.1 million.
High Court Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne announced that he would make an order regarding the preliminary objections on February 23.
At a previous occasion, the defence party had raised preliminary objections regarding the case filed against MP Abeygunawardena.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
