Of parodies, carols and barrels of seasonal cheer!

I thought I had survived the frenzied seasonal stampede and made it through to Christmas Day and the New Year with my decrepit body and sanity intact. Yes, I have endured running the gauntlet of the loud noisy malls with thousands of people trying to maul one another. That’s why they are called mauls by the more timid shoppers.
Now if Christmas was anything like last year I must be half awake. The carols heralding the midnight service actually sounded almost as seraphic as those sung by ‘Hark and Harold’ and their angelic choir. I thought that even by Boxing Day I would be at least given a respite from the holiday music. Fat hope!
I regret now how I recalled the schoolboy antics of my good friend and former classmate Bonnie Boyd to the grandkids. They thought he was a hilarious lyrical genius. Worse still, they thought he was an icon to be followed as an example. Yes, I am referring to the same Boyd whose full-throated bell-like contralto drowned the rest of the songbirds in the primary school choir. He was not actually a nightingale, but nonetheless he always had his mates in gales of laughter with his naughty song parodies.
Whenever the hymns were being sung he would substitute words such as ‘Allapang-Loolla’ for ‘Alleluia’ or ‘Get-Some-Money’ for the reverent Lenten hymn ‘Gethsamane.’ Time and again his sacrilegious turn of phrase was detected by a vigilant teacher or cleric, mostly because he kept a serious demeanour while his mates guffawed at his lampooning lyrics.
Yet nothing could dissuade him from his twisted takeoffs. Nothing, categorically nothing, could lessen this burlesque mania. He was flogged ruthlessly for this addiction to satirize by fuming teachers and religious Lasallian Brothers at our school, St. Bens.
The thunderous slaps he received for this particular transgression were of such stunning magnitude that sounds of the wallops reverberated in the ears of his fellow students long after they had been administered. But hard-boiled Boyd remained oblivious to the punishment meted out by the slap-happy pedagogues. Astonishingly, he remained unmoved although both his facial cheeks took on the colourful hue similar to that of a Toque Macaque monkey. And his blistered bottom had the distinct resemblance to a baboon’s flaming red butt.
Still you did have to admire his affinity for turning the other cheek, even if it was not done solely in the true spirit of Christianity. Now the grandkids have caught on to copying the holiday song raillery. And what do I keep hearing? Melodies, parodies and more lyrical spoofs. Right throughout the season I hear my little ‘Loony Tunes’ Chipmunk quartet distorting the holiday lyrics.
Do you hear what I hear or am I hallucinating? Are the tiny voices really singing: “While shepherds washed their socks by night?” And when they serve the postman, the drivers and faithful old retainers who always drop by for seasonal largesse they belt out in full throated unison: “Oh come all ye faithful come and get a plateful!”
Hey, at Christmas or rather Boxing Day morning and I am tempted to put on my pugilistic gloves to defend my peace of mind. I forget the derivation of Boxing Day, but the feeling of wanting to invite your unloved ones outside one at a time and punch them in the face, does that come into it somewhere?
I do believe I have red and green bags under my eyes. No they are actually black.
The imagined hues are just a reflection of the green pine tree, the decorative seasonal tinsel and bunting which can play tricks on your eyes. No I am not referring to some of those old society hags who really do tote designer handbags and have Gucci bags under their eyes to match.
I find myself half awake all swaddled in Christmas decorations. The kids have been having a great time wrapping their exhausted old man in all kinds of streamers and bunting. Ok I turn around in bed and hear sleigh bells. Sleigh bells? But surely they are bells of some kind and make a heck of a noisy jingle whenever I writhe around. When I attempt to ignore the jingling jangling as I snuggle under the blanket the bells go ding-a-ling-a-ling. I realise by now that I have been festooned with bells on my toes as well.
Now I perceive that the wake-up offensive has been mounted on the scale of a D-Day invasion by midget grandkid insurgents. There is a cacophony of sounds with rattles, blowouts, squawkers, party horns and cap guns firing directly into my eardrums at point blank range. And then Kingsley the tiniest of the clan has been persuaded to climb into my bed and quip: “Hey wakey, wakey Dada. It’s New Year!” I turn around and drawl menacingly: “Go away. Who are you? I don’t know you. This is not Dada. It’s the Vampire!”
They respond with another parody: “We three kings of orient are. Trying to smoke a rubber cigar. It was loaded it exploded. Now we’re on yonder star...” However grumpy I feel there is no getting away from being imbued with the Christmas spirit as I blast off with my own answer in my own ‘Barimatone’: “All I want for Christmas is a good night’s sleep. A good night’s sleep, a good night’s sleep.
All I want for Christmas is my bed to myself, without this intruding little thief.”
This time I am out of bed and the invaders scatter with frightful screams. My toe bells jingle as I wade knee-deep through reams of discarded gift wrapping. I have a funny taste in my mouth and manage to cough up some disgusting tinsel. And the tangle of tinsel is the reason I have lost my voice, while suffering a bout of ‘tinsel-itits.’
It is only 7.15 in the morning and I distinctly hear the presence of the earliest visitor. It is the beautiful baritone voice of Boyd belting out the classic, ‘It’s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year’.
To be sure he has as usual parodied it with: ‘It`s the most wonderful time for a Beer!’ I also realise that the tree isn’t the only thing getting lit up this year, because Boyd is certainly all lit up with the spirit that cheers.
With three broken marriages behind him he serenades every eligible dowager with this parody of the hackneyed Christmas song: “Single bells. Single bells, I’m single all the way. Oh what fun it is to watch those couples fight all day. Yay! Yay! Yay!"
