Government has ensured full freedom to stage protests: Amaraweera

"The government has ensured full freedom to stage protests but the people at large blame the government for inaction when the protests cause hindrance to their daily lives," Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said
He was addressing a meeting after launching the 'Wewak Samaga Gamak' development programme at Ethbatuwewa, Hambantota on May 20.
"The medical profession is so important it has no alternatives. I request members of the medical profession not to tarnish their image by demonstrating at every turn for minor issues that can be resolved through discussion and negotiation," he said. The Minister said the freedom given to demonstrate should not be construed as a weakness of the government. It signified the democratic nature of the government. "Unending demonstrations would only place people's freedom and interests in jeopardy," the Minister said.
"The biggest challenge we face today is to develop the country's economy. It is the duty and responsibility of the government as well as the aspiration of the people. When steps are taken to develop the country, people's support is needed to ensure the success of those steps. But the people's contention is that everything should be done by the government," the Minister said.
"The government is not akin to a company that runs according to profit and loss. Its duty is to formulate plans and implement them. Success of them will be ensured only if they are implemented with the intervention of the people," he said.
Minister Amaraweera said doctors were now launching strikes over the SAITM issue when the President had already provided an acceptable solution. "But the GMOA was rejecting everything and acting like Shylock demanding the whole pound of flesh," he said. "I would consider this as very unfair on their part. Trade unions too should try to be a little flexible without sticking to one firm standpoint," the Minister said.
