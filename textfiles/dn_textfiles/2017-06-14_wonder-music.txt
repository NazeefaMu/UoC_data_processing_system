Wonder  of  music

Dictionaries say that music is a set of sounds emitted by man, beasts, cascading waters and rustling leaves. These sounds have always given relaxation. Rarely the precursors of doom.
H G Wells in his ‘Outlines of world history’ Vol 1 says that man has not determined when music originated. It has been recorded in ancient writings. Living beings have strived to imitate sounds they hear. The man sighed into a reed and the beautiful flute was born. Music consists of a series of sounds for sleep, to sing, to dance and to weep, to love and to pray.
Starting with the animal world, the female cicada makes a shrill sound with her wing. A call of love. A nuisance to the male. ‘Happy is the cicada whose wife has lost her wings! The stillness of the night is broken by the melodious sounds of much lower and higher animals.
All during their mating seasons. The mouse, cockbird, birds that roam the skies, the cat and much more make music their call for a mate. Just think what the world would be if a man was to make music the call to love. With no specific time for making the call, the air would be full of songs and instrumental music. A real cacophony indeed.
Music has grown with the man. He tried to imitate the sounds he heard. Some high and some low pitches. We can start at the very beginning. The beginning of life. The shrill cry of the new born babe announcing its arrival into this world. It was and will be music for all mankind. Later music was set according to a scale-Do-Ray-Me-Fa and Sari-Ga-Ma. They fitted the sound of music. Harmonised with the voice. The voice imitated the sounds around. The sounds fascinated man. As sung by Julie Andrews in the immortal ‘Sound of music’ the scale was the beginning.
The drum is one of the oldest sources of music. It was used in sending messages and various rituals practised by ancient man. For the Incas, the Red Indians, Africans and Asians, the drum was a part of their life. In our own land, different kinds of drums keep us enraptured, during religious pageants, and many other functions. The ear of man recognises the occasion on hearing the music. It is universal. Our viridu and the South Indian ‘villupaatu’ have the same rhythm. The wailing, sound of music denotes sorrow or death.
Music is a must when a young couple is united in marriage. The Ashtaka, the Jayamangala Gathas, Lohengrin’s wedding march as the bride enters the sanctum with her father. Then Mendelsson’s wedding march when the new couple walks proudly among their kith and kin.
All this is music most heart-warming with tunes so very appropriate to the occasion. Have you ever thought about the two ‘goodbye’ songs – sung after the wedding ‘Kedelle un kirilli’ of Mignonne and ‘Raththaran Duwe’ of Carlo Fonseka – so very heartwarming.
Music soothes a troubled mind. It’s there, even in funeral parlours. Soft music makes the sick relaxed.
The sounds of music are very pronounced in religion. The sound of drums in the perahera, the ‘Dhammang Saranang Gatchami’, church music, the Iman calling to prayer from the minaret, the devotions in the kovil are very distinct to their faiths.
We thank our musical giants Devasooriyasena, Amaradeva, MS, Jothi, Victor, CT and Chithra, Carlo Fonseka, Baig, Mignonne, Nanda also Jim Reeves, Pat Boone, Elvis, Bill Haley and also Schubert, Strauss, Chopin, Bizet and much more for giving us the dew drops of music.
The National Anthem, be it the fiery La Massaille of France to our Own Matha, a country’s anthem gives a feeling of pride and patriotism. An immortal melody. Six decades ago, the London Symphony Orchestra was here.
A hanger at the Ratmalana Airport was the venue. At the end of the first performance, as was the custom, they played our anthem.
Ninety-six artistes took part and Matha soared to celestial heights that day. Traditions were broken. Ten minutes of applause and an encore. Yes, traditions were broken. They played our beloved Anthem again, it was applause of tears. I am sure our sweet Mother Lanka and our beloved Ananda Samarakoon too would have wept with joy.
