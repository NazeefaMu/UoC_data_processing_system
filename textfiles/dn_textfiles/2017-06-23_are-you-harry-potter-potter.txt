Are you a harry potter potter?

I have always fancied a bit of pottery making but the last time I made some kind of such a creation, I was about 7 years old and I really can’t remember whether I was any good at it but how hard can it be for the girl that zip wires across valleys, swim across crocodile infested waters and beats the drum in a sort of semi-convincing way that has everyone dancing by the pool?
A belly dancing pot
We made our way from Negombo old town where I did some sketches of the wonderful old balconies with Ranjan to the very rural village of Kirimatiyana, where I meet with Sakunphala, our lovely 33 year old pottery teacher – The boys and I are shown some examples made earlier that morning drying in the tropical sun – immediately afterwards she seats herself on a low stool next to a foot-operated pottery wheel and slaps on an enormous piece of wet clay like an artist with a no-nonsense air of supreme confidence after she had done this a million times before. I wonder at this point if she plans to make a witches’ cauldron there’s so much clay but realise she is simply saving time by putting about ten pots worth on the table so she can do several at a time. Talking to my two sons Amzar and Samad I wondered if perhaps she knew that getting it in that central spot was crucial to throwing a good pot.
In about twenty seconds flat she fashioned a pot so perfect it could have been made by a Deep Blue operated machine. Wow! That is just so easy, I thought, as I took over the driving seat like James Bond girl getting into his Aston Martin. After some fumbling about getting the clay to even move with my dry hands, I dipped them her advice into water and caressed it into something resembling a belly dancing pot dancing to Arabian music until finally, fed up with the amateur at the wheel, the quasi pot escaped, taking flight across the floor into a wet lifeless heap into the corner of the shed, looking not unlike a giant slug. I looked up sheepishly, in total disbelief, at the assembled company from the surrounding village looked at first shocked and then started to laugh and so did I seeing the funny side of things. Not surprisingly they did not offer me a job to join their family business, although my youngest one made several very unusual pieces of pottery and my oldest created a fantastic looking vase.
I learn as I have another go that pot-making had been in the family for 75 years, three generations, and that she had been pumping out some 200 pots a day for 27 years since she was six years old. I was so impressed learning step by step how she fashioned those pots as if they were a part of her, coming out of her fingers like magic each one was so beautifully performed it almost looked machine made except for the occasional thumb print on the rim.
A couple of days course
We all tried to copy her with varying degrees of success and it started to get competitive and ugly as I again failed to cut the mustard but as it was descending into a mud fight the action was moved on to the area where they fired the pots – the hand built oven was a master piece. This was no ordinary oven at about 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, with two channels running down its length, covering the two sides of assembled pots.
Sakunphala’s dad showed us how the pots would be stacked up to five feet high and then covered first with broken pots then a layer of straw. The final layer was made of wet mud before the fuel, made of coconut fronds and husks, was inserted into the channels along with sawdust to slow the burn down for a day before putting in bigger husks for the second bigger fire on day two.
Although, this was the least successful of my experiences, it was nonetheless one of my favourite and very humbling – I would recommend it to anyone, not just for the hands on experience but also to see people and their cottage businesses outside the towns in their rural element and surrounded by Sri Lanka’s rich wildlife. For the boys it was a great day to indulge in their primal earthy instincts and momentarily experience rural lives in the raw, with this most hands on and challenging of art forms, pottery making. If you can do a couple of days course you will with practice create your own masterpiece in clay and for my sons it was the perfect excuse to get muddy and have a mud fight with the other village kids before having a game of cricket with a tree branch and a ball made from a Balsa seed.
