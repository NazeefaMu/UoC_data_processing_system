More facilities for war heroes' families - Ruwan

Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said the government aims to initiate measures to provide enhanced facilities and solve issues of war heroes' families.
Wijewardena made this observation yesterday participating at a ceremony to present Virusara privilege cards to disabled war heroes and families of fallen war heroes at the Sri Lanka Army Commando Regiment, Ganemulla.
“Measures are being taken to provide benefits to families of war heroes acting on the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Before the end of this year, Virusara privilege cards will be given to 25,000 families of war heroes while by next year, privilege cards will be provided to more than 25,000 families,” he said.
The minister said measures have also been taken to get the participation of private and public sectors to provide benefits to all citizens.
“Discussions will be held with the Army Commander and initiatives will be taken to return land under Army possession."
