Erroneous Data Analysis argues Fernando

President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando appearing on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries yesterday suggested that the data analysis provided by the Central Bank regarding the transactions of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited contains erroneous data.
Fernando PC was leading evidence through Wasantha Alwis, who is the Additional Director of the IT Department of the Central Bank, yesterday at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Fernando PC pointed out to the Commission that Alwis’ data analysis has ‘mixed up’ the data on sales and purchases with borrowings and lending.
Fernando also suggested that data on an EPF transaction which is also included in the same analysis, contains errors. Fernando also said he will provide correct data soon to the Presidential Commission.
