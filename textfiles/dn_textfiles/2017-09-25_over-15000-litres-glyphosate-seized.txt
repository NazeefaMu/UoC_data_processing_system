Over 15,000 litres of Glyphosate seized

Sri Lanka Customs on Saturday seized a container carrying a stock of Glyphosate, a banned agrochemical, which was illegally imported to Sri Lanka from China.
The stock of Glyphosate was in a 20 foot container which was taken into custody at the Orugodawatta Container Yard. Sri Lanka Customs Spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said the stock was worth around Rs.60 million.
Around 3,948 cans of Glyphosate containing over 15,000 litres of the banned agrochemical were nabbed. Further investigations are conducted by Sri Lanka Customs under the directive of Director General of Customs Chulananda Perera. The government banned the use of Glyphosate in June 10, 2015, issuing a gazette notification saying imports and use of Glyphosate are banned under the Import and Export (Control) Act, No 01 of 1969.
