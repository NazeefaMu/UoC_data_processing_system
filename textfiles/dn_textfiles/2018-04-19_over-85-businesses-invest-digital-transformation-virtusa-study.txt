Over 85% of businesses to invest  in digital transformation - Virtusa study

Virtusa Corporation, a global provider of digital engineering and IT outsourcing services that accelerate business outcomes for its clients, announced the findings of The Digital Transformation race has begun, a September 2017 study commissioned by Virtusa and conducted by Forrester Consulting, that reflects the digital maturity of firms worldwide.
The study evaluates the state of digital transformation across six key industries – retail, banking, healthcare, insurance, telco, and media.
“The Forrester study confirms that while most companies are preparing to make digital transformation a priority, they have a long way to go before achieving any kind of mastery over the multiple disciplines required to effectively innovate,” said Frank Palermo, global head of digital solutions, Virtusa. “Firms that are obsessed with their customer’s experience can achieve significant operational efficiencies and put innovation at the heart of their respective cultures and are the ones that will see the greatest benefits from digital transformation. In today’s business climate, with industries being disrupted at every turn, companies must be able to quickly change their products and processes to pivot to take advantage of new market opportunities. As the study finds, improving digital maturity will be key to meeting the changing needs of customers in an evolving marketplace.”
The study was generated with input from more than 600 digital transformation decision makers in North America and Western Europe to explore the state of digital maturity across six key industries. Respondents included C-level executives, vice presidents, and directors at companies with revenues ranging from $250 million to more than $1 billion.
The study deployed a digital transformation maturity index, examining firms’ innovation readiness and competency across these key industries in three areas: customer experience, operational excellence, and business innovation. In all three areas, firms fared slightly better in customer experience compared to operational excellence and business innovation. The study also identified five levels of digital transformation maturity firms can reach – Curious, Exploring, Deploying, Thriving, and Mastering – to best synthesize the data from the maturity index. On average, firms currently fall into the lower-to-middle range of the Deploying category (26.06 out of 45).
According to the study, currently 85 percent of firms surveyed said they would increase the budget, their company allocates for digital transformation next year, with 37 percent indicating the increase would be by 10 percent or more.
The study also recommends that firms be customer obsessed by building visions for winning over executive stakeholders, establishing baselines to build digital transformation roadmaps, and putting innovation at the heart of their firms’ cultures to ensure greater digital transformation maturity.
“In the age of the customer, empowered, demanding customers can exercise more choice than ever before in deciding which companies will earn their business, and which will fall by the wayside. To keep up, firms must invent or reinvent their businesses with technology at the core, or watch customers defect as their markets are disrupted,” the study states, adding, “To move forward on digital transformation, firms must evaluate their current capabilities, then plot a path forward accordingly. Furthermore, firms must move soon to keep up with the fast pace of digital change. In the age of the customer, firms must adapt or be swept aside.”
