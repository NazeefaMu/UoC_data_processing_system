Avurudu smiles with HSBC for 350 children

The staff members of HSBC brought the joy of Avurudu to over 350 children from four children’s homes and community centers this month.
Each year, HSBC employees take time off to spend time with children who don’t enjoy the abundance that many others do. The purpose was to share the joy of the Sinhala and Tamil New year celebrations with them and give the children a chance to experience the revelry of traditional Avurudu celebrations.
This year, children from the Meth Mihira Special Education Centre in Moratuwa; Salvation Army Girls School, Dehiwela; Community Concern, Dehiwela and Sri Jinananda Children’s Home, Wellawatte joined the Avurudu activities.
Fun Avurudu games and dance performances took place and the the Avurudu Kumara and Avurudu Kumari were crowned to much applause. Avurudu kevili, much coveted by the old and young alike, were on offer, including fresh kevum which were prepared at the venue.
The celebrations gave the children a chance to experience the enduring traditions of Avurudu and make memories that would last beyond the festivities.
