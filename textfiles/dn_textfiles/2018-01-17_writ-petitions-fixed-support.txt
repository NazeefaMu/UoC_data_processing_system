Rejection of nominations:
Writ petitions fixed for support

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for Friday (19) to support 14 writ petitions filed by various political parties including Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which sought a Writ of Mandamus order.
This was directing the Returning Officers appointed for the relevant local authorities to accept the nomination papers delivered to the Election Officers by the political parties in respect of the Local Authorities Election to be held for the purpose of election of the members to the local authorities.
When the petitions came up before the Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioners moved an earlier date to support the petitions citing that they want to support petitions before the postal voting date scheduled to be held on January 21.
Meanwhile, Senior Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appearing for the Elections Commission said that he was expecting to make his submissions under three categories which caused to reject the nomination papers presented by the relevant political parties.
The SLPP, National People’s Party, United National Freedom Party and Janasetha Peramuna had filed writ petitions in the Court of Appeal seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the relevant local authorities.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the District Returning Officers.
President’s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Meheran Careem appeared for the UPFA General Secretary.
