Sri Lanka well above Human Capital Index averages

Sri Lanka scored well above the South Asian region average and on par with the world average according to a new Human Capital Index (HCI) launched by the World Bank that assessed the health and education standards in 157 countries.
The HCI was launched by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim at the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings last week as a new tool to encourage countries to invest in people.
The Index ranks where each country is now in terms of productivity of the next generation of workers. According to it children born in Sri Lanka today would be 58 percent more productive as workers in the future if they enjoyed complete education and full health.
According to the HCI, 17 out of 100 children in Sri Lanka are stunted, and so at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime. “99 out of 100 children born in Sri Lanka survive to age 5. In Sri Lanka, a child who starts school at age 4 can expect to complete 13 years of school by her 18th birthday. Across Sri Lanka, 87 percent of 15 year-olds will survive until age 60. This statistic is a proxy for the range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes that a child born today would experience as an adult under current conditions,” the World Bank said in its data analysis.
The HCI measures the amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. It conveys the productivity of the next generation of workers compared to a benchmark of complete education and full health. According to the World Bank 56 percent of children born today across the world will lose more than half their potential lifetime earnings due to under investment in health and learning.
In 2017, Sri Lanka’s HCI is higher than the average for its region and income group. The Index is part of the World Bank Group’s Human Capital Project, which includes a programme to support to countries to accelerate progress in human capital outcomes.
The HCI have ranked countries using a rating scale of 0 to 1. The HCI South Asia average is 0.46 where as Sri Lanka has scored 0.58. The world average is 0.57. The HCI score is 0.44 in India, 0.48 in Bangladesh, 0.49 in Nepal, 0.39 in Pakistan and 0.39 in Afghanistan.
Singapore tops the HCI rank with a score of 0.88 and Korea, Hong Kong, Finland, Ireland and Australia also have a higher rating. The countries which lag behind in the index are Chad, South Sudan, Mali and Liberia.
