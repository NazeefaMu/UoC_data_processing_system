 The 54th Junior National Athletic Championships powered by SLT for the 17th consecutive year was held at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Diyagama successfully, despite the hindrance by rainy weather condition on the final day, May 15.
The championship brought forth a new Sri Lanka record for the pole vault event in under-20 girls category established by W.G.H.S.K. Dharmarathne from A. Rathnayake Central College, Walala with a record breaking performance of 3.34 metres. The championship also saw 14 new Meet Records and two equaled Meet Records being established.
