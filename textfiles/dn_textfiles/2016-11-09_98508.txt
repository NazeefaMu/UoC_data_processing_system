Opportunity beckons

When the national selectors named Upul Tharanga as the replacement for injured captain Angelo Mathews for the ongoing Test series against Zimbabwe there was a mixed reaction to it. Some were of the opinion why the selectors should fall back on a tested and tried cricketer while some thought that he was too old (forgetting that he was still in his early thirties) and past his prime and the place should have gone to a youngster.
Well, as things have panned out Tharanga has started to repay the faith the selectors had kept in him by scoring a century in the first Test and following it up with another important knock of 79 in the current second Test. On the first occasion Tharanga batting at Mathews’ position at number five contributed a useful 110 not out enabling Sri Lanka to build on partnerships in the lower order and get to a match winning score of 537.
In the second Test his half-century proved invaluable as it once again provided the team with a base to reach 500 plus for the second time in the series. He came to bat with Sri Lanka not too comfortably placed at 84-3 and forged a partnership of 143 with Dhananjaya de Silva that helped the side to recover to 255 for five and finally post a 500 plus total. Tharanga in fact became the first victim of the Decision Reviewing System (DRS) which made its debut in Zimbabwe in the ongoing second Test when he was caught at slip off the wicket-keeper’s pads – a decision which was initially negatived by the umpire but challenged by Zimbabwe was over turned.
It was not Tharanga’s fault that the century he scored in the first Test at Harare was his first in ten years after his 165 against Bangladesh at Bogra in 2006. It is the longest gap between Test centuries by a player since the Second World War. Since making his debut against India in 2005 Tharanga’s had a rather lopsided Test career. He was within the framework till 2007 after which his form fell away and he was more in the limelight as a one-day cricketer. He returned to Test cricket after seven years in 2014 with a solid knock of 83 against South Africa blunting the threat posed by Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel and Imran Thahir at Galle. But failed to hold his place appearing in only a further five Tests in the next two years before the current Zimbabwe series where he has been picked to strengthen the middle order. Primarily Tharanga came into the national side as an opening batsman and to his credit it must be stated that despite the ups and downs he has gone through in his career which would have made any other cricketer hang up his boots he has continued to play the game scoring heavily in domestic cricket and his selection to the Test side against Zimbabwe is due reward for his persistency and commitment.
Tharanga’s only 31 but having broken into international cricket at the age of 20 it seems that he has been around for so long to some because his appearances for the national team in Tests and ODIs have been rather sporadic. He is at an age where a cricketer peaks in his career and one hopes the Zimbabwe tour is the turning point.
Following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sri Lanka needs a player of Tharanga’s caliber and experience in the team to not only strengthen the batting but also provide invaluable insight and input to team strategies etc.
Following the form he has displayed in Zimbabwe Tharanga has been further rewarded by the selectors by being asked to captain his country in the one-day tri-series (featuring Zimbabwe and West Indies) which follows the two Tests as Mathews and his deputy Dinesh Chandimal are still recovering from their injuries and are unavailable for selection.
Tharanga has captaincy experience having led NCC (a club he has represented since the age of 15 from Dhrmasoka College, Ambalangoda) to become the Premier league champions in 2013-14 and also led Ruhuna in the inter-provincial tournament.
A naturally gifted left-hander Tharanga is the second batsman in the world to be involved in a double century plus partnership in ODI cricket seven times, the only other player to achieve that feat being Ricky Ponting of Australia. He holds the world record first wicket partnership in ODI cricket of 286 with Sanath Jayasuriya, the present chairman of selectors as well as the second highest partnership for the same wicket of 282 with Tillakaratne Dilshan. Tharanga’s innings of 174 (not out) against India at Kingston in 2013 remains the second highest individual ODI score for Sri Lanka after Jayasuriya’s 189 also against India.
Tharanga’s career has also had its downside. He has bitter sweet memories of having lost his family home to the 2004 tsunami including all his cricketing gear which Sangakkara graciously replaced and, being slapped with a three-month ban after being tested positive for a banned substance during the 2011 World Cup.
When Sangakkara retired from Test cricket, it was to Tharanga that the national selectors turned to fill the all important number three slot in the batting, but he could not fulfill that task.
Tharanga’s career has been full of opportunities of this nature which he has not been able to grab and cement his place in the team. The current tour of Zimbabwe is another that has come his way and one hopes this will be the turning point of his rather chequered career.
