Retro reflective signboards to reduce railway accidents

Retro reflective signboards will be installed at unprotected level crossings across the country as a solution to the continuous fatal accidents on railway level crossings and resultant multiple deaths island wide.
National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said retro reflective signboards will be installed initially prioritizing the frequency of accidents and unsafe locations. The rest of the boards will be installed in the future.
The first retro reflective signboard will be installed at the unprotected level crossing located in Nawinna on March 12.
He said there have been 151 deaths and 194 injured as a result of railway-related accidents including accidents occurring at unprotected level crossings and accidents due to trespassing on the tracks during the past 10 months. Train collisions with vehicles at railway level crossings had resulted in 348 accidents, while 53 passengers had died due to falling from trains.
