Kotikawatta residents protest garbage disposal in Kotikawatta

Kottikawatte residents have launched a protest against the dumping of garbage in the area.
The Colombo-Avissawella Road is currently obstructed as a result of the protest.
The move to dump garbage from Colombo in Kotikawatte and other sites comes in the wake of the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Thirty people were killed and as many as 30 are still missing after a section of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed on residents on Friday (14).
