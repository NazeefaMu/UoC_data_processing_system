Dengue mosquitoes now use new breeding grounds

The latest entomological surveys reveal that dengue mosquitoes have changed their usual breeding places and now breed inside homes and gutters,Entomologists’ Association President Najith Sumanasena said.
Sumanasena said dengue mosquitoes now breed in places located inside homes such as small water containers placed to prevent ants, refrigerators and pet’s drinking water containers.
 “Dengue mosquitoes breed where their future generation can easily find food. Now their selection is inside homes and gutters,” he said. The fine for dengue mosquito breeding places located in construction sites should be increased because it is another common breeding place for dengue mosquitoes, he said.
Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said there are around 40,000 quack doctors in the country at the moment and they make it more difficult for the dengue patients to recover. They prescribe medications such as `Ibuprofen’ for fever patients to bring down fever fast and gain popularity as ‘one shot’. Dengue patients should only take paracetamol. Other medications cause fatal complications such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome and they die, he said.
