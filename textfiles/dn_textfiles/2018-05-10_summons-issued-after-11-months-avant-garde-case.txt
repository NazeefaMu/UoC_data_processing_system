Summons issued after 11 months in Avant Garde case

Defendants in the case filed in the Colombo District Court by the Attorney General against Avant Garde Maritime Security Services have been issued summons to appear in Court on October 23.
The Attorney General filed this case in November 2017 to recover Rs 782 million owed by the company to the Sri Lanka Navy for the services provided by it.
The defendants in the case are the Avant Garde Maritime Security Services and another persons. Legal sources said the defendants had been noticed to appear in court nearly 11 months after the Attorney General filed the case.
