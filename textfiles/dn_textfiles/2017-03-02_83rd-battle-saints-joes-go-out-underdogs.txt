83rd Battle of the Saints: Joes go out as underdogs

St. Joseph’s College Maradana will have to battle hard to regain the Rev.Fr Maurice Legoc trophy in the 83rd Battle of the Saints cricket encounter against St Peter’s College which will take place on March 3 and 4 at the P. Sara Oval.
This Battle of the Saints encounter started way back in 1933 with St. Joseph’s College winning the inaugural clash. Robert Fernando led St. Joseph’s College in the first encounter.
The Joes last win was achieved in 2008 under the leadership of Ruwantha Fernandopulle.
Of the 82 matches played between the two schools so far the Josephians lead the series with 12 wins.
The Joes led by bowler Harin Cooray this season have won three matches outright against St. Patrick’s College Jaffna, Maris Stella College Negombo and Bandaranaike MV Gampaha while remaining unbeaten.
“Big match is a totally a different game to other matches. We are hoping to play positive cricket and bring the trophy which has eluded us for the past eight years back to the college,” said Harin Cooray the skipper of St. Joseph’s. Their batting has not been very consistent as only one batsman Nipun Sumanasinghe has been able to make a score of over 100 and is their top scorer for the season with over 1000 runs. He will have the burden of steering the batting for the Josephians along with wicket-keeper cum Sri Lanka youth player Revan Kelley. Apart from the duo Dineth Madurawela and Shevon Fonseka will be expected to bolster the middle order batting.
Much is also expected from Jehan Daniel the Sri Lanka youth player and Pahan Perera who have also scored over 500 runs.
To curtail the strong Peters batting line up the bowling will be in the hands of Harin Cooray who together with Jehan Daniel have taken over 120 wickets between them. Support for them will be expected from Havin Perera, Ruchira Ekanayake and Dineth Jayakody.
This year the Josephians are coached by veteran Sri Lanka cricketer and coach Roger Wijesuriya. “Both sides are very strong and have done well this season. Frankly speaking I was new to St. Joeseph’s but I am very happy with the ongoing progress. Batting is our strength as we have an advantage of playing most of the matches on our home grounds at Darley Road.
We will try our best to see the match finishes on a good note and we will set the bench mark in this game,” said Wijesuriya.
