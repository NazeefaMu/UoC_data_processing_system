Gazette to be issued on banned light-coarse fishing

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed Fisheries Director General to take immediate measures to issue the Gazette notification banning the light-coarse fishing method.
Although this method of fishing was banned in the Southern sea a few years ago, some fishermen had started engaging in this method again causing harm to the marine eco-system.
After considering the situation, the minister instructed Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando to take immediate measures to issue the Gazette notification with regard to the ban on light-coarse fishing. During the Progress Review Meeting held on Monday at the Ministry, Minister Amaraweera had also instructed the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard to take legal action against those who engage in this banned method of fishing.
During the meeting, the fisheries community charged that small-scale fishermen are in difficulty of catching enough fish to find their daily income. Scientific studies conducted by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) also stated that fisheries resources have been badly affected due to this illegal practice.
