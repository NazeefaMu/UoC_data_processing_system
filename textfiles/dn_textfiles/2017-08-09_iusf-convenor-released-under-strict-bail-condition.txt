IUSF Convenor released under strict bail condition

Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF) Convenor Lahiru Weerasekera, arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest was today ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by Colombo High Court.
Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision not to grant him bail.
Accordingly, the suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.10, 000 with three sureties of Rs.500, 000.
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, the High Court Judge warned that bail could be canceled and accused would be remanded until the conclusion of the trial, if he violated the bail conditions.
“A student leader should behave in an exemplary manner to the younger generation without causing disturbance to public and damaging public property”, the High Court Judge said.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the suspect had entered to the university in the year of 2011 to follow an applied science degree but he still failed to complete the degree program even after a lapse of six years.
“He currently has 10 pending court cases in several Magistrate's Courts,” SSC Bandara said.
Defence counsel appearing on behalf of Lahiru Weerasekara moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over a month. The Attorney General did not raise objections to release the suspect on bail.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Gamini Alwis appeared for the suspect-petitioner.
