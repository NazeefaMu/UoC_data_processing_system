Cycling for a ‘Pollution free and peaceful world’

Tapar Kumar Das, a school teacher from Kolkata and President of the Dibakar Memorial Explorers foundation is on a 1100 kilometer bicycle expedition in Sri Lanka to promote a ‘Pollution Free and Peaceful World’.
Tappar arrived in Colombo on Christmas eve with his bicycle and set off on Christmas day on his 1100 kilometer ride which takes him through the island with night stops at Bentota, Mirissa, Tissamaharama, Wellawaya, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Dambulla, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Mannar, Negombo and return to Colombo on January 6.
The Dibarkar Memorial Explorers Foundation is an adventure sports and nature welfare organization which has been carrying out awareness campaigns on global warming since 2014. Earlier this year Tapar Kumar Das and Chiranjith Dutta cycled through Yangon, Bangkok, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos to making people aware of Global Warming and Climate Change.
“I am spreading the message for a pollution free and peaceful world as over 1500 people have died due to heat stroke in the recent past in the subcontinent while millions more are faced with water crisis because the world temperature is rising. said Tappar when I met him as he was cycling through Matara last Friday (29th). Global warming is also a cause for the increasing frequency of natural disasters in the world” he added.
