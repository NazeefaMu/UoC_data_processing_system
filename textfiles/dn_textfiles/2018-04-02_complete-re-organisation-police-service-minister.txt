Complete re-organisation of the Police Service - Minister

There will be a complete re-organisation of the Police Service soon. The exercise is aimed to transform it to public praise and minimise criticism and allegations against it, Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
The Minister disclosed this when he visited the Kataragama Kiri Vehera Raja Maha Viharaya and called on Viharadhipathi Ven. Kobawaka Dhamminda Chief Sanganayake Thera of the Ruhunu Magampatthuwa and received his blessings on March 31. Maddumabandara said the duty and responsibility of Ministers and MPs is to work for the progress of the people by providing relief and facilities needed by them rather than to bring in No Confidence Motions. The Minister who stressed the need to maintain a proper management of the Kataragama Sacred City and new town said he would facilitate it by introducing a planned programme in the near future.
He said arrangements would be made for the Kataragama Esala Maha Perahera after holding discussions under the patronage of the Vidharadhpati of the Abhinawaramaya.
Ven. Dhamminda Chief Sanghanayake Thera said the proposed Kataragama Sacred City Development Fund to be launched under the contribution of officiating priests of the devalayas had not still got off the ground.
As such finding the Rs. 60 million needed for the Esala pageant had become a difficult task.
He also said special attention should also be given towards keeping a clean environment in Kataragama.
