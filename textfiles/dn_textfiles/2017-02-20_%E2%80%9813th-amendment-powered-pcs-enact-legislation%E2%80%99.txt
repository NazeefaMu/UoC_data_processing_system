‘13th Amendment powered PCs to enact legislation’

Parliament had the sole authority to enact legislation in the country upto 1987. However, the 13th amendment to the Constitution had given provisions to provincial councils to enact legislation superseding those of parliament, Attorney Manohara de Silva PC said in Galle on February 17.
He was addressing a conference on the new Constitution held at the Galle Intellectuals' Committee at the Galle Sports Pavilion.
De Silva said five Presidents including Chandrika Bandaranaike assumed power in this country, but they did not fully implement the 13th amendment. "Given this situation, the statement made by Northern Former Chief Minister Vigneswaran that he would exercise law and order and land powers could not be lightly dismissed. Vigneswaran was a retired Supreme Court Judge, and a legal luminary. He had also threatened to institute a court to hear allegations of crimes against war heroes if the government failed to do so.
"Vigneswaren said he would not release even an inch of land to extend the northern airport. Formulation of a new constitution was not a big issue for him.
But the problem was the renewed talk about existing laws and regulations which had remained dormant for nearly 30 years," he said.
Silva said provincial councils could implement laws for a division of the country with the the 13th amendment.
But only the President has the powers to defeat any moves taken to divide the country. That is why separatists were clamouring to abolish the Executive Presidency. The 19th amendment watered down the Executive Presidency and handed its powers to the legislature.
The Police Commission was appointed by the legislature. The Constitutional Council was a joke. It was created to weaken the powers of the Central Government, he said.
