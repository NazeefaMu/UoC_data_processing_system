Cyber Illusions marks sixth year of creativity and innovation

Live experience designer and consultant Cyber Illusions has marked its sixth year of creativity and innovation, in 2018, with the delivery of Oman’s largest projection mapping project to date.  
Driven by the idea of integrating design and technology, Cyber Illusions combines cutting-edge thinking and technique into extra ordinary digital illusions that merge video, light, sound, interactivity and scenic designs that deliver revolutionary experiences.  
Importantly, Cyber Illusions sixth year saw it delivering the largest projection mapping project in Oman for that country’s Military Technical College. Featuring a set up that spanned over 620 feet, across two buildings; the installation was part of a ceremony marking the graduation of the college’s first batch of recruits.  
Handpicked by Oman’s leading event solutions provider, GT Stage Tech, for this remarkable undertaking, Cyber Illusions was chosen due to its impressive portfolio of successful projects carried out across Asia and the Middle East, which showed it was abundantly qualified to deliver a project of this unique scale and complexity. This was especially important considering the many potential technical issues that had to be taken into consideration, which required a high degree of creative and technological talent and experience, areas for which Cyber Illusions is increasingly becoming known.  
Offering three disciplines to clients; Systems Integration and Automation for Live Events; Creative and Interactive Content Production; and Audio Visual Consultancy; Cyber Illusions believes a good experience is the culmination of multiple sensory stimuli working together in perfect harmony.  
The Systems Integration arm offers programming and show control solutions for complex live events. Today, live events are becoming more and more complex with high-tech equipment triggering many variables to create a desired effect.
Cyber Illusions has always had a flare for developing high quality visual content. Understanding these large format and multi-screen productions and delivering specialized content to make events come alive is what Cyber Illusions has been known for since 2011.
With more than ten years in the Creative and Audio Visual Industry, the Managing Director of Cyber Illusions Lalindra Amarasekara is no stranger to using technology creatively.
