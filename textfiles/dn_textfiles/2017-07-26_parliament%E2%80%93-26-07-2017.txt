[Parliament– (26-07-2017)]

New Act : Central Bank to manage foreign exchange
The Central Bank as a Government agency would manage but not control foreign exchange under the new Foreign Exchange Act, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament.
He said the previous Act had to be repealed as there were contradictory provisions. While several provisions were to control, the others were to liberalise foreign exchange.
The Prime Minister said the objective of the new law is to promote and regulate foreign exchange and to bring in foreign exchange belonging to Sri Lankans for the development of the country.
He said there would be no draw of foreign reserves as the Government assures the preservation of foreign exchange is of paramount importance.
He said the Government would within next few months acquire US$ 1.1 billion to its account by way of transactions of the Hambantota harbour and another additional amount with the Mattala airport agreement.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations commencing the second reading debate of the Foreign Exchange Bill yesterday.
He said the country's Law applicable to foreign exchange is the Exchange Control Act 1924-1953. He said after World War II, many countries in the European Union brought in exchange control, whereas the UK had such a mechanism from the start of the WW II. With the WW II, many European Union and Asian economies collapsed. They would not have revived without the Marshal Aid Programme of the Americans. However, Sri Lanka did not see it necessary to control foreign exchange since it had sufficient reserves. The country had developed reserves during the war thanks to the sale of tea and rubber, he said.
"When we gained independence after the World War II, our reserves were such that we gave a loan to the United Kingdom. The Galoya project was implemented with the reserves of Sri Lanka. We did not have to go to the World Bank or any one else, the Prime Minister said.
"However, in 1953, we had a foreign exchange crisis when our earnings from tea and rubber dropped. Then, the Foreign Exchange Act was introduced. The situation revived, but the Central Bank and the then Foreign Minister felt this was a necessity. The proponents of the socialist economy thought the control of foreign exchange was necessary. It became a habit," he said.
"We started liberalising since 1977. Many countries that started liberalising after us had changed the laws, amended the laws and repealed the laws. Only 47 countries had not repealed restrictive laws on foreign exchange," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
"We have a peculiar system. On one hand, we have laws to control foreign exchange. But if you look at liberalisation, it has come through under many regimes. The law is to control foreign exchange, whereas the regulations are otherwise. We have a contradiction here. People don't have full confidence in Sri Lanka. The other is regulation on gold. We don't control gold. Any person can purchase gold but under the permission of the Director General of the Customs. It is not controlled by the Central Bank, but regulations say it should be controlled by the Customs. We have contradictory provisions in the Exchange Act. That's why we brought in new law," he said.
"The objective of the new law is to promote and regulate foreign exchange. We have repealed the Foreign Exchange Act. The key feature of the new law is that the Central Bank as a Government agency is responsible for implementing the law. They manage foreign exchange, they need not control foreign exchange. The authorised dealers and restricted dealers authorised to deal foreign exchange will continue to be subjected to the provisions of the law. Every Commercial Bank continues as authorised dealers. A citizen having foreign exchange or foreign asset may use it for current or capital transactions. Capital transactions will be defined by regulations. Certain classes of transactions will be free of control," the Prime Minister said.
He said if some one has undeclared foreign exchange outside Sri Lanka, the Government can bring them in. It will play a major role in the country's development. Foreign exchange is not the luxury of a few rich people, he said.
"There are many Sri Lankans who have foreign exchange outside Sri Lanka. We need to bring them in. Our interest rates are higher than those in many countries that those monies are kept. We have given concession to Sri Lankan citizens to remit upto US$ one million with only a remittance fee of 1 percent. We have excluded monies coming under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Conversion on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, the Bribery Act. If the monetary board says there is a shortage of foreign exchange, the minister with the approval of the Cabinet can regulate or restrict the remittance of foreign exchange for six months, thereafter, another six month with the approval of the Cabinet," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Agreement on H'tota Port Joint Venture to Parliament today
The Government will table the agreement related to the Hambantota Port Joint Venture in Parliament today, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was joining in the debate on the Foreign Exchange Bill in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said the agreement approved by the Cabinet yesterday would be tabled in Parliament by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe on the direction of President Mathiripala Sirisena.
“We will provide ample room to debate the content of the agreement in Parliament. The project will be a great leap forward in relation to the development of the country. It will lay the foundation to convert the Hambantota port a profit making venture while generating thousands of employment opportunities for youth,” the minister said.
Replying to criticisms on slow-paced investigations on fraud and corruption charges, the minister said, “We have filed court cases pertaining to Rs. 3.1 billion worth money and property belonging to three members of the Rajapaksa family. These include lands, houses and black money invested on various purposes”.
Minister Samaraweera, explaining on the debt crisis of the country, said, “This year, we have to pay USD 2,805 million to repay the loans and interests. Loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime account for 72 percent of the sum. The peak of the debt crisis will be from 2018-2020. In 2019, we have to find USD 4,245 million (Rs 3.2 trillion) to service the foreign debt. Loans obtained during the Rajapaksa regime account for 82 percent of the sum. However, the total annual revenue of the country is little over Rs 1 trillion".
The minister, observing that the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations is a vital step forward by the Government to resurrect the country’s economy, said the Government has taken precautions to address any potential detrimental impact from the move.
Police vehicle used in arrest attempt on Ryan Jayalath: Sagala
Man with five arrest warrants
The vehicle used in the incident involving the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee convener Ryan Jayalath last week was not a white van, but a Police vehicle, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said in parliament yesterday.
He said the persons involved the incident were police officers ordered to arrest Ryan in connection with several cases.
He expressed his regret over inconvenience caused to the public while making a ministerial statement.
Minister Ratnayake said he had observed serious mistakes and shortcomings in the operation carried out by Colombo Crime Division policemen when they tried to arrest Ryan Jayalath.
"I have obtained a report from the IGP on the incident occurred when the CCD officials attempted to arrest medical student Ryan Jayalath at the Organisation of Professionals Association premises in the Cinnamon Gardens police area on July 20," Minister Rathnayake said.
The incident occurred when police tried to arrest Jayalath, a wanted suspect with regard to the Case No. B 16250/17 at the Maligakanda Magistrate Court under the charge of trespass and damaging public property during a protest at the Health Ministry on June 21 and Case No B 3049/16 at the Fort Magistrate Court for violating court orders, the minister said.
He said Police had come to know that the suspect was at the OPA building on July 20. The CCD officials launched an operation to take the suspect into custody, Minister Rathnayake said. Four policemen in uniform and nine policemen in civvies had participated in the operation. They had been transported to the location by a vehicle belonging to the police and driven by an uniformed police driver, he said.
"I have instructed the IGP to ascertain whether there had been mistakes in the hands of senior police officials when they issued instructions to launch this operation which drew public displeasure and international attention," Minister Rathnayake said.
"The IGP has issued a circular on the methods to be adhered by policemen when they make an arrest."
He expressed regret to the public, the President and the Prime Minister for the inconvenience caused by the Police Department by Police conduct in trying to arrest medical faculty student Ryan Jayalath.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena making a special statement under the standing order 23 (2) said the Government deploys white vans to abduct those who stand against them. He questioned if the Government deny that those in the civil attire were not the police officers. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the vehicle was not a white van but a Police vehicle. Court had issued five arrest warrants on Ryan, he said.
Dual citizenship holders allowed to serve in foreign diplomatic missions
The Foreign Affairs Ministry has taken a decision to allow persons holding dual citizenship to serve in Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said the decision was taken after discussions at the ministry.
“Some Sri Lankans living in foreign countries are talented professionals. We are depriving the chance to get their services to the country, if we impose citizenship restrictions. These individuals are not elected public representatives unlike the MPs. There is no harm in appointing them to Foreign Diplomatic Missions,” the minister said.
Responding to a question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake in Parliament yesterday, the minister said two dual citizenship holders were among the appointees to Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka from August 1, 2015 to August 1, 2016.
“Swarna Gunaratne, who was appointed as the Consul General of Los Angeles, USA in March 2016 is a Canadian and Sri Lankan dual national and Manoj Warnapala, who was appointed as Counsellor to Sri Lankan High Commission in London, UK in October 2015 is a British-Sri Lankan dual national,” he said.
The JVP, however, questioned how the Government could assure the loyalty of the dual citizens appointed to represent Sri Lanka in overseas missions.
Parliament was told that 88 appointments to the Foreign Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka from August 1, 2015 to August 1, 2016 were made outside the Sri Lanka Foreign Service.
“There are non-diplomatic officers, Cabinet appointees, officers from other relevant Ministries and Departments, Public Management Assistants, Drivers and Office Assistants among them,” the answer given to Parliament stated.
