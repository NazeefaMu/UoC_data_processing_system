Fairfirst Insurance introduces trilingual chat bot, Machan

Fairfirst Insurance has launched its very first artificial intelligence based chat bot named Machan. Yet another tech driven breakthrough, Fairfirst policyholders will now be able to keep abreast of what’s happening with their claim without the hassle of having to reach out to the sales agent/broker or the Fairfirst call center.
Additionally, Machan is also the very first chat bot in the industry that is available in three languages, Sinhala, Tamil and English
The launch of Machan is expected to reduce waiting time for claimants with real time updates available at their fingertips. Machan is capable of having simultaneous conversations with hundreds of people.
No matter what time of the day it is or how many people are in contact, every single one of them will be answered immediately.
What’s even more impressive is the ability for Fairfirst to continuously improve customer service through analytics and data collection.
Commenting on this feature was Head of IT at Fairfirst Insurance Clement Fernandopulle “we are confident that Machan will significantly change how we operate and this is the first of many new process improvements to kick in” Another key feature is Machan’s ability to outline any due claim documentation and allow customers to upload these documents via the chat bot. Speaking on the launch of Machan was Head of Claims Deshapriya De Silva “Claim settlements are any insurers biggest service priority and investments of this nature are sensible”
