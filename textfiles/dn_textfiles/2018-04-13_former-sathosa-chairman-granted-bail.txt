Former Sathosa chairman  granted bail

Former Lanka Sathosa Chairman Nalin Ruwanjeewa Fernando arrested for allegedly misappropriating Rs.39 million Sathosa funds during the last Presidential Election, was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the alleged offences cannot be considered as offences committed under Public Property Act since Lanka Sathosa comes under the purview of Company Act.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.25,000 with two sureties of Rs.300,000. An order was also issued preventing the suspect from leaving the country.
The FCID had commenced an investigation against former Sathosa Chairman and for Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage in connection with importation of 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draught boards during the previous regime.
On April 06, the Court of Appeal had dismissed a writ petition filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who sought an order preventing the FCID from arresting him for allegedly committing offenses under Penal Code and the Public Property Act while importing sports equipment.
