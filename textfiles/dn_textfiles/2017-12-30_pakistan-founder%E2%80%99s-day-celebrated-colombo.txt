Pakistan Founder’s Day celebrated in Colombo

The Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka paid homage to Pakistan's Founding Father Muhammad Ali Jinnah in connection with his 141st Birth Anniversary celebrations at the High Commission premises.
The ceremony was held under the theme “Hamara Quaid” and Main Hon Quaid ka Pakistan”.
High Commissioner Dr. Shahid Ahmad Hashmat, paid tribute to the Quaid for his untiring struggle and meritorious efforts for the creation of Pakistan. He underscored that the creation of Pakistan would not have been possible without the diligent efforts, singularity of purpose, vision and leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Dr. Shahid Ahmad Hashmat said that Quaid-e-Azam was a constitutionalist, who believed in democracy and social justice.
His struggle for a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Sub-Continent was aimed at creating a country where the Muslims could practice their religious, cultural and social values freely, he added.
