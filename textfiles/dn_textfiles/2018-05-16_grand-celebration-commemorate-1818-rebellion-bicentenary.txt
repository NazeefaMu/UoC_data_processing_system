Grand celebration to commemorate 1818 rebellion bicentenary

The bicentenary of the famous 1818 rebellion is to be celebrated on a grand scale.
Science Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama has directed relevant officials to make necessary arrangements to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the 1818 rebellion, which falls this year.
He has directed that the National Archives Department, the Kandyan Heritage Unit of his Ministry and the Department of Archaeology should join hands to organise various programmes to depict the rebellion and other related incidents, which were of national and cultural significance.
The Minister has said the history of victorious selfless struggles launched by our forefathers to protect our freedoms should be subjected to appraisal and bequeathed to future generations.
"Unless this was done, we would be doing a disservice to the country and nation," the Minister has said.
