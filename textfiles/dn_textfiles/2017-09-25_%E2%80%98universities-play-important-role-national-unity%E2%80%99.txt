‘Universities play important role in national unity’

Universities play an important role in national unity and reconciliation, which is the need of the day. Hence, we must all work hard to achieve this goal, keeping in mind that all of us are Sri Lankans, said former President and Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga.
She was addressing the academics, students and staff of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka at the Auditorium of the Engineering Faculty, recently.
UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva, Vice Chancellor Prof.MMM Najim, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Dr. S. M. Junaideen and the Co-Coordinator of ONUR Eng. M. B. Murshid received the former president and her officials at the Faculty of Engineering.
Explaining the objective and the purpose of setting up of ONUR to the academics and the students of the university, former President Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga said that ONUR was set up with the commitment to achieve national unity and reconciliation, to give effect to this pledge.
She added, “The war that lasted for 30 years and brought heavy losses of human life and properties of Sri Lanka, has now come to an end and peace prevails; however, the people of Sri Lanka are still not enjoying a healthy peaceful situation. In order to make this reality, we are striving hard to achieve this goal and we thought universities are ideal places to initiate this project.” She announced that seven universities have been selected to implement this project. She said university students can be utilized as agents for positive changes by conducting various activities based on interest of each higher institute. She also expressed her confidence that that as this universities consist of all three communities, this project can be given a big boost and appealed to all students to work constructively.
University staff and the students raised various questions at the open discussions which followed.
