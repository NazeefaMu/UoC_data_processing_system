Google celebrates 20th anniversary with a video doodle

Search engine giant Google celebrated its 20th birthday on Thursday with a special video doodle featuring popular searches all over the world throughout the last two decades of its existence.
The video features popular search queries like Y2K, Pluto losing its status as a planet, the Royal Wedding, 2012 on the Mayan calendar, how to pronounce ‘gif’ and how to make avocado toast.
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in September 1998, as part of a PhD project. Page and Brin met at Stanford University in 1995. By 1996, they had built a search engine, initially called ‘BackRub’, that used links to determine the importance of individual web pages.
“Twenty (ish) years ago, two Stanford Ph.D. students launched a new search engine with a bold mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Though much has changed in the intervening years, Google is still dedicated to building products for everyone,” a post on the official Google Doodle blog said.
Google Search is now available in more than 150 languages and over 190 countries.
