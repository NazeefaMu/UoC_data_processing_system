Speaker signs Judicature Amendment Bill

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday signed the Judicature Amendment Bill to set up a permanent high court to expedite the cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
The Speaker’s Media Division in a statement said the Speaker gave his assent to the Bill. Accordingly, the Bill comes into effect from yesterday.
The Bill was passed with amendments in Parliament last Wednesday. It received 119 votes in favour and 52 votes against following a division called by the Joint Opposition.
A number of offences including theft, dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servant, banker, merchant or agent and dishonestly receiving stolen property can be directed to the permanent high court.
Cheating, forgery, making a false document, making or possessing a counterfeit seal, plate and others to commit a forgery and offences of money laundering can also be directed to the separate court. Bribery of judicial officers, Members of Parliament, police officers, peace officers and other public officers has been listed as an offence that can be tried in the court. Corruption, conspiracy and abetting offences under the Bribery Act can be tried in the court.
