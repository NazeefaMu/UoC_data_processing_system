Six Sri Lankan asylum seekers deported from Sweden

 Six Sri Lankan asylum seekers who were deported from Sweden, arrived at the Mattala Airport yesterday on a ‘Sweden Air’ flight.
After their landing, officers of the Criminal Investigations Department questioned the deported Lankans.
They had been deported as the Sweden authorities had refused to grant them citizenship status. Police investigations concerning the six deported Sri Lankan’s are continuing.
