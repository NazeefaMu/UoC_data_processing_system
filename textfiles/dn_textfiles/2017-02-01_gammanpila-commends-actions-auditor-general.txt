Gammanpila commends actions of Auditor General

The government is trying to remove the Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe to continue with its fraud, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila. He said this yesterday at a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head Office in Pitakotte. He said it was due to the honesty and dedication of the Auditor General that the COPE Committee could reveal the fraud behind the Treasury Bond issue. He added that the fraud behind the Coal transaction too could have been revealed due to the Auditor General working in line with the law. "The greatest obstruction for this government's fraudulent activities is the Auditor General and the ministers and members of the government are attempting to sling mud at the Auditor General."
He said Minister Kiriella had said the World Bank was of the view that the audit report on the Treasury Bond issue was not up to global standards. He added that the World Bank would not have made such a statement and knew that such a statement could only be made by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
MP Gammanpila said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake criticised the Auditor General for giving a report to Parliamentarians without a copy to him first. He added that the Auditor General was only answerable to the Parliament and not to the Executive.
