SriLankan Airline launches Colombo Melbourne direct flight

The national Carrier, Srilankan Airlines’ Colombo-Melbourne direct flight has reversed the trend of declining passenger traffic into Sri Lanka.
Despite Australia being home to a  large Sri Lankan Diaspora and student community, passenger arrivals into Sri Lanka have been on the decline in 2017, one of the prime reasons being the lack of direct flights from Colombo to Australia.
This status quo was improved by SriLankan Airlines’ strategic launch of its direct daily flights from Colombo to Melbourne last year. The route has already registered a profit within a short period of less than six months, demonstrating its potential as one of the fastest break-even and profit-making routes in the airline's network.
There has been a tangible upward surge in tourists arrivals from Australia since the month of October ‘17, since the launch of the direct flight.
Commenting on the performance, Suren Ratwatte Chief Executive Officer, SriLankan Airlines said, “We are delighted to fulfil a long-felt need for a direct flight from Colombo to Melbourne. The tireless efforts of the airline's marketing and commercial teams have made a significant contribution to this success. Following the success of this strategic decision, we will explore opportunities, between Colombo and Sydney and other destinations in Australia.”  
SriLankan is a member of the prestigious oneworld global airline alliance, SriLankan offers convenient connections to 14 cities throughout India, nine in the Middle East and other destinations such as Male and Gan Island in the Maldives and Seychelles. The Airline also operates one-stop twice-daily services between Sri Lanka and Australia with its codeshare partners Qantas and Malaysia Airlines.
Launched in 1979, Sri Lanka’s National Carrier is an award-winning airline with a solid reputation for service, comfort, safety, reliability, and punctuality.
The airline provides convenient connections to its global route network of 94 destinations in forty four countries.
