ARC Fertility India to invest Rs 100 mn in Lanka

ARC Fertility India will invest Rs 100 million to open their first International Fertility & Research Centre in Bambalapitiya, Colombo 04. The company has also received BOI approval and the facility will open next week.
ARC Fertility India Founders Dr. Saravanan Lakshmanan and Dr. Mahalakshmi Saravanan said that they inaugurated their first ARC Fertility in 2004 in Chennai and it was very successful.“We have now opened over 14 ARC International Fertility & Research Centres all over India. In addition we have also started a multispecialty facility, Abhijay Hospital (Pvt) Ltd. We have treated 100,000 childless couples.’’
Dr. Lakshmanan said that they observed that there were foreign players in this segment in Sri Lanka and this was one reason for them to open in India. “In addition many Sri Lankan couples are also visiting India to take this treatment from over 60 plus hospitals that are offering this service. We have also utilized the Information Technology (IT) very effectively. They have a YouTube channel (ARC Fertility) which has recently fetched ”Asia Book of World Records” for reaching 27 million views from 200 world countries with 1,330 awareness videos in subfertility in multiple languages.”
Both the founders have received “Guinness Book of World Records” in for creating awareness in men and women fertility and mental health in 2017/2018.
Understanding their higher demand of sub fertility globally the founders decided to expand the services in key locations.
