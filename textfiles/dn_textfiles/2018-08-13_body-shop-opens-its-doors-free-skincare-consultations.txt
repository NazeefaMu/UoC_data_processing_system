The Body Shop opens its doors to free skincare consultations

The Body Shop in Sri Lanka is ensuring that you don’t neglect your skin this Summer, with the introduction of free skincare consultations at all three of its stores in Sri Lanka.
Trained beauty specialists will be on hand to offer their expertise on how best to take care of skin during the dry and dusty period, with an extraordinary new product that not just effectively deep cleanses but also moisturises and vitalises dull skin.
Through The Body Shop’s one on one consultations, customers will receive personalised advice on how to implement cleansing into their daily morning skincare routine, or even when removing make-up at the end of the day.
The Intensely Revitalising Cleansing Oil-in-Gel from The Body Shop is a matchless new addition to the nourishing Oils of Life™ skincare range; an essential upgrade to an everyday skincare routine during the hot Summer months.
Suitable for all skin types, its unique texture undergoes a sensorial transition from a rich, gel-like texture on application, into a light, milk lotion once in contact with water; removing residual impurities and leaving skin feeling supple and moisturised for an entire 72 hours.
