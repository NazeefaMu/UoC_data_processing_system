SIU Director to assess Point Pedro shooting

The Police Special Investigations Unit Director has been sent to Point Pedro in Jaffna in order to appraise the ongoing investigation into the police shooting which killed a lorry driver transporting sand last Sunday.
He has been sent to Point Pedro on the instructions of the Inspector General of Police to assess the progress of the ongoing probe and give necessary instructions, a statement by the Police media spokesman’s office said. Police officers involved in the incident have said that they opened fire at a sand transporting lorry after the driver failed to heed orders to stop and tried to flee.
A 25-year-old was killed as a result of the shooting, and a tense situation has prevailed in the area after the incident.
Two police Officers were subsequently arrested in connection with the incident and later remanded.
