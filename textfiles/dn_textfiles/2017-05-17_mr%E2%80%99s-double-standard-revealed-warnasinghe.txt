“This is the double standard of Mahinda Rajapaksa”, Warnasinghe said.
“Weerawansa said they would hoist black flags when the Indian Prime Minister comes to Sri Lanka to take part in the United Nations International Vesak Day Celebrations in Colombo. Weerawansa said the Indian Prime Minister would come to sign the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and to take over the Trincomalee Oil Tanks,” he said.
