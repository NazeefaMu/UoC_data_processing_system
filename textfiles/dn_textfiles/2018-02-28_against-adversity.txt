Against Adversity

For Head Girl of Highlands Ranudi Perera it was always going to be her heart. Perfect Prefects features Perera who claims her leadership is based on kindness and empathy.
Perera possesses an attribute that is not fully understood by science – and that is kindness. It is at once more compelling than intelligence or courage. It is not easy for a good man to lead. But Perera manages it. And in this world we live in, that is a rare quality.
“I feel that one attribute that stands out about my leadership is my kindness. I believe in treating those under me in a very humane way with a lot of understanding and compassion. I would like to be an example of kindness to my fellow students. My ambition is to be a teacher. For this I would like to do well in my studies and go to university,” explained Perera.
Firm kindness
As mentioned by her Head Boy Seniru Epasinghe she too believes in Unity. But while Epasinghe looks at unity in terms of standing against adversity, Perera looks at unity as a matter of the heart – being united by kindness. However this is not to say that she allows indiscipline. She is firm when she needs to be firm.
“We must work together, have unity and coordination. Also the ability to control others is an important part of my leadership. Yes I am kind but I am not soft,” said Perera.
When facing a difficult situation Ranudi says she would take advice from her teachers and the prefects’ board and then follow their advice. Because she feels that in addition to leading a student population she still needs to take directions and instructions. While being a leader she is still a follower.
“I would say that in Sri Lanka, what I see as a big problem is a lack of unity. I think helping each other is an essential part of a well- organized society. This kind of culture of giving and helping is something I would like to promote. I think respecting others is very important to ensure security and order. I don’t believe in condemning others and judging them. I believe we should work together,” pointed out Perera.
Perera is part of the Media Club. The club has done wonders for her self- confidence. As she got used to being exposed to the outside world she lost this fear of expressing herself. She soon became a shepherdess to the young ones who came into the media club.
Reprimanding someone
“First I need to thank my parents for where I am today. I must also thank my teachers’ right throughout my education from the nursery. They taught me how to grow up and how to become well- disciplined young lady,” added Perera.
Perera’s message to anyone who wants to be a leader is to choose their words carefully and wisely in a way that does not lacerate anyone’s feelings. She does not believe in hurting anyone’s feelings. Even when reprimanding someone there is a way to put ideas across. Scolding a person is something she likes to avoid.
“First you should speak to someone kindly. Do not fight and advise them kindly and lovingly. And I believe they will then listen to us. Because we all like to be loved and we don’t like to be at the receiving end of negative criticism,” said Perera.
Perera says she is not someone who becomes affected by pressure. If she is in a tense situation she just detaches herself from it and tries to be calm.
“The education I have received from the Highlands is very good. Our teachers are always available and always have an ear. They are there for us anytime during school. They would go out of their way to help us. They help us in many ways to succeed in life,” stated Perera.
Disrepute and disgrace
One of the most important parts of Perera’s leadership is inculcating a love for the school in students, because they all have a lot that they owe to the Highlands. They have received much from the school in terms of education and it has become a platform for them.
“Do not bring the school into disrepute and disgrace by behaving badly in public. Always think of other people. Always be a role model to others,” said Perera.
Perera feels that one problem in the world that she sees is aggressive, unethical and uncalled for behavior. Behavior that is undesirable. Behavior that is unreasonable or irrational. We see this a lot in society. Husbands abusing their wives, wives also abusing their husbands, children being abused. Violence in society, work place harassment and many more.
“There is a great need to understand others. I became a head girl because teachers understood me and helped me. They told me as a girl in this day and age you need to be well-disciplined. A girl has to protect her name and reputation. Her character is important and she must value her character,” explained Perera.
The temple is a sanctuary for Perera. As a Buddhist she meditates and calms her mind. Her source of strength is her parents. She has a very open relationship with her parents and they are always there for her.
Climbing hills
“School is a place that has meant a lot to her. As a teacher I can give back to society. As a teacher I would like to share my experiences with the students. Because I really enjoy my schooling years. It is a part of me that I will never let go. I do a lot of activities related to nature – such as climbing hills and mountains. I love the rainforests,” she explained.
Despite her naturally giving character she does not believe in trusting everyone. Even though we are faithful others may not be the same. So we need to be a little cautious.
“I am lucky to have a guild that is very intelligent. I do not have to go after them, they do things on their own. I don’t need to remind them all the time. I have got into the habit of balancing school and family. I manage my time. I enjoy my time with my family and friends,” said Perera.
 
Highlands College has offered Head Boy Seniru Epasinghe an arena for development. Perfect Prefects features Epasinghe who with the school behind him is ready to begin his life journey.
First and foremost Epasinghe needs to be a role model to others, if he is to exercise the powers of his office to the fullest.
“Because if I am not a role model then I cannot win people over and get them to work with me. I understand that sports and other extra-curricular activities as well as studies are important for the development of the personality of a student. I encourage them to engage in such activities. I need to motivate others to perform their duties, because the Head Girl and I reply on a properly functioning system of command which ensures discipline in the school” said Epasinghe.
His goal in life is to be a software engineer. This goal is largely altruistic since he wishes to be one, so he can help others in their day to day activities.
“I believe in Unity. No matter how desperate the situation is or the odds stacked against me are, I knows that my guild will stand by my side and I will stand with my guild. That is the quality of my leadership. We will stand in unison when it comes to any activity at school. I understand my success depends on the loyalty and respect my underlings have for me,” explained Epasinghe.
He knows his prefects are young. And that once they leave the portals of Highland they will have to face the world. It is vital that they look up to him for this reason alone. He needs to guide them and prepare them. His character must be without blemish and his behavior needs to exemplary.
“I will tackle the problem alone if it is within my power. If the problem is something that is severe I will seek counsel from my parents and teachers. But always on my mind is the team. That is my first resort. They are comfortable taking orders from me and treat me as more of a mentor. I have trained and directed my guild, as to what to do when encountering a difficulty,” said Epasinghe
Money is not everything for young Epasinghe. His business is being a fisher of men. The abilities of an individual is what greatly interests him. What is his primary concern is what that individual can choose to do. Money is this man’s least concern.
He is a chess player at heart because he is a strategist and a footballer because it is a team game.
“I am someone who pursues football and chess at school. I believes in a cordial relationship with others when it comes to working as a team. Again comes the Unity aspect. The relationships are what matters. I am working with humans not robots. Without unity you simply cannot play as a team. Because a computer can take directions without question but a leader and his team have feelings. Which is why unity is important,” added Epasinghe
Epasinghe wishes to thank his parents and teachers for all the guidance and the trust placed in him. They have played a big part in him being a prefect. His parents give him a lot of strength.
“As I mentioned before bringing out the best in people is my concern night or day. One must work very hard to find the qualities within them and use the potential within them through a process of searching themselves,” said Epasinghe
Epasinghe is a person who reads books extensively. That is what he does when he confronts a particularly stressful period. His main favorites are adventure stories. An admirer of Abraham Lincoln, Epasinghe’s admiration of Lincoln came from that fact that Lincoln was a man who had integrity and character and who came up the hard way in life.
“The teachers at the Highlands are very concerned about the performance and the well- being of the child. If the child has a particular difficulty there is a support system in place to help them. The teachers are very accessible and approachable,” stated Epasinghe
Epasinghe proudly calls himself a man of many sides to his character. He is not a Jack of all trades but he is resourceful and has many talents – IT and Sports.
“Life is not black and white. There is a grey area. Our blood is red regardless of which ethnicity we belong to. We should not judge others by the money they have or which race they belong to or their color,” said Epasinghe
When he talks, his school mates listen to him. He is a friend to all. A devout Buddhist he goes to temple every Poya day which makes him calm and he also meditates to calm his mind. This helps him achieve peace of mind even when the duties at times become a little stressful.
Epasinghe knows all about the value of trust as he was betrayed once. It had cost him a lot.
“Time is of the utmost importance to me and I always make time for my family while working according to a time table. I love my school and the Prefects Guild because of their unwavering support and the help they give me,” said Epasinghe
