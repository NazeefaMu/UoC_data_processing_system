Test of  the 20th Amendment

The government’s strategy to counter the JO came in the form of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill. It was passed in Parliament last Wednesday with a two-thirds majority, with 159 votes for and 34 against the Bill. This Bill was first introduced to Parliament in July but was activated in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict on the 20th Amendment. Only the JO voted against the Bill, which was supported by both the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). In a news briefing, JVP parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake maintained that the party has been consistent in its stand that elections to provincial polls should be held on one day to prevent a government exploiting elections and holding them on a staggered basis
The political guessing game that had everyone on tenterhooks as to when Provincial Council elections would-be called, came to an anti-climactic end last week when the government caught the opposition by surprise by enacting legislation that could effectively delay the polls for many months to come.
Early last week, the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was ecstatic. That was because the Supreme Court had determined that the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution required approval not only by a two thirds majority in Parliament but also by the people at a referendum-and the government simply could not risk a referendum on the issue.
Under ordinary circumstances, this would have meant that three provincial councils- in the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central provinces- would stand dissolved by the 1st of October, elections would have to be called by the Elections Commission immediately and polls would have to be held, probably in December 2017 or, at the latest, by January 2018.
The JO saw these elections as a testing ground for their political fortunes. They could have cashed in on the fact that the two ruling parties in the government of National Unity -both the mainstream faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as well as the United National Party (UNP) - were suffering from the burden of incumbency and are not exactly riding a wave of popularity right now.
Besides, because it was a provincial election, its Members of Parliament could have also actively campaigned for the JO or its proxy party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), even though campaigning for a party other than the UPFA or the SLFP could have invited disciplinary action by the mainstream SLFP.
Democratic process of elections
For all the publicity that the JO has generated, it is also mindful of the fact that the brand of politics that it sells- Sinhala nationalism stamped with the Rajapaksa brand name- has been untested at the polls since the January 2015 debacle. The verdict against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Secretary Lalith Weeratunga could have only detracted from its popularity. So, it was very keen for a contest to gauge its strength and was raring to go.
That is why it summoned the best legal resources at its disposal and challenged the 20thAmendment in the Supreme Court. After the Court’s decision was announced in Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the JO was all set to activate its membership in anticipation of an election.
All these plans went into disarray however, as the government launched a retaliatory strike. Critics of the move would argue that it was anti-democratic in that it sought to delay the democratic process of elections. The government counters that, saying its actions to conduct provincial election on the one and the same day for all councils makes practical and financial sense.
The government’s strategy to counter the JO came in the form of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill. It was passed in Parliament last Wednesday with a two-thirds majority, with 159 votes for and 34 against the Bill. This Bill was first introduced to Parliament in July but was activated in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict on the 20th Amendment.
Only the JO voted against the Bill, which was supported by both the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). In a news briefing, JVP parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake maintained that the party has been consistent in its stand that elections to provincial polls should be held on one day to prevent a government exploiting elections and holding them on a staggered basis. Ratnayake provided examples of this which occurred during the Rajapaksa regime.
Among the significant changes proposed in the Bill is the reservation of 30 per cent of nominations to females and the demarcation of electoral boundaries. The latter is the factor that will lead to the delay in elections as it requires re-demarcation by a delimitation commission. This was the same issue that led to the postponement of Local Government elections which are now overdue by two years.
With the new Bill being signed into law, the terms of office of the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central provincial councils will not be extended. Instead, they will be administered by the Governors of the respective provinces, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha announced shortly after the new legislation came into effect.
For once, the JO was outsmarted strategically in Parliament. The decision to pursue the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill was taken jointly by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
While President Sirisena was in New York attending sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the two leaders of the government kept the telephone lines busy, discussing developments and talking to minority parties to gain their support for the Bill to ensure a two-thirds majority. Instructions went out to parliamentarians to remain in Colombo for the vote and even saw Colombo district parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra arriving in Parliament with her baby.
The JO, out-manoeuvred by the move claimed the government was not acting in keeping with the spirit of democracy. “This government has also openly insulted the judiciary and flouted the Constitution by introducing changes to the provincial council selection law through the back door when the Supreme Court had given a clear ruling that the extension of the terms of the provincial councils or a postponement of elections would require a referendum in addition to a two thirds majority in Parliament,” a statement issued under the name of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
Government’s resources
“The manner in which they changed the Provincial Council election system with just days to go for the automatic dissolution of the first three provincial councils shows that they will do anything to avoid holding elections. Such gross abuse of the law making process has never before been experienced in this country,” Rajapaksa’s statement said.
Rajapaksa attempted to take the moral high ground on this issue and could indeed claim that whatever the deficiencies in his administration, elections were always at hand. However, it must be noted that these elections were conducted mostly during Rajapaksa’s second term in office when he was extremely popular in the afterglow of the war victory against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
Hence it was politically advantageous to Rajapaksa to conduct those polls and strengthen his stranglehold on power. This, Rajapaksa did in style, holding provincial polls on a staggered basis, concentrating all the government’s resources in a few regions.
After one set of polls were secured, that was to have a domino effect on other provinces going to the polls a few months later.
Those in the government point out that although Rajapaksa now cries foul over the postponement of polls, the one province which Rajapaksa’s UPFA could not secure, the Northern Provincial Council, did not have elections conducted until September 2013, more than four years after the conclusion of the war with the LTTE. Even then, Rajapaksa only reluctantly agreed for the poll to be held, after much diplomatic arm twisting from India and the international community.
Now, Rajapaksa is at the receiving end of a similar strategy from the government. In addition, the UNP and the mainstream SLFP led by President Sirisena worked in tandem in this instance to thwart the plans of the JO.
This, those in the government say, was an eye-opener for politicians in both camps within the government, underscoring the importance of working together.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also noted the significance of co-operation between the two major parties when he presented the draft constitutional reforms to Parliament last week.
Without doubt, he will hope that the success of the government’s strategy with the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill will convince both UNPers and SLFPers in government to continue working together as the country faces the challenge of drafting a new Constitution–or, at least, extensively revamping the existing one.
That is the next major hurdle that awaits the government.
