Mannar residents demand Tamil prisoners' release

 
A group of residents in Mannar and politicians held a demonstration opposite the Mannar Kachcheri on Tuesday demanding the release of Tamil prisoners held in custody. Wanni District MP Selvam Adaikalanathen who joined the protesters said the government's failure to release the prisoners before the Deepavali festival as promised earlier was most regrettable.
