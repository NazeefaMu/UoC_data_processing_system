Peace Air partners Lufthansa Consulting    in bid for SriLankan,Mihin Lanka

Peace Air, the only Sri Lankan bidder willing to run SriLankan Airlines said it has partnered with Lufthansa Consulting, a subsidiary of Lufthansa Germany to submit a comprehensive proposal to the company and to conduct a Due Diligence once the government approves Peace Air’s proposal.
Peace Air which has actively participated in the Expression of Interest (EOI) has offered US$ 5.5 billion to run SriLankan Airlines.
The total investment for stage one of the financial offer of Peace Air is US$ 3250 mn with payment to government for debt and shares being US$1250 mn while the full offer for aircraft purchases is US$ 1750 mn and another US$ 250 mn for working capital making it US$ 3250 mn.
Peace Air Chairman Gamini Wethasinghe told the Daily News yesterday they have the capability and expertise from Lufthansa Consulting to run the airline with more destinations being added and with more aircraft purchased outright.
“We have a concrete funding partner who operates from the UK and the SWIFT funds are in writing at the moment and the representatives are already in Sri Lanka now,” Wethasinghe said yesterday.
“Peace Air has accepted the recommendation of British Aviation Consultancy Company Nyras,engaged by SriLankan Airlines who said a zero balance sheet be created.Peace Air is willing to pay the full amount of US$ 1000 mn (US$ 1 bn) towards debt to the Government of Sri Lanka and make the two airlines debt free.
“Our management partners are Lufthansa Consulting and Privatair Airlines.These two companies will join Peace Air to assist and manage SriLankan, Mihin Air and SriLankan Catering.They have agreed to support us in every single area of airline operations and business,” Wethasinghe said.
“We have proposed to the government that not a single employee will be sacked or retrenched now and we vehemently oppose the move to retrench staff in both Mihin and SriLankan since they are the asset of these airlines.
“Our plan is to double the fleet and therefore we can keep all the staff, who are working today. We can always find work for them within.Train the existing staff in a field they like.There are so many things that we can do to keep the staff happy.They must feel wanted.They must feel that their jobs are safe and sound; that they stand on solid stable ground. Fear will cause a lot of damage in the Airline itself.Therefore, we must say that there is no retrenchment or sacking policy,”,he said.
Wethasinghe said Rs 100,000 will be given to all employees of the two airlines as a signature bonus in anticipation of their cooperation and team work,if they are given the go ahead to manage the national carrier.
