Anuradhapura drinking water issue will be resolved by 2021

Acute scarcity of drinking water in the Anuradhapura district would be resolved to a larger extent by 2021, the Water Supply and Drainage Board sources reveal.
Anuradhapura boasts a population of 9,17748. Besides domestic level water supply sources, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NCP) provides drinking water for a population of around 410,000. The Board has given 82,000 water connections and the demand increases the supply. By 2020, the JICA funded Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa Water Projects will be complete. These two mega schemes will benefit 290,000. China funded Rajangane-Thambuttegama Water Supply Scheme will provide adequate drinking water for 40,000 people by 2022.
Within the next three years, the WSDB (NCP) will complete the Eppawala-Mahawilachchiya Scheme including the expansion of the Thantirimale, Galnewa-Bulnewa, Thalawa, Mihintale, Kahatagasdigiliya, Kebitigollewa and Padaviya water projects benefiting 100,000 people.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said that once the proposed Yan Oya and lower Malwathu Oya reservoirs are completed by 2021 facilitating 150,000 people in areas such as Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Horrowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya, they would supply adequate drinking and agro water throughout the year.
He pointed out that the availability of drinking water would prevent the fast spreading kidney diseases in these areas. The only solution for fighting the drought in the district is to have the tanks system that comprises around 3,300 major medium and small tanks kept filled with water. The ongoing drinking and irrigational water projects will address this issue, the Government Agent said.
According to the sources, the Japanese and Chinese aided Wahalkada, Mahakanadarawa and Rajangana-Thambuttegama water schemes and the Yan Oya and lower Malwathu Oya Projects will cost around Rs. 100,000 millions.
Apart from this, the World Bank has invested through the Irrigation Department around Rs. 2,000 m to preserve the dams of Padaviya, Mahawilachchiya, Rajanganaya, Nuwarawewa, Thissawewa, Nachchaduwa and Mahakanadarawa Tanks.
