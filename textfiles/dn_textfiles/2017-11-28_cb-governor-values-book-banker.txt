CB Governor values book by banker

Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy highly valued the book titled ‘Techniques of Securities for Bank Lending with an Insight to Life and Times of a Banker’ written by a former banker Charles Rajanathan and said present day bankers immensely need such publications to enhance their knowledge of the banking sector.
Dr Coomaraswamy made these observations during the presentation of the first copy of the book to CB Governor by author Charles Rajanathan, at Central Bank headquarters in Colombo.
While commending the contribution made by former banker Rajanathan by publishing a book in this nature, Dr Coomaraswamy thanked the author for sharing his expertise with other bankers who are engaged in the field of credit administration.
The Governor said this book will be an ideal text book for bankers especially those who are engaged in credit appraisal.
Rajanathan said the objective of publishing the book was to share his expertise in the field of various types of securities for bank lending, its operational aspects and mitigation of risk.
He said the initial chapter of the book gives an insight to the life and times of bankers of yesteryear who were not fortunate to have the luxury of technology enjoyed by the present bankers since in the past everything was done manually,
Rajanathan also told the Governor of his intention to translate this publication into Sinhala to cater to a wide audience of bankers in the rural areas.
Eminent bankers in the calibre of Chairman of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Rajendra Theagarajah, Hatton National Bank, former Chairman/MD Rienzie Wijetilleke, Cargills Bank MD/CEO Prabhu Mathavan, Cargills Bank Director and Amana Bank former MD/CEO Faizal Salieh, HNB Director A.N. de Silva, Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, Director General P.J. Jayasinghe also commended this publication.
Rajanathan commenced his banking career at Hatton National Bank in 1973 and during his 30-year period he had worked in divisions which related to credit and its operation and administration.
Rajanathan was also the Head of Credit Administration at Pan Asia Bank, Union Bank of Colombo and the Amana Bank and presently he is in charge of the Training and Development arm at Cargills Bank and also a senior member of the Resource Panel of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, the Centre for Banking Studies, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
