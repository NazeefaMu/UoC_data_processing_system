SriLankan Airlines further enhances service excellence for passengers of all airlines at BIA

SriLankan Airlines further enhanced its customer service capabilities with more specialized training for its airport service staff at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to serve passengers of all airlines even better.
SriLankan Airlines (www.srilankan.com) is the sole airport ground handler for all airlines that operate to BIA in Colombo, where it annually handles nearly 9 million passenger movements on approximately 70,000 flights.
SriLankan Airlines, General Manager Airport & Ground Services Bandula Weragama said, “We at SriLankan Airlines are constantly seeking more ways to enhance the skills of our staff, in order to delight all our customers even more. We remain steadfast in our commitment to provide the finest levels of service to our valued passengers, especially as our volumes of traffic at BIA increase, growing year on year due to the steady growth in tourist arrivals and larger numbers of Sri Lankans travelling overseas.”
The latest service enhancement involved training on handling of wheelchair and stretcher passengers by the instructors of the St. John Ambulance Service, who imparted specialized skills to the airline's airport staff through a four-day training programme, to further enhance safety and comfort of elderly passengers and passengers requiring special assistance.
Sri Lanka's National Carrier has built a reputation as one of the world's finest airlines in terms of customer service, both in the air and on the ground, over nearly four decades of operations. Apart from handling of passengers, baggage and cargo of all airlines, charters, freighters, private aircraft and other types of aircraft that operate to BIA and MRIA, it provides specialized services for premium passengers such as the Serendib Business Class Lounge and the Silk Route Priority Check-In Service. SriLankanAirlines’ expertise as an airport ground handling company has long been recognised.
It was one of the first ground handlers to receive the prestigious IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) Certification in 2008 from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global association of airlines, a certification that has been continuously renewed since then.
In its quest to provide a superior service, SriLankan works closely with all authorities at BIA including the airport owning company Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd, Sri Lanka Air Force which is the airport's security handler, Customs, and Immigration.
The National Carrier's fully owned subsidiary SriLankan Catering operates the Serenediva airport transit hotel and provides catering services for most of the airlines that operate to BIA and the other lounges.
