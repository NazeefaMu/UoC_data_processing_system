TNA against local mechanism to probe alleged war crimes: Vigneswaran

The TNA disliked any kind of local mechanism which probed alleged war crimes or investigated any other local incident. The TNA will give consideration for any such mechanism only if it included International Judges, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said.
Vigneswaran said this when journalists in Jaffna quested him about discussions he had with six foreign ambassadors and representatives of the European Union who met him in Jaffna recently. Vigneswaran said he made the above position known because according to the present environment in the country justice does not seem to be done not only as regards the Courts or any other place.
He said the government had not fulfilled a single request made by the TNA so far. He said solutions could not be found to the problems of Tamils in this country by depending on the views and protests of the so called communal parties in the South. Vigneswaran said he told all foreign deletes who visited the North that the only solution to the Tamil problem was the joining of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and granting them a Federal system of government.
“The TNA or the Tamil people had no need to disassociate themselves from this view,” Vigneswaran added.
