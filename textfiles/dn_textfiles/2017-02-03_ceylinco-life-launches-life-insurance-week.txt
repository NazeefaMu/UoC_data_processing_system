Ceylinco Life launches  Life Insurance Week

An annual, country-wide campaign to widen the life insurance net through interaction with the masses gets underway on February 11, when Ceylinco Life launches its Life Insurance Week (LIW).
The life insurance leader said it plans to deploy some 4,500 sales people from 260 branches at a series of activities and engagements in key towns and villages in a concerted effort to take the message of life insurance to the grassroots.
In its 10th edition, Ceylinco Life’s 2017 Life Insurance Week will focus on the theme that the cost of waiting to buy life insurance is too high. Using a simple yet effective illustration, the company will demonstrate that buying life insurance sooner rather than later can result in significant savings in premium payments.
Among the activities planned by the company to engage with its target audiences are regional town storming programmes in 40 locations around the country to create better awareness of the importance of life insurance; special screenings of some of the latest movies at eight cinemasin Anuradhapura, Ja Ela, Kurunegala, Galle, Ratnapura, Ambalangoda, Jaffna and Batticaloa; and art competitions in some of Ceylinco Life’s own branches.
“The penetration of life insurance is around 13 per cent at present and our objective is to increase this figure by educating people on the value of the protection it offers,” Ceylinco Life Director/Deputy CEO Mr Thushara Ranasinghe said. “The Life Insurance Week programme has been an effective way of reaching out to the masses, and has generated higher than average sales of policies during the campaign period.”
He said the Life Insurance Week initiative supports Ceylinco Life’s Vision which is “To take the message of life insurance and Retirement Planning to every Sri Lankan and provide protection to every family.”
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
