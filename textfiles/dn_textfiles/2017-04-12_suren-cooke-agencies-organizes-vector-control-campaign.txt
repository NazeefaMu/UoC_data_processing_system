Suren Cooke Agencies  organizes vector  control campaign

Suren Cooke Agencies, a pioneer in making the community a safer place to live, organized a vector control campaign in several rural areas, to help people get relief from mosquitoes.
Suren Cooke Agencies has always been in the forefront of the vector control industry and takes great pride in working on corporate social responsibility projects such as these.
 Dengue is the most deadly mosquito-borne viral disease, especially confronting countries located within the equatorial region, having high temperature. Rainfall and humidity, those are conducive for mosquito breeding and migration that causes extensive transmission of the disease.
 Suren Cooke Agencies, the masters when it comes to pest management industry in the country, extended their support to the “ News1st Gammadda initiative”, in Thamaraville, Barathikulam, Faizal Nagar and Idiman 4th Div areas in Kinniya, Trincomalee, to carry out a successful vector control campaign using their latest equipment. The two-day programme covered 14 schools in the four villages.
Suren Cooke Agencies used their latest product Pulsfog High out Put Thermal Fogging Machines during the campaign, a method which proved to be an effective way of eradicating mosquitoes from a neighborhood when a large area is concerned without undue harm to the environment.
Suren Cooke Agencies works closely with government institutions to train the staff on the proper usage of the Pulsfog Thermal Fogging Machines in their war against the deadly mosquitoes.
 Commenting on new advancements in vector control, founder of Suren Cooke Agencies, Cooke said that they are currently in the process of further testing the one of the latest products, the Sky Spray 1000 Copter which will further reduce the time and manpower needed for such campaigns. 
“If you don't keep innovating, you cannot make a real change and there is always a better way,” Cooke said.
