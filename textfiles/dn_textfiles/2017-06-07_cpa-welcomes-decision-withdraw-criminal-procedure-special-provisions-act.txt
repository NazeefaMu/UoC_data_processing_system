CPA welcomes decision to withdraw Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act

The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) in a media statement has welcomed the government's decision to withdraw the “Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2013 (Amendment) Bill”.
The undertaking was given yesterday in the Supreme Court by counsel appearing for the Attorney General’s Department when the special determination was taken up to hear Petitions challenging the constitutionality of two provisions in the Bill, including a Petition filed by the CPA and its Executive Director (SC SD 7/2017).
The CPA argued that Sections 6A(2) and (6) of the Bill’s Clause 2 were inconsistent with Articles 3, 4 (d), 11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), 13(3), 14(1) and 17 of the Constitution.
The provisions, if enacted, will allow an Officer in Charge of a police station to deny lawyers access to detainees and the premises of the police station if such access would be “prejudicial” or shall “affect” the investigation being conducted. Because of this, these provisions are inconsistent with the rights of persons in custody guaranteed under the Constitution and the law.
The CPA argued that the right to a fair trial under the Constitution includes the right to a lawyer for anyone in custody. Sections 6A(2) and (6) of Clause 2 of the Bill are drafted in a way that is too broad with no objective criteria to determine the prejudice or effect a detainee's access to a lawyer or the lawyer’s access to a police station may have on an investigation being conducted. The CPA notes that while these provisions are proposed to operate only temporarily, similar temporary legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) became permanent over time.
