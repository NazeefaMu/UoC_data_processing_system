World Carrom Champions felicitated in Parliament

World Carrom Champions visited Parliament yesterday on the request of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The House felicitated the champions who appeared at the gallery to witness the Parliamentary sessions. The Speaker warmly welcomed the team at his official chamber as well.
The Speaker told the team members that following the 1996 Cricket World Cup, this victory was the most important sporting achievement in all these years. A special reward was granted to Nishantha Fernando who represented Sri Lanka in 2008, 2016 and 2018 in international Carrom competitions, while wining the World Championship in 2012.
