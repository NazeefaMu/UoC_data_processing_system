Galle Principal caught while  taking bribe

 A group of officials of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption yesterday arrested the Principal of Ahangama Shariputra Maha Vidyalaya, Galle for allegedly taking bribe from a father of grade 1 class of the school.
Investigations revealed the student’s father had been asked to pay Rs. 20,000 as a bribe for the admission of his son to grade 1. He had been instructed to deposit the money at a building material shop at Dikkumbura, in Ahangama by the Principal.
The father who agreed to pay the money had informed the Bribery and Corruption Commission about the Principal’s demand. The father had gone to the shop and given the money to the shop keeper for which he obtained a receipt on the instructions of the commission officials.
An official met the principal with the receipt and handed it over to the principal on behalf of the father when the later was caught red handed while accepting the receipt by the other officials. The principal was to be produced before courts by yesterday evening.
