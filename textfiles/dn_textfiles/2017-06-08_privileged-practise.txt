Privileged to practise

Preached by the Buddha (c. 563-483 BC), Buddhism is one of the great religions of the world. As Karl Marx perceptively judged, among other things, “religion is the generalized theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form….” Theories about the world, whether they are religious, philosophical, scientific or just fanciful in origin, all seek to account for the incredible diversity and intricate complexity of the phenomenon of life on earth. Historically, convention has privileged religious theories against critical evaluation, but increasingly and irreverently all theories about the world including the God-hypothesis have become subject to critical empirical scrutiny.
Religion, philosophy and science are aspects of humankind’s ceaseless attempt to solve existential problems. Their concerted, dedicated objective is knowledge of the world we find ourselves in, not knowing whence we came nor why nor whither we shall go. The most useful knowledge would provide us with an understanding of the world as it really is. According to the Buddha, too, the senses should be cultivated to see the truth, to see things as they really are. Such knowledge is necessary for human beings to pursue with any hope of success the goals of survival of themselves and their kind in this world, avoidance of suffering and attainment of happiness.
Stream entry
The Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening, the first of which is called stream entry. This gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered the “stream” flowing inevitably to nibbana. He/she is guaranteed to achieve full awakening.
This book explains the way to enter the stream. It is also known as achieving the Sotapanna state of being. It is not difficult to become a stream-entrant as most people believe. Yet it is a delicate thing. And it is only grasped by those who are wise. That’s where the problem lies. When one reads this book, he can realize the said stream-entrant state. But there is a chance that he may not know he realized it. This state is unique. It is a teaching that must not be given to each person you meet. The one who obtains the initial information can travel the path to stream entry. If there is a person with high wisdom then he can learn the path at once. No preliminary information is necessary for him. He understands at once that there is something beyond the limit that we perceive. When you follow this path, you will meet the said state.
There are many people who believe that a stream-entrant noble follower must be able to travel in the air with his superpowers. This is not true. They believe that those who arrive at noble states like stream enterer should be able to perform miracles. There is no such thing. There are three kinds of miracles as per Buddha’s teachings:
• Miracle of superhuman power
• Miracle of Teaching
• Miracle of reading others minds
Buddha said, “Out of these three miracles monks, the one you should perform is the miracle of teaching.” What does it mean to perform miracle of teaching? Performing miracle of teaching means teaching others the Dharma that you realized and confirmed.
Buddha said, “monks, the greatest miracle a monk can perform is the miracle of teaching.”
There is a story where Buddha crosses a river.
One day Buddha was by a river with his assistant Ananda, waiting for the ferry to arrive. A hermit comes to where they were, laid out a scarf, got onto the scarf and floated across the water. Then Ananda turns to the Buddha and asks;
‘Why don’t you also get us across the river like that?”
Buddha replies,
“Ananda, be patient and wait for the ferry.”
So they wait. When the ferry arrives he pauses before getting on and asks the ferry conductor,
“ How much do you charge to cross the river?”
Conductor replies,
“Twenty five cents your honor.”
Buddha turns to Ananda and says,
“Ananda, the value of that miracle is twenty five cents! That person dedicated thirty or forty years of his life trying to get that power. But if he had used that time to travel the Noble Way and to get the Noble Fruit then he would have already crossed Samsara.”
People waste time trying to get magical powers. If those people spent that time trying to cross Samsara by training the mind, then they would have already escaped Samsara. Instead of finding reasons to cross Samsara, people find reasons not to cross Samsara. They collect things that are hindrances to liberation.
People try to achieve things that they can never achieve. They try to hold on to things that they cannot hold on to. They try to keep things that they cannot keep. They try to enjoy things that cannot be enjoyed. Knowing well they will not get them, they still go chasing after them.
Keep running
Keep doing what you are doing the same way. Just know that you will never get them. Keep running after them. While running think like this; “regardless of however much I run, I will not be satisfied. I will never get what I am trying to get. What I will get is not what think it will be. It will always be something else.”
What you think will not happen in life! You will not get to enjoy what you hope for. Are you going to run seeking these things?
Yes, run! Run until you are completely out of breath. When you run like this, at the right time your heart will tell you to stop running. Don’t stop. If you stop then that is not because you realized Dharma. It would be because you stop. Then one day you will start running again. So do you run after worldly goals, or not?
Run!
Run until you are out of breath. When you are out of breath the heart will become the witness say, “Didn’t such and such a person say you will be out of breath due to this running? But you did not agree with that. And you did not believe it. Now it has been proven to you. Do you still want to run, or not?”
You will never run again. You have stilled for eternity. That means you have entered the stream.
After that, due to the old habit you will get ready to run. Then what happens is your mind says not to run. It says “there is nothing to gain by running.” Then what happens? Then you have lost the need to run.
You should investigate your life in the past. All the running that you did in the past. How you fell and got wounded while running. Think about all this. You have to do a self-analysis about yourself very honestly. Self-analysis is the way to liberation. Self-analysis means:
To search about yourself.
To think about yourself with an open mind.
Feel free to express what you feel. Say what comes to your mind directly, If you want to scold someone, scold the person to his face. That is the greatness. If you have something to say then say it. That is a person’s genuineness. It is his greatness. It is his honesty. The one who comes to the way of the Dharma shapes himself in this way. If not that person can not realize this Dharma, If one keeps one thing inside and says something else, then that is a dual personality. A dual personality can never enter the stream. The nature of the stream-entrant noble follower is that he is truthful. If he feels like saying what comes to his mind he will say it.
Now let’s say you have done something wrong and someone feels like scolding you for it. Then what should that person do? He should tell you that you have done something wrong, and he should scold you for it harshly. That should be the nature. That is also his honesty. But, then do you hate him? Do you scold him back? You must honor a person’s honesty. Noble ones do not look down on honesty.
What happened when Vimala the prostitute follows Moggallana the great Arhat on the street? Vimala was a famous prostitute that lived at the time of the Buddha. Vimala saw the handsome figure of Arhat Moggallana and told him of her desire.
Did he scold her?
No, he did not scold her.
Did he reject her?
No, he did not reject her
Did he chase her away?
No, he did not chase her away.
He let her follow him. He took her with him. Took her and did what?
He showed her the way to win stream-entry.
Those in the material world always hope for material gains. That is the nature. Try to understand.
Physical Science
There are some hidden rules in this world. A person only understand them after his enlightenment. In physical science there are laws. For example Newton’s laws for motion, Ohm’s law for electricity and Gauss’s law for magnetism. In the same way there are laws in spirituality. Our mind works according to those laws. They are deep.
We became happy when our wishes came true. We got sad when our wishes did not come true. Now the happiness of wishes coming true and the sadness of wishes not coming true have both gone to the past. What are both of them to you now?
A dream.
This world is a dream. It is an illusion. But however the great majority of people have not felt this. That is the problem with not being a stream -enterer. There is a teaching of the Buddha in the Anguttara Nikaya, Sattaka Nipata called Sattasuri Uggamana Sutta. In that Sutta Buddha explains how at one point this world will get destroyed by heat. First the earth will get so hot that all plants will die. Gradually the earth will begin to reach temperatures that will cause it to explode with fire. From there Buddha goes on and says:
“Monks, even this earth is without essence. You may live here. You may dwell here. But never get attached. Do not even get attached to this earth. Do not grasp this earth. Do not crave this earth. Do not have hopes of this earth. But,” he says, “this teaching will only be accepted by a stream-entrant.” Why?
Because those who have not entered the stream think the earth is self, and it is eternal. They think Idle but this earth will remain. Is he a stream-enterer?
He is not a stream-enterer.
A stream-entrant noble follower never accepts that he or the world is permanent or eternal. But the stream-winner knows when he dies he would be buried in this earth. Even though he knows he will be buried in this earth, he does not accept that the earth is eternal. Then what does the stream –entrant noble follower accept as eternal?
Nirvana.
There are two kinds of people in this world. There are those who accept that Nirvana is the only eternal thing that exists; and there those who accept that this earth and all the other physical objects exist for eternity. Which group do you belong to?
You still belong to the group that accepts physical objects as eternal.
 If we were to join the group that believes Nirvana is eternal, then we go from one side to the other. For that, something should happened in us. What should happen in us is?
We must do a self-evaluation of our life. We must do an exploration about life. Life is a dream, an illusion. We think that this illusion is real. We have been taught how to be stuck inside this right from our childhood. We expect many things in life. When we continue to contemplate life deeper and deeper, we will understand the whole world. When we get that understanding we will become still. That is stream-entry. That is enough to enter the stream.
To realize Dharma, the first thing a follower should have is conviction, Conviction is trust. You accept because you have respect for the teacher. But before you accept, you yourself must do an evaluation about the teacher and his wisdom. What most people do is listen to lectures and remember them. But nobody realizes Dharma. To realize Dharma you must force yourself on to the path of training the mind if you have to. You cannot go in comfort why can you not go in comfort?
Your mind is already addicted to various habits. It already has numberless habits.
This mind that is addicted to habits keep running behind a myriad of pleasures. It runs one pleasure and does not find it there. Then it pauses to think about that for a brief moment and then starts running after some other pleasure. It continuously repeats this process. Whether it gets the pleasure or not, it keeps running after different things. So when does this torture of chasing come to an end? This process is an endless search for pleasure.
In the end it is all a dream.
If this is all a dream then why run so much? Stop! Stop and think. Do not run at full possible speed chasing goals. All throughout Samsara the mind has trained to seek pleasures.
You run to explore:
Hatred,
Jealousy,
Lust,
Anger.
Now each person has made a path for his mind to search for pleasures. You have created a path for your mind to seek lust. When one pleasure is not found, it seeks another. When it loose that, it seeks yet another. Let’s stop this crazy running.
We usually tell someone something soft at first. Then what do we do?
Next we say it a bit sterner. Then we say it harsh. And if they do not listen at that we do something even more. The great Arhat Moggallana does this to Sakra, the ruler of the - Heaven. You can read this in Maha Thanha Sankaya Sutta.
One day Sakra, Lord of the Devas comes to visit the Buddha to find out about letting go. After hearing about letting go, he goes back to Heaven and builds a castle. One day Arhat Moggallana wants to find out how Sakra’s practice of letting go was coming along. So Arhat Moggallana appears in front of Sakra. Then Sakra says to Arhat Moggallana,
“I built a beautiful castle. Let me take you on a tour to see it.”
As they are touring Sakra points out, “here are the flower gardens, here are halls” etc. After the tour Arhat Moggallana pushes the castle with his foot. The whole castle crumbles down and is destroyed. At that moment the Sakra realized the Dharma. Do you see the nature of realization?
If someone attempted to make you realize Dharma in this manner, what would you do? You will hate Arhat Moggallana, But Sakra is wise. Sakra thought, “What he did was a good thing. He destroyed my castle. When the castle was destroyed I realized that my world gets destroyed. “That means Sakra was given a lesson about the stream-entry.”
It is mentioned in the Sutta that Arhat Moggallana destroyed Sakra’s castle with his foot. What exactly did Arhat Moggallana destroy here?
He destroyed the world that Sakra had created with the six senses - eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind. Here is another question, where exactly did Sakra build his castle?
In his mind.
Then what exactly did Arhat Moggallana destroy?
Sakra’s mind.
Where does the world exist?
Within eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind.
Then what exactly is the meaning of destroying the world?
Showing the meaninglessness of eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind is destroying the world.
You yourself destroy your world and teach an eternal state beyond this world. Do it without mercy! What is destroying the world? Making one realize the meaninglessness of the world he has created with the eye, ear, nose, body, tongue and mind. Then a need, an interest, a hope appears within one to search for something beyond this meaningless world.
Do not underestimate the Dharma. If you understand this Dharma, that person who understands he will never become a loser in life. He will win every day in life. That means there will be no situation for him to win. If you think like this in life, how easy is it to live? But to live in line with this Dharma, you must be fortunate.
Have you heard about the great philosopher Sir lsaac Newton? Sir Isaac Newton’s wife left him.
She said, “I cannot live with him. He is always doing mathematics. ”That was unfortunate for Isaac Newton. What was unfortunate?
He did not find someone who is matching. But, do we suffer thinking we did not find a partner who is matching? In life if you get the husband, wife, partner or friend that is not matching do you mentally suffer?
Do not suffer mentally. Think in the opposite direction.
Listen to the story about Socrates. His wife was mean. She used to yell at Socrates for one thing or the other every day. The reason Socrates became a philosopher was her behavior. So the husbands and wives reading this must yell at the other person as much as you can. When you yell at the other person, it drives that person to greatness. Who helps a Bodhisattva to become a Buddha?
It is those who act against him.
Who makes a person an Arhat?
It is those who work against him.
Who makes a person great?
Those who stand against him.
If one is to reach greatness then he must have a lot of enemies. Without enemies a person does not reach greatness.
