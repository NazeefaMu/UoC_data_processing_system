Tough measures to be taken against university ragging

At a recent media conference that was held in Kurunegala Higher Education and Culture Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakse said that in order to overcome unfortunate trends in state universities in Sri Lanka of brutal ragging, the Ministry of Higher Education and Culture would take tough and meaningful measures very soon to offer better and disciplined, quality higher educational opportunities to the Sri Lankan undergraduates of state universities.
The Minister said, “due to brutal ragging and other types of tortures caused to the new students of state universities in Sri Lanka constantly by senior undergraduates every year, there is an upward trend in students and parents to turn to private universities for higher educational opportunities nowadays.
Specially, female students and their parents are reluctant to undergo brutal and inhuman ragging at state universities.
Certain Students’ organizations purposely launch inhuman ragging activities for new comers who attend the state universities to cripple the higher education in Sri Lanka.
Their sole objective is to deprive higher educational opportunities for the less privileged but talented student population of this country.
