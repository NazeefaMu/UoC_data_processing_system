UNP awaits  Attorney General’s  decision on Ravi

The UNP awaits a decision from the Attorney General to arrive at a conclusion about former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said.
“A decision should be given soon by the Attorney General with reference to former Minister Karunanayake. He may be held responsible or be cleared, whatever the decision does not matter, what matters is that we receive some form of a decision soon. It is not fair to keep him in suspense. He is a person who has contributed immensely to form this government. It is wrong to act in a manner that would affect his political career,” Minister Fernando said.
He made these observations in reply to a question whether the government is considering giving a ministerial portfolio to MP Ravi Karunanayake, at a press brief held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters, yesterday afternoon.
“When allegations were levelled against the Former Minister, we as a party and me individually stood against him, and criticised him. Now, when he is unfairly treated, we have to stand up for him as well.” Fernando further said.
