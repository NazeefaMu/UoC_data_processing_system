Demonstrations blocking roads violate human rights: Speaker

When a small group of people stage demonstrations blocking roads according to their whims and fancies, it amounts to a grave injustice towards the general public. Such demonstrations violate human rights. Therefore, special attention has to be made to such incidents in future, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said at Pallewela on January 23.
He was addressing a meeting after opening the new police station at Pallewela, Mirigama. This is the 474th Police station in the country.
Speaker Jayasuriya said Pallewela had only one police checkpoint in 2011. When they requested it to be upgraded to a police station, former IGP Ilangakoon commenced the upgrading programme. It was completed by the incumbent IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
The speaker said the government set up nine independent commissions including the Police Commission to ensure a transparent administration. This had enabled police officers to perform their duties protecting the honour and prestige of their uniform. As people's representatives, they are duty bound to offer recognition to the indefatigable service rendered by police personnel to safeguard law and order.
He said the Police Department should change according to the changing times and modern developments. The Police service should not be a dreaded task. They work in close co-operation with the public.
He said people in Pallewela and its surroundings were very peaceful, and they lived in unity and a sense of co-existence.
Rs. 50 million was allocated for development work in Pallewela. He said the father of the nation the late Prime Minister, D.S. Senanayake, was a product of Mirigama. Therefore, they were duty bound to develop the region. The area has no political divisions either because the chief organisers of the two main political parties were cooperating with each other to develop the region.
Every one should have the right to lead a free life under democracy. Everyone should be able to use the road to the airport and back as he or she pleases anytime of the day. If a handful of people held a demonstration blocking the road, it would amount to usurping other people's rights. They would have to think twice and act if such obstructions were caused to people's just rights in future.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara also spoke. Gampaha SSP Muditha Pussella delivered the welcome address. Provincial council member Udena Wijeratne and former provincial council member Sanjaya Siriwardena were present.
