New insights into cultural studies

Nayar’s work is categorized into two parts. The first part contains the materials on contexts, theories and methods. The second part takes into consideration the sites of culture which include the aspects of cultures of consumption, cultures of space and cultures of communication. In several ways, the two parts are interlinked. Both parts contain material drawn from the most significant trends in the field of cultural studies which throw penetrative insights into the learner and teacher. One significant segment in the study is the light thrown on the area titled as postcolonialism and
cultural studies by and large an area forgotten by most oriental scholars.
The term Cultural Studies has come to stay as a household word as used in many academic and other allied fields. Over the years, the terms ‘culture’, ‘cultural studies’, ‘cultural impact’, ‘cultural barriers’ have given various meanings in these fields of studies. But still, there is a stormy tendency on the part of the scholars to go back to the meanings, definitions as well as the concepts of culture as laid down the centuries in both the Oriental and the Occidental contexts.
The attempt on the part of the lecturer Pramod K Nayar in his work ‘An Introduction to Cultural Studies’ is to throw light to the study of culture, taking into account certain aspects of the study inclusive of the scope, aim, methods, theories as well as the more popular areas as created in the study with the use of technology such as the mobile phone as well as Internet. Thus the advent of the areas in popular culture is taken into consideration.
Simple introduction
Nayar basically attempts to address the teacher as well as the upper grade of the student, perhaps at the university level of learning, on these issues. As such, the work of Nayar is an attempt to give a simple introduction to the various ways of understanding culture. The ways that are now often collectively termed as ‘cultural studies: furthermore the work is an attempt to explore the meanings of everyday processes, places and acts like communication, space and shopping. In this manner, Nayar takes the reader from the more known to the more unknown territories in the field of cultural studies, linked to the lineages as well as the more modernistic uses and abuses, perhaps linked to the advent of technology into the traditional patterns of cultural aspects. Wherever possible, the writer cum teacher of cultural studies is helped by underlining the more emphatic aspects. One such example goes as follows: On the term ‘Popular Culture’, the writer underlines:
“Popular culture is the set of practices, artefacts and beliefs shared by the masses and is constituted by the everyday life of the masses, the food habits, fashion, forms of transport, the music, the reading habits, the spaces they occupy and traverse.”
This paves the way both for the teacher as well as the student to delve more emphatically on the culture concepts as laid down over the years due to the expansion of the accepted forms of learning and teaching. Several perhaps commonplace questions too are raised in the context. At a particular junction, Nayar asks: Why is Agatha Christie not studied in English Departments, when most people read Christie rather than Thomas Hardy?
He too goes to the extent of showing how the aspects of culture are linked to the aspects of popular political beliefs and practices.
Various cultures
Nayar’s work is categorized into two parts. The first part contains the materials on contexts, theories and methods. The second part takes into consideration the sites of culture which include the aspects of cultures of consumption, cultures of space and cultures of communication. In several ways, the two parts are interlinked. Both parts contain material drawn from the most significant trends in the field of cultural studies which throw penetrative insights into the learner and teacher. One significant segment in the study is the light thrown on the area titled as postcolonialism and cultural studies by and large an area forgotten by most oriental scholars.
This also paves the way to trace some of the trends set by the concept called globalization. According to the scholar Nayar, the global trends left behind as a result of postcolonialism, has to be retraced taking into account the concept of globalizing culture which is still in the infant stages of interpretation and analysis. It is believed that global economics and media interactions determine the aspects of cultural trendsetting at the behaviour of the individual in a society. How far this is true in one’s own cultural context may be a question raised.
In the Indian context, Nayar gives one example which goes as follows.
“In India for instance, in the heavily mediated cultural context, of the present, the elite / wealthy members of society can have access to Yves St Laurent or a Chanel line because these are now available.”
Global economy
As such he concludes: “Cultures and traditions are therefore modified not with the local culture, in mind, but with global patterns. Their choices are determined by the global economy.”
Thus the work of Nayar rests on several layers that enlighten the reader to know much more than one can learn from the study of a single culture. I felt for a moment that this is the type of work that should be made available to the students and teachers of Mass Communication.
