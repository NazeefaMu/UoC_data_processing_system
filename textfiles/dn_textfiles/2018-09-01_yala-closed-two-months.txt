Yala closed for two months

The Yala National Park will be closed to visitors for two months from tomorrow untill October 31, the Wildlife Conservation Department announced.
The Department said the closure is to allow time and space for ecological restoration. It is a usual procedure followed every year during the dry season. Yala has five blocks, but ‘Block One’ or the Palatupana gate is considered to be its main tourism zone. The Department carries out renovation work of visitor bungalows inside the park during this period.
