A Father’s Dream Come True shaped as BCSL

 
Days were dark with a raging war spreading untold suffering and unbridled poverty in its wake in Sri Lanka’s East, plaguing the people especially school going children. Parents had no alternative but to send their sons and daughters just after their AL’s to work in small grocery shops and wayside garages for a pittance they called a salary. 
People’s suffering, especially the plight of youth with no hope of a future unsettled him many a time but he was determined to put an end to the misery. He was a visionary ahead of his time always thinking creatively, envisioning what a future would hold and come up with an answer that fit that picture - Baticaloa Campus Sri Lanka is Hon. M L A M Hizbullah’s brainchild replacing adversity and poverty with scholarly brilliance leading to an affluent life style here or anywhere else in the world for higher education aspirant educated youth.
I needed more information though to pen this article to let my readers know more, so I and my colleague made a bee line from Lake House to meet Ahamed Hiras Hizbullah. A door opened and we were greeted by a smart young professional whom I never thought was BCSL’s Managing Director. Pen and writing pad on the ready, I was all set to ask questions and take down notes.

Q. Why has this new non state university been located so far away?
A. The principle reason is that five out of the six non state universities are situated in Colombo placing a huge burden on students from eastern, northern and north western provinces in finding suitable lodging and bearing transport costs while concentrating on student fees and studies. BCSL is therefore located in the boarder of Batticaloa where connectivity is easy and hassle free for all from these provinces.
The stressful university life may sometimes threaten a students<U+05F3> academic performance. In this sense, design of the campus is far beyond providing a place for study.

The beautiful forest surrounding the university campus offers a calm environment conducive to research and reflection while still within a buzzing metropolitan area.
