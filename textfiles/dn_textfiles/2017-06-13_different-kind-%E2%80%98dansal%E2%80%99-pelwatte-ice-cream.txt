A different kind  of ‘dansal’ with  Pelwatte ice cream

The month of June in Sri Lanka is celebrated marking the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the third century BC. A common sight on the full-moon poya day this month is the plethora of ‘dansal’ serving everything from tea, coffee and herbal drinks to biscuits and more elaborate rice and curry or ‘dunthel bath’.
What all pilgrims enjoy during this day is the ice cream ‘dansal’ that can be found at almost every 100 metres in cities and towns far and wide.
Giving alms to pilgrims during this season is considered a highly meritorious act, and many organizations and individuals flock to set up ‘dansal’.
Ice cream is a favourite among many and this season homegrown, 100% natural dairy producer Pelwatte Dairy is offering customers a range of delectable flavours at affordable prices.
Pelwatte Dairy uses 100% fresh milk from local farmers and adds only natural sweeteners and colours to their range of flavours such as strawberry, mango, vanilla, banana, chocolate and fruit and nut.
Instead of limiting to the traditional flavours this range offers the tropical fruit alternatives for a different taste experience.
Creamy and healthy Pelwatte ice cream comes in 80ml cups, 500ml, and 1l, 2l and 4l tubs.
The larger tub is ideal for those who wish to purchase in bulk with hopes of providing a free treat for all pilgrims this season.
Pelwatte Dairy is also offering concessionary rates for bulk purchases.
