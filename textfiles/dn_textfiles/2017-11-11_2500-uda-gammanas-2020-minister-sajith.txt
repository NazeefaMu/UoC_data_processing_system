2,500 Uda Gammanas by 2020: Minister Sajith

Two thousand five hundred Uda Gammanas will be set up by 2020, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He was addressing the gathering at the opening of the Siythuru Gama Uda Gammana at Lunugamvehera, recently.
The minister opened the 46th Uda Gammana in Lunugamwehera which consists of all basic facilities including water, electricity and other infrastructure facilities.
The minister added that he was glad that former Suriyawewa Pradeshiya Sabha Deputy Chairman, who is a close associate of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, joined to strengthen the government and support it at the forthcoming elections.
“More UPFA members have joined us recently, because they hail the services rendered by us to the people,” Minister Premadasa said.
The minister said there was an era when farmers in the district took to the streets and launched protests demanding a fair price for their paddy. But today, the farmers are getting a fair price of Rs. 48 per kilo. The farmers have been benefitted greatly as a result of the farsighted policies of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said his father, former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, launched the Sucharitha programme and commenced his political journey. He received bouquets and bricks both when he commenced his political career from the village. The minister said still there are 2.5 million families in the country who are suffering as a result of problems regarding housing. There are 80,000 families in the Hambantota district who have such problems. The Hambantota district will be converted to a better district within the forthcoming two years, the minister said.
