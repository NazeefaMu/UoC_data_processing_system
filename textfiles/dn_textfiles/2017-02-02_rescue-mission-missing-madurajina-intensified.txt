The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has been tracing the 'Madurajina 2' multi-day fishing boat and its five fishermen ever since the boat has gone missing in the sea for nearly a month, the ministerial news release says.
The release states that Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando no sooner than the incident was reported to take all necessary measures to locate and rescue the missing boat and the five fishermen.
Although the Navy along with the National Coast Conservation Department launched search operations, they had not found any clue so far. The fisheries authorities in countries in the Indian Ocean too were requested to keep vigil and inform the Sri Lanka authorities any clue regarding the boat.

Sri Lankan multi-day fishing boats as well as those of other nations engaged in fishing in the international maritime zone too had been informed about the missing boat and as soon as any positive information was received, the government would take quick measures to rescue the boat and its fishermen, the press elease states.
