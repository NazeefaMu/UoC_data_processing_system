Speaker clearly violated Constitution: Susil

Colombo District MP, former UPFA General Secretary, Cabinet Minister and Attorney Susil Premajayanth said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should uphold the Constitution and asserted that he had no mandate or the authority to challenge the decisions and directives of President Maithripala Sirisena, constitutionally or otherwise.
This is serious and Speaker Jayasuriya has clearly overstepped his mandate and line of authority, he told the Daily News last night.
The MP was speaking in the wake of news releases that Speaker Jayasuriya had issued that he did not recognise the present Government and that the status quo should be restored to prior to the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and that the President did not have the mandate to sack Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Explaining the position Constitutionally, Premajayanth explained that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had no mandate to oppose the prorogation of Parliament and reconvene the House ahead of the gazette notification issued by the President for Parliament to meet on November 14, which would be going against the decision of the President, of whom, he said was the sole authority of reconvening the House of Parliament.
It was only on Monday that the Fundamental Rights Petition was filed by Attorney Nanaganda Kodikuwakku was taken up in the Supreme Court and it was that there was no way that Parliament could be re-summoned ahead of November 14.
The Attorney General also told the Supreme Court that in no way could be decision of the President to prorogue Parliament could be challenged, MP Premajayanth explained.
Explaining further, he said that according to the Provisions of Article 33 Sub Section 2, it states very clearly and under the duties and powers of the President, it specifically states that to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament is the inherent power of the President.
“With that power, the President has the power to prorogue Parliament and the Speaker has no business to overrule that decision or to do anything outside the gazette notification, Premajayanth said.
He also said that Article 42( 4) of the Constitution also specifically states that the President was vested with the powers of that office, to appoint a Prime Minister, whom in his opinion, who is most likely to command the confidence of the majority of the House
He said that it as patently clear that the mandate to appoint the Prime Minister was the sole authority and discretion of the President and that the Speaker had absolutely no business there. This is a clear cut violation of the Constitution by the Speaker as the Executive President is elected by the entire people of this country but the Prime Minister or the Speaker and other Members of Parliament was elected only for a particular District or Constituency.
That was the difference between the Executive President and all other politicians, he said.
Therefore, the President cannot delegate his Constitutional responsibilities to the Prime Minister and therefore, the Speaker has no mandate to either appoint or remove a Prime Minister, he remarked.
“It is also up to the Speaker and MPs to uphold Constitution,” he noted.
