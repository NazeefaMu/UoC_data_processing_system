Social media used to slander Maha Sangha - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said social media should not be misused and it should only be used for the betterment of the country and society.
“It can be observed that certain persons are slandering the Maha Sangha levelling baseless allegations through the social media. “Levelling fabricated allegations and slinging mud on the Maha Sangha through social media mainly through facebook, cannot be accepted,” the President said at the Amarapura Nikaya’s Upasampada ceremony held at the Kaluthara Bodhi yesterday.
“Politicians are used to facing fabricated allegations of this nature.But it is strange for the Maha Sangha since they have not faced such situations,” he said.
The President pointed out that Maha Sangha should lead the country through national issues. “The country needs the leadership of Maha Sangha especially when national issues come up. Therefore,the Maha Sanga should guide and provide advice when needed mainly when the country is facing a national issue” the President added.
