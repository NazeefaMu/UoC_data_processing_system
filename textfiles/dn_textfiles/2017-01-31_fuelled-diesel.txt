Fuelled by Diesel

Vin Diesel has a penchant for adding fuel to any franchise he’s attached to – if you’ll pardon the pun, and ‘xXx’ is no different. True to form, ‘xXx: Return of Xander Cage’ pushes the action to the max with extreme sports, gun fu, bike chases on land and on water, jumping off a plane with no parachute – to name only a few tropes. A treacherous villain, a sharpshooting sniper (Ruby Rose), a bumbling yet adorable hacker (Nina Dobrev), an enduring mentor (Samuel L. Jackson), and a charismatic DJ (Kris Wu) for the sheer heck of it; practically all the action movie clichés have been crammed into this flick to make it quite the spectacle.
The ethnically diverse cast is great for racial representation, yet the considerable talents of the ensemble aren’t exactly put on display. Donnie Yen is a legitimate Mixed Martial Arts fighter, as is Tony Jaa and even Micheal Bisping, but the fluidity of their fight sequences is stifled by the infuriating, twitchy editing technique that currently plagues Western action movies.
Choppy style
This choppy style is usually reserved for actors who cannot perform their own stunt work, so it’s an odd decision considering Yen and Jaa have repeatedly proved they can hold their own. Speaking of which, Deepika Padukone’s highly awaited Hollywood debut is refreshing - she has a significant role that she plays with ample confidence and without a forced American accent, who can throw down with the rest of the boys, showcasing an Indian ‘heroine’ who has come a long way on the big screen.
Crowd-pleasing
One does not simply walk in to a Vin Diesel movie expecting compelling storytelling and thoughtful cinema, and although ‘xXx’ exists in an alternate reality where the laws of physics simply don’t apply, there are enough crowd-pleasing moments to distract you from a predictable plot and departure from logic. That said, the movie has enough star power to perform well enough, particularly in Asian markets, to ensure yet another insane outing soon.
