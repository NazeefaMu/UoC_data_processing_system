Prof. Mohan Munasinghe attends Climate Change Leadership Summit

Co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize Professor Mohan Munasinghe, was the first among a panel of speakers which included former US President Barack Obama (who is also a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate), who addressed the global Climate Change Leadership Summit at Porto, Portugal, recently.
Professor Munasinghe addressed a gathering of 3,500 top-level business leaders and CEOs, on the role of business in addressing climate change and sustainability issues.
Besides Professor Munasinghe and former US President Obama, the other main speakers at the summit included Dr. Irina Bokova (the first female and Eastern European Director-General of UNESCO), and Juan Verde (advisor on environmental issues to former US President Obama and former Vice President Al Gore).
The Climate Change Leadership Summit helped launch the Porto Protocol, which features a pledge by the world business community to urgently implement an action plan to fight against climate change.
Professor Munasinghe is Chairman of the MIND Group in Colombo, which includes the non-profit Munasinghe Institute for Development (MIND), a UN-recognised centre working globally on all aspects of sustainable development, and MIND AM focussing on data analytics and management.
He is Chairman of the President’s Expert Committee on the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision as well as a guest professor at the Peking University in China.
He also serves as Director on the Board of Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), one of South Asia's leading providers of Integrated Sustainability Solutions, adding all aspects of sustainability to corporate boardroom agendas, supported by its Strategic Equity Partner, MTI Consulting.
