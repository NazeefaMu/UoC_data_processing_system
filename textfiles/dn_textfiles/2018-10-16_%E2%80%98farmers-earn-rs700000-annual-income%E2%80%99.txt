Export-oriented passion fruit cultivation zone inaugurated
‘Farmers to earn Rs.700,000 annual income’

The inauguration of the export-oriented passion fruit cultivation zone of the country was held recently in Pelawatte, Moneragala, under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Under the first stage of the project, which has been implemented by the Agriculture Ministry Agriculture Modernisation Unit, 35 acres of land in Pelawatte, Moneragala, have been allocated for passion fruit cultivation, while an additional 35 acres of land have been distributed among 75 farmers as half-acre allotments.
A high-yielding passion fruit variety called ‘Horana Gold’ will be cultivated in this zone.
“A farmer would be able to receive an annual income of Rs.700,000. The entire passion fruit harvest of the zone is scheduled to be purchased by the private sector and there will not be any issue for farmers to find a market for their produce,” the minister said.
Agricultural tool sets worth Rs.700,000 were distributed to all 75 farmers during the inauguration.
This zone was established under the Agriculture Development Project Api Wawalai-Api Kanne, implemented by the Agriculture Ministry with the intention of stopping the importation of vegetables, fruits, grams and other food products that could be grown easily in the country.
