Brands promotion is the best way to move a board upwards, said Ashish Mishra, Managing Director interbred India. He said that with better branding most of Sri Lankan companies that are only selling their products locally could go globe.
He also said that it was the private sector that drove India globally known in the 1990's via the IT industry. “But today this story is old and KPO and BPO terms are not only confined to India. This may be because India is overpriced. Sri Lanka can compete in this sector as the island nation cost are cheaper.”
