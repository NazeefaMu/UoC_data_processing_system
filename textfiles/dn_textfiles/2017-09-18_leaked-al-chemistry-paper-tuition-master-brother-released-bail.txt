Leaked A/L Chemistry paper: Tuition master, brother released on bail

 
The tuition master and his brother who were alleged to have published leaflets containing questions from the 2017 G.C.E. Advance Level Chemistry paper were released on bail today by the Gmapaha Magistrate.
The Police arrested the tuition master after carrying out investigations into the distribution of the handout near a leading school in Gampaha which contained several questions that appeared in the exact form as in the second A/L Chemistry question paper.
