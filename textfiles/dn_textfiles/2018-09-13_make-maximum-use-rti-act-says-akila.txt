Make maximum use of RTI Act, says Akila

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam requested the public to make the maximum use of the Right to Information Act to fight against injustice when admitting children to Grade 1 in schools.
The minister also instructed the ministry officials and the Principals to provide the information requested under the RTI Act.
The parents can appeal and seek information under the RTI Act once the selected students’ list is displayed. If a student had been admitted by producing fake documents, that student can be removed according to the circular issued relating to the admission of students for the year 2019.
