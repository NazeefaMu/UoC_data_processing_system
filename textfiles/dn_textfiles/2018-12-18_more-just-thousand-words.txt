Rap, Funk, Hi- Hop an Alternative band Unscripted have prospered in the Music industry because of their sheer commitment as Saveen Makalanda put it. Which is why their message to any young musician is simply this – ‘do what you got to do, because you just might be the one to change the whole game!’ Indeed when heeding his words another quote comes to mind – ‘When the going gets tough the tough gets going’! Melodies speaks to Saveen Makalanda of Unscripted whose success surely comes from the fact that they have the desire and discipline to make things happen. Because without discipline, desire amounts to nothing!
“Our music is pretty much unscripted. It is a mix of many genres such as Rap, Funk, Hip Hop and alternative. But I’d say we have a sound that is unique to us. Music is everything to us, it also gives us a voice so we could speak to people on a level that is universally understood,” said Makalanda.
One particular strength in the band is that they have this diversity. They draw inspiration from so many genres of music and this combined with their natural fearlessness to experiment with what they see and hear, all results in some really powerful music that has helped them amass a group of loyal followers.
“Our strength would be chemistry of the band and the fact that every member is influenced by all kinds of music around the world. No secret really, we are not afraid of taking risks,” explained Makalanda.
Another strength the band has, is their knowledge of music. Knowledge is truly power when it comes to this group of musicians. This has enabled them to break so many barriers. Music is life to them and not a day goes by when they don’t share items of music with each other.
“All our members come from various musical backgrounds. We love our music. Literally there won’t be a day that we don’t send each other new music to listen to. Even though there are so many constraints of doing music in this island we want to keep going and somehow break the barrier in this music industry,” pointed out Makalanda.
The band have not been idle. They have been putting their noses to the grindstone. Their music has been well received and they have really tasted success over the years.
“We have released one EP that includes three songs! The most outstanding one would be the EP H.U.S.T.L.E which included three of our originals and this is important to me because this is the record that put us on the map! Also we released the very first clay animation music video in Sri Lanka for the song H.U.S.T.L.E. Which was done by Chamindika Abeysinghe,” explained Makalanda.
The band admires artistes like Anderson Park, Tom Misch, John Mayer, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Stevie Wonder, MJ and the Doors. Makalanda points out that it is a learning process listening to these artistes. You need to use your ears and listen. Just by listening to someone talk or by listening to the lyrics of their music you can learn so much.
You just need to be a good listener. You need to pay attention. If you think you know everything about music you will just stagnate. You need to be open minded and you need to have that willingness to absorb what is going on around you. Again listening is important when it comes to everything in life.
If you take some artistes all over the world, they faced rejection after rejection. Yet they succeeded in life. They did not go on American Idol and win a spot in Hollywood. No, they tried again and again and one day their dreams came true!. They did not audition on American Idol and X- Factor. Performance after performance they were turned down and they came up the hard way. One day their hard work and determination paid off. Some of the people they went to must have given them a harder time than Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh or Sharon Osbourne.
“We listen to all kinds of music, you could actually learn much more by simply paying attention. In music with a little luck and hard work and single minded focus you can strike gold. You need to be resolute because you can be a game changer on your day if you have that determination,” pointed out Makalanda.
Makalanda stated that when you are onstage the feeling is out of this world. You feel you’re on top of the world. The band of course party a lot after a hard day’s work. They have encountered many setbacks but they did not let that deter them.
“We will never forget the performance at kacha kacha which was a banger! We completely went unscripted, improvised for hours, while English Sinhala and Tamil rappers would freestyle and the crowd was pretty wild! Hustle EP Launch and tropical jam was special too!,” said Makalanda
He also pointed out that an interesting feature of the band is they are not on the same page all the time but this works for them and not against them! This creates a lot of brainstorming because they have so many different ideas! So many ideas are brought to the table. That is the beauty of it. This enables them to come up with some unique and awesome approaches.
“Our ambition and goals are simple. To be bigger and better. To take the music scene here to a bigger stage, a wider platform! To stun audiences with our powerful melodies.
We would especially like to thank everyone who supported us in the local music scene! Lone rider productions for doing most of our videos! And of course the Ktown crew and the fans!,” said Makalanda
