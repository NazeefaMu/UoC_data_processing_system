‘Miles to go before I sleep’

May Day in Sri Lanka always has political connotations and is an opportunity for the major political parties to showcase their strength. Despite the traditional May 1 holiday being postponed, this year was no different with the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its offshoot, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) jostling for pole position.
In the context of recent political developments such as the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the decision of sixteen SLFPers to sit on the opposition benches and the reforms in the UNP, this week’s May Day celebrations had added significance in hinting what could lie ahead for the major parties.
The mainstream SLFP headed by President Maithripala Sirisena held their rally in Chenkalady, Batticaloa in a departure from their usual tradition of staging celebrations in Colombo. The rally was well attended and all parliamentarians loyal to the President participated.
Also attending the rally was former Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena who was among the ‘group of sixteen’ who voted for the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and subsequently quit the government. Her presence at Batticaloa led to speculation that she has reverted to supporting President Sirisena and that the ‘group of sixteen’ had now become the ‘group of fifteen’. However, Jayasena is yet to formally comment on her stance.
Even more significant was a statement by President Sirisena at the rally. He stated that he ‘would not retire from politics by 2020’. This is an obvious reference to the next presidential elections which are due by January that year. The reason, President Sirisena said, was because he had many more goals to achieve and his task as President was only half finished.
“The country does not need corrupt politicians. There are no political leaders who love the people. Some dream of forming a government in 2020. We will support a programme which promotes reconciliation”, President Sirisena was reported to have said.
SLFP’s presidential candidate in 2020
Previously, while campaigning for the Presidency in 2015, President Sirisena had stated that he would not run for President again, a pledge repeated several times after assuming office, most notably at the funeral of Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera in November 2015.
For some time, there has been speculation about the President’s intentions for 2020, fuelled further by his recent inquiry from the Supreme Court to determine whether his tenure ended in 2020 or 2021. The Supreme Court affirmed it was the former. Since then, several frontline SLFP ministers have been declaring that President Sirisena would be the SLFP’s presidential candidate in 2020 but the President has remained silent on the issue.
It should be noted that even on Monday, what the President said was that he would not ‘retire from politics by 2020’ and that he did not state that he would run again for the Presidency, though this appears to be the most plausible conclusion to draw from these comments.
If that is indeed the President’s intention, that would rule out any possibility of a rapprochement between the mainstream SLFP and the SLPP of which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the de-facto leader. Therefore the significance of the President’s statement was not lost on Rajapaksa.
Addressing the SLPP’s own well attended May Day rally in Galle, Rajapaksa attempted to pooh-pooh President Sirisena’s comments. The President has to make such statements to retain parliamentarians loyal to him, Rajapaksa argued.
Although the SLPP’s rally was reportedly well attended, if it had hoped to send the mainstream SLFP a message by roping in some parliamentarians from the ‘group of sixteen’, it would have been disappointed because none of them attended the Galle rally.
Despite widespread expectation that the ‘group of sixteen’ would eventually shift their loyalties to the SLPP because they believe that would enhance their chances of re-election, it is now clear that with many months more before the national elections, the majority in this group wish to keep their options open. It is also acknowledged that some in the group- such as former ministers Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekara- are more inclined to join Rajapaksa while others- such as former Minister John Seneviratne- wish to pursue a more neutral stance.
If the SLFP and the SLPP had their fair share of conveying political messages to each other, the UNP rally was not without its own drama. The rally of the main constituent party in government was held at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo, a day ahead of the other rallies.
That too was a departure from its usual practice as the rally was confined to a closed venue and there was no procession in the lead up to it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe alluded to the recent reforms in the party and also declared that the Samurdhi Bank would be brought under the purview of the Central Bank, a comment which drew a retort from S. B. Dissanayake, who was the minister in charge of the Samurdhi movement until recently. Dissanayake said he would resist such a move.
SLPP’s next presidential candidate
Making his presence felt at the rally was UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa. Premadasa pledged to work towards the election of a UNP President and a UNP government at the next elections. He also recalled that his father, Ranasinghe Premadasa had many differences of opinion with his leader J. R. Jayewardene but always remained loyal to Jayewardene “like his shadow”. He too has learnt that lesson and would follow in his father’s footsteps in remaining loyal to his leader, Premadasa said.
The UNP’s newly appointed National Organiser Navin Dissanayake acknowledged that the UNP had suffered a setback at the local; council elections and that the SLPP was making inroads into its vote base. Dissanayake also alluded to speculation about a tussle between the Rajapaksa siblings- Chamal, Gotabhaya and Basil- to be the SLPP’s next presidential candidate.
Of more concern to the UNP would be the absence of many stalwarts from the May Day rally. Among those who were conspicuous by their absence were Chairman Kabir Hashim, Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake and other stalwarts including Palitha Range Bandara, Ashoka Abeysinghe, Wasantha Senanayake, Hirunika Premachandra, Chaminda Wijeysiri, Ranjan Ramanayake, Daya Gamage, Sujeewa Senasinghe, Mayantha Dissanayake and Edward Gunasekara, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Malik Samarawickrema, Sagala Ratnayaka, Ranjit Aluvihare and Chathura Senaratne.
The UNP, in a subsequent statement, clarified the absences of some of the MPs stating that they were either overseas or unable to attend due to other personal reasons. Obviously, some of the absentees are close loyalists of UNP leader and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and would have had no intention of embarrassing him.
However, there is speculation that the absences of some others were due to recent party reforms not meeting their aspirations. Among them, parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra has been outspoken, communicating her dissatisfaction in numerous interviews with the media. It remains to be seen whether Premachandra will be taken to task with disciplinary action taken against her or whether the party would adopt a more conciliatory damage control option.
It is clear from what transpired on May Day that all the major parties are in somewhat of a state of flux, with national elections looming in about one and a half years. The mainstream SLFP is desperate to recover from the drubbing it received at the local council elections and the defection of the ‘group of sixteen’. The SLPP, despite its recent successes, has to identify a presidential candidate and gear itself for elections and the UNP has to deal with internal dissent. Interesting times, no doubt, are ahead.
