UK interest rates  held at 0.5%

The Bank of England has held UK interest rates at 0.5% for the third meeting in a row.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted by seven votes to two to keep rates unchanged, in a departure from the MPC’s unanimous vote in February.
The last time rates moved was in November, when the Bank raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5% - the first increase since July 2007.
More rises are expected this year even though the pace of inflation has eased.
All nine members of the MPC, including governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their meeting in February.
“We expect the Bank of England (BoE) to remain on hold today, but we do expect an interest rate rise later this year - possibly around the autumn,” Remi Olu-Pitan from the fund manager Schroders told the Today programme.
“The BoE is very much focused on inflation. Inflation in the UK right now is around 2.7% - it’s the highest in the G7,” she explained.
“It is unusual [to raise interest rates] when growth is so weak in the UK, but I guess because global growth is so strong, somehow the UK should benefit from that.”
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has raised its UK growth forecast, but warns it will be among the worst performing G7 economies until 2020.
The BCC has raised its GDP forecast for 2018 from 1.1% to 1.4% and in 2019 from 1.3% to 1.5%. Its first forecast for 2020 is for 1.6% growth.
The hike is driven by slightly stronger than expected consumer spending.
And it says the UK’s export performance is expected to remain robust on the back of strong global growth.
But it says with imports also likely to continue to grow, the contribution of net trade to the UK’s GDP growth over the near term is to be limited, “particularly with little evidence of a sterling boost to the UK’s overall net trade position”.
And despite the upgrades, UK GDP growth is set to remain well below the historical average throughout the forecast period.
