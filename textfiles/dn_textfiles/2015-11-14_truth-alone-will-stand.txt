The Truth alone will stand...

Lankan government decided to revoke a purported agreement Avant Garde had entered into with the defence minister under former Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and asked the navy to take over the private firm's operations. President Sirisena has ordered the immediate cancellation of the so-called joint venture deal between the private security company and the defence ministry's private arm known as RALL and to take legal action against Avant Garde within a week
According to Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the President has ordered to hand over the operations of Avant Garde to the Sri Lanka Navy with immediate effect. The decision was taken at a meeting held with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena. Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon, Attorney General, Navy Commander, representatives from the Rakna Lanka, Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe participated in the discussion.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake's allegations
Inspector General of Police N. K. Illangakoon claimed ignorance over the arms scandal, but was censured by the Cabinet which had pitched into him for not carrying out a thorough investigation.
One could wonder whether the dispute on Avant Garde has created a modern crime and punishment problem. Because when JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake made his allegation in parliament, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe challenged him to a debate on this matter. Minister said "I have not taken a cent from Avant Garde. When JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake made this allegation in parliament, I challenged him to a debate on this matter and said I would resign from my portfolio if it was proved correct. But he did not take up my challenge".
Justice and fair play
At the same time Field Marshal Fonseka had criticized Minister Rajapakshe over several matters including that of not taking action to arrest former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. "He kept pressuring me to arrest Mr. Rajapaksa even without any evidence. He was keen on taking revenge from him. We came to establish good governance not to take revenge from anyone. I said I will not arrest him because allegations against him have not been proved. When I told the President and the Prime Minister about this they also advised the Attorney General not to act as others wanted but to act reasonably. .."
President Maithripala Sirisena has summoned this special meeting and has taken firm stand to clear the table. He has taken this step as tension prevailed at the last Cabinet after Megapolis and Western Region Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne accused Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana of not pursuing the allegations against Avant Garde.
In this scenario Attorney General became a sort of converse Javert, the dedicated police officer in Les Misérables, the novel by Victor Hugo. In that novel Javert is a fanatic Police Inspector in pursuit to recapture Jean Valjean - the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread.
Our Javert is accused of not taking any action against hideous culprits because his dedication to the letter of law! So he is the reverse of French Javert in Les Misérables. As a layman I assumed that the job of AG is to use the law to safeguard the flow of justice and fair play. I am mistaken; the job of AG is to safeguard the interest of the culprit until 200% evidence is brought before him by any modern Javert in the Lankan police force. Until then the blame will obviously come on the police for messing up the investigation.
Revolutionary Democracy
Fortunately in this case President Sirisena has played the role of the noble peasant Valjean. He has gallantly taken the load off the shoulders of the Attorney General and dissolved the Avant Garde.
This action shows that the mass movement that has been classified as the Revolutionary Democracy is still active; all components, peoples committees, trade unions, civil society organizations and NGOs spread throughout the country are continuing the dialogue. Maithri has felt the pressure of masses assembled.
Peoples organizations can understand what is happening and their empirical understanding obtained through common sense may look humble and simple; but closer to the truth. It is this understanding that guides the people to come out and face the power of reaction again and again.
Now that Avant Garde issue has taken a dramatic turn what will happen to our Javert?
In the original story Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral.
He takes his own life by jumping into the Seine. Certainly that is too dramatic for the real world. But masses can do wonders. Recent happenings prove this social principle. Slogans and actions may take various forms; but the thirst for truth and justice, will remain the force that propels the Revolutionary Democracy.
