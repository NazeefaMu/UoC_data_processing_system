Deadly cells in lungs

This week Clinical Consultant Oncologist attached to the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka ( NCISL), Maharagama Dr. N. Jeyakumaran, MBBC (Jaffna), MD (Colombo) speaks about lung Cancer that shows a rapid increase among Sri Lankans. Medical experts in Sri Lanka say that lung cancer is the second commonest cancer among Sri Lankan males at the moment.
Q What is lung cancer ?
A - Lung cancer occurs when normal cells of the lungs change into abnormal cells that multiply out of body’s control forming a malignant growth in lung tissue. Lung cancer is the number one killer in the West. Lung cancer incidence is slowly rising in Sri Lanka too. It is the second common malignancy among men in Sri Lanka.
There are different types of lung cancer. Some types appear in the central part and others do occur in the periphery of the lung.
There are many warning symptoms. Common symptoms of lung cancer when it is confined to the lung or the thorax are:
* Prolonged Cough
* Chest pain
* Hoarse voice
* Spitting or coughing up blood
* Trouble breathing or wheezing
When it spreads to other organs it gives rise to many symptoms due to its effects on those organs: If it spreads to the brain, there may be headache, vomiting and or any weakness of limb. All of these symptoms can also be caused by some other conditions too. But if you have these symptoms, you should see your doctor immediately
It is very important to identify or diagnose lung cancer at an early stage so that one can have a curative surgery or radiotherapy. If it is in late stage it would be very difficult to treat to cure the condition and one need to tolerate many side effects of chemotherapy as well.
Q- Who are at risk of developing Lung Cancer ?
A - Lung cancers do occur mostly among heavy smokers. Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, of which more than 70 behave as carcinogens that cause, initiate or promote lung cancer. Second hand smoke (Passive smoking) can also induce lung cancer. Lung cancer is also caused by exposure to asbestos or to polluted air especially in industrial zone. Exposure to radiation like Radon gas too increases the incidence.
Lung cancer can occur among non smokers and young adults due to alteration in their chromosomes or with genetic disorders that are very vulnerable to the genesis of lung cancer.
Q - How Lung Cancer can be diagnosed?

A - When a person is having above symptoms or being a chronic smoker, he / she should consult a doctor to do some tests to diagnose lung cancer. When you meet a doctor firstly you will be examined and a chest X-ray too will be performed. If the chest X-ray shows a spot or a shadow that looks like a cancer, further special tests like bronchoscopy, CT scan or PET scan will be done. These special imaging tests show details of lung tissues and any tumour or abnormal growths within the lung as well. These imaging tests also help in staging the lung cancer to offer appropriate treatment.
A small sample of tissue from the abnormal area can be obtained by either with bronchoscopy or with CT guidance. This tissue can be examined under the microscopy for final diagnosis and pathological sub-typing. There are some special molecular biomarker studies, like EGFR, KRAS and ALK mutation status can be performed in the tissue for targeted therapy especially when it is an adenocarcinoma.
Q - What is the treatment available for Lung Cancer ?
A - The right treatment for lung cancer depends on the stage and the type of the disease. When the lung cancer is in the early stage, radical surgery or radiotherapy can be offered to cure the condition. When the patient is well fit and eligible for surgery, resection of part of the lung or even removal of the whole lung will be done. But when the patient is frail, very old and with co-morbidities, surgery cannot be offered even with an early stage of the disease. In this situation radical radiation treatment would be the best alternative.

In late stages the only hope is chemotherapy. It will help controlling the disease but at the expense of its side effects. When the molecular biomarkers are well expressed in the lung cancer tissue, targeted therapy like Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Crizotinib or Osimertinib could be prescribed. These molecules have few side effects that are very manageable. Recently vaccines too are tried to manage few types of lung cancers.
Anyhow in very late stages these lung cancer patients suffer badly with breathlessness and discomfort. Good palliative treatment with aspiration of pleural fluids or pleurodesis and use of morphine to have better quality and comfort is very essential.
Q - What is the message that can be given for the healthy people to prevent Lung Cancer ?
A - The best way to lower the chances of getting or dying from lung cancer is to quit smoking. It does not matter how much or how long one has smoked, but quitting will reduce the chances not only of lung cancer development, but also of the heart diseases and many other cancers.
It is also extremely very important to detect lung cancer at its early stage by consulting a doctor when the above symptoms do occur. Researchers have been studying "low-dose CT scans" as a form of good screening tool for lung cancer detection in early stages among high risk individuals.
Government of Sri Lanka has taken many steps to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, especially under the His Excellency’s initiatives by displaying pictorial warning in the cigarette packs, implementation of laws to stop smoking in public places and total banning of asbestos based products such as asbestos roof sheets from the year 2018.
