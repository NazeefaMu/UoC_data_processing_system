Drought adversely affecting fishing industry: Amaraweera

 
The freshwater fisheries industry of the country has been badly affected due to the severe drought condition prevailing in most parts of the island, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. 
According to the minister, small reservoirs in several areas have been completely evaporated and fish resources of these reservoirs have been completely destroyed and the Fisheries Ministry will take measures to release fresh stocks of fish once the reservoirs filled with water.
Apart from that the Ministry has already taken measures to provide technical and financial assistance to promote inland fish farming among the families whose income is based on fishing at small reservoirs since the fish catch of them has been drastically declined, said the Minister. 
He further said that the government had allocated a large amount of funds for the development of inland fisheries industry of the country. The monthly income of families those who depend on fresh water fish industry had been increased up to Rs 100,000 due to the welfare activities and livelihood development programmes conducted during past two years. 
“Due to the non-establishment of new fish hatcheries during the previous regime, only 20 million fresh stocks of fish released to the reservoirs. But now the number of fish annually release to the reservoirs has been increased up to 80 million. A large number of fish hatcheries have already been established in the country with the intention of releasing 100 million fish to the reservoirs by the end of year 2019.” the Minister added.
