LSSP to celebrate Republic Day on May 22

The Republic Day of Sri Lanka will be celebrated by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) on May 22 at 3.00 pm at N.M.Perera Centre, Borella under the patronage of LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday Prof. Vitharana said that the Leader of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Dinesh Gunawardene and several leftist political parties will attend the meeting. Several other programmes will take place islandwide to mark the day.
Prof.Vitharana said Sri Lanka is heading towards becoming a colony again and Sri Lanka won the real Independence and announced the same to the world as an independent country on May 22, 1972 with the new Constitution introduced to the country by Sri Lanka Freedom party with the support of leftist political parties.
But later, the day was forgotten and even after presenting a cabinet paper as a minister in the previous regime, the day was not celebrated as expected.
The Trincomalee harbour will be used as a US army base and relevant agreements have already been signed. Sri Lankan air force and navy have become parts of the US armed forces by patrolling along the Indian Ocean in behalf of US armed forces, he said.
Even the Survey Department is about to be sold to a foreign company. The government has signed an agreement with the IMF agreeing to conditions and accordingly the Government is pruning social welfare systems established after a struggle by the LSSP. The EPF, ETF, pensions are some of the benefits being curtailed, he added.
