Ex-minister’s son refutes bribery allegation

The son of late Lands Minister M.K.D.S. Gunawardene yesterday refuted as completely false an allegation made against his late father by former Presidential chief of staff Dr. I.H.K. Mahanama, saying his late father asked him to canvass bribes from prospective investors in the Kantale Sugar Company.
Addressing a press conference convened by the Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre yesterday, Nalin Gunawardene said he was certain that his late father was never involved in soliciting any bribes because he functioned as his father’s coordinating officer at the time.
Dismissing all allegations made by Dr. Mahanama, who is now in remand for allegedly accepting a bribe from an Indian investor, Gunawardene said his late father stayed with his sister when he went to England to seek medical treatment.
At that time Mahanama had even visited England to obtain his father’s signature to hand over the title deed of the Kalutara Bodhi. During that visit too, Mahanama was more interested in finding an investor than seeking his father’s signature for the deed.
He alleged that during the time John Amaratunga held the portfolio following the death of his father, Mahanama tried his best to award the scrap iron tender to the wife of a high-level Naval officer.
Gunawardene said at the time of his death, his father was residing in a dilapidated house belonging to the Land Registration Commission. There was suspicion that Mahanama even siphoned off money from the expenditure made for his father’s funeral.
Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre and CaFFE Director Keerthi Tennakoon addressing the conference said that during investigations conducted into the thee matter of the two officials arrested for bribery concerning the Kantale Sugar Factory, attention should be drawn to their properties and other assets too. There was information that these two officers owned flats at Torrington Square and Sri Jayewardenepura close to the university premises, as well as buildings in Matara town.
