Kiralakele to be a tourist attraction

The Kiralakele area off the Nilwala river in the Matara district will be developed as a tourist attraction.
According to members of the Nilwala Valley Farmers’ Organizations, this region has an extent of over 300 hectares. It has already been gazetted as a natural sanctuary by the government. The Ceylon Tourist Board has taken over project activities and the World Tourist Day has also been celebrated there on a grand scale.
Proposed development activities in the region include construction of agricultural dams in swampy and marshy lands, cultivation of various species of plants so as to improve and maintain mangroves already existing there; erection of a crocodile park, a holiday resort with spacious rest rooms for local and foreign tourists, and a hotel with indigenous food varieties such as organic vegetables and buffalo curd, cadjan thatched huts with stalls; putting up aquariums of inland fish with sale centres and ancient houses with agricultural and cultural identities, and employment generating projects as well. The main aim of all these endeavours would be to attract more tourists to the region and collect a better income for country’s coffers, project officials further added.
