World Maritime Day
World Maritime Day for 2015 falls on September 24. The theme for 2015 is "Maritime education and training." The theme was adopted to focus attention on the wider spectrum of maritime education and training, in particular its adequacy and quality, as the bedrock of a safe and secure shipping industry, which needs to preserve the quality, practical skills and competence of qualified human resources, in order to ensure its sustainability. World Maritime Day was first held in 1978 to mark the 20th anniversary of the IMO Convention's entry into force. Celebrations are held throughout the world to focus attention on the importance of shipping safety, maritime security and the marine environment, and to emphasize a particular aspect of IMO's work.. -UN.
'Pini Poda Wessak' goes to Kalutara
Award winning dramatist Nalaka Swarnathilake, who has produced many children's creations such as 'Dangamalla', 'Anne', and 'Mama Wenama Malak', is bringing his annual show back on stage on September 25. The show will unfurl at the Kalutara Town Hall. This event, titled 'Pini Poda Wessak - Small Wonders on Stage', is designed to showcase creative performances in the streams of drama, dancing and singing.
It will comprise two shows, a 10.30 am show for school children and the public show at 6.30 pm, which will be held under the patronage of veteran artist Edward Jayakody and Charitha Priyadarshani Peiris. It is a presentation of the Whyteleaf Performing Arts Academy and will feature around 50 children (who are between the ages of 10-15) performing 15 items, including songs and dancing styles stemming from several cultural backgrounds.
The 50 children are comprised of students from 20 schools in Colombo and Kalutara, marking the first time a show of this scale is being held in Kalutara.
It will feature songs from several famous Sri Lankan stage dramas and include a collection of songs written by Kalasuri Arisen Ahubudu. The music direction for the show will be done by veteran musician Lakshman Wijesekera. At a time when creations that can be jointly enjoyed by our children and adults are diminishing, the goal of this event is to present a stage show that rejuvenates this genre of entertainment.
As Nalaka explains, "the Whyteleaf Performing Arts Academy was the first institute in Sri Lanka that was started with the intent of using drama, dancing, singing and other aspects of the performing arts to develop the personality of the children. Its main objective was to create a better citizen for the future rather than just an artist. Thus, this show is being organised as an annual event to provide the childrenan opportunity to exercise their leadership and organisational skills as well as giving them a national stage to showcase their talents. It follows on from the tremendous success we had with last year's show".

Importance of reading
If we ask people about their hobbies, many would say "reading". Earlier generations used to read a lot compared to the current generation. Reading enables a person to be more intelligent and knowledgeable. There is no one in the world who hasn't read a book - it might be a school book, a comic or even a magazine. As we all know, by reading we unknowingly gather information. Books take us to another world. Even without visiting a new country, a person understands the culture and traditions of that country. When a child sees his or her elders reading, it inspires him or her to read. Parents should take care that as we take pain to inculcate the feelings of spirituality, social awareness and traditional values in children, we should also ensure that children befriend books. We can ensure that we are bringing up good citizens if we cultivate this habit.
When a child reads he or she can even find solutions to his problems through the books. Nowadays parents are too busy with their hectic life. They do not have time to pay attention to the concerns of their children. In many situations books can serve as guiding factor or helpline in children's life. Parents should take care that the child spends less time on TV and Internet and spends more time on reading.

My first bicycle
I still remember the day when I got my first bicycle. I got it when I was seven years old. It was a four-wheel cycle. It was blue in colour.
There was a beautiful picture of Manny, the mammoth, from 'Ice Age' on my cycle seat. Every day morning I would ride my cycle . I loved to ring the bell whenever I saw people coming near my cycle. My cycle had a basket in the front. I always kept my favourite teddy bear in the basket. Afterwards my father removed the side wheels. I was very scared to ride the cycle without side wheels. Suddenly, one day I put both my legs on the pedals and rode. Finally, I learnt to ride a bicycle all alone. I was so happy.
When I grew up my father bought me a big bicycle. Now, I ride it to some nearby shops. But still I love my first bicycle and keep it safe in my house. I will give it to my brother whenhe grows up.

Farming
My grandmother always says that her favorite hobby is farming. I wondered how can anyone have farming as a hobby! She has mainly vegetables in her garden. There are vegetables like tomatoes, lady's finger, snake gourd, bitter gourd, drumsticks, green chillies etc. She cooks only those vegetables that grow in her garden.
She is a good cook. When I saw her garden I felt it is so nice to eat something that is grown in our own garden. We don't need to be afraid of harmful chemicals that are sprayed on plants. All the vegetables used are fresh and pure.
Lately many people are turning to farming. They say that farming gives them peace and happiness. I have seen my grandmother talking to the plants. I used to feel funny. But I have seen that the more she interacts with a plant, the faster the plant grows.
My grandma says when she gets up in the morning she feels fresh seeing the plants swaying in the breeze. It is as if they are saying "good morning." Everyone should follow my grandma's way of farming. We should be aware of the fact that the fertilizers that are used are dangerous and deadly. It can cause cancer, skin problems and various health hazards.

A hot summer day
I live in a city which is very hot during summer vacation. On a hot summer day I would like to stay indoors and play indoor games with my friends. We friends get together in our house and play games like carrom board, cards, scrabble etc.
My mother makes sure that we drink lots of water or juice. We go out to play only in the evening when it is less hot. If my friends are not around I like to sit in front of the TV drinking king coconut water. It is difficult to spend the day when electricity goes off as I cannot watch TV. If there is no electricity we sleep on the terrace.
My sister and I play a game "star counting". The person who counts the maximum number of stars wins the game. Sometimes when it is too hot I wish I lived in a village. Then, when its too hot I could jump into the pond and enjoy the cool water in the pond. I like summer because we can eat lots of ice cream.
