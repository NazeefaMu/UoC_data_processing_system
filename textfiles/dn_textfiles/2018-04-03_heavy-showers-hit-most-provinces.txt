Heavy showers to hit most provinces

With Inter-monsoon conditions getting established over the island, showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in most provinces of Sri Lanka after 2.00 p.m. the meteorology department said.
Showers can be expected in the Western, Southern and South-eastern coastal areas in the morning too.
Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces during the morning.
There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
