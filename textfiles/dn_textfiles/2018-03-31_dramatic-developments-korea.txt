Dramatic developments in Korea

The political atmosphere in the Korean peninsula which was marked by policies of brinkmanship followed by the United States President and North Korean Leader as well as joint US – ROK military drills and North Korean missile and nuclear tests has dramatically changed for the better with all parties negotiating to resume diverse summits.
President Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will be meeting President Moon Jae in of the Republic of Korea on April 27 at Peace House, in the southern part of Panmunjeom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It will be the first meeting of the leaders of the two Koreas since 2007.
The thaw in relations all began with the offer of North Korea to send a team of sportsmen to the Winter Olympics that were held in South Korea.
The South responded positively and a flurry of diplomatic activity with exchanges of high level official delegations improved the climate at an unprecedented speed.
The North Korean leader also paid a sudden visit to Beijing last week in order to brief Chinese leaders about the impending summit and consult Chinese leaders. After his departure Beijing announced that the North Korean President was willing to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A high level official of China visited Seoul subsequently and informed Seoul about the outcome of the meeting with Kim Jong Un. Perhaps he would have already delivered a message from Pyongyang to Washington to be delivered through South Korean officials. Two South Korean officials will now fly to Washington to appraise President Trump of the latest developments and on the forthcoming Korean Summit. Meanwhile officials of the two Koreas will meet on April 4th to make final preparations for the Leader’s Summit.
President Trump is also expected to meet President Kim Jong Un in May and both of them have expressed optimism about its success. It is reported that North Korea has promised to suspend its nuclear missile and weapons tests and to refrain from calling for a stop to joint US-ROK military drills to facilitate dialogue.
Japan, not to be outdone and feeling left alone has also intimated its desire to meet North Korean Leader. It is said that secret negotiations are being made now through the Japanese Embassy in Beijing for a Japan-North Korea summit in early June.
West on an anti-Russian crusade
Britain, United States and several other Western countries have expelled nearly 150 Russian diplomats in a coordinated move over the alleged poisoning of a former Russian intelligence official Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Russia has denied the charge and says it is part of the anti-Russian policy of the West. Earlier he has defected to Britain.
It all began with the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from London on March 14th. Russia retaliated by expelling 23 British diplomats. Then the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats including some working in the UN on March 26. Russia retaliated by expelling an equal number of US diplomats from Russia and withdrew its approval for a Consulate in St. Petersburg.
In addition to Britain and the United States, altogether 22 countries including France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Poland and Canada have expelled Russian diplomats.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that “Russia will show a mirror response to all countries that have expelled Russian diplomats”.
It yesterday announced that it has already expelled 150 foreign diplomats.
At present Russia is facing sanctions imposed by Western nations against it over its policy in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
More sanctions are expected in view of the aggravation of the present crisis. The United States has also warned about the possibility of freezing Russian assets in the United States.
The Bank of Russia has one-third of its currency assets in the US. Russian economic analysts have claimed that such an act would mean a declaration of war.
