The Ernakulam rural police on Thursday foiled an attempt by a group of young Sri Lankan refugees camping in Tamil Nadu to illegally migrate to Australia in a boat near the Munambam fishing harbour.

Four agents, Stephan, Andrews, Christy Adima, (all three from Thiruvanathapuram) and Veeramani (Kanyakumari) too have been arrested.
The intelligence team of the police got wind of the possible illegal immigration from Munambam on an old boat purchased by the agents, preparing to sail from Kochi on Thursday or Friday night.
Based on information given by the arrested, police trapped agents camping in the region with an intention of sending them under the cover of darkness.
The refugees, camping in Kochi for the last few days, paid from Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 1 lakh to the agents.
