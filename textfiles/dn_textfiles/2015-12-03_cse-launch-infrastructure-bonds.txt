CSE to launch infrastructure bonds

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is planning to launch infrastructure bonds in the immediate future, said Vajira Kulatilaka , Chairman of CSE at a ceremony held to mark its 30th anniversary .
The CSE is also planning to set up a separate trading board for Small and Medium Enterprises( SME) and it is slated to be launched in the immediate future.
The CSE is also extending its reach beyond borders to cooperate commercially with its peer exchanges in the region, to collectively uplift the performance of regional Exchanges.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the government will also bring in new laws together with the Exchange Management Act and territorial taxation system to create complete confidence in the Stock Exchange. He said that Sri Lanka requires an efficient and transparent stock market. To achieve this target, the public sector entities are encouraged to go public. He urged the relevant authorities in the CSE and Securities and Exchange Commission to address issues relating to conflict of interest and integrity.
He said he is confident that with all these proposed initiatives, there will be a strong market reflecting a strong economy which the government has pledged to create. The Colombo Stock Exchange on Wednesday adopted the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) which was developed by MSCI and Standard and Poor's with a view to standardizing capital market activities.
