Pohottuva will win  LG polls -Dallas

The Joint Opposition will win the LG election under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Parliamentarian Dallas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition at the Rajagiriya Dr.N M Perera Memorial Hall, Alahapperuma said we have not had an opportunity to contest which is no house left because SLFP took a lease by UNP.
He said all the parties representing the joint opposition have decided to contest the election under the symbol of pohottuva and JO will support the SLPP at the upcoming polls.
He further said they did not destroy the SLFP, it was destroyed on January 8, 2015.
