The square President

I was born in 1972, the year of the Watergate break-in, and so am too young to remember Richard Nixon in his presidential years. But I have often marvelled at the untrammelled hatred for the man among liberal Americans of an older generation. The reason for the loathing cannot have been ideology: Nixon’s conservatism was mostly attitudinal rather than ideological; he did not govern as a right-winger.
He cared almost exclusively about foreign policy, on which he held pragmatic (if complicated) views of an extremely high intellectual order, and more or less let centrist appointees run domestic cabinet agencies. “I’ve always thought this country could run itself domestically without a president”, he said to an interviewer in 1968; “all you need is a competent cabinet to run the country at home. You need a president for foreign policy.”
Empirical evidence
Why the hatred, then? He was often deceitful and in crucial respects unprincipled, but hardly less so than his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, whom many modern biographers have gone out of their way to praise on the grounds that he expanded the American welfare state, though the empirical evidence of its success is lacklustre at best.
Nixon had his enemies spied on and used federal agencies to bully them, but other presidents, before and since, have done the same, and in any case hatred for Nixon long predated post-Watergate revelations of his paranoid vindictiveness.
John Farrell, in Richard Nixon: The Life, comes close to the answer when he observes, near the beginning of his account, that “there is cool and there is square, and Richard Milhous Nixon was nothing if not square”. Coolness – the quality of appearing self-possessed, at ease with oneself – became an essential part of democratic politics with the rise of tele­vision.
That happened roughly from the time Nixon was urged to run for Congress in 1945 (where Farrell’s book begins) to the time he was defeated by John Kennedy in the 1960 presidential contest. Nixon’s loss to Kennedy that year is often simplistically attributed to his poor performance in the first televised debate, but it’s true that the sleep-deprived Nixon appeared addled and shifty beside the poised Kennedy in this new visual medium. Particularly in his later years, Nixon was often bad on television. After he won the presidency in 1968, he appeared defensive and mean in televised events, and his attempts to appear relaxed – cool – came off badly.
Sense of humour
Nor did his appearance help. As a younger man Nixon was handsome enough, but the growth of those famous jowls in his middle years gave his appearance a graceless aspect that, combined with a one-dimensional sense of humour, made him seem, as Farrell has it, square. Half a century ago, US presidents didn’t appear and speak publicly nearly as often as they do today, but even in the 1970s it must have been easy to grow tired of looking at Richard Nixon. For sophisticated people, he was easy to despise.
That hadn’t always been so. The progression from light to darkness is the chief com­ponent of any biography of Nixon, but Farrell capably emphasizes his earlier generous outlook and ability to command the loyalty of subordinates and respect of voters. As a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, for instance, Nixon combined sober anti-com­munism with winsomeness and intellect­ual probity.
Farrell rightly acknowledges both sides of the question of communism in mid-century America – on the one hand “the governments of the United States and Great Britain had been penetrated by Soviet spies during World War II, some of whom stole valuable military secrets”, and on the other hand “the United States was never in danger of a Communist insurrection led by its flaky homespun Reds”. In 1948 the bright and cheerful member from California’s 12th district offered an attractive contrast with the bigoted oaf John Rankin (Democrat of Mississippi) and the snivelling and corrupt J. Parnell Thomas (Republican of New Jersey). In one hearing recounted by Farrell, Arthur Garfield Hays of the generally left-wing American Civil Liberties Union sparred good-naturedly with Nixon, whose fairness, he said, “confirms my faith in the American system of government”.
Suspected spy
In 1948 Nixon, in the face of opposition from editorialists and Democrats and silence from Republicans, insisted on pursuing the committee’s case against the suspected spy Alger Hiss. “The name means nothing to me”, Hiss had answered when the committee asked him if he’d ever known his accuser, the reformed spy Whittaker Chambers. In fact, Hiss did know Chambers, and as a high-level official in the State Department, Hiss had passed diplomatic secrets to the Russians. - Times Literary Supplement
