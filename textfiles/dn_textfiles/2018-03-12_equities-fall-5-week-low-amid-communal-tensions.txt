Point of view
Sri Lankan equity markets closed largely flat this week, as communal violence clouded sentiment and investors opted to remain on the sidelines.
The main share price Index fell for three consecutive days at the start of the week, falling to a 5-week low of 6503 points on Wednesday as communal riots failed to ease even by midweek.
The Index consequently lost 53 points but gained 47 points on Thursday and Friday as the racial violence dissipated by week end, helping the Index close at 6,551.19 points, just 6 points lower than last week’s close.
Foreign investors who were a major driver of equities in 2017 meanwhile, remained cautious on domestic equities this week, and while this week’s communal tensions didn’t trigger a major equity selloff, net foreign inflows fell to a 2018 low of Rs. 193.4Mn by end week.
Although the net inflow position was a reversal from last week’s net outflows of Rs. 489Mn, this week’s net inflow was notably lower than average weekly net foreign inflows recorded over 2018 so far (Rs. 801Mn).
Local institutional and HNI investors also remained relatively subdued this week, with crossings for the week falling to 43% cf. last week’s exceptional participation levels of 74% of market activity.
Institutional and HNI interest was driven mainly by blue-chips such as HNB (57% of total crossings) and JKH (14%) which cumulatively accounted for 70% of the week’s total crossings, while the remainder was driven by interest in mid-caps such as NTB (10%),TJL (9%) SAMP (6%) and LION (5%).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for directional cues from political developments in the upcoming week.
Market earnings rise 15% Y-o-Y over Dec’17
Total1 market earnings for the recently concluded earnings season indicated a Quarter-on-Quarter growth in earnings, as earnings 2 for the Dec’17 quarter rose 41% Q-o-Q to Rs.84.4Bn.
This compares to the Rs. 75.8Bn recorded by the full market in Mar’17 and the Rs. 53.7Bn recorded in Jun’17 and Rs. 59.9Bn recorded in Sept’17.
Growth over the quarter was driven largely by sectors such as Banks, Finance& Insurance, (+61% Y-o-Y), F&B (+41% Y-o-Y), Teleco (+182% Y-o-Y), Land & Property (+306% Y-o-Y) and Healthcare (+13% Y-o-Y).
While the growth in Q-o-Q earnings is notable, it is also largely reflective of the traditionally stronger Dec quarter; indeed, market earnings over the Dec’17 quarter on a Y-o-Y basis was a more restrained 15%, reflecting the general slowdown in overall GDP growth which is estimated to be <4% in 2017 (GDP growth over 9M’17 was 3.7% Y-o-Y).
On a cumulative3 9M basis too, corporate earnings over the period fell 3.8% Y-o-Y to Rs. 174Bn relative to Rs. 182Bn reported by the total market in Dec’16.
The decline was driven mainly by lower corporate earnings in sectors such as Manufacturing (-22% Y-o-Y), Construction (-135% Y-o-Y), Teleco (-13% Y-o-Y), Hotels & Travels (-99% Y-o-Y), Motors (-23% Y-o-Y) and Power & Energy (-99% Y-o-Y).
Nevertheless, stronger corporate earnings growth in sectors such as Banks (+16% Y-o-Y), Insurance & Other (+43% Y-o-Y), Diversified (+12% Y-o-Y), Land & Property (+65% Y-o-Y), Healthcare (+53% Y-o-Y) and F&B (+3% Y-o-Y) helped prop cumulative market earnings.
On a trailing 12M basis meanwhile, market earnings rose 10% Y-o-Y to Rs.274Bn helping push the PER levels down to 11.63x relative to 11.96x in the comparable period in 2016.
