Pathfinder Foundation to develop work programme with Sichuan University of China

 
Following a fact-finding tour undertaken by a team of academics representing the prestigious Sichuan University (SCU) in April at the invitation of the Pathfinder Foundation (PF), a three-member PF delegation visited SCU recently with a view to exploring avenues for cooperation with that university. 
The PF delegation comprised Bernard Goonetilleke (Chairman), Luxman Siriwardena (Executive Director) and Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Director Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives (CILI) of the Pathfinder Foundation.  
 
Sichuan University is recognized as one of the 10 top universities in China. The university located in Chengdu, capital of the Sichuan Province, is home to approximately 16 million people.  
 
SCU maintains a strong  partnership and exchanges with universities in Europe and the US. As such, steps taken by the Pathfinder Foundation to establish relations with SCU and Sri Lankan higher education institutions are bound to bring good dividends to Sri Lankan students.  
During the visit of SCU academic team headed by Prof. Ming Hong to Sri Lanka last April, the Pathfinder Foundation engaged in discussions to determine how the university could forge close relations with Sri Lankan universities.
 
Following the discussions with the Pathfinder delegation, SCU and PF are negotiating to enter in to a MoU for joint academic programmes in association with SCU. One of the highlights of the visit was the conferment of Guest Professorship of SCU to Adm. Dr. Colombage by the President of SCU, handed over to him by Prof. Yan Shijin, Vice President of SCU. Following the award, Prof. Colombage delivered a lecture on ‘Changing Dynamics in the Indian Ocean: Geo-Strategic Competition and Dilemma of Sri Lanka’.  
During the discussion Vice President Prof. Yan Shijin had with the visiting Pathfinder team, he emphasized the importance of heightening China-Sri Lanka relations and Sri Lanka’s role in the Belt and Road Initiative of Chinese President Xi Jingping and the desire of SCU to help Sri Lankan students seeking higher education in China.
