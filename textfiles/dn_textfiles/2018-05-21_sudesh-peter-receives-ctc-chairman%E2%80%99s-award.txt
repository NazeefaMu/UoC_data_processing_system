Sudesh Peter receives  CTC Chairman’s Award

The Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) recently presented the company’s highest honour, the Chairman’s Award, on External Affairs Counsel, Sudesh Peter.
The award recognizes outstanding personal contribution to the growth and development of the company during the previous year.
Sudesh’s role at CTC involves making sure that the company is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, while ensuring that the company can operate successfully within an extremely challenging regulatory environment.
“I was able to achieve these results thanks to a collective team effort where we worked together cross-functionally, and I would like to thank my teammates for their support. I am also happy that I was able to guide the company through what can be termed as one of the most challenging periods in its history. I had to ensure that the business had visibility on the current regulatory landscape, while planning for what changes might come in the future.”
CTC Chief Executive Officer Michael Koest said, “Sudesh successfully drove two key projects during the past year that helped secure the sustainability of our business. As a responsible corporate, ensuring compliance with all existing laws and regulations is critical for success, moreover we must be ahead of the game when it comes to how the regulatory environment can change. Sudesh was successful in helping CTC to navigate through the changes, adapt and deliver significant results in 2017.”
