Child born with deformed features termed ‘alien’

Being born with rare conditions can be challenging for the survival of a child, and it only gets worse in India since the lack of awareness about medical disorders creates a situation where the infant doesn’t get the sensitive treatment that it needs, and in many cases faces trouble from society.
A similar case is being reported from Bihar’s Katihar, where a child born with thick skin and deformed features due to Harlequin Ichthyosis is being branded an ‘alien’ and also called supernatural by the locals. The child was born to 35-year-old Khalida Begum last week. She was shocked to see the small head and bulging eyes.
The child also has symptoms of Anencephaly, where the child is born without a head. The shocked mother initially refused to even nurse the child, but started nursing it after a while.
She told Daily Mail, “I was so shocked and saddened by this that I asked the midwife to take the baby out of my sight.”
Meanwhile villagers are thronging to the house to catch a glimpse of the child. Everyone is calling the child an incarnation of Lord Hanuman. This isn’t a first as several children with certain birth defects have been associated with supernatural beings due to lack of awareness.
