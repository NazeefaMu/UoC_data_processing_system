Dench hates being called a  ‘national  treasure’

Judi Dench, who has had a prolific and award-winning acting career, said she does not want to be called a ‘national treasure’.
The 82-year-old star said she despises the term and often asks people not to use it for her.
“National treasure! Oh, please don’t say that! Everyone says it, everyone. It’s horrible, it’s awful. I hate it,” said Dench.
“I’d like much more to be the ‘Notes on a Scandal’ woman than the ‘Marigold Hotel’ woman, do you know what I mean?” In the 2006 psychological thriller-drama film, Dench played an older high school teacher who has a love affair with a younger woman, whereas in ‘The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel’, she played a widowed housewife who comes to India on a holiday.
