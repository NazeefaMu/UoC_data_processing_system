Kabir queried on withdrawal of hostel facilities

The hostel facilities for second year students studying for the Higher National Diploma at Ampara Hardy Technical College have been withdrawn due to complaints of serious ragging at the institution. Accordingly, around 450 students of the 550 second year batch have been asked to leave the college hostel.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa in an additional question to Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim in Parliament on April 04, drew the latter’s attention to the matter, requesting him to take necessary steps to resolve the issue. “There are about 550 second year students who study for the Higher National Diploma at Ampara Hardy Technical College. The college has provided hostel facilities to its students for 30 or so years. Now the authority has sent the hostellers away. There are about 450 students who reside away from Ampara who are affected by this decision,” MP Jayatissa said.
Answering on behalf of Minister Hashim, Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage said that the reason for withdrawing hostel facilities for these students is the serious ragging taking place at the institution.
“Ragging at this institution has become extreme,” Deputy Minister Gamage said. “There is a large file of complaints on ragging. I met the second year students who use hostel facilities as well as those who do not. The students who use hostel facilities told me that they will not rag new students any more."
"However, the second year students who do not use hostel facilities say that it is better to withdraw the facility as the ragging will continue.”
She also said that they are looking into the possibility of using two separate buildings for the first and second year students as there is enough space available. “The first year students will be taken in by this May. So we are planning to hold discussions with the parents of these students as well. We are hoping to brief Minister Hashim after these discussions.”
