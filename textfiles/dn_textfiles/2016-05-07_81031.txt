‘Some trying to make political capital out of MR’s security issue’

If any one tries to make political capital by raising an issue over the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the government has already guaranteed his security, it cannot he condoned at all, Liberal Party Leader Dr. Newton Peiris said.
“If police personnel are deployed to replace the withdrawn Army personnel, there is no problem about security because it is crystal clear that no reduction of security has been made to the former President,” he said. Addressing a press conference at Queens Hotel, Kandy on May 5, Dr Peiris said there is no Emergency declared in the country and terrorism had been totally eradicated.
“Therefore, it was unfair on the part of the former President to ask for Army security which was denied to even the incumbent President and the Prime Minister,” he added.
“If former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had any problem with security he should discuss and settle this issue with President Maithripala Sirisena, but trying to create a violent situation over it could never be approved,”Dr. Peiris said.
The Liberal Party Leader said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been decisively defeated and rejected by the masses at the last Presidential Election and he should accept the decision taken by the people with humility.
He also said that there was a grave shortage of doctors in the country today and as such, the setting up of Private Medical Universities was no problem.
Liberal Party Vice President Dunstan de Silva, Treasurer Ratnasiri Kottage, Executive Committee member Ajith Prasanna and Tarindi Kahawita were also present on the occasion.
