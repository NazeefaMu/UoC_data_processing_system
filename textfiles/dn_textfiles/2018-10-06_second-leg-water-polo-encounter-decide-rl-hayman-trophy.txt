Royal College’s sporting gesture:
Second leg of water polo encounter to decide RL Hayman trophy

In an act of exemplary sportsmanship Royal College has decided to forfeit the result of their first leg win over S. Thomas’ College in their water polo encounter for the RL Hayman trophy played last Saturday at the Sugathadasa Sports Complex.
The Royal College principal BA Abeyratne in a letter addressed to acting warden of S. Thomas’ College Mt Lavinia Asanka S Perera has stated that “even there is no official request from the governing bodies for Royal to forfeit the points obtained in the first leg encounter, keeping up with the spirit of the game we agree to your request that the winners of the Hayman trophy to be the result of the second leg”.
The second leg is scheduled to take place at the same venue today.
Controversy rose at the end of the first leg which Royal won narrowly 9-8 when it was found after the match that they had fielded an extra player in the pool. This evidence came to light only after viewing a video play of the match.
The Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) the governing body for water sports clarifying the position states in a letter to the Royal College principal:
1) The extra player was in the pool for 1 minute and 45 seconds of the playing time. We note that the Royal College goalie who joins the team from outside the pool after the time out called by S Thomas’ team has been missed out.
2) This error has not been picked up by the referees or the officials.
“We are of the view that this was a genuine oversight by the officials and the coaching staff. According to the FINA rules SLASU should receive the protest within ½ hour after the particular match. I would also like to mention that the two referees were appointed on the request of the joint organizing committee.”
