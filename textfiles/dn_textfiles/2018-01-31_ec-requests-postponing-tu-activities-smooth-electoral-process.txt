EC requests postponing of TU activities for smooth electoral process

The Election Commission (EC) has requested that all trade unions (TUs) to put off trade union activities until February 15, to ensure that the election is carried out without disruption.
Issuing a statement to the media, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said a breakdown in services attached to the electoral process would negatively affect the people’s franchise.
Government officials who are directly involved in election activities such as government officers, principals, teachers, professionals, Government Printers, postal services, railway services, electricity providers, water board, petroleum, banking services, health services, telephone services, SLTB and other public transport services are required to carry out a successful election, he further said and added that it was also important that other services in the private and public sectors be carried out without any interruption. The Election Commission accepted that the trade unions, in these services, had the legal right to protest to win their demands from the government or any authority, but pointed out that the right of the citizenry to choose its leaders through a free and fair election, was a fundamental aspect of democracy. Hence, they requested the assistance of all parties to ensure that the electoral process functions smoothly.
