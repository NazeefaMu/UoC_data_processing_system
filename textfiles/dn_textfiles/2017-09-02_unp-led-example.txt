UNP led by example

UNP General Secretary and Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Kabir Hashim faces a delicate balance between working in a unity government while also ensuring that Party remains strong to face an inevitable election. In an interview with Daily News, Hashim stressed that the UNP has taken bold decisions to fight allegations of corruption within its own fold and will ensure that the UNP will serve the full term of the government, even in the likelihood that the SLFP chooses to withdraw from the national government.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Given that the SLFP-UNP agreement came to an end recently, there have been questions of whether the SLFP and the UNP can keep the partnership going until 2020, and given the various differences that have cropped recently, it seems doubtful. How confident are you that the two parties can stay together until 2020?
A: When the elections were over in 2015, we signed an agreement and it was signed mainly for the purpose of a national agenda. We spoke of a national agenda because since independence, this country has had many national issues which remained unresolved. This is because of the two party system which changes every five years. The UNP had 107 seats, we could have formed our own government by getting some people together; at the time we had over 15 members willing to join us. But the Prime Minister had agreed with the President that they would work on a national agenda and that we would have a national government. So we put the country before party and signed an agreement.
The UNP stands by its commitment to go through the five years with the SLFP. We have shared Cabinet positions and many other positions. But now since the agreement has lapsed, it is up to the UNP and SLFP to decide on revalidating the agreement. In our hearts, it is a question of trust and we are ready to go ahead, however difficult it is. For the UNPers it is a matter of sacrifice because we are sharing power. We have been in opposition for the last 20 years, so many UNPers would have preferred to have power to ourselves but we are willing to share. But in the event the SLFP does not want to go ahead with the agreement, we have a mandate for five years, we will think of a way to work with other forces to continue the government. That is our first responsibility and we are confident that the government will continue until 2020 whether the agreement is revalidated or not.
Q: How do you think it is faring for the UNP so far? In the last month alone you have had one UNP minister resign and another sacked? It does not look good for the UNP within Cabinet?
A: On the contrary, I think it is looking very good because the UNP took hard decisions. The UNP led by example. We spoke about a clean government, transparency and accountability. And there were only allegations made against Ravi Karunanayake, he was only a witness in the case, not even the accused. No charges against him. And despite that there was a political witch-hunt and it was a major political issue, so the party spoke to him and he agreed to step down until which time he is cleared. Which era did this ever happen? Not only in Sri Lanka but in the whole of South Asia, was there a Minister who stepped down and paved way for a transparent investigation? This is what the people have to remember, the UNP took that hard decision. And as far as Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is concerned, we stand by collective responsibility and that shows that the UNP will not even spare the most powerful of persons if they don’t stand by collective responsibility within Cabinet or within the party. They will have no mercy from the party because the party will be strict in its discipline and conduct. So we did very well in those two instances.
I would thus in return re-ask the question, in 2015, just before the election, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he apologizes because 'some of my guys were corrupt and that I should have taken action'. He himself said that in the newspapers. So he is admitting that some or most of his ministers were rogues. The same way, Mahinda Amaraweera, the present General Secretary of the UPFA, made a statement in 2014, on the eve of the elections, saying, 'why are you asking for a change? You are saying we are corrupt, but why do you want to appoint new ones will do the same. So let the old rogues be there’. He admitted that they have robbed. Two responsible people in their party have said this. Did one person step down? Or be held accountable even when they went into opposition? Some of have now come into government but did their party decide to clean up any of them? So between the two, we are the party which has had the courage to listen to the people and where mistakes have been made, the UNP is willing to correct them.
Q: So are you saying that of the two parties, you now have the moral high ground because you have taken action against those who are allegedly corrupt?
A: Not action but we have taken steps to pave the way for accountability and transparency. Since there have been accusations and counter accusations, we have asked a senior minister in our government to step down until investigations are complete. This is an unprecedented move.
Q: Speaking of the corrupt, in 2015 the UNP also promised to apprehend the corrupt and bring in clean government but since then, even backbenchers in your own party complain that little action has been taken with regard to that and they cannot face their own electorates. So do you believe that adequate action has been taken to deliver on the 2015 promises?
A: With regard to corruption, there is a lot of discontent in the country that the government has not taken steps and the UNP feels that we haven’t taken any hard steps against those who were corrupt in the previous government. It's actually in the reverse, where our own members who have not even been proven with guilt have been dealt with. But there is one thing we are grappling with; it is the question of the law of the jungle. Earlier it was such and the former Commander of the Army was dragged into prison like an animal, there was no legal basis on which they took him, no procedures followed. Are people asking us to do the same thing? We cannot do that, we have a legal process. So we allow the Police, Law and Order Ministry and Justice Ministry to follow the process but we do admit that there are bureaucratic delays. There are also allegations that there is influencing by some powerful people, there is even allegations that top officials are being bribed to stop investigations, the previous government has made so much money, that they are bribing officials. That is how the story goes, it might be true. That is why the last Cabinet meeting decided that there should be a special process to expedite these cases of rampant corruption, murder, etc…thus the suggestion to set up special High Courts to speed up this process. And there would be a special team to follow this up, but we will not go outside of the legal structure for whatever reason.
Q: But the President himself has pointed out that the two UNP Ministries of Law and Order and Justice have been slower than usual to act?
A: The President of course always has the recourse to set up of a separate unit, like that of the Bond Commission to speed it up. So instead of blaming each other, if there is any doubt that the UNP is not doing it, the President has access to doing it in an alternative way. But from our side, what we like to point out is that even if you take Nawaz Shariff, he was Prime Minister for two years before he was removed two years later. It takes time. The UNP is not willing to do witch-hunts on anybody but we also will not allow anyone to influence the Justice system and influence the course of justice. Now we are going to get tougher for sure.
Q: The 20th Amendment which has been promoted at a national level is now being increasingly rejected by the Provincial Councils. Do you think there is a gap between what national politicians want and what the Provincial Councillors are prepared to accept and take to their electorates?
A: I would say that it is a lack of understanding and lack of communication that has led to some of the Provincial Councils not taking up the vote or voting against it. It was a joint decision by the two parties, within Cabinet and outside of it. So it was very clear within the two main parties that the election should be held in one day and not spread out. Therefore we need to work out a particular system. If there is more communication with the Provincial Council members, it should get sorted out. I do admit that there hasn’t been enough communication between the two groups.
Q: But if the Provincial Councils keep rejecting it, would the government go ahead with it?
A: The Government is definitely going to engage with the Provincial Councils and discuss it with them and if there is an issue, we will look at other legal recourses.
Q: There are allegations that the 20th Amendment is a farce to postpone elections and the people are asking for elections, even Local Government elections have not been held yet?
A: As the General Secretary of the UNP, I want an election more than anyone else. I wanted an election on the day we won the General Election; to have the Local Government Elections one month after and to then immediately go for Provincial Councils. The UNP has always wanted elections and I too think that we should have elections, people want it and we have to give it to them ASAP.
Q: As we talk of elections, it seems that much of governance at present is being carried out under a cloud of election fears and promises. Many decisions are blamed to be motivated by a possible election or that many hard decisions not taken because of it?
A: All the hard decisions are being made. We are bringing in the Inland Revenue Bill and we brought the Exchange Control Bill. Hard economic decisions are being made by the Government and mainly led by the UNP. We are not going to play populist politics but at the same time we are not outright stupid. We are also looking after people. We have promised the people we will look after them as much as policy decisions. On a daily basis, when we give people jobs, welfare benefits and houses; it is part of the UNP. If you go back to the 1977 era, JR Jayewardena started giving free books, free meals and free uniforms to children, Premadasa gave Janasaviya. That is how the UNP works and people should be happy about it and election or no election; I look at it as a good thing.
Q: So you think the grassroots UNPer is satisfied with the government and if you do go for an election end of the year, it would be a positive outcome for the party?
A: To be satisfied you would have to attain Nirvana and no one has done that here. So people will always want more. That is why we are trying to grow the economy and give them more. But the people understand the current scenario the Government is working in. That we took on an economy with an unprecedented debt burden and that the highest debt repayments are coming up this year onwards with it increasing after that. People understand that we have a coalition government and we have to make decisions carefully, they understand that we don’t have full power- we don’t have Provincial and Local Governments. So people will give us time and strength to deliver better through those two institutions and then we can deliver better.
Q: Despite you saying people will understand, the Elections Commissioner recently pointed out that that there was a considerable drop in people registering to vote, especially the youth and that too mainly in the Greater Colombo area, a UNP stronghold. Does this not show that the people have lost faith in the system itself?
A: That is a question that needs to be addressed and the youth are not usually patient as those who are older. There has been a very bad impression about politicians and politics in our country and that is due to a few cases and few people. People have generalized that all politicians are corrupt and not sincere. I don’t agree with it, the majority of politicians are committed and have sacrificed their time and effort for the people. We need to change this perception by the action of good politicians. And yes this is a problem we need to grapple with. People are beginning to lose confidence in the system and politicians. That is why unconventional leaders have come up suddenly all over the world.
Q: What do you plan on doing about it?
A: The few good men in Sri Lanka will have to start working a little bit harder.
Q: The UNP has also been criticized for not letting young blood come up. Though you talk of building a second generation of leaders, we don’t necessarily see youth being given key positions? There is a lot of discontent at the bottom?
A: It is not only through position that you are recognized. When you are young, you need to make a mark on your own. The party gives you room to work and you get your positions when you keep becoming more mature and have more experience. You cannot take a young backbencher and make him a Minister or Deputy Minister- that is not how it works.
I sat in the last row of Parliament when I entered and I moved from there and it took me a long time. I was patient, I didn’t have any positions, I was never in the Working Committee, Executive Committee or any senior positions but I worked hard and subsequently over the years, I became recognized and I automatically was given the position. That is how the UNP is building the young ones, we are not going to give them positions and say now prove how good you are. You prove how good you are and you will get your position.
Q: So basically, wait for it and you will get it?
A: Not necessarily, you need to prove how good you are first. There are many young deputy ministers now. A lot of young MPs are now being groomed to be political leaders in their districts and outside. We have given them positions within the party; to lead different organisations such as youth, women, artists, non-governmental organisations, etc. they are engaging with different groups and learning. Recognition is not giving them a plump ministry or chairmanship. That is not how we do it in the UNP.
Q: That is not necessarily true, is it? Your own leader was the youngest Cabinet minister in his time. Surely he did not wait as long as you to get it?
A: As much as our leader was the youngest minister, he had to wait almost 40 years to become a strong Prime Minister, so it took him a long time and it was not an easy journey. Same way there are young deputy ministers who got that position just after 5 years in Parliament. They were lucky. I had to wait for 20 years. There are some other seniors who have waited for longer. It is a waiting game. And the UNP has recognized young people and given them work but we are in a sharing government and that is another challenge we have. We could have given more positions to young people but we have almost 35 SLFP Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers; that is a large number, so we had to deprive some of our own key members. There are senior, deserving members who could not be given ministries, so this is a tough time.
