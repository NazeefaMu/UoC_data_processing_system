Maharagama UC election petition withdrawn

A writ petition seeking a declaration that the election of 23 candidates elected to the Maharagama Urban Council under an independent group (motorcycle symbol) is invalid was yesterday withdrawn by the petitioner himself.
When the Petition came up before Court of Appeal President, Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, the Counsel appearing for the petitioner informed court that his client has decided to withdraw the petition since several respondents in the petition have already tendered their resignations. He said petitioner Chandrasena Perera hopes to file a fresh petition to overcome legal snags in the petition.
Chandrasena Perera, a registered voter in the Maharagama Urban Council area has filed this petition naming 27 persons including 23 members of the independent group, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and members of Election Commission as respondents.
Perera stated that the election of the Independent group No 2 are void since they did not have the qualification required by Section 08 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The petitioner alleged that most candidates who contested under the motorcycle symbol were not residents of Maharagama. Perera said the addresses to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatte. The petitioner is also seeking an Interim Order directing the Election Commission to produce the official nomination paper and the respective affidavits and declarations of the candidates of Independent group No.2 who contested the Local Authorities Elections held on February 10.
President’s Counsel Faiz Musthapha and counsel Amarasiri Panditharatne appeared for the petitioner.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the respondents.
