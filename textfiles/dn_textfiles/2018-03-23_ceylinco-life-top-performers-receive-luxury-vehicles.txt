Ceylinco Life top performers  receive luxury vehicles

The spearheads of Ceylinco Life’s remarkable growth in 2017 were recognised at a awards ceremony and 30th anniversary celebration at which the life insurance leader honoured 261 members of its sales and non-sales teams with 457performance awards.
Themed ‘30 years of caring’ this annual awards ceremony also celebrated the 14th successive year of Ceylinco Life’s market leadership in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry.
The highlight of the event at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre was the presentation of a luxury Mercedes Benz sedan and two Toyota Axio cars for the use of top achievers, another first in the local life insurance market. High achievers were also presented with overseas tours, certificates, medals and trophies.
Staff members, sales consultants, unit heads and branch heads from the Ceylinco Life head office and more than 250 branches in every district of the country were recognised for their contribution to the company’s outstanding results last year, with some top performers winning multiple awards.
Among those honoured were 43 members of Ceylinco Life’s sales force who qualified for the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) in 2017, one MDRT member among them who achieved Court Of Table status, and 120 sales officers inducted into the company’s own High Flyers’ Club last year. There were also three Retirement Planners Club winners.
Speaking at the event and tracing the 30-year journey of the Company, Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan recounted how Van Winfree, the former Vice President for Marketing at Metlifehelped set up the Company.
