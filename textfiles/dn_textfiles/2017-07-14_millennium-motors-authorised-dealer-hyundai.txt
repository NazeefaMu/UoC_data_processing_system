Millennium Motors  authorised dealer for Hyundai

Hyundai Lanka has appointed Millennium Motors as its authorised Colombo city dealer from July 13. This is to increase its footprint in the country and make the Hyundai brand more accessible to the public.
The Hyundai Motor Group has announced a new corporate identity for its dealerships worldwide, which has been labelled the Global Dealership Space Identity (GDSI).
The initiative aims to create a unified look at its stores worldwide. The key aspect is to redesign the interior and exterior of its dealerships more elegantly and enhance its brand image.
By the mid-1990s, Hyundai comprised over 60 subsidiary companies and was active in a diverse range of activities including automobile manufacturing, construction, chemicals, electronics, financial services, heavy industry and shipbuilding. In the same period, it had total annual revenues of around US$90 billion and over 200,000 employees.
Hyundai branded vehicles are manufactured by the Hyundai Motor Group, which owns the reputed brands Hyundai, Kia and Genesis. Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, Hyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, which is capable of producing 1.6 million units annually.
The GDSI was developed primarily for emerging markets and countries where Hyundai has lacked a facility design programme. The global design features an open, airy showroom with high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling glass topped by a bronze-coloured roof structure.
The new concept is a collaboration between Hyundai Motor Company and Delugan Meissl Associated Architects, a renowned Austrian architecture firm known for their modern and dynamic designs. The new showroom design is aimed at further strengthening its Modern Premium brand concept to improve customer service, brand experience and the overall dealership appearance for visitors.
