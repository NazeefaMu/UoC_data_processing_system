Dayasiri co-Cabinet Spokesman?

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is likely to appoint Kurunegala District SLFP parliamentarian and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara as the co-cabinet spokesman of the SLFP shortly.
A Senior Secretary of the SLFP in Kurunegala district told Daily News yesterday that the senior members of the SLFP were in agreement to appoint Jayasekera as the co-cabinet spokesman. However, President Maithripala Sirisena, as the leader of the SLFP has to ratify such an appointment to be official, he added.
He said that at the last SLFP Central Committee meeting , Ministers of the SLFP made a request to President Maithripala Sirissena over this matter.
