‘447 Luna Tower’ luxury condominium to be completed in 2020

Colombo has seen a dramatic increase in activity and development. Much of the development has been credited to the real estate sector, which has experienced significant growth in the past five years.
“As infrastructure continues to advance in the form of highways and large-scale projects like the Colombo Port City, Colombo as a destination is set to draw further investment appeal. The capacity to invest in premium real estate is increasing as the city transforms into one of the gateway cities in the South Asian region.” Commented Eraj S Rajapakse, Senior Manager Projects, Asia Capital PLC.
The Developer of luxury condominium - ‘447 Luna Tower’ - occupies a central location on Union Place, in a neighbourhood that offers any and all conveniences from designer shops and upscale restaurants to supermarkets, banks, hospitals and more.
The apartments are priced in Sri Lankan rupees (LKR), while a majority of the other noteworthy residential developments in central Colombo are priced in US dollars (USD). Investors will benefit from the greater capital appreciation of fixed LKR pricing as the US dollar appreciates and the cost of competing developments increase in LKR terms.
‘447 Luna Tower’ has been strategically positioned in the upper mid-range segment with 70% of the inventory priced below Rs. 56 Million, which places it within reach of a wide market segment.
The project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2020, is poised to be the only condominium in the heart of the city to strike a perfect balance of elegant design, luxury living and convenience of location at a competitive price.
Upon completion, 447 Luna Tower will offer the optimal combination of luxury and convenience to both home-owners and tenants.
The project has partnered with renowned architect Philip Weeraratne and his firm PWA Architects. The project consultants include Ong & Ong, Singapore an international industry leader providing unrivalled technical expertise, Arup a global giant, headquartered in Hong Kong, a company in structural engineering who has partnered with the project’s structural engineers NCD Consultants.
This is the first of many projects to be undertaken through the Asia Capital and Belluna alliance. Other projects include an ultra-luxurious 57 room villa resort in Galle, for which is under construction and scheduled to be completed in August 2018; a 300-room city hotel on Marine Drive in Colombo 3; as well as their first resort endeavor with Marriott International, to debut the Westin brand in Maldives with the “Westin Maldives, Miriandhoo Resort” entailing a 70 room capacity.
A further multi-development project in Colombo is in the planning stages. Belluna Co. Ltd., Japan’s long term plans with Asia Capital PLC reiterate the company’s confidence in Sri Lanka’s growing real estate and hospitality industries.
