Roast Paan from the Cauldron

The Cauldron introduces their exclusive roast paan breakfast range. With a twist on the traditional sandwich, this Sri Lankanized version of a typical breakfast sandwich comes packed with tastes that are familiar of home.
The roast paan sandwich range includes an eclectic mix of East meets West in a sandwich that is also the right mix of sugar and spice with its seeni sambol and cheese combination. Perfect for the vegetarians this sandwich is also for those who need a fiery start to the day. For those who need a daily dose of pol sambol, the Cauldron offers it combined with a halmasso baduma (sprats fry). For a more European flavour, there is also the egg and chilli mayonnaise. The range also includes a hearty option for the meat lovers with a kalu chicken curry, pol sambol and cheese.
Introducing the range The Cauldron Founder of Tharanga Perera said they are working to combine Sri Lankan classics and turn them into delicacies.
The greatest part about the Cauldron’s roast paan breakfast is that it isn’t limited for breakfast and can even be picked up for a brunch snack or early lunch. Add to this a cup of Lavazza coffee or a pot of tea and you have a complete meal to tuck in to at The Cauldron’s cozy interior.
