Stock of 232  T-56 ammunition recovered from reserve

A stock of 232 rusty T-56 ammunition hidden inside Parasangaswewa Reserve in Wannipalugollewa was found by Anuradhapura Police following information from a person who ventured into the reserve in search of firewood, recently.
Police said it was a stock of 7.62 ammunition believed to have been brought by LTTE terrorists for their failed attack on the Anuradhapura SLAF base in 2016. Investigations are continuing.
