MPI New Year celebrations

One of the leading film circuits in Sri Lanka, Movie Producers and Importers Pvt Limited also known as MPI Film Circuit commenced its operations for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year with celebrations with the participation of its board of directors, staff and well wishers from the industry.
Directors of MPI, Dr. Arosha Fernando, Sunil T. Fernando, N. Udayakumar and Nimal Kularatne were joined by Zihar Zuhair, Ravin De Silva, and Ishani Gamage of Dialog Axiata along with number of film directors, film promoters, and media personals wishing success for the company.
“As part of the restructure of the company which will commence shortly, we will be launching a rapid expansion program fully backed by a couple of large cooperates in the country. This will certainly help us taking our local Ccnema industry to a different height by adding many new film theaters across the country along with a comprehensive renovation program for the existing film theaters,” said one of the MPI directors, Dr. Arosha Fernando.
