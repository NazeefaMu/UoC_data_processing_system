Exam centre at IDH for dengue infected students

A special examination centre has been set up at the Infection Diseases Hospital (IDH), Angoda to allow 12 dengue infected students to sit the Ordinary Level Examination, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the 12 students suffering from dengue are sitting for the Ordinary Level Examination at the IDH under the monitoring of doctors. Dengue patients require constant monitoring to prevent possible Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome.
About 77 dengue deaths and 47,900 dengue cases had been reported this year. The Health Ministry cancelled leave of health workers attached to 30 high risk MOH divisions to face the increasing dengue threat, the sources said.
The health authorities took legal action against 616 mosquito breeders and issued notices to 2,882 premises during the recent dengue eradication programme implemented in high risk areas. The inspectors found 1,140 premises with mosquito larvae. They inspected 77,728 premises and found many private homes with mosquito larvae, the sources said.
