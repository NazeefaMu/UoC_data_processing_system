Drought relief payment from March 15: Over 100,000 families qualify for relief

Anuradhpura District Secretary R.B. Wanninayake said relief payment to drought affected families will start from March 15.
According to a survey, 124,484 families have qualified to get drought relief in the Anuradhapura district. There will be 694 work sites at the Grama Niladari divisions level for employing one member from each family.
Each member will be paid an allowance of Rs. 10,000 monthly on ''cash for work basis''. The work programme will continue for four months, Wanninayake said.
Meanwhile, nearly 4,000 families who are suffering from a scarcity of drinking water in Thirappane, Mahawilachchiya, Nochchiyagama and Padaviya are provided water through a bowsers service, the District Secretary said.
