Canada at 150

Today is a monumental day for Canadians living all over the world. Canada turns 150 today. It was on July 1, 1867 that a few provinces and territories come together to form Canada, the second biggest country in the world in terms of total area, next to Russia. The name Canada is now generally accepted as originating from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word Kanata or Canada, meaning "village" or "settlement".
Canada has a chequered history and as the origin of the very name denotes, Canada has been occupied by native people long before the Europeans set foot there in the 1600s. Starting in the late 15th century, French and British expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places in North America in what is present day Canada. In 1867, the Province of Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brusnwick and Nova Scotia through Confederation, forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new dominion expanded, finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.
Today, Canada consists of the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan. Quebec and Prince Edward Island and the territories of Northwest, Yukon and Nunavut. French-speaking Quebec held a referendum some years back on the question of independence and most Quebec residents opted to remain in the union, though there still are occasional calls for separation. Canada retains the Queen as the Head of State.
Since the Second World War, over 10 million immigrants have come to Canada and many of them have become enthusiastic Canadians. Canada is now home to people from all over the world who speak hundreds of languages including Sinhala and Tamil. Modern Canada is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural melting pot that showcases the very essence of diversity. Canada has just 36 million people, most of whom live in cities and urban centres such as Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton and Vancouver. Given the sheer size of the country, it needs more people for a diverse range of vocations. Canada thus has one of the world’s leading and fairly liberal immigration programmes.
There are around 500,000 Lankans domiciled in Canada, who enrich the socio-economic fabric of their adopted country in numerous ways. Most of them have family back home and remit funds to them. Every year, hundreds of Sri Lankan families migrate legally to Canada to the extent that almost every Sri Lankan family has a friend or relative in Canada. This is just one aspect of the close relationship between Canada and Sri Lanka which have many things in common, from the English language to the Commonwealth membership. Total two-way trade between the two countries amounts to around US$ 500 million per year and efforts are underway to raise this figure in the coming years. Sri Lanka is fast becoming a major destination for Canadian tourists. Sri Lanka and Canada, whose bilateral relationship soured somewhat over human rights concerns during the tenure of the previous Government, now enjoy robust ties following a new approach to ties with the West by the present Government.
Canada seeks to give pride of place to its First Nation peoples, having formally apologised eight years ago for the former Indian Residential Schools programme which separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities. With the recent release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Report, the Canadian Government has accepted its “failings” in the horrendous saga in which seven generations of native children were scarred by physical, emotional and sexual abuse in the schools, which often resembled violent prisons. The Government has promised a “total renewal” of the relationship between Ottawa and the indigenous people and to address the many problems that still affect them, from poverty to the lack of facilities in reservations.
Canada shares the world’s longest (virtually) unguarded land border with the United States of America. The two countries share a very close relationship. Over the course of the last 150 years, Canada has been heavily influenced socially, culturally and economically by its Superpower Southern neighbour. However, far from living under the shadow of its powerful neighbour, Canada has managed to carve its own identity on the world stage, especially after the advent of flamboyant and charismatic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Even as the USA has retreated from international obligations such as the Paris Climate Accord, Canada has stood its ground and articulated the need to fight climate change. The Canadian economy is booming too. There is no doubt that Trudeau is charting a new course for Ottawa, one which will see the country taking an even more active role in world affairs as it looks forward to the next 150 years.
Today, all Canadians in Canada and elsewhere will celebrate what Canada represents to much of the world — a nation of freedom and peace, vast natural beauty and economic opportunity. Canada is truly at a crossroads on its 150th anniversary, striving to rectify the injustices of the past and looking forward to moulding a brighter future for all its citizens.
