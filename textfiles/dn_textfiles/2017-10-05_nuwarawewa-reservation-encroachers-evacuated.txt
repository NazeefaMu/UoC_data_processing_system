Nuwarawewa Reservation encroachers evacuated

The Nuwarawewa Reservoir, the main water source supplying drinking water to Anuradhapura, is in a devastating state due to the encroachers residing in the tank reservation.
In Nuwarawewa reservation, a large number of buildings including hotels have been put up which badly affect the wellbeing of the tank. In order to save the tank, there is no other alternative than evacuating the encroachers and the buildings, Anuradhapura Divisional Irrigation Engineer P. U. K. Tilakaratne said to Daily News.
In the meantime, the farmer organizations have complained to Anuradhapura Government Agent and the District Agriculture Committee that the Encroachers Evacuating Program was showing a very slow progress. They have indicated that zonal irrigation authorities have no power to take legal action against the encroachers. The land and legal section coming under the Irrigation Director General is handling the institution of lawsuits against the offenders and hence the enforcing of law to address the encroaching menace is being carried out efficiently and promptly.
The major tanks such as Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa, Abhayawewa, Mahawilachchiya and Mahakanadarawa come under the Anuradhapura Irrigational Division. At a recent survey it has been found that there are 2,933 and 161 encroachers within Nuwarawewa and Tisawewa Tank Reservations. The number of encroachers in Abayawewa Tank Reservation is 44 and in Mahakanadarawa there are 20 encroachers. The number of encroachers stands at 57 in Mahawilachchiya Tank Reservation landscape. Three cases against the encroachers in Nuwarawewa Reservation were decided against them in courts and we have already demolished one house and two more to be evacuated. We have to continue the process through the land and legal section at Irrigation Head Office and not at the zonal level, Tilakaratne added.
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer stated further that there were sewerage systems opened to Nuwarawewa and the toilets built within the close proximity to the tank causing gradual water contamination. According to him, in some encroachment cases the encroachers were found possessing land grants and land permits which seemed to be issued illegally. There are three Jayaboomi land grants holders within the Nuwarawewa Reservation, he revealed. Tilakaratne has informed the DAC that if such lands were declared crown lands, they could be acquired at any given time.
