National Heroes Gazette signing by President, at Magul Maduwa today

The State ceremony at which President Maithripala Sirisena will sign the historic gazette notification proclaiming as National Heroes 81 ancient Sri Lankan freedom fighters who had hitherto been declared as traitors by British Colonial rulers, will take place at the historic Magul Maduwa of the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy today at 4 pm.
Following the signing of the gazette notification declaring the 81 freedom fighters as National Heroes thereby annulling the British gazette which declared them as traitors, a special ceremony will be held near the Magul Maduwa.
Director of Government Information Dr Ranga Kalansooriya said these national heroes were chosen and recommended by a Committee of Intellectuals appointed by the Justice Ministry on the directions of President Sirisena.
