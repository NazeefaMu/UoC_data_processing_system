Walk to remember

Among all living beings, only humans have the ability to walk on their hind limbs. To walk straight, a few metres or many a kilometre. A myriad actions could be performed with the feet whilst walking. To kick, to hop, to skip whether we walk forward, backward or sideways. Man can walk briskly, leisurely, with hands in his pocket, chatting, exercising, gesticulating, carrying little ones or heavy bags and at the same time to see all what’s happening all around him.
The only walker non human on its hind limbs is our tuxedo attired artic / antartic domiciled penguin. Walking on webbed feet with a wobbly gait like those who perambulate on the rubberised or concerted highway after taking on overdose of you know what. A flightless bird that walks on ice.
Of all the walks, we recall with reverence, the walks of our celestial teachers. The lovely walk on seven lotus flowers by Prince Siddhartha. The walk of Lord Jesus Christ on the waters of the Sea of Galibee. Then, the walks of our hallowed teachers on mother earth preaching. Their immortal words to all mankind. Their disciples walked amongst the multitude. The pious followers of the Buddha walked serenely looking down at their toes. Devotees walk round the Holy Kaaba in Mecca.
We walk around the sacred Bo trees in the Island. Walk up the Holy Mountain Sripada, walk up hills simulating the walk of Jesus Christ up to the summit of Calvary. Beautiful humans walk round the corridors of the temples at Trichendur, Thirupati, Kataragama and make a lovely walk up to the Relics of the Buddha in Kandy. All these walks are brought to our minds while walking down memory lane.
The walk makes a triumphant entry into the lives of humans during their short sojourn in this life, when we take our first steps on mother earth amidst smiles, tears, clapping and clicking of cameras. Then grandpa and ma take their gem for a short walk. A snail’s walk for all three.
Toddler's walk
The toddler has a walk. The grandparents too may need walkers at time. The word ‘walk’ has many suffixes and prefixes and phrases that give many a meaning. A walking tour with knapsack on your back. A mouthorgan or tiny tune producing mobile phone make walking move enjoyable then tours by air, train or road. To be with nature and fellow men. Lingering walks, recording the chatter of birds with the aid of a modern day mobile phone. We cross the road. Never run, they say. If the road is clear, walk briskly, after looking to the right and left.
We walk up to the rostrum. Walk back to the chair. Walk with ones chin up. Then the walking race with gyrating hips and buttocks hands swinging away does really look amusing. A walkover for the favourite in competitions.
A proposal, a nervous youngster walks into an unknown home. A consensus. All in captures. The lucky young man walks back on air. The wedding. The young couple walk up to the poruwa or altar with their parents. Next, the happy duo walk back into the embrace of their loved ones as husband and wife.
Memories of pre nuptial walks and songs. ‘Walking my baby back home, and “I’ll walk beside you”. Walk takes pride of place. It will linger on till the newly weds walk into a new home of their own.
Space walk
Then the slow walks with smile so love, hope and prayers for the arrival of the little angel. All walk softly up to the cot for a glimpses.
Astronauts did a space walk. Not a dash or a run. In the days of sea pirates, wrongdoers had to ‘walk the plank’. A walk that took them into the depths of the ocean. Brings memories of an award winning film, shot on location in Ceylon. ‘Elephant walk’. A mansion is built on the path taken by roaming elephants an elephants walking path is obstructed. They walk in hordes.
The mansion crumbles. The elephants walk is back for their walks. Then comes the last walk in modern times. A slow, pathetic, walk of no return by those condemned to death. They walk in tears, perhaps thinking of a beloved mothers walk to a ward to bring forth amidst tears of pain and joy a son who has now turned to sin.
Under normal circumstances, man is unable to foretell where and when his last walk will be still we cannot avoid it. I is with man. You are serene in death, in a horizontal position. Mourners walk up to the bier.
Pay their respects, walk back. Next they walk behind their silent kin or friend. Pall bearers walk on either side of the casket. A few walk carrying the silent one. At times on their shoulders. A funeral band or drummers walking in steps before the deceased. Relatives walk round the grave or the pyre. The ordained walk back to their respective places of worship. Nephews walk round the pyre carrying the lighted torches. A sad and silent crowd walk out of the cemetery.
Walk is an endearing gift given to man. Let us pray that this system of perambulation by man will be a source of relaxation and joy till the end of time.
