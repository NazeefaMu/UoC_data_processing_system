Heart, Eye surgeries
Programme to ease <U+200B>waiting lists

The Health Ministry is to implement a special programme next year to cut down waiting lists of patients who have to undergo heart and eye surgeries at state hospitals, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He attended a ceremony at the Ministry recently and said during his speech that state hospitals would peform heart surgeries after 4.00 pm and private hospitals would charge a concessionary price for surgeries.
He said private hospitals would be provided with theatre facilities at low price.
"The World Bank has provided US $ 200 million to Sri Lanka to control Non Communicable Diseases within next five years. The Government will take political decisions and the health staffs should formulate plans for the next 10 years," the Minister said.
