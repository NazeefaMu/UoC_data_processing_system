Salt harvesting begins in Hambantota saltern

Salt harvesting in the Hambantota saltern commenced after carrying out religious ceremonies recently.
Salt Corporation Chairman Ayub Khan said, they expected a bountiful harvest following favourable weather conditions experienced during this season.
The total harvest expected is nearly 62,000 metric tons of salt. He said, Bundala and Palatupana salterns too have been developed to the optimum level, while the corporation had trained its workforce and acquired new machinery required for the harvest. The corporation hoped to produce the country's total salt demand by 2020.
Development of the salterns was another victory achieved by the Yahapalana government.
