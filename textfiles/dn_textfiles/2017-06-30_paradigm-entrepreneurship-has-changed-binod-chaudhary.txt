Paradigm of entrepreneurship has changed - Binod Chaudhary

As much as making money was important to businessmen it was of paramount importance to work with the society to redistribute it back, opined Binod K. Chaudhary Chairman, CG Corp Global, Nepal speaking at the 178th AGM of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
“As businessmen, making money is important to us. But more important than that is how we work with society in giving it back. We cannot function in a vacuum. We have a big responsibility towards our society. We all need to fulfill that responsibility. Otherwise, our earning money will be useless. For many of us, making money may be easy. But it is difficult using that money wisely toward helping our societies. Let us ask ourselves do we want to be remembered as‘rich and mean businessmen’ or ‘rich and compassionate human beings’?” he queried.
Chaudhary said that Bill Gates was known as the richest man of the world. But he was equally know for running a foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that is doing so much on public health around the world.
“In India, we all know the Tatas for being one of the biggest conglomerates, but we remember them even better for their fantastic social service in the fields of cancer treatment. It gives me tremendous sense of satisfaction to share that within a period of less than six months we built 3000 transitional homes and 40 school buildings after the earthquake in Nepal,” said.
Looking back 20 years, one could see the predominance of traditional manufacturing industries. The capital-centric traditional industries such as textile, jute, sugar and steel used to rule the market. Those days have now ended, he said. The paradigm of entrepreneurship has changed. Trendy Youtubers are compelling traditional television broadcasters to rethink their survival, teenage Instagram stars are becoming case studies for marketing gurus. “To be an entrepreneur, we need two things: an innovative idea and a strong will to execute. It does not matter what citizenship or passport you carry.
The national boundaries no longer hold any relevance if your will power is strong enough, Chaudhary added.
