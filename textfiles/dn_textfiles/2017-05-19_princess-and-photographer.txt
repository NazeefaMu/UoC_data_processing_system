The Princess and the Photographer

On May 6, 1960, the sun too gave a wedding present to the couple getting married that day. He gave them clear, blue skies.
From the flagpoles along the streets of London hung white silk banners with the initials of the bride and groom entwined on red Tudor roses. There was a grandstand outside Westminster Abbey and discreetly hidden television cameras inside (it was the first royal wedding to be televised).
Among the 2,000 guests were not only the expected array of statesmen, peers, ministers, and close friends of the couple, but also the three living wives of the bridegroom’s father. Other guests included the groom’s housekeeper and the postman from his father’s village in Wales.
The bride who looked exquisite in what ‘Life’ magazine later called “the simplest royal wedding gown in history,” was Queen Elizabeth’s sister, Princess Margaret. She was 28, at the height of her beauty and charisma, poised, stylish, and groomed to perfection. Yet, often imperious - if she was bored, she showed it—at one small supper dance given in her honor, when her host asked her, “Ma’am, will you start the dancing?” she replied, “Yes—but not with you.”
As fate would have it, all this changed in the spring of 1958, when one of Margaret’s dazzled admirers asked her if she would sit for a photograph. He said he knew just the right photographer. She agreed.
The chosen photographer was Antony “Tony” Armstrong-Jones. According to ‘Vanity’ magazine Tony took charge of the sitting in his usual way. With the utmost politeness, he made her change her clothes, her jewelry, and her pose as if she were any other sitter.
Princess Margaret, accustomed to unquestioning deference, had never met anyone like him. She decided that she wanted Tony in her circle, and after a while his face could be seen among the parties of six or eight people in which the Princess went to the theater or dined out.
“Nobody knew about their relationship, there wasn’t a whisper about it, “ says Anne de Courcy, in her biography of Tony. “She would see him in secret at his studio and yes, he would join her at parties, but no one could pinpoint which man she was interested in. The press focused more on the ones who were seen to be eligible. They didn’t think of Tony who was often in the background.”
For Tony it was all overwhelming. He was used to pretty girls, from unsophisticated débutantes to models and actresses, but Margaret was something different. She was gilded with the mysterious, mythic aura of royalty. Everything around her spoke of this. For example, at every meal the Princess was served first, and no one could speak to her without first being addressed by her. In some houses, if she did not help herself to, say, potatoes, no one else could.

Unlike with her sister, Elizabeth, Tony was not Margaret’s first love. She had been linked to several beaus in the past, most notably her father’s and sister’s former equerry, Peter Townsend. After a tumultuous period of will-they-won’t-they, their relationship ended on 31 October 1955. Wishing to show the public she had moved on from Townsend, on February 26, 1960, her engagement to her new love interest, Tony the photographer, was announced. The news came as a surprise to many, and it didn’t go over well with everyone, particularly royal courtiers who would have preferred Margaret to marry a wealthy aristocrat. When Noel Coward, a fervent royalist, heard the news he wrote in his diary, “He [Tony] looks quite pretty but whether or not the marriage is entirely suitable remains to be seen.” When Lord Pembroke heard of the engagement, he exclaimed, “Then I’ll go and live in Tibet!”
But love endured, mainly because in spite of the objections, the royal family was delighted with the match. “They all liked him very much—Tony had great charm, very good manners and he knew exactly how to behave,” de Courcy explains. “He felt devotion to the royal family, to the Queen, who he admired immensely. He got on very well with Prince Charles and he adored the Queen Mother.”
On her wedding day Princess Margaret made an exquisite bride. Her dress, designed largely by Tony, though ostensibly by Norman Hartnell, had three layers of organza over tulle. The St. Cyr of Paris veil was also tulle bound. The overall effect prompted The Times to write of Margaret, “it was as though she moved in a soft white cloud.”
The simplicity of the dress allowed for some statement accessories: a diamond necklace from her grandmother Queen Mary and the large Poltimore Tiara acquired specially for her. The wedding ring was of Welsh gold—some of the gold from which the Queen’s wedding ring was made had been set aside for Margaret—her high-heeled shoes were white, and she carried a bouquet of white orchids.
Tony was a slight, elegant figure in his wedding morning coat, designed by the tailors who had made suits for him since he was an Eton schoolboy, Denman & Goddard. As he proceeded carefully down the aisle, his slight limp from his childhood bout with polio was barely noticeable.
After the wedding ceremony, as Tony, the first “commoner” to wed a king’s daughter in over 400 years, led Margaret onto the Buckingham Palace balcony, to stand there with the Queen, Prince Philip, and the royal children, the cheering rose to a crescendo.
Another fairy tale wedding had reached an end proving love knows no barriers. No mountain could be too high, no ocean too deep when it comes to sharing your life with the one you love.
