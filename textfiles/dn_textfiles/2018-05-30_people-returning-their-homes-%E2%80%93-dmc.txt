MONSOON HAVOC
People returning to their homes – DMC

The disaster situation is gradually decreasing and post-disaster management is underway. People are starting to move out of the safe zones and relief and medical officers, along with staff of the Disaster Management Centre, are helping to clean houses that were affected, stated Disaster Management Centre Deputy Director Pradeep Kodipilli.
However, he cautioned victims about going to the affected areas which are still not certified as safe. “The landslide warning still exists. The soil is still unstable in some areas which received a high rainfall. But almost all the rivers are returning to their normal levels,” Kodipilli said.
“Officials are working hard to evaluate damage to houses so that the owners could obtain insurance from government funds and grants. Relief services are also underway to the victims in the safe zones and also to the victims who are not in the safe zones. There were 75,000 affected in the safe zones on Sunday. However, now there are only 70,000. The people are moving back to their houses,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department warns the public of strong winds over both land and sea areas. Strong gusty winds up to 50-60 kmph can be expected over the western slope of the Central hills and fairly strong gusty winds up to 50 kmph can be expected in Western, Southern, North-Western and North-Central Provinces.
Several spells of light showers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Western Provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. The sea areas extending from Mannar to Batticaloa via Puttalam, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough or very rough at times, as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph. Wind speeds up to 50-60 kmph can be expected in the sea area from Mannar to Trincomalee via Kankasanturai. The naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant about the winds. The Meteorology Department forecasts that strong winds are likely to persist during the next two days.
The general public can contact the Disaster Management Centre on its hotline 177.
