Additionally, YouCompare launched its ‘YC Representative Program’ that brings together the youth of the nation by facilitating a platform for them to demonstrate their creativity and build up professional skills. These YC representatives will voluntarily engage in CSR based projects in diverse areas including Education, Community/Livelihood Development and Environment and Disaster Relief. The main focus of these community based projects is to give back to the community and stakeholders that support YouCompare so that they can in turn have a positive impact on the society at large. These representatives will personify the mission of YouCompare which is to help today’s generation empower tomorrow’s youth through the support and involvement of individuals. Individuals who register as YC representatives are offered multiple benefits including easy access to all YouCompare services along with the opportunity of honing their skills. Moreover all those who sign up with YouCompare be it a representative or not, are offered a student card that enables them to utilize discounts and other benefits at various partnered institutes and vendors.
