Colombo garbage to Karadiyana dumpsite

 
Colombo’s garbage will be channeled to the Karadiyana dumpsite, Municipal Commissioner V. K. Anura said today.
The Karadiyana dumpsite, extends to over 37 acres.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had requested the Kesbewa Court to allow them to utilize the Karadiyana dumpsite.
The Kesbewa Court had allowed for 350 metric tons of garbage per day.
These moves come in the wake of the tragedy at Meethotamulla on Friday, that has claimed 30 lives.
Thirty more are still missing and unaccounted for.
