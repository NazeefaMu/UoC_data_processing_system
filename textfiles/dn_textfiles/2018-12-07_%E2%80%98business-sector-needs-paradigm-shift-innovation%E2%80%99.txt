‘Business sector needs paradigm shift via innovation’

The European market is looking at more diversified products and this would give opportunities for Sri Lankan companies, said Deputy Ambassador of European Union, Thorsten Bargfrede.
He was speaking at the National Business Excellence Awards (NBEA) organized by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) and held at Colombo Hilton.
He said that this new shift would enable Sri Lankan companies to enter the EU with a new basket of products creating more opportunities.
He also said that he was impressed with the criteria set for NBEA awards 2018.
NCCSL President Sujeeve Samaraweera said NBEA being a structured awards scheme has become the symbol of excellence as of today for the ‘best of the best’ businesses in Sri Lanka.
“The business sector needs a paradigm shift via innovation. The final beneficiary of all our efforts is the community thus good governance should be adhered to. We have a social responsibility for ethical business behavior. Constant indulgence in CSR would create close rapport with the community,” he said.
Meanwhile Thalawakele Tea Estates PLC won the overall Excellence Gold award at the (NBEA) while Silver and Bronze awards were secured by Aitken Spence Hotels Holdings PLC and GAT Marine Services respectively.
