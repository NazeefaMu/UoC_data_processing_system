Robo-crab

A Chinese farmer has designed and built what might be the most ridiculous robot you’ve ever seen.
Fu Zhenlin, 54, who says he’s a part-time inventor, built a bizarre crab-like android and unveiled it to the world on September 12.
A video, filmed by one of his friends at his home in Heihe City in northern China, shows Fu taking the creature for a spin around his workshop. Two of his friends also have a go at ‘driving’ the robot, which appears to be jittery and relatively hard to control.
According to Fu, Robo-crab can carry any person as long as they weigh under 100kg. The eccentric farmer says he’s also built a robot dog and a robot horse.
