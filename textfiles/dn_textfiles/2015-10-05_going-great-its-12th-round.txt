Going Great on its 12th Round

The Festival of Choirs 2015 organised by the Western Music Society of Royal College took place for the 12th time to a Full House capacity on Friday October 2 at the Bishop’s College Auditorium. This event is one of the most anticipated events among the choristers of some of the big schools in Colombo.
This time the choirs from Asian International School, Visakha Vidyalaya, Elizabeth Moir School, Ladies’ College, Bishop’s College, Methodist College, Wesley College, The British School in Colombo and Royal College took to stage to give out their best in their vocal talents.
Ladies’ College began the opening act with a touch of beat boxing as their backup instruments and giving the audience an earful of Flashlight, List Thine Eye and Could You Be Loved. Each performance of theirs was well received by the audience.
Next came in the boys and girls of Elizabeth Moir School with glow wrist bands to light up the dark stage with luminous light. They gave us a medley on Footloose and getting the audience to groove in with them as some of the choristers danced to their music. Everyone loved it!
Asian International School began their performance with one of Sri Lanka’s well loved hits “Master Sir”. Dressed in a mixture of white they went on to show their dancing skills while singing Drag Me Down and Marvin Gaye.
Next up was the event organizers – Royal College – who sang a mixture of some classic hits of the ever so loved and known Billy Joel. People were singing along to all of the songs such as Piano Man and their classmates and schoolmates kept cheering them on and of course got a great applause by everyone.
The young ladies of Visakha Vidyalaya donned black dresses and sang 3 amazing power songs – Halo (Beyonce), Titanium (Sia) and Lucky (Pharell Williams).
Wesley College gave the audience ‘Living on a Prayer’ and a Rock Medley showing that nothing beats music like some good old Rock!
Methodist College sang Look at the World,
Ama Volvo and gave the audience a true Sri Lankan treat with medley of Sinhala Baila. In Sri Lanka, nothing gets your toe tapping like Baila!
The stage hosts for this big event Bishop’s College came out to give their version of ‘Just the Way You Are’ and of course give a medley of songs by one of the world’s top female artiste right now – Taylor Swift. With each school getting a great applause by their family, friends and fans the Combine Choir got together to sing Smile/I Smile and ending this event on a very high note and the National Anthem.
So now can’t wait to see what 2016 has in store by these amazing talented young artistes.
