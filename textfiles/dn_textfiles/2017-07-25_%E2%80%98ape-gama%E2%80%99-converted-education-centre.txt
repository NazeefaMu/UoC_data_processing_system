‘Ape Gama’ converted to education centre

A theme park, symbolising an ancient village of Sri Lanka, “Ape Gama” at Pinnawala, Rambukkana near the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and newly opened Pinnawala zoo has been converted as an education centre for learning. It depicts the country’s agriculture based self-sufficient lifestyle of a bygone era, and was established by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council.
Ape Gama theme park, a brainchild of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, educates visitors on the ancient lifestyles of our ancestors, including their agriculture systems, industries, culture, beliefs, water management, law, economy, interpersonal relationships and many more.
Ape Gama constructed on a four acre land near Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and zoo by the Ma-Oya river is now open to the public as an education centre for thousands of local and foreign tourists.
