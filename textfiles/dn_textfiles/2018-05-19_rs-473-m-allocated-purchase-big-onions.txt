Rs. 47.3 m allocated to purchase big onions

The government has allocated Rs 47.3 million to purchase big onions at a certified price of Rs. 80 per kilo, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Ministry plans to purchase 7,000 metric tonnes of seed onion from local farmers as a relief for them considering the difficulties faced by many farmers since they cannot get a good price for their produce. The Ministry has taken measures to provide more reliefs for the farmers who engage in big onion farming.
The Ministry has decided to provide a seed subsidy of Rs. 9,000 per an acre, an insurance cover worth Rs. 40,000 and fertiliser subsidy for the big onion farmers.
