Round II of the Mobitel Drag Championship took place at the Katukurunda Racetrack on Sunday, August 12th, 2018 and was organised in collaboration with the Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC), Drag Racing Association of Sri Lanka (DRASL) and the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
The event’s main sponsor was Mobitel and their vehicle partner is SML Frontier Automotive, sole agents of Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) in Sri Lanka. Hiran Kevitiyagala secured the title of ‘Fastest Timing of the day’ and was the winner of the Pro Drag Open, whilst Sabry Salam won the title of ‘Best Tuner’.
Mobitel Drag Championship 2018 Round II was organised to generate funds for charity, with the main benefactor being the Air Force Seva Vanitha Fund, which is a government charity organization.
The DRASL is in partnership with the Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC), the oldest motorsport club in Sri Lanka. The club was formed to bridge a gap between drag racing enthusiasts and professional racing organizers.
