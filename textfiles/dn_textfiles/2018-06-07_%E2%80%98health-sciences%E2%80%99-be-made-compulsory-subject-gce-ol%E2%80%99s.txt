‘Health Sciences’ to be made compulsory subject at GCE O/L’s

Cabinet has decided to make compulsory, the subject of ‘Health Sciences’ at the GCE Ordinary Level exams.
The Cabinet Paper on the proposal was submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
His proposal is in addition to the recommendation made by the Committee of Experts on Educational Reforms for the 2023 national syllabus.
The Minister had pointed out that annually 75 percent of the deaths in the country were as a result of Non-Communicable Diseases.
“Around 72.5 percent of the country’s population do not consume the required daily quantities of fruits and vegetables in their diet. When it came to the female population, 44 percent do not engage in any physical activity. In order to change such behaviour, it was seen as a necessity to continue Health Science education as a mandatory subject,” Minister Senaratne said.
The proposal will be implemented subject to approval of the National Education Commission. At present, Health Sciences are taught from Grade 6 until Grade 9 and is a non-compulsory subject at the O/L exam.
