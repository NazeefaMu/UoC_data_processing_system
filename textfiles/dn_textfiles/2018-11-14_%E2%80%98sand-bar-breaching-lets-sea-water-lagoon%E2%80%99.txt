‘Sand bar breaching lets sea water into lagoon’

Heavy rains in Batticaloa have prompted the public to call for breaching the sand bar, but technical officers from the Department of Irrigation, Agriculture, Kachcherai, Road Development Authority and Municipal Council said the stagnant waters should be allowed to remain for a few more days to saturate the ground.
They said the breaching of the sand bar will result in salt water entering the lagoon.
The Pillaiyarady along the Batticaloa-Kalmunai High way and the Vavunativu bridges are inundated and people are moving about with great difficulties.
The Disaster Management Center of Batticaloa provides relief for the affected in the Batticaloa District.
The OIC, Batticaloa Meteorology Department K. Sooriyakumaran says that there is a low depression developing near the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal Today (9) and advises fishermen to refrain from fishing.
