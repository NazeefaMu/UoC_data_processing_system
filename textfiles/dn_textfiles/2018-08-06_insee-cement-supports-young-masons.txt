INSEE Cement supports young masons

A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding was signed at the Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Ministry to enable 4,500 young masons in Sri Lanka to be awarded an internationally acceptable vocational accreditation.
The three parties to the MOU are the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) and INSEE Cement.
Young masons who have already received basic training under master masons will be selected from across the country for accreditation. They will be put through a brief programme of further formal training. Thereafter, those who pass a qualifying test will be made eligible to sit for NAITA’s National Vocational Qualification Framework (NVQ) Level 3 accreditation examination. Those who are successful will be awarded the NVQ Level 3 certificate, which is an internationally accepted vocational qualification.
NAITA is an organisation under the Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Ministry. This programme has been initiated by NAITA with the support of the other two institutions under the Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama’s initiative of an accelerated programme of vocational training for Sri Lankan youth.
The MOU was signed by the heads of the three institutions, in the presence of Minister Dr. Amunugama.
