Use compostable, biodegradable lunch sheets, bags - CEA

The ban of manufacturing and selling polythene will not be extended by the Central Environmental Authority from September 01 and therefore consumers should get used to alternatives after the deadline, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Waste Management Unit Director Ajith Weerasundara told Daily News Business.
According to Director Weerasundara, over 1.5 million polythene lunch sheets and two million polythene bags (popularly known as 'silisili' bags) are currently used by Sri Lankans every day.
Director Weerasundara said the ban of using polythene was strictly imposed by the Government at this juncture to stop environmental pollution reported from all parts of the country.
He said it is up to consumers who love the environment to adhere to the Government’s law and use alternative lunch sheets and bags from September 01.
When asked what the best alternatives were, he said consumers could use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which are highly environmental friendly.
He said in addition they could even use banana leaves or similar leaves and also lunch boxes which do not pollute the environment.
Meanwhile, commenting on the said plastic lunch boxes, a leading recycle plant owner in the Kalutara District, Gamini Peris said there are recycling plants in the country and plastic lunch boxes, yogurt cups or plastic drink bottles can be collected easily and recycled.
“But polythene lunch sheets and bags are added to the environment by consumers with food particles after using them and no one is interested in collecting and taking them to recycling plants, “ he said.
He said plastic items such as flower pots, shoe manufacturing materials, bags, toys, toy bats, sports gear, tyres, bags and many other ornamental items can be easily recycled and manufactured.
Packaging Materials (Pvt) Ltd Chairman/Managing Director R.D. Premasiri admired the Government’s decision of banning polythene due to environmental pollution.
He said authorities should also focus attention towards a large number of large, medium and small scale manufacturers who are engaged in the polythene manufacturing industry and they should be given a helping hand or else many ordinary employees, workers and also their families will lose their daily income .
Focusing attention towards compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets which are said to be highly environmental friendly, a polythne manufacturer in the Colombo District Rohan Peris said only few consumer in the country use compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and therefore research should be done at the Industrial Technology Institute in Sri Lanka (ITI) to check the quality of these sheets to ascertain if they are actually degradable during a short period.
