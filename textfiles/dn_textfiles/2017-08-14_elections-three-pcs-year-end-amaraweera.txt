Elections for three PCs before year end: Amaraweera

All arrangements were finalised to hold elections before the end of this year for the three provincial councils that are due to expire terms shortly, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the inaugural meeting of the SLFP Galle District Organisation held at the Hall de Galle recently.
Minister Amaraweera said elections to the three provincial councils were most likely to be held in advance than other provincial councils that were due to expire terms later.
He said most of the SLFP candidates for Provincial Council elections were selected. He requested organisers to select candidates for vacant seats and send in their names to party headquarters.
He said many organisations and election monitoring teams had requested the government to hold all local elections on a single day according to the Ward System.
“When the Cabinet approves a new bill to make this a reality, some sections accused the Government of trying to postpone elections.
“Since we earned flak for trying to execute good deed, we decided to hold elections soon according to the Preferential System,” he said.
