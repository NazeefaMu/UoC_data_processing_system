Sri Lanka wins first runner up award at Yale Chapter ISTF

Sri Lanka won the first runner up award for Best Innovative Prize for Environmental Projects in the tropics at the Yale Chapter of the International Society for Tropical Foresters (ISTF) held in New York recently.
Dr. Keerthi Mohotti, Deputy Director Research at the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka in his capacity as Chairman of the National Steering Committee of GEF (Global Environmental Facility)/SGP (Small Grants Project) /UNDP representing Sri Lanka and the project executing body was present at Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, USA to show case the environmental project demonstrated by Sri Lanka and to receive the award.
Sri Lanka is honoured to received such an award from among 25 competitive submissions around the world evaluated by an expert US panel and showcasing a technically sound and innovative environmental project conducted by rural communities.
The 2017 ISTF conference was held from January 27–28, 2017 under the theme “Tropical Forests in a Connected World: Collaborative Solutions for a Sustainable Future”. Sri Lanka and Cambodia became the top two finalists out of 25 projects rigorously evaluated by an expert US panel.
Sri Lanka’s submission was on the project ‘Promotion of Bio Gas Technology and Efficient Rubber Drying Houses to Reduce Green House Gas Emissions Associated with the Rubber Industry in the Kegalle District funded by GEF / SGP/UNDP. The project was executed by Anura Premathilaka and the team of Human and Environment Development Organization (HEDO) on the advice of the National Steering Committee of GEF/SGP.
Having evaluated the environmentally sensitive issues in the rubber production areas, technical advice and guidance were provided where several innovative operations were included for practice by selected small holder rubber communities in the Nelundeniya, Galapitamada, Mampita and Lenagala Grama Niladhari Divisions of Warakapola Divisional Secretariat in the Kegalle District.
A few model demonstrations executed in this GEF funded environmental project covered components such as (1) Conversion of conventional smoke houses using large consumption of fire wood sources to efficient rubber drying houses using locally available saw dust, an industrial waste which would have otherwise been disposed along river banks or open burning resulting in environmental degradation in view of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the rubber production process and to minimise deforestation in the surroundings and (2) Conversion of rubber affluent from smoke houses to bio gas to reduce environment pollution through the acidic waste to water streams threatening the Bandula Barb (Puntius bandula) which is a critically endangered and point endemic species found in this area reported in the National Red list.
