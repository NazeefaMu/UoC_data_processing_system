CVI easily curable in children: Dr. Ratnayake

Children who suffer from Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) can be successfully treated at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) in Colombo, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist Dr. Piyara Dilani Ratnayake attached to the LRH told the Daily News, yesterday.
According to Dr. Ratnayake, it is easy to recognize CVI and easy to treat as well if CVI is diagnosed early. Children with CVI can be treated at the LRH but they should visit the hospital with a referral from an Ophthalmologist from their nearest State hospital. Before visiting the LRH, parents should visit an Ophthalmologist in any State hospital with the child and obtain a referral.
Dr. Ratnayake said children with CVI can see but they (their brain) cannot understand what they see. However, the child's sight can become near normal through therapy and by following the correct procedures. CVI is easy to resolve in many children if it is diagnosed early, she pointed out. Treatment is a continuous process. The rehabilitation process should not be limited to therapy sessions, she added. A child suffering from CVI would already have been drawn to lights, colours and movements.
Contrasting colours such as black and white, blue and yellow etc. should be used during therapy. Patterns such as checkerboards, bull’s eyes, etc will help. Anything that has light or movements would be useful in therapy, she added.
