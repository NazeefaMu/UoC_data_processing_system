UNP begins talks on electing election reps

United National Party MPs who met yesterday morning at Sirikotha have discussed naming party representatives. The names will need to be forwarded and justified accordingly, sources said.
Deputy Minister of Transport Ashok Abeysinghe speaking to Daily News following the meeting said the Prime Minister had not attended the meeting and discussions were mostly on the elections and the way forward.
“It was decided that we need to meet district leaders and provide suitable justification on the representatives which we shall name,” he said.
“There were no questions posed on the current situation since the matters related to the elections will also need to be sorted out, regardless of the outcome on the political arena,” he said. Nearly 40 members had taken part in the meeting, which was attended by the UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim.
