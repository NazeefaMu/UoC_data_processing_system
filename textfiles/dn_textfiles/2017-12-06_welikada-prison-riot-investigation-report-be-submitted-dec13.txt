The Attorney General informed Court of Appeal today that the progress of the CID investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 will be submitted in Court on December 13. 
Senior State Counsel Manohara Jayasinghe made this remarks pursuant to a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the matter was fixed for December 13.
