WP Governor pledges to uplift peoples’ livelihood

Newly-appointed Western Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said yesterday that he would work with all concerned parties to uplift the livelihood of the people of the province.
He was sworn in as the Western Province (WP) Governor at the Provincial Governor’s office in Kollupitiya, yesterday. Addressing the gathering at the swearing in ceremony, he said he considered it a privilege to serve as the Governor of the Western Province.
"The Western Province holds one-third of the total population of the country and is also its social, economic and political centre. Regardless of the political situation in the country, I am committed to uphold the values of good governance,” he added.
He said that former Western Province Governor K. C. Logeswaran was a talented administrative official and that strove to achieve unity, equality and brotherhood among various communities living in the province.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said a special feature of the Western Province, is that there had never been conflict between the Governor, Chief Minister, provincial councillors or staff.
"We expect to facilitate the development of local farming, organic fertiliser production and waste management under the guidance of Governor Nanayakkara, who had been instrumental in commencing several such projects in the past,” he added.
