Minions hog : the limelight in Despicable Me 3

Minions might struggle to carry an entire movie (as their self-titled 2015 spin-off confirmed), but the googly-eyed little guys steal every one of their scenes in this workman-like three-quel.
And their finger-clicking, black-and-white stripes prison routine is a show-stopper. The anarchic energy of the cute yellow critters is particularly important now that the formerly despicable Gru (Steve Carell) and his fearless new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) have settled into cosy domesticity with their three girls — Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel).
In Despicable Me 3, the filmmakers introduce a long-lost twin brother to further enliven the franchise. Dru’s candy-coloured Freedonian mansion provides a welcome change of scenery for Gru after he is fired by the ferocious new head of the Anti-Villain League (AVL) for letting Despicable Me 3’s new villain, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), escape.
‘Despicable Me 3’ is will begin screening at Liberty By Scope Cinemas 3D, Savoy Premier 3D, Don Plaza – Kalutara, Excel Cinema 3D, Sky Lite 3D Malabe, Sky Lite 3D Matara and MC- Gold 3D from June 23.
