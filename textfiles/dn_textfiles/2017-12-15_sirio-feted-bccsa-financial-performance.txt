The annual event which was organized by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), Sri Lanka’s premier business chamber, applauded some of the country’s top corporates that place high importance on sustainability, ethics and governance. This year’s award ceremony was held for the 14th consecutive time and was graced by chief guest Kenichi Suganuma, the ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka while David Bent, a renowned global corporate sustainability expert, delivered the keynote address.

This is indeed a great milestone and we’re confident to thrive in similar initiatives in future,’ commented Felix A. Fernando, CEO and Director, Sirio.
