Moves to strengthen laws on money laundering

The government is focusing on dealing with deficiencies in the Companies Act No 7 of 2007 which has allowed private companies to get away with money laundering activities.
Acting Industry and Commerce Minister A. D. Champika Premadasa, submitting a Cabinet paper on Tuesday, had asked for the Act to be amended to stop the country from being used as a haven for money laundering.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) - the global policy setter on Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMACFT) - has publicly identified Sri Lanka as a country with strategic AMACFT deficiencies, placing Sri Lanka in its ‘Grey’ list of countries. An Action Plan for Sri Lanka has been introduced to be implemented within a given time frame to rectify the deficiencies highlighted, noted the Cabinet paper on the subject.
The failure to implement the actions required during the time frame will have serious negative consequences on Sri Lanka's economy and financial system, it further added.
The European Union, in its Parliamentary Sessions in February 2018, has already black-listed Sri Lanka.
One of the action items in the FATF Action Plan has been to introduce amendments to the Companies Act No 7 of 2007, on the identification of beneficial ownership.
The Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank and the Department of Registrar of Companies have drafted the amendments with the consultation of the Company Law Advisory Commission.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, on February 21, had requested to expedite all such amendments.
Thus, the Cabinet approved to amend the company law as per the amendments prepared by the Advisory Commission appointed under Section 506 (1) of the Companies Act No 7 of 2007.
