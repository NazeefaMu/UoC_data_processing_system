Proposal to exempt Health Services from VAT: Rajitha Searatne

 
A cabinet paper will be presented in order to exempt all health services from VAT, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Senaratne had instructed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe yesterday, to prepare the relevant Cabinet Paper soon in order to present it to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Minister Senaratne had taken a decision to exempt all health services from VAT after considering numerous hardships undergone by the public when VAT is added to their hospital bills when obtaining various services from private hospitals.
Several Patients' Organizations and Private Hospitals' organizations had pointed out this issue to the Minister.
