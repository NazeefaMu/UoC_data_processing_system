Tyronne enters Pin Fernando Trophy 2017 final in style

Niranjalee meets Shirani in Ladies final:
Tyronne Weerackody continued his good form overcoming the elegant young teenager Armand Flamer Caldera 2&1 on the 17th. Tyronne did well in the quarter final encounter to defeat Ranil Pathirana, Captain of the RCGC and 3 time past Winner of the Pin Fernando Trophy.
Armand had an easy passage with comfortable wins earlier, but Tyrone had his measure and it was a very good win for him. In the other semi final top seed Milinda Ratnayake, receiving 9 strokes from young star Vinod Weerasinghe, fought all the way, from being 3 down dormie playing the 16th, won the 16th and 17th to play the 18th one down, but Vinod held his nerve and won the 18th to reach the final with a 2up victory over Milinda. The final is set to be a battle of young potential star Vinodh versus the confident ‘never say die’ spirit of Tyronne Weerackody for the Pin Fernando Trophy 2017.
In the Pam Fernando Trophy semi finals, Niranjalee Amarasuriya defeated Eliane Sterchi 2up in a close match, whilst Shirani Buffin had to go down the 19th hole to snatch victory from Ruani Desinghe and enter the final. An epic battle awaits the Pam Fernando Trophy 2017 final between Niranjalee Amarasuriya and Shirani Buffin.
The two finals for the Pin and Pam Fernando trophies sponsored by UTE-CAT SOLAR, will be played today afternoon, followed by the prize giving in loving memory of the late Pin and Pam Fernando, legends of Sri Lankan golf.
