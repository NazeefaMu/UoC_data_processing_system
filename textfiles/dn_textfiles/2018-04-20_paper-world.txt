Paper world

Here is a selection of pretty paper art creations by Russian Federation-based artist and designer Margaret Scrinkl, who imagines soft and poetic miniature worlds by patiently hand-cutting colorful paper. Small leaves, blossoms and other natural elements form the basis of her work cutting all of the details by hands, sometime looking like jewelry work. “Paper is one of my favourite materials for work,” she writes on Bored Panda.
“I like to create my own tiny world using paper layers and texture. I am inspired by nature and pop culture, so I combined them and made a series of blooming social media logos. It gives me an infinite sense of spring. Cutting hundreds of plants is like meditation for me.”
And looking at her artworks is like meditation for the viewers. So sit back and enjoy the intricate, delicate, pure world of Margaret’s paper cuttings
