A wise move

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to walk the gauntlet and put paid to the accusations and innuendos made by the Joint Opposition following mention of his name in the Special Presidential Commission proceedings in regard to the alleged Central Bank Bond scam. The Premier has volunteered to present himself before the Special Presidential Commission probing the Bond issue and offer clarifications into the areas where references were made to him during the ongoing proceedings.
The PM's office, issuing a statement, said that the Premier is ready, at anytime, should the commissioners require him to respond, in view of references made to him in the public proceedings. “Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is prepared to offer clarifications at any time to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond auctions in view of references made to him during proceedings”, it stated.
If Prime Minister Wickremesinghe follows up on his intention and appears before the Commission it will be the first time that a serving Prime Minister of this country, will mount the witness stand and submit himself to the questions of the Counsel of the Commission. Not that the dock is something alien to the Premier. As Leader of the Opposition, he was summoned to give evidence before the Batalanda Commission and subjected to a virtual inquisition, in what turned out to be a media circus. It is better that the Premier silences his critics, once and for all, rather than allow his name to be bandied about freely in connection with the Bond affair, as the JO spokesmen appear to take pleasure in doing, at present.
Even his worst critics would concede that Premier Wickremesinghe is above reproach in matters of probity which has even earned for himself the sobriquet ‘Mr. Clean'. Even Chandrika, amidst a bitter Presidential Election campaign, in 1999, made no bones about this fact. It is clear that the Joint Opposition is all out to besmirch this reputation of the Premier and is today making various allegations against him based on certain references in regard to him at the Bond commission. The fact that the Premier had offered to clarify matters before the Commission and submit himself to the searching questions of the State Counsel, itself, is a clear pointer that he is on solid ground as regards propriety. Hopefully, this will put paid to the vilification campaign launched by the stalwarts of the JO, who all have corruption cases against them pending in the courts and are clearly drawing a red herring to detract from this fact by the making baseless charges against the PM.
The statement from the PM's office also says that the government was committed to investigate the allegations made against it or its employees in line with the mandate received on January 8, 2015 to restore democracy and good governance. Senior members of the UNP were told that he (PM) should have an opportunity to respond, because, his name had been mentioned during the proceedings. This, no doubt, has been pounced on by the JO as a handle with which to use against the PM. By doing so, they clearly hope to position themselves as paragons of virtue. Now, with Premier Wickremesinghe volunteering to go before the Commission, it certainly is going cause a huge dent in the JO campaign, with the government poised to wrest the initiative.
Already three senior ministers were summoned before the Commission in an unprecedented development and now the Prime Minister, no less, is about to testify. Could one have imagined a similar development under Mahinda Rajapaksa? On the contrary, daylight robbery became the norm and the high and mighty shielded from any probe. The very fact that a Presidential Commission is probing the government's own ministers, certainly, is an indication that the Sri Lanka has reached the status of a mature democracy. Every effort should be made to preserve this status and make even government leaders accountable for their acts.
The government, some may argue, had committed hara kiri by appointing such a commission where its own members are being probed. Hence, a similar commission should be appointed to investigate the financial scams of the Rajapaksa era as well, such as the Greek Bond affair and the stock market fiddling. Today the crooks in the Rajapaksa government are apparently rubbing their hands in obvious glee at the difficulty the government is placed in, of its own accord. Hence, the need to expose the deeds of the Rajapaksas. We say this because apart from a few court cases, that seem to get prolonged inexplicably, the crooks and plunderers are sitting pretty and cocking a snook at the government. The commission proceeding have also allowed pro- Rajapaksa media to go to town with the revelations, burying with it the mega scams under the Rajapaksa regime. Whatever happened to the FCID probes that were carried out with much publicity? It appears that things have lost steam, while the government continues to score own goals by allowing itself to be investigated and invite the wrath of the general public, commendable though the development is.
