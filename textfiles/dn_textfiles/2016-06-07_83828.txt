Fête de la Musique

 
Alliance Française de Colombo is once again organising Fête de la Musique (International Music Day) on July 2 from 10am to 6pm at their air conditioned auditorium No. 11, Barnes Place, Colombo 7 . Fête de la Musique was supposed to be held on June 21 but due to the prevailing situation in the country it was postponed to July 2.
This unique musical event began in France in 1982 on June 21 and now this music festival is celebrated all over the world and every year professional and amateur musicians in France take to the streets and parks on this day to celebrate the arrival of Summer after a dismal Spring. It is free of charge with thousands and thousands of people flocking to these parks and streets as performers embrace all kinds of music the whole day.
Here in Sri Lanka, this is the chance to expose one’s hidden musical talents, it is for everyone amateurs, professionals (no age limit ) singing in any language. Individuals, school bands, school music clubs, interact clubs, music groups, ballet schools/groups, dancing schools, music associations and more.
If one can sing, play any musical instrument and dance - this is the big day! Pop, Jazz, Rap , Country & Western , Disco, Rock , Baila or anything in music goes.
It’s free of charge and the organisers, Alliance Française de Colombo will provide the hall, sound systems and also the background music by the ever popular Annesley Malewana and Super Chimes (free) or one could play their own musical instrument or have their own music or group.
