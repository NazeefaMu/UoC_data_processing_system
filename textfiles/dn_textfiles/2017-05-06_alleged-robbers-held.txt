Alleged robbers held

A group of men involved in breaking into a lady doctor's house in Kahantota, Athurugiriya, were arrested by Athurugiriya Police.
After a complaint by the doctor's husband to Athurugiriya Police, the suspects were nabbed during a special search operation on Tuesday.
CCTV camera footages of close-by houses revealed the suspects had used three lorries to remove the goods in the house. Refrigerators, electric ovens, washing machines, electric cookers, gas cookers, gas cylinders and imported furniture items were among the stolen goods.
Police investigations revealed the suspects had sold the goods at bargain prices.
