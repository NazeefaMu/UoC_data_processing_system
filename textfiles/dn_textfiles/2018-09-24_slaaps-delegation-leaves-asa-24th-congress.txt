SLAAPS delegation leaves  for ASA 24th Congress

A delegation from the Sri Lanka Association of Administrative & Professional Secretaries (SLAAPS) left to Papua New Guinea for the 24th Congress of the Association of Secretaries and Administrative Professionals in Asia-Pacific (ASA).
It will be held from September 24 to 28 under the theme, ‘Administrative Dynamic – the WOW Factor’.
The ASA was founded in 1974 in Manila, Philippines and today it has 14 member countries. The SLAAPS became a member of the ASA in 1990 at the 9th Congress held in Pakistan. The Congress is held once in two years and Sri Lanka had hosted the 14th Congress in 2000 and would host it in 2020.
The Vision of the ASA is to be recognized as the apex body for Secretarial and Administrative Professional Associations in Asia Pacific and the Mission is to promote friendship, understanding and exchange ideas and experiences among the Secretarial and Administrative Professional Associations in Asia Pacific.
