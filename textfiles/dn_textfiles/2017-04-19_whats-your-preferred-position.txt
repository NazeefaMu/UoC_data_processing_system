What's your preferred position?

Besides the graceful arrangement of somersaults and twists in various positions and baranis or blind entries as landing positions, cliff diving differentiates between five basic groups: front – the diver takes off facing forwards and rotates forwards; back – the diver stands with his back to the water and rotates backwards; inward rotating dives – the body position is backwards but despite rotating backwards, the diver rotates in towards the platform, hence the name inward take-offs; reverse – the chest faces the water but the diver spins back towards the platform; and the handstand to finish it off.
The armstand can be executed from either the forward or backward direction and can include twists as well.
To spice competition up a little more, the two required dives – the ‘easier’ dives with a lower Degree of Difficulty – must be performed from different take-off positions and so are the two more difficult and complex dives with DDs of up to 6.3. These are also called optionals. “It can be tough when you start looking at the groups and what dives you have to do to fulfil certain needs. Obviously you want to be comfortable with your optionals, so the harder ones where you do more somersaults and twists. You definitely want to be comfortable in those two groups and then you kind of just have to play with the voluntary dives and get some versatility and figure out what works for you,” explains America’s Steven LoBue, the owner of the only ‘quint half’ in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.
It has a lot to do with personal preference and strengths as a diver as to how that manifests itself in a cliff diving career. While 29-year-old LoBue is the master of rotational dives with his front five somersaults pike, Blake Aldridge and David Colturi, for example, are extremely good twisters. They feel the twist, they know where everything is. And certainly, there are dive groups, which are more difficult - handstands, for example. “Orlando Duque can’t do a handstand very well, he has a lot of problems with his wrists. Some others, like Russia’s Artem Silchenko, are so stable and solid, so he prefers to do that.
And also when you do a handstand you get a little bit more Degree of Difficulty, so that’s the incentive to actually dive from your hands,” describes Joey Zuber, the cliff diving expert. When there’s a preferred position, like in the case of the American LoBue, who favours forward dives as he enjoys looking at the water and getting a chance to appreciate the surroundings and the venue, there’s also a position you try to avoid, as four-time World Series champion Gary Hunt says: “I have much more difficulty doing reverse take-offs, because I broke my leg and sprained my ankle when I was 16 and my ankle really tightened up and so when I bend my leg at the end of the platform, I can’t bend so far down. I have to lift one of my heels up when I’m facing forwards. That makes it hard for me to stay at a decent distance away from the board; so that’s definitely one of the groups I’d avoid doing.”
The main reason why this rule of different diving positions was introduced to the World Series was to encourage the athletes to acquire a more versatile diving programme and that plays into Blake Aldridge’s hands. The former Olympian from England thinks he’s lucky because “I’ve such a great technical background with my diving from such a young age, there’s not really any position that I can’t do. I certainly do prefer the multiple twist dives than the somersault dives, but that’s just good for me that a little bit of somersault and a lot of twist is the highest Degree of Difficulty at the moment and so I am happy with the way the rules are.”
Preferring front to back, inward to reverse or handstand, and being good at it, should not prevent you from strengthening other positions. Everything that puts you out of your comfort zone makes you a well-rounded diver. If you only stick to one group, you’d not be furthering the sport, you’d not be improving your diving.
