Godfrey Evans, the chunky wicket-keeper of Kent and England

Rewinding my memory back to the 1950s, Godfrey Evans comes to my mind as a keeper who was enthusiastic, full of energy and one who could rev up the flagging spirits of his team mates even when the chips have hit rock bottom.
As an ardent cricket fan, enthusiast and an analyst, I am disgusted at the way some of our boys are playing the game in India. I wonder whether a person like Godfrey Evans could work a miracle to turn things around.
We have had two captains in the recent past - one a little bit on the timid side and the other looks like a rock star on stage dancing to a different tune! The only redeeming factor of the 2nd T20 was when Upul Tharanga and Kusal Perera was going great guns. Where Tharanga was mastering the Indian bowlers with a clinical eye, cross-batting and lifting the Indian bowlers at 45 degrees angle hitting the sweet spot time and time again to get the maximum purchase, Kusal was somewhat in his prime (well-muscled, beautifully proportioned, with a low centre of gravity helping him to execute his shots square of the wicket on either side with ease since he could balance himself well even with one leg).
A replica of Sanath Jayasuriya, butchering the Indian bowlers even at angles nearly parallel to the ground and hitting sixes at will in this period of play.
The partial Indian crowds, the players and of course the commentators were dumb struck for a while, but then the rot set in, wickets fell like nine pins and the funeral rites were performed in double quick time. In this festive season one hopes not one god but all the other gods put together must find a solution.
Hathurusingha is waiting in the wings, will ‘Hathuru’ has all the ‘mithuros’ on his side to enjoy a grand Christmas lunch, or would it be over spiced one wonders, the best will be for Hathuru to have his own recipe.
Godfrey Evans’ indefatigable spirit and skill behind the stumps were his greatest contributions to English cricket, especially in the golden years of cricket of the 1950s, states Ronald Perry in his book “Bradman’s Best Ashes Teams”.
He goes on to state that no matter whether opposition was 8 for 80 or two for 400, Evans’ enthusiasm and drive lifted English spirits like no other. It was his personality as much as his diving for miraculous leg side catches or brilliant stumpings that made him such an important part of a winning team.Spectators loved him too, his theatrics smiles and boundless energy made him worth watching. He loved his cricket and it loved him. His batting too had a certain attraction and was never dull except for the odd occasion when he had to play defensively for the team.
’Keepers have always been characters, but most likely to go about their business unobtrusively. Evans was too fun loving and extroverted not to be noticed at every chance. And there were plenty of opportunities in his position on the field. If he kept to the menacing spin of Jim Laker and Tony lock, his very presence was intimidating to batsman, who knew that the merest slip forward of the crease would invite swift dismissal. Evans would affect an exaggerated twist of his broad shoulders and upper body towards the square leg umpire.
The gloves would be swept and the pose would be held until the umpire either agreed with the appeal or turned it down. Evans was daring too. He often kept up to the stumps to medium pacers, which took both lightning reflexes and courage.
The stocky and muscular Evans (5 ft 9 ins; 74 kg) loved being up at the stumps, not the least reason being his ability to dive forward of the wicket for a catch or to stop a run. Yet he was equally adept at standing back to Frank Tyson when he bowled faster than any one ever had in Australia.
Perry stated that young Godfrey was brought up in Kent at the family’s property Lord’s, Sheldwich, near Faversham, the 100 acre farm of his once rich stock broker grandfather. Evans’ mother died when he was three. His father an Electrical Engineer was often abroad. Evans boarded at Kent College from eight to sixteen and at 14 made a quick fire 101 not out for his school in an evening match against choir school Canterbury.
It was his good fortune that the game was witnessed by a member of the Kent county staff at the Lawrence ground Canterbury. It led to his own appointment on the staff at Kent at the beginning of the 1937 season.
He decided to become a keeper like his hero, Les Ames who was also at Kent, along with another, Frank Wooley. The ground became Evans’ cricket headquarters for the next 22 years, concluded Perry.
