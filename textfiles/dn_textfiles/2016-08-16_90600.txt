Northern Provincial Council Deputy Chairman Jeganathan has criticised the party leadership for the appointment of lost contestant Shanthi Sri Skandarajah as a national list Parliamentarian.
He has said the party members’ view was that Prof. Siththampalam was the fitting person for the seat.
However, Sampanthan had reprimanded Jeganathan and forced him to sit.
Jeganathan had thrown the microphone at Sampanthan on this occasion.
