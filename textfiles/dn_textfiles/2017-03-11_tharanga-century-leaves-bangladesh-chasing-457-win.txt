Tharanga century  leaves Bangladesh chasing 457 for win

GALLE: Upul Tharanga scored his first Test century at home in 24 attempts as Sri Lanka set Bangladesh a daunting target of 457 to chase in a minimum of 125 overs to win the first Test played at the Galle Cricket Stadium.
By the close of the fourth day brought forward by 11 overs due to bad light Bangladesh had made a positive start scoring 67 without loss with Soumya Sarkar setting the pace for his team by scoring his second half-century of the match – an unbeaten 53 off 47 balls with six fours and a six. Tamim Iqbal his partner played a passive role and was 13 not out.
With the loss of 38 overs on the third day due to rain and a further 11 yesterday a total of 49 overs have been lost in the past two days due to inclement weather conditions.
Tharanga whose appearances in Test cricket has been few and far between since making his debut in 2005 had made hundreds only in Bangladesh and Zimbabwe before yesterday’s innings of 115 off 171 balls that saw Sri Lanka declare their second innings closed after tea at 274-6. Tharanga was involved in half-century partnerships for the first three wickets with Dimuth Karunaratne (32), Kusal Mendis (19) and Dinesh Chandimal (50 n.o.).
The flat Galle surface proved an ideal platform for Tharanga to make up for his cheap dismissal in the first innings when he was dismissed for four. He played an unblemished innings that lasted for 225 minutes during which time he found the boundary on 11 occasions and twice over it.
Chandimal also compensated for his poor dismissal in the first innings by completing an unbeaten half-century off 75 balls riding on the dropped chance he offered at 11 to Sarkar at slip off Mehedi. Bangladesh require a further 390 runs and Sri Lanka ten wickets off a minimum of 98 overs going into the fifth and final day today.
