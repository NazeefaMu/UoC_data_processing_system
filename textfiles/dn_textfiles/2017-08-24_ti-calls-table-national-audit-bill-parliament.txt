TI calls to table National Audit Bill in Parliament

The anti-corruption organization, Transparency International Sri Lanka, said on Tuesday that the current draft of the National Audit Bill should be tabled in Parliament immediately.
“This is focused on driving personal accountability in public finance,” Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said at a press conference in Colombo.
“Many of the things that we have recently seen have illustrated that the public’s trust in public finance is at an incredible low.”
Obeyesekere said Transparency International had seen the draft of the bill, and believed it upheld the best international practices in public financing.
Contrary to some reports, the current bill would allow the Auditor General to impose personal financial responsibility, or surcharges, on people who have committed fraud or corruption in their public roles, he said.
“Our State entities are completely incurred into our entire economy, so sorting out public finance is essential, and this ability to surcharge is crucial,” he said.
Obeyesekere also said the proposed law would allow the Auditor General to examine bank accounts, and create an independent budgeting mechanism designed to safeguard the National Audit Office’s independence.
The National Audit Bill was initially proposed by Cabinet in 2015, and has been repeatedly deferred. It was a key pledge of President Maithripala Sirisena’s 100-day manifesto.
“There is speculation that the current draft could be scrapped and re-written, stripping it many of its powers,” Obeyesekere said.
Although there are some issues in the bill that Transparency International believes should be addressed, such as amending the appeals procedure to remove conflicts of interest, “the bill can be tabled in Parliament and (these changes) can be made,” he said.
