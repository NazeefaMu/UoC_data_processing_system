UNP boycotts Attangalla PS meeting

The Attangalla Pradeshiya Sabha’s UNP members boycotted the Sabha’s monthly meeting on Tuesday in protest against the removal of cutouts of UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa in Nittambuwa town by the Attangalla Pradeshiya Sabha.
SLFP member Anuradha Gunathilake said every political party should have the right to carry out its propaganda campaign without hindrance. “We are bound by the law of the land. It is undemocratic to destroy cutouts like this,” he said.
PS Chairman Priyantha Pushpakumara said all cutouts, posters and flags in Nittambuwa town were removed under the Sabha’s project to keep the town clean and tidy.
