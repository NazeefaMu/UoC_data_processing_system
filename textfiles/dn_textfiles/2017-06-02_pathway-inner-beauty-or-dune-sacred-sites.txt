Pathway to inner beauty or Dune sacred sites

Juliet Coombe believesMuhudu Maha Vihara in centuries gone by was a popular pilgrim route to Anuradhpura from Magam via Pottuvil, which over time vanished into the dunes.
It is only 9am and already the sand is scorching hot underfoot as we join Buddhist pilgrims at Muhudu Maha Vihara to see the approximately 2300-year-old temple complex. The magnificent ruins are hidden inside the dunes and are one of only two historic Buddhist religious historic sites on this eastern seashore, which is known as Sri Lanka’s surf capital.
The temple complex is 3.5 km beyond Pottuvil, on the A4 Road where goats scamper, surfers surf at dawn and finally the houses are replaced by yellow sand dunes, which appear like giant rocks scattered along the coastline. These dunes today are seen as key to protecting the land from progressive sea encroachment and hold a great deal of Buddhist history and many other secrets just waiting to be dug up.
The landmark
On arrival it is important to cover your shoulders and leave the shoes at the entrance, even the umbrellas used to shade you from the sun should be left behind. Muhudu Maha Vihara according to the small booklet at the entrance dates back to the reign of King Mahanaga, who built this temple in the 8th Century.
The King Kavantissa sacrificed his only daughter Vihara Maha Devi to the sea to avert a catastrophe in the area and it is said that a boat was buried in the temple grounds. The king’s daughter was later washed ashore near the East coast, where Muhudu Maha Vihara stands today. Other stories say she went to Kirinda and where ever she went the importance of these ruins remained.
Resident temple’s Buddhist monk Udlamatta Ratnapriya is happy to tell you about this historical site in the shade of the trees near where the pilgrims hang lucky wishes and make prayers daily. Some say this series of temple columns is near where the Queen bathed in sandalwood and this is where she also kept her royal jewellery. The monk feels this is just one of the reasons why so many pilgrims leave a special message hoping it will be granted as the place has a magical feel about it.
Its dagoba is the landmark when searching for the royal statues half buried amidst the ruins and sand it is currently being rebuilt and in front of it recent discoveries of more temple complex have been made since a stone was laid in 2013. The 28th King according to the ‘Mahavansa’ King Maha Naga built this Mudu temple for the memory of King Kavantissa and his Queen Vihara Maha Devi.
To its west are the remains of a pillared structure where the torso of a Buddha statue was found and later restored by the Department of Archaeology. The seashore covers much of the site where the dagoba lies, yet to be excavated and some bits that are now showing are due to the 2004 tsunami waters bringing them out and the wind that moves sand revealing and hiding new ruins. Several stone pillars and broken bricks are visible from nearby. When this was uncovered, there emerged two beautiful life-size stone statues of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara.

An archaeological reserve
This sacred spot is lit at night and would make a wonderful evening trip when it’s cooler underfoot from the burning sand. Ideally just before sun set to enjoy the sparkling statues made of local crystal stone like granite that can be picked out in the sun light revealing the brilliance of the islands mastercraftman ship taking the form of a life size statues of the King and the Queen Vihara Maha Devi standing in front of the Buddha statue making it one of the great temple settings after sunset one can feel the mystery of this historic site.
The survey plan of the temple shows that the Muhudu Maha Vihara possessed 264 acres of land on the coastal strip a one time. A government gazette notification issued in 1965 states that the temple had been given 30 acres of land and is protected as an archaeological reserve. Unfortunately, the temple today now has only three acres as villagers have acquired the rest of the land, where many other interesting artifacts may yet be discovered.
Just 10 km away from Muhudu Maha Vihare in Pottuvil into the land in Lahugala National Park, and next door to it is another temple called Magul Maha Vihara with a number of ruins including a stone carved wedding platform (Magul Poruwa) believed to be used by King Kavantissa and Queen Vihara Maha Devi who it is said were married at this site and the most spectacular moonstone of man riding an elephant that can be found under the roots of an old Banyan tree at the main entrance.
The sand dunes absorb the merciless sunrays during the scorching midday heat, and attempting to tread on the dunes is akin to walking on red-hot embers and so it is important to see both sites either early or late in the day. Also take someone who knows the places and tell you more about the places like the resident monks, or village elder whose knowledge of this temple in the dunes is fascinating and passion even on the hottest of days inspiring.
