IPM President Prof. Ajantha keynote speaker  at BSHRM Conference, Dhaka

IPM Sri Lanka President, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri has been invited to address the sixth MetLife International Human Resource Conference 2017 organized by the Bangladesh Society for Human Resource Management (BSHRM) as a keynote speaker.
The Conference, themed “Exchange to Change” will be held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Center (BICC), Dhaka, Bangladesh on March 3, 2017.
Prof. Ajantha will be accompanied by a team of four delegates representing IPM Sri Lanka who will participate in the conference and thereafter engage in a Foreign Delegate Exchange Programme.
The Foreign Delegate Exchange Programme is a result of the Memorandum of Understanding between IPM Sri Lanka and BSHRM inked for the co-operation in HR related matters and facilitation of bilateral learning programmes between the two institutions for the mutual uplifting of HR knowledge and experiences.
“Being invited as a keynote speaker at the sixth MetLife HR Conference organized by BSHRM indeed an honor. The conference as well as the Exchange Programme will no doubt be of immense value and a great opportunity to enhance and exchange our knowledge and understanding of human resource management. We look forward to the interactions with our contemporaries,” said Prof. Ajantha, President, IPM Sri Lanka.
Prof. Ajantha keynote address at the conference will be on the topic “Driving Change: The Role of the HR Profession”. While many delegates from Sri Lanka have been invited by BSHRM as panelists in previous years, this is the first time that a keynote speaker from Sri Lanka has been invited to address the conference which is a clear reflection of the high esteem and recognition that IPM Sri Lanka and the HR professionals enjoy in the region.
“The Conference, interestingly themed as “Exchange to Change”, and the Exchange Programme will be an interesting platform to understand the practical developments taking place in managing and motivating people at work. It is also an excellent opportunity to develop and grow our networks with the HR fraternity of our neighboring countries for mutual benefit,” he added.
“We are happy that a delegation of HR professionals representing Sri Lanka and IPM are participating at the National HR Conference in Bangladesh this year too. We are confident that the delegation will be able to exchange much knowledge and insights on HR during the Conference and discussions with their Bangladeshi contemporaries,” said Immediate Past President and Chairman of the External Affairs Committee of IPM Sri Lanka.
The IPM delegation to the conference will consist of Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri, Col. Saman Jayawickrama, (Council Member, IPM Sri Lanka), Leader of the Exchange Programme Delegation, Priyal Perera, (Fellow Member, IPM Sri Lanka), Lnt Commander Nilan Krishantha Miranda, (Associate Member, IPM Sri Lanka) and Prof. Prasadini Gamage, Consultant for Academic Affairs, IPM Sri Lanka.
