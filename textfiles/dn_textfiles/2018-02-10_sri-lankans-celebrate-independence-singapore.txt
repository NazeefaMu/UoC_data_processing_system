Sri Lankans celebrate  Independence in Singapore

The Sri Lankan High Commission in Singapore celebrated the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka’s Independence at the High Commissioner’s Official Residence on February 4, with a large gathering of the Sri Lankan community in Singapore.
The event commenced with the hoisting of the National Flag and the singing of the National Anthem in both Sinhala and Tamil, followed by two minutes’ silence in remembrance of all who sacrificed their lives for the country and the victims of conflicts.
The traditional oil lamp was lit by the High Commissioner, representatives from various Sri Lankan organizations/associations based in Singapore, and the Sri Lankan migrant workers. Multi-faith religious observances were also conducted invoking blessings on the country and the people of Sri Lanka.
Addressing the gathering, High Commissioner Nimal Weeraratne said the steadfast efforts of the Government have fostered an atmosphere for all Sri Lankans to celebrate this milestone occasion as one nation, while fondly remembering the country’s forefathers for their sacrifices to achieve Independence as a united force rising above ethnic differences.
The High Commissioner urged Sri Lankans of all ethnicities to build linkages with Singapore friends to bring home the best it has to offer for the benefit of the motherland. The National Day Messages of the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were read out to the gathering.
High Commissioner Nimal Weeraratne noted that the people of Sri Lanka celebrate the 70th Anniversary of Independence with a sense of confidence, pride and renewed hope for the betterment of their future.
