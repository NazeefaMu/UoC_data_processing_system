Weapons at Mt. Lavina Courts: Main suspect arrested

The main suspect wanted in connection with the detection of weapons at the Mount Lavinia Courts recently, Rangana alias Maiya has been arrested by the Police.
The investigations into the detection of weapons have revealed that the firearms smuggled into the court premises were to be used to assassinate an underworld leader who was slated to attend a hearing in the courts.Proceedings at the Mount Lavinia Courts were suspended last Wednesday after the Police in a special search operation discovered a pistol with 4 live rounds and a revolver with 6 rounds hidden in a bag inside the court premises.
Twenty suspects were arrested in connection with the weapons detection later and were remanded in connection with the incident.
The Police have tightened security, especially in court premises, following the recent attack on a prison bus in Kalutara that killed five prisoners including a gang leader and two prison guards.
