Hi-tech ballistic image analyser to help crime scene investigations

The Government Analyst's Department plans to purchase an automated ballistic image analyser which will help speed up the hearing of firearm-related criminal cases, said Government Analyst's Department Director General A Welianga.
The automated ballistic image analyser is the most modern automatic microscope available in the world, he said. It can provide scientific data about firearms and spent cartridges found at a crime scene. It also simplifies the process of maintaining a computerised data bank of such findings.
He said the department recently purchased a modern analyser which helps to identify the cause of a fire and ascertain if it was due to natural causes or was an act of arson.
