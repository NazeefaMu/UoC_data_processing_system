A facelift for Meethotamulla

The Socialist Youth Front - the Youth wing of the JVP - conducted a creative public awareness campaign on the theme ‘Meethotamulla garbage mountain landslide and its political implications’ at three major Colombo city hubs on April 24 afternoon. These were opposite the Fort Railway Station, Borella Junction Pedestrian Crossing and opposite the Bambalapitiya Flats. Environment-friendly youth, students of the College of Fine Arts and members of the Socialist Youth Front participated.
