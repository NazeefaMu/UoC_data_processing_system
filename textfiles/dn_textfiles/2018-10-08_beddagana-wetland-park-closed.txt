Beddagana Wetland Park closed

The Beddagana Wetland Park has been temporarily closed to the public due to the prevailing inclement weather.
This decision has been taken as a precautionary measure since a drastic rise in the water level is expected due to heavy rains forecast in the next two days by the Meteorology Department, the Urban Development Authority said in a statement yesterday.
The statement which warned the public against visiting the park, added that it would be re-opened once the rains subside.
