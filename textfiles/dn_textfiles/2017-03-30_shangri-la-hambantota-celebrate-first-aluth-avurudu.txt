Shangri-La Hambantota to celebrate first Aluth Avurudu

Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa is geared to celebrate its first Avurudu season in Sri Lanka with a number of special culinary experiences and festive activities.
Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort & Spa will transform its artisan village into a typical village Avurudu market, or ‘AvuruduPola’ on April 13 and 14.
The grounds will feature peddlers with clay pots, brassware, wood carvings, paintings, ornamental fish and plants, and cane ware. In addition, there will be food stalls with traditional ‘kevili'. The Pola will also have a ‘Kopi Kade‚’ set up to serve village style coffee to shoppers.
In keeping with the April festivities, Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort & Spa will offer guests a traditional Aluth Avurudu lunch at its Bojunhala restaurant and authentic sweetmeats or ‘k evilimesaya’ including kavum, kokis, kaludodol, and even achcharu and tropical fruits at its Gimanhala restaurant in the evening.
For those who want a change from the traditional fare, the resort's signature SERA restaurant will host a Spice of Asia brunch buffet featuring dishes such as sushi and sashimi, lobster rendang with coconut rice, wok sizzling prawns, vietnamese vegetarian pho and a selection of delicious desserts like pandan cake and lapis surabaya.
The highlight on both days will be the Avurudu games conducted by the staff of Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort & Spa. Celebrations call for traditional village style games, which include kottapora, kamba adeema, sack race, kanaa mutti bindeema as well as rabangaseema.
During the two-day celebration, Shangri-La's CHI Ayurveda Spa will offer 30 minute complimentary head andscalp or foot massages for guests that book a 90 minute Pizhichil Ayurvedic therapy, that combines rich oil massage with a special heat treatment that stimulates the senses through a coconut spices body scrub.
Entire families can be assured of a warm welcome with a range of services catered to each family member. For example, the Cool Zone will be open on both days and will feature plenty of activities like a 7m high trapeze, painting workshop, magic show, outdoor movie, outdoor water park, children's’ pool and childcare facilities to keep younger guests happy throughout the celebrations.
