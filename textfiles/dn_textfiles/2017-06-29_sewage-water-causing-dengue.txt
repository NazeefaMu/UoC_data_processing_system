Sewage water causing dengue

The residents of the Nintavur Divisional Secretariat area were advised not to let sewage water out to nearby drainages and keep them clean to avoid the spread of mosquitoes, said Nintavur Medical Officer of Health A. Thasleema.
Thasleema said a group of PHI officers visited several houses in the area to inspect whether residents let sewage water out properly.
“The drainages near residences become mosquito breeding places and spread dengue. Sewage water produces a bad odour and pollutes the environment. People living nearby breathe polluted air which causes disease,” Thasleema said.
Legal action will be taken against perpetrators,” Thasleema said.
