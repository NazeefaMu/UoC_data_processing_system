SME sector welcomes GSP+

Sri Lanka’s Small and Medium Apparel sector praised the Government’s achievement of receiving the much needed GSP Plus concession to Sri Lanka.
Speaking at the AGM of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Exporters held in Colombo, SME President Bandula Fernando highlighted the long overdue GSP Plus and thanked the Government for their endeavour of getting this benefit to improve the Sri Lankan economy. He said this GSP Plus benefit will not only help the garments sector but also many other sectors where large number of Sri Lankans are employed.
MAS Deputy Chairman Sharad Amalean was also present on the occasion to strengthen the country’s Small and Medium Apparel sector representatives.
He also welcomed the much needed GSP Plus as it will immensely help to swell the country’s economy.
