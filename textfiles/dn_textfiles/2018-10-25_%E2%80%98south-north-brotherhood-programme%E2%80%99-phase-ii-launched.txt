‘South to North Brotherhood Programme’ Phase II launched

Old Anandians launched Phase II of their ‘South to North Brotherhood Programme’ between October 17 and 20, under the patronage of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, who is also an old Anandian.
Under the project, 38 students, nine teachers and six parents of Alvai Ambal Vidyalayam in Point Pedro left for Kataragama on October 17 with the aid of the Army Supply and Transport Directorate and the Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Regiment.
The group was received at the Colombo Fort Railway Station by old Anandians and the army.
They were then provided with the necessary accommodations and meals.
A special tea arrangement and breakfast was also held for them at the SLEME Regimental Centre before they left for Colombo.
The 4 Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment and Vijayabahu Infantry Regimental Headquarters were also instrumental in providing the necessary support for the journey.
