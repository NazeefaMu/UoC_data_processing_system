French connections

“What we want, is that when you hear the word ‘French’, the first thing that will come to mind is ‘Alliance Francaise de Kandy’, says the ambitious director of the Kandy branch, Mickael Lenglet. This year is the 50th anniversary of the institute and the work that they have been doing to promote the French culture it truly commendable. Daily News speaks to Michael Lenglet on the rise of Alliance Francaise De Kandy.
“In Kandy, this year, there will be the traditional French Film Festival organized by Francophone Embassies in Sri Lanka and the Alliance Française. But there is also Lab Citoyen, a competition to win a trip to France. We decided to organize a school contest which is organized by the Alliance Française Kandy and St Anthony’s Girls College. The Plume d’Or where students of the Alliance Française can, once again, try to win a trip to Paris.
To celebrate this important anniversary, we came up with an ambitious idea: to organize 50 events! There will be the gala dinner on May 27 in presence of Mr. Jean-Marin SCHUH, Ambassador of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. And we are planning events to celebrate the music festival in June. There will be more competitions, exhibitions and festivals. Some of them are still in preparation,” explained Lenglet.
Every year, on March 20 the International Day of Francophonie is celebrated. This is a huge event for many reasons. The International Organization of the Francophonie is gathering 84 countries who all value the French language, whether it is their national language, official language, teaching language or just because they cherish the values defended by the organization. It is estimated that there is now over 274 million speakers of French over the world.
Week of the Francophonie
“In many countries, they organize the week of the Francophonie, and even sometimes the month of the Francophonie! And of course, all these events are organized by the French embassies in partnership with the Alliance Française network. We are very proud to say it’s been 50 years since Alliance Française was created in Kandy. 50 years that we promote French language and organize cultural events. Because, that is the mission of an Alliance Française – to create a bond between France (and Francophone cultures) and the host country. We are 90 percent self-financed,” said Lenglet.
What people usually don’t know is what Alliance Française is.
“First we are a Sri Lankan Association. We work closely with the French Embassy, but we are not dependent on France. As every Association, we have members and we also have an Executive Committee composed of local people who accept to fulfill the position on a voluntary basis. Second point, we are a non-profit institution, which means that the money we are receiving through our activities are used to offer better services – better facilities and assets, better teaching quality, more cultural activities,” pointed out Lenglet.
The aim is to promote French culture, as well as to provide a space for intercultural exchanges between Sri Lanka and the cultures of the French-speaking world.
“A teacher at the Alliance Française, has pioneered pedagogical methods that take into account the mother tongue and the learning style of all of its students. Alliance teaching methods combine a classic approach to language acquisition and an open-mindedness to new modes of communication. The Alliance is adopting new technologies and has created partnerships and has diversified our course offering. The Alliance’s recognition by the French Education Ministry as well as by European organizations speaks volumes about the Alliance’s leadership in the field,” elucidated Lenglet
The Alliance’s pedagogical mission is inextricably linked to its commitment to culture. Hence, the Alliances have forged their identities by meshing French language and French artistic creation with a wonderfully diverse student body. In short, a language truly lives when it is shared.
“At the moment, French is still considered by young learners as a subject for the A-Level. But it is so much more than that. Speaking French is a formidable asset for their future: to study or work abroad or to add strong professional skills. We are currently reviewing our courses and we are very happy to say that we will be offering French classes for Tourism, where professionals will have the opportunity to learn French to communicate with French tourists because a lot of French people don’t speak English,” shared Lenglet.
The institute are also reviewing their O-Level and A-Level programs which should be ready for next June.
“Since I arrived, I realized that there was a strong competition in French teaching in Kandy. However, I also realized that there are a lot of fake courses organized by people who can hardly speak French! They manage to do their whole class without speaking a word of French and charge the students with very high fees!. I also understood that most A-Level students are worried about failing their exam, so they are ready to pay a lot of money. I always wonder, why don’t they all come to the Alliance Française Kandy? Students who study with us pay less and they are taught by teachers who received regular trainings from professionals invited from France to help them discover new teaching technics,” argued Lenglet.
The new O-Level and A-Level programs will combine language learning with intensive preparation to the skills needed for the exams which are grammar, translation and written expression.
“In the Alliance Française Kandy, students are sorted in level groups and we make sure that Beginners are not mixed with more advanced students – this sounds so obvious and still so rare to find! And the cherry on the cake, we also are the only French institute in Kandy to have both local and native French speaking teachers,” emphasized Lenglet.
Lenglet has been in Sri Lanka since June 2016. Before being in Kandy, He spent 12 years in Ireland where he taught French in the most prestigious Irish university, Trinity College Dublin, and then in the Alliance Française Dublin, which is the 3rd biggest Alliance in Europe and, where he was the Headmaster.
“I was teaching students of all ages and all levels. I worked closely with the French Embassy and the French Teachers Association to develop programs to help teachers of French in their daily work. I am qualified as a trainer for French teachers after completing 2 Master’s degrees: one in linguistics and one in Teaching French as a foreign language. My years in Ireland were wonderful but then I had the feeling I needed something different – to discover a new country, a new culture and to start new projects. That is when I was recruited by the Executive Committee of the AF Kandy as its new director,” informed Lenglet.
Lenglet pointed out that they have been in Kandy for 50 years and there are still people who have no idea who they are
“Therefore, my first thought was that we need people to hear about us. We started to organize more events. We create a Newsletter to promote our events, we created a brand new website (www.afkandy.lk). Basically, what we want is this,” summed up Lenglet.
