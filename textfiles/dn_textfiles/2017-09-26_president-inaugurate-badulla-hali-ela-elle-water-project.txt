President to inaugurate Badulla, Hali-ela, Elle water project

The Badulla, Hali-ela and Elle integrated water supply project will be vested with the people by President Maithripala Sirisena tomorrow at the invitation of City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem and City Planning State Minister Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle.
The water project will cover 42 Grama Niladhari Divisions in the Badulla Hali-ela and Elle Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
The project will provide safe drinking water round the clock for more than 100,000 people in Badulla Hali-ela and Elle.
The project consists of a water purification plant which can purify 15,000 cubic metres of water per day, a concrete dam with a tank of 17 metres high which can store 132,000 cubic metres of water, eight water storage tanks, pumping houses, transmission and distribution centres. The government has spent Rs. 11,800 million for the project with the assistance of the United States.
The water collected will be pumped to the water purification plant near the reservoir, which can purify 15,000 cubic metres of water per day. Purification will be carried out under a mixed Tube Settlers and Absorption Clarifiers method and removal of poisonous material methods.
The project also consists of a waste water recycling network to recycle the water ejected through the water purification process. The packaged water treatment centre constructed on a mountain slope of Badulla has also saved a large extent of land area required for a project of this nature in traditional land areas.
The 56 kilometre transmission pipeline network has been constructed with Poly-Ethylene (HDPE) pipes.
