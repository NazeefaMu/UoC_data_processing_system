Art and crafts galore!

For the third consecutive time Shining Path Montessori at Rathanaptiya, held its art and craft exhibition from December 15 to 17. The event showcased the creative talents of the students. This Event measured the overall performance of the sensorial skills that the children have developed through the school which promotes the AMI method of early childhood education. They focus on eye and hand coordination, fine and gross motor skills, muscular perception and how well they use all the above methods for creative work.
The exhibits were from four categories. Each category measures different skills that the child has developed through the school. Drawing and Painting, needlecraft, hammering, ceramic and pottery were the categories which were on show.
Our Shining Path Montessori is headed by Samila Perera.
