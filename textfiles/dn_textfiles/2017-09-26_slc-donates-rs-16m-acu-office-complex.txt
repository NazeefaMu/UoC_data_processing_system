SLC donates Rs. 1.6m to ACU office complex

The Association of Cricket Umpires (ACU) realized a long felt dream of getting a headquarters office of its own after 74 years on Friday September 22.
The ceremonial opening took place on an auspicious note with the president of the Association of Cricket Umpires, Member of Parliament, Buddhika Pathirana and its 744 strong membership attending with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Thilanga Sumathipla as the chief guest.
A highlight was the donation of Rs.1.6 million by Sri Lanka Cricket towards the setting up of the office complex. The cheque was handed over by SLC president to the ACU treasurer, Roshan Dhammika soon after the opening.
Making the welcome speech at the location P. Sara Oval with the ceremonial opening Pathirana said that it was a dream come true for the black coated fraternity who perform a thankless job in the middle who had unfortunately not had an office of their own for so many years.
Pathirana had a special word of appreciation and gratitude to the SLC president for the magnanimous donation of Rs.1.6 million towards the cause. He observed that he had not wanted to contest for president of the ACU, but had come forward as he was called upon by a unanimous decision by the association’s executive membership.
He noted that cricket and politics had a similarity where you win and lose. “Of course, I look for the day when the Association of Cricket Umpires could have a permanent land to set up its headquarters before long as the current complex is on a rental,” Pathirana said.
President of SLC, Thilanga Sumathipla, while expressing his pleasure at the ACU realizing a long felt dream, said that SLC would donate a further Rs.5 million towards helping the umpires of this parent body of the black and white coated fraternity set up a headquarters office that they could call their own.
For the record, the ACU was the official parent body for umpires in Sri Lanka, and the untiring services of this fraternity that was an integral link to cricket activity in the middle deserved all praise.
Among those associated at the opening were SLC secretary, Mohan de Silva, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva, Nishan Danasinghe, former cricketer and member of the ACU and president, Sri Lanka Schools’ Cricket Association, Oshara Panditharatne.
