Cement Marketing Lanka to introduce HITEPOZZO fly ash product to market

Cement Marketing Lanka Limited situated at Biyagama Road, Kelaniya, will introduce Hitepozzo, a value added fly ash product and a substance used to improve the durability and quality of the concrete and is coming to domestic market.
Chairman, Ramiah Ramanadan said that Hitepozzo is partial cement replacement in ready mix concrete/mass concrete application. During the chemical reaction in concrete, the Hitepozzo will react with the free excess Lime and will make the ideal free lime into useful Calcium silicate Hydrate which will provide additional strength to the concrete. The chemical reaction is shown in below
Hitepozzo is produced by careful selection, beneficiation and classification and processing of material at our modern plant with latest technology. It helps the concrete to reduce Heat of Hydration, Micro Craking and improve soundness.
Due to spherical nature of processed Hitepozzo and reduction of un burnt carbon during processing in our factory, Hitepozzo will help to reduce water requirement in concrete, will increase pumpability of the concrete and reduce the friction of aggregate during concrete.
Addition of Hitepozzo in the concrete will improve impermeability of concrete which will lead to increase strength and durability. This impermeability will avoid Carbonation ( Shrinkage in concrete), Sulpahate Attack and Steel corrosion. 
Due to high durability and Strength, Hitepozzo is very popular in the cold condition.
At this juncture, he said that Hitepozzo is available in different grades based on particle size distribution and as per the International Standard such as BS EN 450 (BS 3892 –1)/ ASTM  C 618 Class F and sizes available from 2% retention on 325 mesh to 34% retention on 325 mesh as per the International standards. It is widely used in mass construction to speed up the building process.
“It is suitable to mix directly with  produced cement in manufacturing Blended cement. It is also used as performance improver in manufacturing of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), roofing sheet, Brick manufacturing, Hollow Block, Paver Blocks and Tiles as well.
He Very glad to inform that “ Our company was established in September 2012 and we work only with leading material suppliers of Indian Company and our products are used by most of the principal development and construction groups operating in the region.”
Hitepozzo comes in 1 to 1.5 MT HDPE Jumbo bags, 50 Kg Bags and Bulk tankers. “The product is now accepted by both local and international construction companies and there is a new demand to introduce a mini pack so that it could be used for residential building purposes as well.”
He said that some of the big projects in Sri Lanka that uses Hitepozzo, they are Altair Project in Colombo, Colombo Lotus Tower, Colombo Port Expansion Project, Orion City Project, Maga Head Office Project, Labor Department , Access Tower, Narahenpita, the Outer Circular Highway Project, (Kaduwela to Kadawatha), Upper Kotmale Hydro-power (UKHP) Project, Extension of Southern Expressway Project (Matara  to Beliatta) and other projects.
