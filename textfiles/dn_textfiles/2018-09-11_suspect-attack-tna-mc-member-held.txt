Suspect in attack on TNA MC member held

Kattankudy Police arrested one suspect in connection with an alleged attack by a gang on the residence of Batticaloa Municipal Council TNA member Siniththambi Jeyandiran at Kalladi on Sunday night.
Police said a gang armed with clubs had entered the councillor’s house around 8 pm on Sunday and attacked one of the councillor’s supporters named Indiran and escaped from the scene after threatening to get at the councillor himself, who had been away at the moment.
Indiran was admitted to the Batticaloa Hospital with serious injuries, after the attack. Police investigations are continuing.
