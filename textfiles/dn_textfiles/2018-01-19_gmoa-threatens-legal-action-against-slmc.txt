GMOA threatens legal action against SLMC

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will take legal and trade union actions against the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) if it violates the Medical Ordinance, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
He said the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) commenced examinations for its students from today. He said it proved that the government did not close the SAITM on December 31 last year as they promised to the country and to the judiciary.
“Yhe Prime Minister promised that Prof. Colvin Gunaratne would not be appointed the SLMC President. But the Health Minister had gone ahead against the Premier’s pledge and made the appointment. Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva is acting according to the wishes of Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Dr. Rajitha Senaratne,” he alleged.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said a committee appointed by the SLMC was taking various steps to legalise the SAITM. “If the SLMC acts like this way, the international recognition of the Sri Lanka Medical Service will be shattered,” he said.
“The SLMC members should bring a no-confidence motion against its president, He does not represent SLMC opinion,” he said.
