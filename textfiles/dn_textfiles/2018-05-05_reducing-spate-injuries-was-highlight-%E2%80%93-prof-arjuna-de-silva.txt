Reducing spate of injuries was the highlight – Prof Arjuna de Silva

Professor Arjuna de Silva who resigned with Dr Harindu Wijesinghe from the Sri Lanka Cricket medical panel said that the highlight of their four-year association with SLC was reducing the spate of injuries to cricketers down to zero.
“Before we went for the Indian tour last year we had zero injuries which I believe was a good achievement,” said Prof de Silva.
Speaking further Prof de Silva stated, “We streamlined the rehabilitation and injury management areas. We started the rehab lab with two foreign physios - one for rehab and one for injury management. The medical team today is very big unlike in the past where there was only one physio. Now there are two foreign physios and around four local physios. One physio is doing rehab while the other physio tours with the team, which I think is a good plan.”
“We also introduced facilities to liaise with foreign consultants like Dr Chamindu in England and Prof Siri Kannangara in Australia. We also streamlined anti-doping and it has been quite ‘okay’ during our period, players have been made aware of their responsibilities,” he said.
Prof de Silva and Dr Wijesinghe resigned from the SLC medical panel due to pressure of work.
“The university students who were on the road have decided to come back for their term so there is a lot of time commitment which is the main problem for my resigning from the panel. Dr Harindu is also stepping down for the same reason,” said Prof de Silva.
