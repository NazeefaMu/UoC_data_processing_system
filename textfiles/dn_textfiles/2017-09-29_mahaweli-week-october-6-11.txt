“The objective of this programme is to give new life to Maha season food crop cultivation which fell back during the last few seasons due to the adverse weather conditions,” said Jayaratne. “The Mahaweli Sathiya will be implemented with the support of all government and non-government agrarian sector institutions and the public in all 10 Mahaweli Zones”.
