'Prawn exports can be US$ 140 mn industry'

The present US$ 17.5 million income from prawn export has the potential to be raised to US$ 140 million, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
Prawn farmers should pay close attention to follow the proper methods to increase their harvest and achieve that income target, he said. The minister was speaking at a meeting with prawn farmers following an inspection tour at Ambakandawila in Chilaw on October 21.
He said his ministry would provide them with the required technical expertise and other assistance.
