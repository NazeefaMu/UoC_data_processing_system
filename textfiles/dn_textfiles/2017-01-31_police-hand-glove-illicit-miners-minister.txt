Police hand in glove with illicit miners: minister

The environment is threatened due to illegal gem mining carried out in Watawala with the help of police officers, Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Dagambaram said.
He made these comments while inspecting an illegal gem mine in Watawala on Sunday.
Digambaram said residents informed him of illegal mining in the night.
“The police has not intervened despite complaints by residents,” the minister said. A spokesman for Watawala Police said illegal gem mining was carried out with the backing of politicians.
“When the police fail to support, officers are transferred,” the spokesman said.
