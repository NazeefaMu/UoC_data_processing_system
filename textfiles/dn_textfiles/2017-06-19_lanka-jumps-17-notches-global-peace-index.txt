Lanka jumps 17 notches in Global Peace Index

Sri Lanka has made significant improvement in the Global Peace Index (GIP) 2017, jumping 17 notches to be ranked as the 80th in a list of 163 countries.
According to the GPI report, Sri Lanka’s improvement of 0.116 has resulted in the largest jump in the ranking in 2017.
The GPI report says “…Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India, have made the most improvement in terms of overall score.” Sri Lanka coming second in the South Asian Regional ranking, has scored an overall score of 2.019.
The GPI report has noted that “The ongoing consolidation of power undertaken by Sri Lanka’s government led by the President Maithripala Sirisena, has allowed it to undertake structural political reforms for improved governance, which are reflected in improved performance in the indicators measuring political instability, likelihood of violent demonstrations and political terror.”
Sri Lanka benefited primarily from improvements in the Societal Safety and Security as well as Militarisation domains, GPI report has noted.
“In particular, financial contributions to UN peacekeeping missions improved sharply, and there were also visible gains in reducing political terror, likelihood of violent demonstrations, and to a lesser extent, political instability and the impact of Terrorism.” the GPI report noted.
The report credits the present Yahapalana government stating that “a strengthening of political stability following the end of a decades-long civil war in 2009 and efforts by the ruling coalition composed of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to address long-standing concerns among the electorate about the political and human rights landscape.” However, the GPI report warns that “tensions between the Tamil minority and the Sinhalese majority remain latent, and could hinder attempts to achieve national reconciliation.”
On the downside, the number of homicides per 100,000 people rose modestly although it is still at a relatively low level, while the number of armed services personnel per 100,000 people has risen sharply to one of the highest levels in the world.
According to the 2017 Global Peace Index, the world became more peaceful in the last year, however, over the last decade it has become significantly less peaceful.
In South Asia, Bhutan has been identified as the most peaceful country, followed by Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Bhutan ranks 13th, Bangladesh 84th, India 137th, Pakistan 152 nd and Afghanistan 162nd.
Iceland has retained its place as the most peaceful country in the world since 2008, followed by New Zealand, Portugal, Austria and Denmark while war-ravaged Syria and Afghanistan remained at the bottom of the rankings.
