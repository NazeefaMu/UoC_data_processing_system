M.T. FERNANDO  a soccer referee of world class

Any sport must have a judge, a referee or an umpire to have a watch as to how the game is played according to its rules and regulations.
Of all sports those who take to refereeing in football, rugby and hockey are the most hard worked, what with having to be up with the run of play, keeping pace with it and at the end of the game being able to gracefully accept the bouquets and brickbats.
The referees must be ever watchful that no infringements take place, but seeing that the players play the game clean, fair and square and however good a job referees perform they rarely come in for plaudits from players or the spectators.
One of the best produced
Among ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ there are not only players but referees. One, if not the best, produced in the country in football who could have been as good as any referee in the world was MANAGE TOMLIN FERNANDO.
FERNANDO, popularly known as ’MT’ had his early lessons in sport in the school by the Bambalapitya canal St.Peter’s College where he was an all round sportsman. The school did not pay much attention or encourage football preferring to rather concentrate and encourage cricket, rugby and athletics.
But FERNANDO’s first love was football and rugby but in the little football that the school indulged in FERNANDO showed more than ordinary promise and was destined for greatness as a player and after his playing days were over, he took to refereeing and turned out into being an outstanding referee.
Fernando’s teammates
Fernando’s teammates at cricket at at SPC were Michael Chanmugam, Dion Walles, Aubrey Weinman and at rugby Ago Paiva, Harold Silva and Schokman brothers who later donned Havelocks rugby colours. However his first love was football, popularly called the poor man’s game. From the first moment I met and got to know FERNANDO through my dear departed friend J.S.N. ANANDARAJA he impressed me as being dedicated and honest and his knowledge of most sports was fantastic, but it was in football that could be termed the ’Wisden’ to use cricketing parlance.
FERNANDO played football for Anuradhapura District in the CFA inter-district tournament. After serving in many posts in the country’s football administration, it was football that was fortunate to have him as secretary for two years, secretary Football Referees Association and as Chairman of The Referees Committee.
Thankless job
FERNANDO finally settled down to being a referee. The job is a thankless one. However good a job a referee performs, he is finally marked for brickbats, popularly called ‘Hora referee’ and what is not sport even leaving himself open for assault.
Coming from a school that was popular for football, although it was in cricket that I excelled, football was my second love because SBC produced many champion teams and having arguably the best coach Albert Fernando who was the first to be pinned with Brazil Trainers License and later a German one.
There was no inter-school, club or international match that I would miss watching. Fights in Inter-school and club matches were more the rule rather than the exception, by losing side fans blaming the referee and even assaulting them. Refereeing was a risky job.
Natural talent
But from the referees I watched in action the best undoubtedly was FERNANDO. He had the natural talent for a referee and when the teams and spectators see him walk onto the field they would cheer him because they were convinced that he would perform a fair job to the satisfaction of the teams and the usually unruly spectators. In the late 1950s and '60s a referee who stood out was C.M. Mantara.
On refereeing here’s a little anecdote. In those days when ever Saunders, Sunrise, Ratnam, Black Square, Victory, Eleven Lions SC or Kotahena Rangers played a match, after he game the referee came in for assault.
There was one referee who pretends to be struck by the spectators invading the field and would drop to the ground as if he has fainted.
Officials rush to his aid and do everything possible to revive him. But to no avail. And the joke was that when one official attempted to remove his wrist watch he recovered to every one’s surprise.
Once he is escorted into the pavilion he would with a smile say that he dropped to the ground to save himself from assault.
Prince of Wales ground
In that era even the FA Cup or a game against any visiting international team was played at the Prince of Wales Ground adjoining which was then the 'kunumolay'- rubbish dumping ground - which V.A. Sugathadasa a former Benedictine and first Minister of Sport who later built and turned it into a stadium which now proudly stands the imposing Sugathadasa International Stadium that a former Saunders soccerite and keen soccer fan President Ranasinghe Premadasa built into international standard.
Also all important matches, even the FA Cup was played at the Army Ground, Echelon Square where now stands the Galadari Hotel. Even the Government Services ground where matches were played, but now stands the Cinnamon Hotel. Football has been given step motherly treatment. Thankfully now matches could be played also at the Old Race course Ground.
FERNANDO has the proud record of having been a FIFA referee for 10 years. He officiated in the first a AFC Asian Cup in Kuwait and the first to ‘blow’ in the President’s Cup in Korea. He also officiated in Thailand, Kuwait, UAE, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Germany and South Korea and on his quitting the game in appreciation of his good work was appointed a, AFAC Referee Instructor.
Treat to watch
Today thy game in the country lacks football lovers and referees of FERNANDO’S calibre.
He was a treat to watch as a referee and players of that era commended and appreciated him for he was fearless and would never hesitate to blow up for an infringement however powerful the player or the club he came from.
