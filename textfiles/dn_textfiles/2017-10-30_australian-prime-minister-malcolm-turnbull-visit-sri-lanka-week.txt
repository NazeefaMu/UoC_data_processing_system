Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to visit Sri Lanka this week

 
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will visit Sri Lanka on 2 November, the Australian High Commission said today.
Turnbull will meet President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during his visit.
“This year marks the 70th anniversary of Australia’s bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, and I am delighted to be able to visit Sri Lanka,” Turnbull said.
“I had the pleasure of meeting President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe during their visits to Australia earlier this year.”
“I look forward to continuing our discussions on strengthening our economic links, defence engagement, and our work together to combat trans-national crime, particularly people-smuggling,” he said.
