Abans unveils Otello collection

The unique Otello collection at Abans provides the perfect toxic-free solution for homeowners who desire both modern, style and extra storage space in their living rooms.
The Otello collection is comprised of natural materials as well as solid treated wood that do not emit any form of noxious gas common with conventional melamine furniture, making this range not just highly durable, but safe and healthy enough for your home.
In addition, the Otello collection features a wide variety of avant-garde, contemporary designs exclusively from Abans, which can meet any homeowner’s preferences.
