‘Rising Star of Hospitality 2017’ to  recognize the best in hospitality industry

 The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) will conduct the first ever island-wide competition to adjudge the most outstanding personalities among the youth in the hospitality industry.
The ‘Rising Star of Hospitality 2017’ Trophy was unveiled at the press conference in conjunction with the re-launch of the official website of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka at the press conference held in Colombo on Wednesday.
Young employees from 200 member hotels island-wide will vie for the coveted title under nine disciplines, where they will be evaluated based on outstanding capabilities, talents and personality traitsby an expert panel of professionals.
President of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka Sanath Ukwatte said, “Today, the country has 22,000 star class hotel rooms in the formal sector and is expected to grow by a further 6,500 rooms by 2020. At present, the total investment is over US$ 3 billion andit is expected to further increase by US$ 1.5 billion by 2020.”
Ukwatte said tourism was a highly lucrative industry for the country as it not only generates large direct and indirect employment but also attracted substantial investment, helping the country to earn much needed foreign exchange. Despite the attractive attributes offered by the industry, today’s youth are unaware of the true potential in the hotel sector. The event is scheduled to take place on October 24 at the BMICH.
The Rising Star of Hospitality competition is exclusively aimed at the youth between 18 to 27 years of ageand will be held in three phases.
The first phase will evaluate job-oriented skills and competencies, and will be held at a regional level. The second phase will evaluate the applicants based on the details provided in their respective candidate application forms. The third and final phase will further evaluate the contestants based on reviews obtained from the preceding rounds, following which the top scorers will be further scrutinized through a one-on-one interview.
Top scorers of the competition will be adjudged the winner, first runner up and second runner up under nine different categories namely – Concierge / Bell Hop, Receptionist, Public Area Attendant, Room Attendant, Steward /Waiter, Kitchen Steward, Bartender, Pool Attendant / Life Guard and Telephone Operator. Candidates who qualify from the first and second rounds will receive a maximum score of 35% each, whereupon 45 contestants will be qualified to face the finals.
The Rising Star of Hospitality 2017 will also confer a special award for the Most Popular Finalist out of the 45 finalists qualified following the first and second rounds of the competition.
