DIMO Chairman receives Germany’s Highest Tribute

Chairman and Managing Director of Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC Ranjith Pandithage was awarded with the ‘Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany’ a prestigious recognition from the German Government recently.
This event was held at a ceremony at the German Embassy in Colombo.
The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany was instituted in 1951 by Federal President Theodor Heuss.
The German Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Jörn Rohde said that this award demonstrates the confidence and the respect Federal Republic of Germany has on Pandithage as a highly respected businessman and also as an exemplary human being. The award is granted after a strict individual analysis and receiving such an award by an individual is a testament of the significant achievement for Pandithage and the company he leads. DIMO’s corporate governance, ethical business practices, transparency and sustainable initiatives too have been endorsed by this.
DIMO represents the best engineered German brands in Sri Lanka from 1939.
