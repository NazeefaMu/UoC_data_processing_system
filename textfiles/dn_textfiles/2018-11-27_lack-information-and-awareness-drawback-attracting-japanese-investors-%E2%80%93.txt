Lack of information and awareness drawback in attracting Japanese investors – JETRO

 JETRO, or the Japan External Trade Organization, is a government-related organization that works to promote mutual trade and investment between Japan and the rest of the world.
Originally established in 1958 to promote Japanese exports abroad, JETRO’s core focus in the 21st century has shifted toward promoting foreign direct investment into Japan and helping small to medium size Japanese firms maximize their global export potential. JETRO has set up branches in identified countries with Sri Lanka being one of them.
The ‘Daily News’ caught up with Senior Director for Global Strategy, South West Asia Planning Department of the JETRO, Kazuhiko Obama in Tokyo to seek his views on needs and strategies and JETRO’s plan of action to promote Japan – Sri Lanka business. The following is based on views expressed by Obama during a discussion with this writer at the JETRO head office in Tokyo recently.
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND PROPAGANDA CAN ATTRACT JAPANESE INVESTORS
In my opinion lack of awareness and information both on Sri Lanka and business opportunities in Sri Lanka is the biggest drawback to attracting investors from Japan. There are a lot of good opportunities for Japanese businessmen in Sri Lanka. But unfortunately lack of information is a hurdle.
Currently there is no Japanese media in Sri Lanka. Japanese media usually reports heavily on India. When it comes to Sri Lanka at times only negative information is published in the Japanese media. In Japan more than 95 percent business are Small and Medium sized Enterprises. SME’s get information from media or the banking corporation.
Unfortunately there is no Japanese banking corporation either in Sri Lanka. Large companies can get information from their agents or partners. For Example Mitsubishi Company has a partnership with Hayleys in Sri Lanka. 
But the SME’s do not have such facilities or contacts. Indian market is so large that Japanese press identifies Sri Lanka as a small country in comparison. This is misleading. Whenever I speak in a seminar or forum I introduce Sri Lanka as not as a mall country but a big one with a lot of potential. Sri Lanka has the same population as Taiwan, Australia or New Zealand, but the Japanese investors are not aware of this fact. If Sri Lanka was located in East Asia for example, Sri Lanka may not have been identified as a small country. Sri Lanka is being identified as a small country because it is so close to India.
JETRO CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG JAPANESE FIRM’S ON ADVANTAGES OF DOING BUSINESS IN SRI LANKA
So we at JETRO concentrate on providing proper and correct information to Japanese companies, especially for SME’s. JETRO branch in Colombo is spearheading these efforts. Also we hold seminars in Japan to introduce Sri Lankan business environment and promote investment in Sri Lanka to Japanese companies. We also publish information in our website and newsletters about business opportunities in Sri Lanka and other general information. When Japanese businessmen want to visit Sri Lanka to explore opportunities we provide individual consultation.
At individual consultations we give a thorough briefing not only about business but other information such as politics, culture, challenges when setting up business, market potential and capacity etc. These awareness activities I believe are most important to Sri Lanka. We also arrange interviews with Sri Lankan businessmen and key persons through our office in Colombo. We provide information about Sri Lanka in Japanese language as well. This is very important to some SME’s in japan where key officials may not be fluent in English.
When we organize seminars a lot of business people attend them and they also ask a lot of questions. At a recent seminar in Tokyo we even had an issue with the seating facilities. There were more business people than we expected and we had to expand seating facilities in a hurry. This means Japanese companies are hungry for proper information about Sri Lanka.
SRI LANKA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A HUB FOR SOUTH ASIA
Japanese companies are focusing business in ASEAN countries. Many set up their regional head office in Singapore. They call it the hub office. In South Asia many Japanese companies don’t have such a hub office.
They expect the News Delhi branch in India to become the hub office. But what usually happens is that hub office becomes an Indian hub office ONLY and not South Asian hub office due to the size of the Indian market.
Sri Lanka is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. It is so close to India so that Sri Lanka can be used as a hub to doing business in India. Also the country can be used as a bridge to Africa due to transportation capabilities. Also Sri Lankan companies are doing good business in Africa, especially in the IT sector.
Japan is yet to explore Africa in a business perspective and Sri Lanka could be the bridge. Sri Lank has a living environment that compares favorably with both India and Japan. It has high quality human resources, good education, English is widely spoken, and most are Buddhists and have even-tempered personalities. These are all positive qualities
JAPANESE STYLE HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SRI LANKA 
JETRO has embarked on a programme to identify new markets in Sri Lanka. Healthcare services are one area we have identified as having great potential. In Sri Lanka non-communicable diseases (NCD’s) account for about 70 percent of total deaths. This is also affecting productivity standards in companies. In order to decrease the number of NCD patients, JETRO is planning to collaborate with Lankan companies and health related organisations to introduce a Japanese style ‘health and productivity management system among Sri Lankan companies, which will include the application of regular health check-ups etc.
In Japan, the company is responsible for employees health. An employee has to provide a comprehensive health assessment report to the employer every year. Companies heavily invest in their employees’ health. We JETRO want to create a similar mechanism in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka’s public health service is very good. However, Sri Lankan people generally think about hospitals as a destination for cure. So they mostly visit hospitals when they get ill.
But in Japan health checks are very popular. So people go to hospitals before they get ill to assess their health. So we are looking to create and popularize the health check-up market in Sri Lanka. Japanese are very health conscious people. Some even check their daily calorie intake. Last year and once again this year we organized workshops in Colombo for Sri Lankan company CEO’s. We urged them to adopt a good health-checkup service for their employees.
Many Lankan’s like going to the gym, running or walking. This is good. But they only engage in action and no measurement or evaluation. We have this system PDCA which stands for Plan, Do, Check and Action. In Sri Lanka it is mostly P (Plan) and D (DO). But no C (check) or A (action).
LEARNING ELDERLY CARE FROM JAPAN
Japan has the world’s oldest population. Also the population growth is very low. Sri Lanka too has a similar trend which shows signs of increasing. In future we also want to focus on the elderly care market in Sri Lanka which is growing fast.
Japan is suffering from lack of human resources in the elderly care market. After creating a good elderly care system in Sri Lanka we can even import human resources in the field from Sri Lanka. India is not suitable for this kind of business because it is too big. Also the Indian population growth is high unlike Japan or Sri Lanka.
JAPAN TO TAP INTO HIGH END CONSUMER MARKET
The Sri Lankan consumer market is growing rapidly. However, I do not think the market has enough high end products or the variety some affluent consumers demand. In future Sri Lanka is becoming a good destination for high end consumer products. Also the variety and choices for consumers are currently lacking. Sri Lankan consumer should have multiple choices. This is another area which we will promote among Japanese investors.
CHALLENGES TO DOING BUSINESS IN SRI LANKA
Other than lack of information there are many other challenges and obstacles to doing business in Sri Lanka. JETRO as I said earlier has established a comprehensive information providing service to media, banking corporations and business leaders. We provide information to Japanese companies doing business in Sri Lanka as well as Japanese companies not doing business in Sri Lanka. Every year we organize a dialogue between Japanese companies in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan government’s relevant organisations led by the BOI. At times there is lot of changes in Sri Lanka with regards to people heading some key organisations. Constant change is hurting business. Also Japanese investors would like quick hassle free service and may be one stop-shop to get their business going. This is currently lacking. Sri Lanka should effectively address issues such as insufficient skilled labour and high quality industrial human resources for the manufacturing industry.
There also should be a consistent industrial policy and BOI functions should be streamlined for it to be more effective and investor friendly. Attracting foreign investment in the is essential for diversifying export products and shrinking the trade deficit, and now is the best possible time for attracting Japanese companies.
