Gota files revision petition to stay Avant-Garde corruption case

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal seeking an order to stay the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court proceedings pertaining to Avant-Garde corruption case.
Through this petition Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is also challenging Colombo Chief Magistrate’s decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Rajapaksa regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case.
The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury.
In his revision petition, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has challenged the Chief Magistrate’s decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and Chief Magistrate’s decision to fix the matter for trial.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had aso turned down a request made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others that they be released from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission over Avant-Garde incident
Rajapaksa is also seeking an order to set-aside the Colombo High Court’s order dated February 2, 2018.
Rajapaksa had raised preliminary objections alleging that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against the eight accused including Gotabaya Rajapaksa under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.
