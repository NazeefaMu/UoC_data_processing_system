Navy awaits GPS footings

The Sri Lanka Navy is awaiting for the GPS footings of the Indian fishing boat, which was said to be attacked recently by an unidentified group when fishing in the Sri Lankan waters.
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne said it is vital to have the GPS recordings of the Indian boat, to conduct the investigations into the attack further.
The Navy has requested the Indian authorities to supply the recordings of the GPS unit fixed to the Indian fishing boat.
“The route of a vessel is recorded with the GPS unit fixed in the vessel. Once the GPS recordings received, the Navy can trace the location of the attack,” he said.
He said Sri Lanka Navy as a professional force, never attacks a vessel without having an approval of the Navy Commander. The approval of the Navy Commander is needed even to fire a warning shot at a vessel.
Wijegunaratne said investigations revealed that 400 to 500 Indian trawlers were in Sri Lankan waters on the day.
