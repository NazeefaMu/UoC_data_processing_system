High powered delegation to Tehran soon

Sri Lankan officials began work on formulating one of the strongest ever national business delegations to Iran in Colombo on Tuesday.
“President Maithripala Sirisena’s forthcoming tour of Iran could open many new doors of opportunities for Lankan businesses,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
Bathiudeen was addressing a team of officials from Industry and Commerce Ministry including the Department of Commerce, EDB, the BoI,Tea Board, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, National Chamber of Commerce and the Foreign Ministry at his Ministry premises. The objective of the visit is to explore bilateral trade, investment and tourism potentials topped up by a Business Forum. Joining the session was Deputy Head of Mission of Embassy of Islamic Republic of Iran in Colombo, M. R.Ahmadi. Minister Bathiudeen is scheduled to lead the Lankan business delegation.
“Iran - Sri Lanka relations have strengthened in the recent years but bilateral trade growth has not met our expectations despite end of sanctions.In 2015, our total trade with Iran was $162 mn, a small amount in comparison to previously higher trade levels. President Maithripala Sirisena’s forthcoming tour of Iran could open many new doors for Lankan businesses and get bilateral trade levels back on track.
Therefore let us collaborate for a strong trade delegation to Iran consisting of representatives from Lankan exporters, importers,manufacturers and service providers so that Sri Lanka can leverage thisopportunity.
I believe that we should not send only a business delegation and just make speeches but also should make joint business presentations with our Chambers to Iranian investors and also schedule several B2Bs so that this visit is leveraged well for the business sector of the country.” Iranian Embassy in Colombo’s Deputy Head M R Ahmadi stressed of the surging interest at Iranian side on the forthcoming meet. “We look forward to explore a wide range of sectors for cooperation during this meet.We believe the planned Business Forum during this event could also bring innew openings.” Prior to sanctions, bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Iran stood at $1.6 billion (2011), but in 2015 it totaled $162 mn, of which $155 mnwere exports to Iran from Sri Lanka.
