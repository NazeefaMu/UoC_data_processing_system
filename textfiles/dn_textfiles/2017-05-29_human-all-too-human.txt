Human, all too human

In October 1876, around the time of his thirty-second birthday, Friedrich Nietzsche set off on his first journey to Italy. He was at this point Professor of Classical Philology in Basel, a post he had secured at the astonishingly young age of twenty-four. Nietzsche had been quite sickly, suffering from a number of ailments, ranging from debilitating headaches and vision problems to frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting.
It was thought that some restful time in the pleasant climate of the south would do him good. Malwida von Meysenbug, a well-to-do aristocrat and writer, invited Nietzsche to join her, and secured rooms in the Villa Rubinacci, perched up the rocky cliffs of Sorrento, across the gulf from Naples and Vesuvius. Richard and Cosima Wagner were a short stroll away, luxuriously ensconced at the Hotel Vittoria. They too were resting, with a monumental undertaking recently completed. A few months before, Wagner’s cycle of music dramas, Der Ring des Niebelungen, had had its premiere at the newly inaugurated festival in Bayreuth. Both Nietzsche and Meysenbug had been close with the Wagner family, and had been champions of the Wagnerian programme for German cultural renewal. While relations between Nietzsche and the Wagners were still cordial, they had cooled somewhat. It was on this trip that Nietzsche would see Wagner for the last time. As Wagner’s influence over him diminished, he began to assert his intellectual independence and come into his own as a philosopher, beginning to write his aphoristic work Human, All Too Human.
Paolo D’Iorio’s Nietzsche’s Journey to Sorrento charts this trip, and this pivotal year in Nietzsche’s life. D’Iorio cites a moving notebook entry of Nietzsche’s, from a few years later, where he reflects back on what this meant to him:
I don’t have enough strength for the North: awkward and artificial souls reign there, who work as constantly and necessarily at the measures of prudence as the beaver at his dam. And to think I spent my whole youth among them! That is what overcame me when, for the first time, I saw the evening come up, with its velvet gray and red, in the sky over Naples – like a shudder of pity for myself, that I had started my life by being old, and tears came to my eyes and the feeling of having been saved at the last moment. I have enough spirit for the South.
Ill health
This journey was the start of a lasting infatuation with Italy. Not long after this trip to Sorrento, Nietzsche would come to resign his professorship on grounds of ill health. He afterwards lived on his modest pension and divided his time between Italy, the Côte d’Azur and the Swiss mountains, particularly around Sils Maria. This trip marked a turning point, both personally and philosophically. In addition to Nietzsche’s move away from Wagner, his early work was strongly under the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer. Although Nietzsche was dubious of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics early on, he was drawn to aspects of Schopenhauer’s bleak world view. Schopenhauer argued that ours was a miserable lot, where we are perpetually buffeted between states of suffering and boredom, and can never reach lasting satisfaction of our desires.
It would be better, he thought, never to have come into existence. Nietzsche’s crucial shift away from this Schopenhauerian stance of “life negation” to his eventual one of “life affirmation” was of course an incremental process. But this foray to the South, if not necessarily the impetus for the philosophical transformation, provides a beautiful geographical image of what was happening more gradually: Nietzsche moves from attachment to a cold, pessimistic philosophy of the North to a sunnier philosophy of the South, a philosophy celebrating life and the world, the body and vitality. Like Lesley Chamberlain’s superb Nietzsche in Turin(1996), covering the last year of Nietzsche’s sane life, D’Iorio’s book focuses judiciously on a key year. It is well judged in its plan and its execution.
 
Covering a considerably longer span, Daniel Blue’s The Making of Friedrich Nietzsche charts the philosopher’s formative years. He was born in 1844 in the Saxon town of Röcken. His father, a Lutheran pastor, died when Friedrich was a young child. Blue recounts the first decades of Nietzsche’s life, up to the point that he finished his university education. Subtitled The quest for identity, Blue’s book takes as its guiding thread Nietzsche’s interest, from an early age, in writing his autobiography. At the age of thirteen, he wrote a charmingly pompous first attempt: “From My Life – by F. W. Nietzsche. The years of youth”. This was the beginning of several efforts at the genre throughout his life, culminating in 1888, on the brink of his collapse into insanity, with Ecce Homo, whose chapters notoriously include “Why I Am So Wise”, “Why I Write Such Good Books”, and “Why I Am Destiny”.
Academic work
In 1858 Nietzsche enrolled at Schulpforta, a boarding school with a distinguished register of alumni, including the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte and the historian Leopold von Ranke. It was here that he received the rigorous training in classical languages that prepared him for his future academic career. Nietzsche’s seriousness about matters of Bildung was evident from this early stage, and extended beyond his formal academic work. Along with a few friends, Nietzsche formed a club called Germania, an intellectual discussion circle, where they would take turns presenting essays, poetry and music.
One of the most interesting elements in Blue’s story is its charting of Nietzsche’s loss of faith, beginning in his middle teenage years. In his contributions to Germania, we don’t see outright atheism, but we do see a cautious movement to a more sceptical perspective. In one of his essays from this period, Nietzsche reflects on how difficult it can be to distance oneself from the tradition in which one has grown up, and to reflect on it in a critical way. This gives a nice hint of what, in the face of this difficulty, will become one of his most striking philosophical accomplishments: specifically his ability to step, insofar as possible, outside the Judaeo-Christian moral tradition and look at it as an anthropologist might, explaining how it gained traction and why it continues to retain it. Nietzsche pressed this still further, going beyond the role of anthropologist to that of philosophical “legislator”, concerned with the task of “revaluing” these hitherto revered values.
From Schulpforta, Nietzsche first moved to Bonn to study, then to Leipzig, where he did his doctoral training. While philology was his subject, philosophy was a strong side interest. He had ongoing doubts about whether he would be cut out for a career as a philologist, but his talent was evident to his teachers. - Times Literary Supplement
