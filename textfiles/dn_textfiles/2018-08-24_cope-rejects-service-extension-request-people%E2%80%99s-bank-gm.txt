COPE rejects service extension request of People’s Bank GM

The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) rejected a request to give a one year service extension to People’s Bank General Manager Wasantha Kumara, COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament yesterday.
Handunnetti urged Parliament’s special attention to implement the COPE recommendation.
He noted that the Finance Ministry and Public Enterprises Ministry have informed the Committee that they accept the COPE recommendation with regard to the service extension.
“There was a request to give a year’s service extension to Wasantha Kumara, who had completed 60 years.
“He was recruited on contract basis in 2001 for a salary of Rs.100,000 and earns a salary of Rs 2.1 million as at now. He had also obtained Rs.75 million as salary increment arrears.
“The COPE is of the view that this service extension must not be given and the common recruitment procedure adhered by all banks must be followed in appointing a suitable person as the GM,” he explained.
MP Handunnetti said the Finance Ministry has written to the People’s Bank Chairman asking to follow the recommendation of the COPE.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the Government accepts the COPE recommendation.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena agreed with MP Handunnetti that the attempt to give a service extension to the People’s Bank GM was faulty and harmful.
He asked the Government not to do anything that could upset the stability of the state bank.
National Policies and Economic Affair State Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva however pointed out that the Government should also pay attention to the salaries offered in the private sector to individuals with similar experience and qualifications.
“The Government needs to come to a common understanding on the payments to such officials in order to retain them in the public sector,” he commented.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena objected to the State Minister’s remarks stating that paying high remunerations to senior management would not help revive those institutions.
“Former SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte was paid a monthly salary of Rs. 3.2 million, but that did not help in rebuilding the national carrier,” he added.
