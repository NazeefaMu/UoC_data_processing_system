In unison with Chinese creativity

Chinese painting is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as guóhuà meaning “national” or “native painting”, as opposed to Western styles of art which became popular in China in the 20th century. Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black ink or coloured pigments; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as hanging scrolls or handscrolls. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, lacquerware, folding screens, and other media.
Landscape painting was regarded as the highest form of Chinese painting, and generally still is. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907–1127) is known as the “Great age of Chinese landscape”. In the north, artists such as Jing Hao, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guo Xi painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough stone. In the south, Dong Yuan, Juran, and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.
The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals.
It was only during the Warring States period (475–221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the Eastern Jin dynasty), painting and calligraphy in China were among the most highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practised by amateurs—aristocrats and scholar-officials—who had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art.
The implements were the brush pen made of animal hair and black inks made from pine soot and animal glue. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on silk. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China’s history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.
The Chinese Style International Tour of Modern Chinese Water-Ink Paintings Exhibition was held at China Cultural Center recently in association with Art news of China and Central Digital TV Chinese Art Channel.
This unique exhibition did host some of the modern paintings of Chinese style crafted with water and Ink, a speciality with the Chinese paintings.
The artists involved in the exhibition were representatives of contemporary Chinese art circles. The portrayals depicted the history of Chinese innovation, inheritance and development. Chinese water-ink painting is an independent form of art which heals the mind and the spirit at the same time. This freehand brushwork integrates poetry, calligraphy, painting and seal art and influences the evolution of contemporary Chinese water-ink paintings. Furthermore, it was categorized into three sects such as character, landscape, flower and bird series.
The exhibits were a new experience for the visitors and the China Cultural Centre alike in capturing the progress of the modern art of Chinese origin.
The exhibition was held free of charge to the public with the courtesy of the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese Embassy shouldered this initiative as part of the National Day Ceremonies of the People’s Republic of China which is being held in the months of September and October.
