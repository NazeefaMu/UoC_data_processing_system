Citizens' Mail

Jumbo coverage
The media is praiseworthy for publicising jumbo deaths on both road and rail. What’s worrying is the sad lack of interest with keeping to our ancient culture in protecting animals.
There’s no single answer to the problem but those in authority should move urgently.
Look at the Daily News picture of jumbos crossing the highway. They should construct overhead bridges over jumbo crossings both over road and rail. There are enough funds collected from Wildlife parks. This type of overhead bridges is built in both Africa and in the west. So why are we so backward and unkind to them?
I appeal to all to give highest priority before more are mauled down. The food and water should be made available in plenty with electric fences.
