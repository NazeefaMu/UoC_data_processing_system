Sandya Ekneligoda appeals to President, PM about death threats

“My husband was not involved with the LTTE, there are many CID investigations that could prove it,” said Sandya Ekneligoda who is receiving threats Online, due to her seeking justice to her disappeared husband Prageeth Ekneligoda, in a press conference yesterday, requesting the public to understand her plight and stop attacking her and her children.
She requested the President to ensure the safety of her and her children, as the person behind the threats and defamation was his own advisor Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thera. She also asked the Prime Minister to remember the statement he had made in support of her when in 2016, Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera verbally assaulted her at the Homagama Magistrate’s Court and to continue with that support. She requested the Maha Sangha to think of her as another ‘Patachara,’ and sympathize with her and her children, without protesting against her.
Ekneligoda had been receiving threats on the social media for years, but since the conviction of Ven Gnanasara Thera, the number of threats had escalated, where people have even threatened to kill her and her children.
Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara thera verbally abused and threatened Sandya Ekneligoda at the Homagama Courts after the hearing of the enforced disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and the arrest of the Military Intelligence officers, in relation to his disappearance in January 2016. He was found guilty for abuse and the use of criminal force on May 24 and was sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment on June 14 and later released on bail.
She said the court case on her husband’s disappearance was still pending, as the Sri Lanka Army is refusing to release information requested by Court, in the name of National Security.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International urged Sri Lankan authorities to urgently take action against those threatening human rights defender Sandya Ekneligoda. In a press release, the Organization said that over the recent days, Sandya Ekneligoda, a distinguished campaigner against enforced disappearances and the wife of disappeared Cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, has been subject to a barrage of hate, abuse, intimidation, harassment and death threats on social media.
