Southern CAA earns high income through fines

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) in the Southern region has recorded an income of over Rs.1.1 million from errant traders through court fines.
The Authority has conducted a series of raids and inspections in the Southern region during the last three months. Selling and displaying unsuitable food items for human consumption, changing prices on labels and selling them at high prices, selling electrical appliances without warranty cards, selling bags of cement at high prices, non-displaying price lists, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority were some of the faults detected by Authority officials during raids.
The officials said the raids and mobile inspections were carried out covering all Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts.
The Authority receives complaints about frauds, malpractices and corruptions against many errant traders daily. Therefore, the CAA has intensified raids during the festive season.
Industries and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen has ordered the officials to carry out the raids, CAA Southern Regional Assistant Director S. Nandasiri said.
