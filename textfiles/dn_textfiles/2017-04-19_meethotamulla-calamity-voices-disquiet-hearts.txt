Meethotamulla calamity : Voices of disquiet hearts

The scene remains grim at Meethotamulla, as countless members of the military crisscross the fallen garbage searching for signs of the missing. Distraught relatives of the disappeared, along with those who were lucky enough to have survived the ordeal unscathed, perch themselves on undamaged buildings, surveying the recovery efforts.
Pools of stagnant water lie in the shadows of smashed, uprooted houses, in which birds and dogs wade. Several CEB employees clamber up damaged utility poles and work to stabilize them. It is a scene of complete disaster. The melancholy mixes with the stench of trash and weighs heavily on the masked relief workers and tearful survivors.

“This is no longer a rescue mission, since more than 72 hours have passed. We are working to find the bodies now,” said Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne, one of the army officers overseeing the recovery efforts.
1,060 members of the Tri Forces, along with 500 Police officers, are stationed at Meethotamulla, and many of them are employed combing through the rubble under which several houses are still buried.
According to Seneviratne, the landslide engulfed many houses, pushing them 100 to 150 meters backwards and then burying them. It is the military’s belief that the remaining bodies will be discovered in the area under the debris.
As of yesterday morning, 31 bodies had been recovered. The number of missing, however, remains unknown, as citizens have not come forward to report lost family members. There is little doubt, however, that more bodies will be found, as fifteen excavators, along with fifteen to twenty dump trucks and other heavy machinery, continue to comb through the piles of dirt and trash.
The recovery effort will continue for the foreseeable future, taking place each day from the morning hours until 8:00 at night.
Though the landfill is stable now, according to the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), plans are being made to further reinforce it before the heavy rains that are expected towards the end of the month.
“The NBRO is conducting a survey on the site, and we are also discussing how to remove the still water that is building up,” said Seneviratne.
The landfill is built on marshland, and much of the water that usually flows through and around the dumpsite is now stuck due to the landslide. Because of this, the military is in the process of cutting several canals through the garbage with the hope of draining the area.
As reported earlier, garbage is no longer being dumped in Meethotamulla, but the military has not started removing any of the waste.
“We have not been informed of any plans for shifting the garbage to another site. Right now, we are concentrating on simply excavating the debris under which there are houses,” said Seneviratne.
Much of the surrounding area has been declared a danger zone, as several of the houses therein sustained structural damage during the landslide.
“About 400 families have been displaced. The total number comes to around 1,700 people. They have either lost their homes in the landslide or live in the 130 houses that have been identified as lying within the danger zone,” he added.
Many of the displaced are being housed at Terrence N. de Silva College, Kolonnawa, where much of the aid has been sent.
Water bottles, crackers, and clothing, as well as household items, are stacked here and there, while most of the displaced gather in the shade, some seated in chairs. Relief workers and journalists mill about, speaking to those affected by the tragedy.
Promises abandoned

I visited the place after the incident occurred. The houses were pulled out from its foundation as well. The residents alleged that CMC sprayed a chemical and it could have led to the collapse.
There have been serious allegations made by the affected community that rescue efforts did not even begin soon after the incident. The residents continuously protested, and the government was very well aware of the danger. But they just allowed this to happen, and the people in Meethotamulla had no choice but to get buried in garbage.
The government could have easily sorted out but they never took an attempt to find a solution.
The Chief Incumbent of the temple made several attempts to find a solution through the government officials, but it was all in vain. The politicians also gave false promises to the people. They never fulfilled any of their promises.
The ministers are very keen on buying new vehicles, so why cannot they find a solution to this people’s problem?
They always look for short term solutions and finally people are in trouble. Many broken promises are behind this incident.
Why couldn’t the government stop the dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla? I think the government should act more responsible and justice should be served to the people.
Lives saved by life lost
Kanthi Kannangara
I was not at home when the incident happened. I was at one of my relative’s funeral. One of my neighbours informed me that garbage dump collapsed. We immediately returned home.
I have two daughters who are married. My eldest daughter’s house was much closer to the dump than my house. When we returned, we saw how the garbage dump had crushed down her house.
If it had not been for the funeral, my daughter and her little kids would have been at home. We lived in fear, but we did not have a place to go.
This is not the first time; it seems the government does not even care about the lives the people living in this area. Residents continuously protested to stop dumping of garbage here, but nobody listened.
Colombo Municipal Council sprayed some chemicals on top of the giant garbage dump and built small canals despite objections raised by residents. I think the spraying of chemicals would have led to the fall of garbage. A similar incident happened previously as well.
I have been living in this area since the 70’s, and now the government authorities have declared that my house is in the danger zone.
Where can I go? Now my daughter also has lost her whole house, and it has been totally buried.
Even after killing more than 30 lives, the government still turns a blind eye towards the issue.
Lingering bitterness
J.A. Dhayawathi
Several people here are taking medication because of the terrible shock. One of my neighbors cannot hear properly after she witnessed the incident.
All the displaced people are put in Kollannawa School. I don’t know for how long we'll have to stay like this.
Some people said that the government is looking for some other places to send us. I wonder where they are going to send us. We suffered a lot due to this problem.
The walls have been cracked and we know that it is very dangerous for us to stay any longer in those houses. That was my native land and suddenly they asked me leave.
The departed and the displaced
Inaya Begum
Many people died in their houses when the dump collapsed, while several others are struck in this place not knowing what will happen next.
It was after our settlements that CMC started dumping garbage. Now they want us to leave the houses and go.
Failed succor
S.H. Harishchandra
I have been living in this house for the past eight years. When we came here, the garbage dump was not this big and people said that it was just a temporary solution by the government. However, within last few years, the dump got bigger than we expected.
I happened to hear that the government has decided to give compensation to the people. This issue is not new to the government; the residents have continuously complained about this. They could have put an end to this problem a long time back, but they failed to do so.
I have no idea how the government is going to carry out their measures to give compensation to the people. How can we believe them?
Foreseen fate
Fathima Farzana
I ran out of the house when I heard a huge noise like water rushing down the mountain. I was shocked to see the houses buried under the garbage. We were aware that this would happen someday; the government just let it happen.
I have been living on rent in Meethotamulla. I have two school-going children. I live on the other side of the dump, but my house is also under the danger zone now.
Nobody can use their wells after the collapse, it has been polluted. The army also warned that there is an electric post and that might fall anytime. We have nowhere to go.
