SLPP restricts digital devices at party pocket meetings

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has restricted digital devices at their party pocket meetings where certain politicians who still hold SLFP membership participate in, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday said.
“The restriction has also been extended to media coverage for such meetings as well,” he added.
“The restriction has come at the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision not to tolerate the behavior of certain politicians who support other political parties while holding the SLFP membership,” Minister Samarasinghe pointed out.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party recently announced that they are to take strict disciplinary action against SLFP members who promote other political parties and political visions while holding SLFP membership. Attention was also drawn to the use of electronic evidence, such as video and audio recordings, when inquiring into such behavior of those politicians. “Certain SLFP politicians who support Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna did not appear when their candidates submitted nominations. These politicians did not go anywhere near the Divisional Secretariats where nominations were accepted.” Minister Samarasinghe observed.
“These politicians have become so fearful of the idea of using electronic evidence being used against them; they have banned any digital device from the meetings they participate in. Apparently, there is a security body check done on supporters who attend Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna meetings. The supporters are to leave all their digital devices outside the meeting place. In these circumstances, it is obvious that media personnel are not allowed to cover these meetings as well,” Minister Samarasinghe explained.
Samarasinghe pointed out that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna is now on the verge of political bankruptcy with its ridiculous ways. “They even use the colour blue to decorate their party offices,” Samarasinghe exclaimed. Minister Samarasinghe was speaking at a media brief held at the SLFP Headquarters last afternoon. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna supporter, Western Provincial Council (WPC) Deputy Chairman Yasapala Koralage yesterday said that he has been given the post of SLFP Organizer to the Horana electorate. Koralage pointed out that they will not allow any conspiracy to divide the SLFP to succeed.
“If the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna leader is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his cut outs should appear at our party offices. But, the only face that appears at them is of late Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake’s, who had nothing to do with this party. We are striving for an SLFP government, not a UNP one. I am sure, when we win the Local Government election, all “Pohottuwa” supporters in Horana will come and join me in the process of developing our area,” Koralage said.
Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has lost its momentum. “There is no such thing as Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna now. People have lost faith in it. All SLFP supporters should defeat the conspiracy to divide our party and take the SLFP to victory,” Devapriya said.
