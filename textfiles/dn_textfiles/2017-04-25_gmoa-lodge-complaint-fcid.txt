GMOA to lodge complaint with FCID

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) hopes to lodge a complaint with the FCID in connection with the alleged misuse of public funds by the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister in order to give publicity to a fraudulent company, GMOA Secretary Dr.Nalin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr.Zoysa said that the two ministers are now allegedly using public funds to insert newspaper advertisements on behalf of SAITM, which is a fraudulent company owned by an individual.
“This is purely an offence when compared to the incidents investigated by the FCID during the recent past under the Public Property Act in connection with the previous regime,”the GMOA Secretary.
According to Dr.Zoysa, even the President had accepted the fact that an institution such as SAITM cannot be owned by an individual.
It is hilarious how the two ministers take technical decisions that should be taken by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
“What they should do now is not publishing newspaper advertisements on behalf of SAITM, but, ask forgiveness from the nation for not revealing and presenting accurate facts before the judiciary,” he said.
The authorities should clarify to the country how the act of publishing newspaper advertisements allegedly by the two ministers using public funds is not an offense under the Public Property Act,”Dr.Zoysa added.
