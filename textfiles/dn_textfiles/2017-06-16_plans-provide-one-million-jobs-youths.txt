Plans to provide one million jobs for youths

A programme will be launched under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena to provide jobs to one million youths of the country through the Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry, Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
The Motor Engineering Training Institute is aimed to achieve this goal said the minister when he visited the construction site of the new institute.
The Motor Engineering Training Institute had to be shifted to a new site to pave the way for the proposed new bridge across the Kelani Ganga.
The proposed new institute building costing Rs. 1,500 million is being built through funds provided by JAICA.
Minister Weerakkody directed engineers and officers-in-charge of the project to accelerate construction work.
