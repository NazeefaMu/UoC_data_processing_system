Maldivians can get kidney operations done in SL: Rajitha

Although kidney operations are banned for Indian nationals, Maldivian nationals can get kidney operations done in Sri Lanka without a problem, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that kidney operations were banned by the Government for Indian nationals due to a racket, but this ban does not apply for Maldivians. Therefore, Maldivians can get done kidney operations in Sri Lanka. Minister Senaratne expressed these views during the recent meeting held with Maldivian Health Minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim.
Minister Senaratne said, kidney operations will be done for all Maldivian individuals under the recommendation of the Maldivian Government. He made a request from Minister Ibrahim to do regular screening for HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) for Sri Lankan workers employed in Maldives.
The Ministers agreed to discuss the topic again and sign the relevant agreements in September, during the WHO sessions for South and South East Asian countries.
