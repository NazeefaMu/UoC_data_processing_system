Malfunction on ice

Pyeongchang, Monday: French figure skater Gabriella Papadakis suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction on Monday, revealing a little more than just her Olympic gold medal ambitions in the ice dance competition.
A heavy title favourite along with partner Guillaume Cizeron, Papadakis’s skimpy dress slipped during a raunchy short routine in Pyeongchang to leave little to the imagination of millions of television viewers around the world.
Despite the sartorial setback the French pair were in second place behind Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who smashed the short dance world record.
The mishap happened when Papadakis leaned backwards early on and Cizeron inadvertantly managed to unclip the back of her racy green costume.
Her halter-top, complete with tassles and spangles, edged sideways to offer an unchoreographed flash of her left boob.
The pair were still able to finish as Papadakis tried in vain to keep her chest covered.
And to add insult to injury, the incident was replayed in slow motion on screens at the arena. AFP
