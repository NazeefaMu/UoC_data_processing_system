Review of SLC’s Women’s U23 Provincial Tourney

Sri Lanka Cricket in one of their talent-exploration missions with a view to unearthing the hidden talent especially among the upcoming young women cricketers in the island organized a short-three-day provincial tournament for women players of U23 age-category naming the three Provincial-teams which participated as Olu, Nelum and Manel.
In this tournament which was played on 25th, 26th and 27th of April, the three provincial teams concerned played each other in three matches at two venues, MCA and Maththegoda grounds. All three matches were of one-day duration subject to a maximum of 100 overs per match with each team playing two innings.
Despite the fact that no matches produced any positive results, Olu and Nelum recorded first-innings wins whilst Manel being a contestant in the only match that ended in no-result lost the other match they played against Olu failing to record a win of any sort in this short tournament. The opening match of the tourney was a low-scorer, but the next two showed certain progress as far as the batting was concerned.
Former all-rounder of Devapathiraja College-Rathgama, Sathya Sandeepani (Manel) who played also for North Central Province U26 side topped the tournament’s batting list with a tally of 94 runs at an average of 94, the highest in the tourney with former Teldeniya NS player, Harshani Wijeratne (79 runs) and Matara SC player, Malsha Shehani (78 runs) both of Olu following. Harshni Wijeratne’s 73-ball 62 against Manel was the tournament’s highest individual total.
In the bowling, Madushika Mettananda of Nelum captured a total of 8 wickets at a healthy average of 7 and an amazing economy of 1.87 to become the top-wicket taker of the tourney with 5 for 21 being her and tournament’s best innings analysis.
Malsha Shehani of Olu who was the third in the batting list finished with tournament’s best all-round display occupying the second spot in the bowling list with 7 wickets to her credit.
Malsha also was one of just two players in the tournament to complete a five-for with the ball. Sachini Sewwandi also of Olu finished third in the bowling list bagging 4 wickets at an economy of 1.67 which was the best in the tournament.
