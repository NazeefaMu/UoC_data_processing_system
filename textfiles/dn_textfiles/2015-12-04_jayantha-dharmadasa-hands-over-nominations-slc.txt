Jayantha Dharmadasa hands over nominations to SLC

Former President of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Jayantha Dharmadasa had reportedly handed over nominations to Sri Lanka Cricket today (04) to run for the post of President.
This increases the number of contestants for the chair of President to four while increasing the competitiveness of the contest. Thilanga Sumathipala, Nishantha Ranatunga and Sumith Perera are the other three contestants. Nominations of Thilanga Sumathipala were handed over to the SLC yesterday (03)       
Nishantha Ranatunga submitted nominations for the post of President of SLC on 26 November. He is a former SLC Secretary who was removed along with other board members including President Jayantha Dharmadasa before the government appointed an interim board.
