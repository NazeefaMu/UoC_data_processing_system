Chief of Defence Staff fails to report to CID

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne failed to report to the CID yesterday, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekera told Daily News.
The CDS was informed to report to the CID to record a statement for allegedly harbouring Lieutenant Commander Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath, who is implicated in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth in 2008-9.
Admiral Wijegunaratne was summoned before courts in September but he had left the country to participate in the Mexico’s 28th Independence Day Celebrations.
He was summoned to give a statement on the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had ordered the CID to take arrest the former Navy Commander and CDS on August 29 if there is sufficient evidence to prove that he had aided and abetted Navy Officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath to abscond the magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths.
The CID arrested Navy Sampath on Lotus Road in Colombo on August 13. He had been in hiding employed as a security guard at an estate using fake identity card.
Sufficient evidence was there to arrest the CDS for aiding the main suspect to evade arrest but he had to first report to the CID for a statement.
This was the second time he was summoned to the CID, but did not report to record his statement.
The media reported that Admiral Wijegunaratne was willing to reveal the truth before court as a responsible senior military officer, as he claims that he has never committed any wrong intentionally.
