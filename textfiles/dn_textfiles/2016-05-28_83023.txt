Defending champs Kandy SC aim for Sevens heaven

Every year inter club Sevens Rugby is one of the sport’s biggest tournaments to Sri Lanka which the city of Colombo conducts and enjoys. Eight of the best clubs in the country will face off on this day with some clubs fielding two teams , which will be invaded by fans from every corner of Kandy and Colombo. Once again the SLRFU should plan a good days rugby.
Kandy Sports Club who are the defending champions, who won the inter club League and the knockout title this season are gearing up for the inter club Sevens tournament , which is expected to be held in August, They will all be up against competitive seasoned Sevens players who will don rival jerseys for their respective sides at an event that has gathered momentum over the years.
The inter club sevens tournament was first held in 1976 in Colombo , where Havelock SC who beat CH and FC 30-0 were the very first champions with Trinity College taking the schools title. . Since then the tournament has been held every year (except once or twice) and held at various venues and also at one time in Kandy.
Kandy Sports Club first won the sevens championship in 1999 under Harris Omar and thereafter on many occasions. So this time some of the key players like Nigel Ratwatte, , Shehan Pathirane, Gyan Weerarthne, Aunuruda Willwera, Lavanga Perera are recovering from injuries. Any way they have some good sevens players like Roshan Weerarthne, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Soyuru Anthony, Arshad Jamaldeen, Anushka Gyan, Buwaneke Udaagamuwa to name a few. So, it will be ideal if they can invite Fazil Marija who is now involved with the national sides coaching to take over the Sevens team together with Saliya Kumara. Last time it was Saliya Kumar who coached the sevens team and they beat Havelock SC in the final under the captaincy of Fazil Marija. Today Sevens rugby is very popular in the country and Sri Lanka has a long history in the sevens field. It was in 1931 that the first sevens rugby game was played, that was in Ratnapura. The man who did everything possible to see to the kick off was K.F. Jenkins a Welshman. That game was between the Policemen and planters of the area. In 1941 the first ever major sevens tournament was held for Layard Cup.
Then in 1947 to mark the 25th year of CR & FC, Sydney de Zoysa and Winne Searasinghe came out with a tournament. It was CH & FC the first club to win a international sevens tournament that was the All India Sevens tournament in 1968. The side was led by John Burrows and together with Omar Sheriff made things easy for the winners. Kandy Sports Club under Lasantha Wijayasuriya won the 1997 All Pakistan Sevens.

Rauff Hakeem is keen to give Kandy Football a fillip
Former Royal College and Law College sportsman Rauff Hakeem who is now a minister, after reading my last Saturday’s article in the ‘Daily News’, Does anybody care for Kandy’s Football says that football is one of the most popular games and played by most of our countrymen, and he is willing to come forward to give a helping hand to promote the game in the Hill Capital.While thanking the Minister for showing concern he should see that the game is promoted in the correct way, Though there is no football played at club level, coaches and referees are having seminars.
Kandy’s sports lovers to start Health and fitness programmes
Staying fit is a great bonus in life and can lead you to be a happy and healthier person. By staying fit and healthy you not only look and feel better but you decrease your chance of medical problems such as diabetes, heart attacks, high cholesterol and hypertension. There are many helpful strategies to keep fit and stay healthy that, with dedication and ambition, can be done if proper guidance is given. So Kandy’s sports lovers are going to start a keep fit programme which is badly needed.
What I feel is to keep fit, one must Start walking or jogging . No matter what your speed is, walking, jogging and also cycling are important parts of a healthy lifestyle as they activate to keep your muscles active and your blood flowing. If you need to keep your knees strong or have body aches and pains then this sort of sport is the best. Come up with a daily walking, and jogging routine that fits with your schedule (i.e. go for a jog everyday). After a while you can increase your distance, speed and eventually time. For example, walk to work, school, marketing and sporting events. If you live close enough to work or school a good solution would be to start walking .
Sportsmen to meet Sports Minister
Kandy's football, cricket and hockey orgaizers have declined recently at club level to meet the sports minister. All these sports are in total disarray. A great effort is needed to bring back these sports to the standard where they were.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella is keen to give a helping hand. Looking back these three sports flourished earlier but now, sad to say, no one knows what is happening. Holding office alone is not sufficient, but those in office should promote the sport, nowadays they are more keen in coaching, umpiring and involved sports equipment.
Now, there are handful of sports promoters who have decided to meet the Sports Minister through Kandy’s sporting Minister Lakshman Kiriella to bring back the sports to the position where it was. It is important that those holding office at club level in the three sports get going to promote their respective sport, particularly because, unlike in the past where funding was a problem, now there are a number of corporate entities who are prepared to support any sport that is managed by clubs whose committees are comprised of those who have the knowledge of the subject they handle and could be trusted to work in the best interest of the sport.
Jayasinghe’s Badminton Academy doing well
Former national badminton player Thilini Jayasinghe who was the first Sri Lankan woman to qualify from the sport for Olympic Games, a product of Mahamaya Girls’ College Kandy. Gives a big hand to keep the sport alive over here in Kandy.
Thilini was selected on performances at 10 international meets where she was ranked 45th from a total of 48 contestants at the Beijing Games. She is a South Asian games medalist and also took part in Asian games and Commonwealth games .
Her main aim is to bring up the sport and produce good talented players both in boys and girls events. Like many other sports badminton was introduced to our country by the advent of British well over 100 years ago. It’s on record that the first Badminton Club was formed in 1909 in Radella at Dimbulla ACC where rugby and circlet was the most popular . It was in 1950 that “Badminton Association of Ceylon” was formed and first Senior National Men & Women Championships were conducted in the year 1953. Today, the Badminton could boast over 5000 taking part at the school level.
Over here in Kandy, at present Thilini Jayaisnghe gives a big hand to promote the game with limited facilities. She has nearly one hundred students from under 1 5 to 19 in her academy which is being coincided at Peradeniya University Gymnasium for both boys and girls. This is the biggest in the hills. She is being assisted by former Dhamraraja College player Harsha Perera. What she needs today is a good backing from the Sports Ministry, to keep the game alive and active.
Two good rugby games today

At Pallekelle Trinity will entertain the enterprising Science College in the “Cup” game while the Vidyartha side will clash with Lumbini in the “Bowl” at Pallekelle.
