Island paradox

After dealing with a flight from hell with a Russian techno-tippler that drank more than all of the rest of the people on the plane put together, I was very relieved, on arrival at Colombo airport, to be taken on a religious tour with my wonderful Jetwing Travels driver Ranjan. On meeting me at the airport handed me a cool towel and water, and as I gathered my thoughts as he was mildly amused by my stories of mile-high physical and mental torture by my travelling companion, a dementor who craved attention, any attention, even bad attention, the latter of which he found the most amusing. However, I unwittingly, moved on to another completely different kind of madness and demonic possession to be found hidden in the catholic enclave of Negombo.
3D sculptures
Being fascinated by different religions I booked on a religious tour of Negombo, and was amazed by how much Buddhism is buried in amongst this Catholic town known to many as Little Italy. I learn from Reverend Aluvihara Thusithagnana Thero that it is very important to have a Buddhist temple in a place where the majority are Christians and says the importance of Buddhism in Negombo is shown on Poya Days, when the temple gets around 10,000 people coming to Angurukaramulla to make special ritual food donations.
Barefoot, I entered the over 200 year old temple through a giant lion’s mouth, and was amazed by the elaborate and colourful 3D sculptures showing various stages of life with the second, after infancy, being a little guy with a cricket bat, which seemed to come even before learning to walk showing the importance of cricket in Sri Lanka. I placed some large pink flowers I bought at the entrance amongst others on the altar before the Buddha, paying tribute to a philosopher and his great philosophy.
The scale and multitude of sculptures in this temple are breath-taking but nothing prepares you for the madness hitherto hinted at. Next door to the temple, we were treated, along with plenty of families going about their religious business, to a range of sculptures depicting grotesque human mutilations of naked men and women at the hands of their darker skinned, red-bulging-eyed demonic tormentors, who were doing the bidding of their big kahuna at the beginning of the exhibits, sitting in state and twice the size of his subordinates. We were treated to an array of hacked off limbs, gouged out eyes on sticks, a woman tied upside down legs wide apart being hand sawn in half, a child being rolled in a barrel filled with bloodied spikes, further amputations, beheadings and goodness knows what else reminding us what happens to you if you do not follow the right path in life – I was beginning to wish I was back on the plane in scintillating conversation with the wannabe Cossack.
Spiritual traditions
What were the parents doing, showing their kids this or did they, too, stumble into this dungeon unsuspectingly like we did? And then, to cap it all, there was a collection box at the end of it, as if we would want to help pay for the upkeep of hell. That said, if you are the sort of person that would like the London Dungeons or New York underworld you’ll love this but what a contrast to the temple are the wonderful people you meet as you travel through this magical island.
Negombo is a great place to start exploring the religions of Sri Lanka and to see the dark demons that threaten her peace, side by side with three of the great religions and philosophies of the world. Our tour ended in old Negombo Fort at Sri Sithy Vinayagar Hindu temple on135 Sea Street, Negombo Fort. Just over the fishing bridge lies this spectacular 300-year-old kovil, renovated less than five years ago with vibrantly coloured spiritual figures, the gods framing the door, each one with a story to tell. I learn that Hinduism, with all its spiritual traditions, came to Sri Lanka through India’s tea estate workers that were brought over by the British. During the day you will see an old man taking coconuts, cracked on the front entrance stone, and turning them into coconut oil, which is added to wicks for lighting the pottery lamps inside.
Across the road garlands of fresh flowers are being strung together for the 6.45am pooja, when a daily ritual of mango or banana, rice with incense sticks, and flowers are stuffed inside a coconut bowl and made as offerings to the gods. Circumnavigate the temple clockwise and you will discover the painted carts representing different animals that belong to the gods and are seen as their vehicles to take them around. Every year in August there are ten days of processions known as the Awani Saduthi festival. These include taking statues, honouring the rat, elephant, tiger and lion, around the Negombo Fort backstreets in the early evening, with coconuts for good luck crushed under the wheels of the sacred carts. After lighting a candle we did a tour around the temple with a pilgrim and then headed on home spiritually richer from this very special tour.
