‘All contestants at NCE Export Awards are Winners’

The NCE launched the “Application Form” for the Annual Export Awards for 2018, at the Hotel Galadari and it was also announced that the awards event itself will be held this year at the Shangri -La Hotel on September 28, 2018.
Sunil Wijesinha the well-known professional who is the Chairman of the Panel of Judges for the selection of award winners for the event this year highlighted to the gathering the value of the NCE Annual Export Awards, and the contribution made by the event to the export development and economic development efforts of the Country.
“All contestants at the Annual NCE Export Awards Event are Winners”, in the sense that an event of this nature enables Sri Lankan Export enterprises to benchmark and enhance their performance in the internarial market place to face the modern competition related to International Trade. In order to emphasize this point he highlighted the example of Japanese enterprises which were completely devastated following the Second World War.
He stated that at that time the quality of Japanese products had been so poor that most countries were reluctant to import Japanese Goods. In this scenario the competitions that were organized by the Japanese Government to encourage improvements in quality, had paved the way for Japanese enterprises to rapidly improve the quality of their products as well as productivity to reduce costs of production.
As a result the quality of Japanese Products and Services reached high standards wherein domestic enterprises in developed countries began pressuring their Governments to restrict the import of Japanese goods, since they could not face the competition related to quality and price.
Wijesinha highlighted this classic example to emphasise the fact that competitions in the nature of the “NCE Export Awards” and similar events in other areas related to the export sector serves to raise standards by improving quality, productivity, and other aspects, to face the competition in the modern world of International Trade.
He complemented the NCE for conducting this prestigious event without a break since its inception, for over 25 years assuming national significance, and stated that this event served to fill a void which prevailed at that time due to the inability of the state sector to conduct the Presidential Export Awards regularly due to various reasons.
Finally in his address Wijesinghe outlined the process for the conduct of the event which consists of a two stage process.

He particularly emphasized the structural changes the event has undergone in recent years, as well as the improvements to the evaluation process of applicants to achieve the high professional standard enjoyed by the event today.
