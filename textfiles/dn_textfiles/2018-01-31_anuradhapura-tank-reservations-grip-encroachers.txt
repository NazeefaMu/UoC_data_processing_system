Anuradhapura tank reservations in grip of encroachers

Encroachment on reservations around irrigation tanks in the Anuradhapura District is an ongoing problem. The public say grama niladaries, farmer organizations, divisional secretaries and irrigation authorities are not taking any action in this regard.
Encroachment continues due to the lack of demarcation of tank reservation boundaries and delay in prosecuting the offenders and demolishing unauthorized buildings.
According to information submitted by the Irrigation Department to Anuradhapura government agent and the district agriculture committee, there are around 50 encroachers on the reservation belonging to Nuwarawewa reservoir which is the main drinking water distribution source for Anuradhapura city and suburbs. It is learnt that only three encroachers have been ejected under judicial orders during the last year.
Padaviya tank, which is among the main reservoirs in Anuradhapura District, has a capacity of 85,000 acre feet. According to Irrigation Department sources, the number of encroachers here is 136. At Rajanganaya reservoir site, 19 persons have encroached the reservation that comes under the tank located in Kokmaduwa and Kalaoya areas. In addition, there are a large number of persons who are unlawfully engaging in cultivation on the reservations in Rajanganaya, Thambuttegama, Giribawa and Galgamuwa DS divisions, ignoring the notices to evacuate by Rajanganaya officials.
With regard to Mahakanadarawa tank reservation, there are around 75 encroachers who have been cultivating the reserved landscape causing damage to the irrigational systems of the reservoir. In Huruluwewa tank reservation, encroachers numbering around 84 are engaged in occupying and cultivating land ignoring evacuation notices.
The Anuradhapura District agriculture committee has received complaints that the reservations of Nachchaduwa, Abayawewa and Tissawewa tanks too are gradually being encroached upon.
State officials and farmer organizations have requested the government agent and DAC that in order to avoid delay in prosecuting encroachers, district irrigation authorities be vested with power to taken action against encroachers, instead of the Irrigation Department in Colombo.
