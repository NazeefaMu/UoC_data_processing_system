Snap elections in Japan

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dissolved the lower house of Parliament last Monday and called a snap election on October 22, one year ahead of schedule. At present his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leads a coalition government.
He is taking advantage of a surge in his popularity that reached 50 percent, following his strong reaction to the North Korean missile crisis. Also the opposition is relatively weak at the moment.
However, a new party –Party of Hope – led by Tokyo’s former female Governor Yuriko Koike has emerged in the horizon and is gaining support. Several Opposition Democratic Party (DP) Parliamentarians have already joined the new party. There are also moves to amalgamate the DP with the new party. The Party of Hope proposes that Japan should be nuclear free, which is popular among the population. It also opposes a proposed tax hike. Both these positions give it an advantage over the LDP.
A survey by the Mainichi newspaper showed 18 percent of voters plan to vote for Koike's Party of Hope compared to 29 percent for Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
An Asahi newspaper poll showed 13 percent planned to vote for Koike's party versus 32 percent for the LDP.
The world as it is In the real world, the wealth owned by eight men altogether is equivalent to the wealth shared by 3.6 billion human beings, who make up the poorest half of humanity.
In terms of turnover, 69 of the 100 biggest entities of the world are transnationals, not States. The turnover of the world's ten biggest corporations is higher than the public revenues earned by 180 countries combined.
Seven hundred million persons live in extreme poverty; 21 million are victims of forced labour. In 2015, 5.9 million children died of preventable or curable diseases before reaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are illiterate.
Eight hundred and fifteen million persons suffer from chronic hunger -tens of millions more than in 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the precarious decreasing growth rate of recent years rebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face hunger by the year 2030, and this will not be enough to eradicate hunger by the year 2050.
It would be practically impossible to reach Sustainable Development goals by 2030.
There are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian tragedies associated to migrants flows worsen and increase amidst a clearly unjust international economic and political order.
The construction of walls and barriers as well as the laws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of refugees and migrants have proved to be cruel and ineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and xenophobic policies that violate the human rights of millions of persons and fail to solve the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts, which are the main causes of migration and refugee claims.
Military expenditures have increased to 1.7 trillion dollars. That reality belies those who claim that there are not enough resources to eradicate poverty.
UN to blacklist firms operating in occupied Palestine
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein has notified about 150 Israeli and international companies that they will be blacklisted for operating in Israeli occupied territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem al-Quds and Golan Heights. Over half of the companies were Israeli, nearly 30 were American and the rest were mainly from Germany, Norway and South Korea.
The companies include giant international corporations such as Coca-Cola, TripAdvisor, Airbnb and Caterpillar as well as major Israeli firms, including pharmaceutical giant Teva, the national phone company Bezeq, bus company Egged, the national water company Mekorot and the regime’s two largest banks, Hapoalim and Leumi.
Several of them have assured Hussein that they do not plan to renew their current contracts or to enter into new ones.
United Nations is compiling a list of companies that operate in these lands in violation of international law and UN resolutions.
World’s biggest Free Trade Zone
Complex negotiations are proceeding on the establishment of creating the world’s largest Free Trade Zone. Named the Integral Regional Economic Association (IREA) will include the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam as well as China, South Korea, Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand.
When finalized the 16-nation IREA will comprise half the world’s population and almost one third of the global Gross Domestic Product.
According to the most recent statistics of the World Bank, the economy of the United States is the biggest in the world with a value of 18 trillion dollars, almost one fourth of the world total (24.3 percent). After the U.S. are China (11 trillion dollars, 14.8 percent) and Japan (4. 4 trillion dollars, almost six percent).
Next places are Germany (3.3 trillion dollars); the United Kingdom (2.9) and France (2.4). India (two trillion dollars), Italy (1.8), Brazil (almost 1.8) and Canada (1.5) follow next.
China is not going to be second forever. In 2016, Chinese GDP expanded 6.7 percent, while that of the U.S. only grew by 1.6 percent. So it will surpass that of the US sooner or later.
The IREA is designed to cover trade of goods and services, investment, economic and technical cooperation, intellectual property rights, competition policy and the solving of disputes, among others. The megaproject will eliminate about 80 percent of the tariff barriers, that is, eight to nine thousand types of taxes.
