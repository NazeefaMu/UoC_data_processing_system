Insurance scheme for schoolchildren started by this govt: Ravindra

An insurance scheme for schoolchildren was started only by this government, Labour and Trade Union Relations State Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
Every schoolchild has an insurance cover for Rs. 200,000 which can be used to obtain medical treatment, the minister said.
The minister was addressing the gathering after distributing Rs. one million worth school equipment among children in Welimada recently.
Samaraweera said the government made certain changes during the past two years and arrangements will be made to repay loans taken to build the Hambantota harbour by commencing a joint venture with a Chinese company.
"No land will be sold as stated by some parties. The JVP is stating that the Hambantota harbour is to be sold. The JVP is saying so as they are scared of losing their power to the Front Line Socialist Party," he added.
