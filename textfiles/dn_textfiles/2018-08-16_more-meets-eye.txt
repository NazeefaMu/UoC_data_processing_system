More than meets the  eye!

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. But what if the beholder has depressingly dark circles under his or her eyes? Be it pollution, stress or sleepless nights of examination tension, you have enough reason to be worried about your appearance. Fortunately there are some simple and easy ways to avoid this issue. Follow these guidelines to rejuvenate your eyes.
Defining under eye dark circles
Simply put, perorbital dark circles are a result of the thin layer of skin below your eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood they contain more clearly than anywhere else on your body. (For reference, this skin around your eyelids, called perorbital skin, is on average about 0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about 2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)
Under eye dark circles and heredity
Hereditary dark circles under your eyes look just like other dark circles - they show up as round, uniform areas of darker skin underneath your eyes. The difference is that hereditary dark circles are determined by genetics, so while you can do things to make them look worse or better, you can't control whether or not you have them in the first place.
A few different types of dark circles may be hereditary. Most dark circles are caused by allergies, which can be hereditary.
When you rub your eyes to soothe irritation, you may be causing dark circles. Some people may also have more pigment beneath the eyes or slower vascular movement, also hereditary traits. Thin skin and pale skin, both hereditary traits, can also cause dark circles.
Best eye serum for under eye dark circles
Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides, and Humectants: these work to moisturize the delicate skin around the eyes. The periorbital area is a common area that dries and irritates easily, especially in women since we are applying multiple products daily. Therefore, keeping a strong skin barrier to this delicate area is crucial; Lightening products with kojic acid, glycolic acid, hydroquinone, vitamin c can be helpful. Products with hyaluronic acid can also help hydrate the skin, which can help with the under-eye appearance.
Products to use for eye puffiness and to brighten under the eyes
Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide): This vitamin not only calms down redness and inflammation but stimulates collagen production and increases free fatty acids in the skin to hydrate, tranexamic acid from lytera helps reduce pigmentation as well as phenylethyl resorcinol and niacinamide, tetrapeptide-30 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide, which all balance melanin production.
Under eye dark circle causes
l Sleep deprivation and tiredness: A lack of sleep or excessive tiredness results in pale skin, making blood under the skin become more visible and appear more blue or darker.
l Smoking and drinking: Late night parties, smoking and drinking can play havoc with your skin and result in dark eye circles. Dark eye circles could be a sign of loss of water from the body (dehydration) due to excessive drinking and intake of caffeinated drinks.
l Sun exposure: Increased exposure to the sun can draw pigmentation of the skin’s surface and create dark circles. Long sun exposure produces more melanin around eyes than usual, giving them a darker colour. There are two main layers of skin, the outer layer of skin known as epidermis and inner layer known as dermis. When excess melanin is being made in the epidermis it appears brown, and when there is more than usual melanin in the dermis it looks blue or blue grey.
l Hormonal changes: In women, the skin undergoes lots of changes during the phase of pregnancy and menstruation, causing darkening under the eyes.
l Allergies: Any condition that causes the eyes to itch may contribute to darker circles due to rubbing or scratching the skin around them. Apart from that, some food allergies can also cause the area under the eyes to appear darker. In fact, dark circles in children often indicate allergy problems. Research also suggests that dark circles are linked to anemia, and liver diseases.
l Anemia: Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of inexplicable dark circles in many cases, which can be treated by making simple changes in your diet. Low iron levels is the most common form of anemia, and results in poor oxygenation in body tissues due to low supply of oxygenated blood. Thus, always take a balanced diet rich in green leafy vegetable, dairy products and all types of fruits to keep your body healthy.
l Dehydration: Dehydration is one of the most common reasons for dark circles under the eyes. The reason is the close proximity to the skin underneath the eye in relation to the underlying bone. When the body does not have a proper amount of water, the symptoms are often evident in this specific area. Thus it is advisable to have at least 8 to10 glasses of water and include fresh fruit daily. It is also advisable to restrict the intake of caffeinated drinks such as tea, coffee, alcohol and other caffeinated drinks as it aggravates dehydration.
