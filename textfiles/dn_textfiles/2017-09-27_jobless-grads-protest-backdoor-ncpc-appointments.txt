Jobless grads protest backdoor NCPC appointments

A group of unemployed graduates in the North Central Province yesterday blocked all gates of the North Central Provincial Council to protest the granting of appointments to 484 graduates to schools in an informal manner. These graduates said that over 400 graduates have been granted appointments to schools that come under the North Central Provincial Council without following proper procedure.
Officials and the public were inconvenienced as graduates blocked the gates preventing them from leaving the provincial council premises for over five hours.
However police succeeded in opening the gates by dispersing the protesters at around 2.30 p.m.
