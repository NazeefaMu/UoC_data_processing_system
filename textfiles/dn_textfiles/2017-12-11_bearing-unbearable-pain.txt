Q – What is palliative care ?
A - Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families who are facing problems associated with life-threatening illness. It prevents and relieves suffering through the early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other problems. Palliative care is the prevention and relief of suffering of any kind – physical, psychological, social, or spiritual –experienced by adults and children living with life-limiting health problems. It promotes dignity, quality of life and adjustment to progressive illnesses, using best available evidence.
Q – Who needs Palliative care ?
A - Palliative care is required for patients with a wide range of life-limiting health problems. The majority of adults in need of palliative care have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, AIDS and diabetes. Patients with many other conditions may require palliative care, including kidney failure, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, congenital anomalies and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
Q – What is the main issue of the patients who need Palliative care ?
A - Pain is one of the most frequent and serious symptoms experienced by patients in need of palliative care. Opioid analgesics are essential for treating the pain and other common distressing physical symptoms associated with many advanced progressive conditions. For example, 80 percent of patients with cancer and 67 percent of patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will experience moderate-to-severe pain at the end of their lives.
Q – How should we take care of hunger and thirst of the patients who are under palliative care ?
A – Such patients’ physical activities are limited and therefore food and beverages should be given to them only according to their hunger and thirst. Giving them more food and drinks than their requirement leads to several other problems. Food and drinks should not be given by force. If given by force, the food and drinks can be entered into windpipe and ends up in lungs. It may lead to develop Pneumonia. If the patient can swallow, soft food and drinks in small quantities should be given using a spoon or a syringe. The mouth should be kept clean by using a piece of wet cotton wool or a piece of wet cloth. Vaseline or lip balm can be used to keep the lips moisture and prevent from drying.
Q – What about the eye problems faced by such patients ?
A – Usually such patients do not close their eyes completely (like healthy people) during their sleep. This can lead to dry eyes and watering eyes. The patients should be kept in a position that helps them to close their eyes easily. Saline or other eye drop (prescribed by a doctor) should be put into eyes every two hours. Wipe eyes gently if there are tears. Do not try to close the eyes completely.
Q – How can the patient handle the pain ?
A – The pain can be due to the disease, due to staying in the same position for a long time and due to wounds and bruises. Change the patients’ position once in every two or three hours.
Keep the skin moistured and dry. Give pain killers according to the instructions of a doctor or a nurse. Do not give additional pain killers (even when the patient demands) because they can be poisonous. (To be continued).
