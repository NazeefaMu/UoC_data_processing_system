President instructs to raid shops selling rice above MRP

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday directed the authorities to raid shops that sell rice above maximum retail price, Presidential Media sources told the Daily News.
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has currently re-issued a new Maximum Retail Price (MRP) order for three varieties of rice, with the inclusion of locally milled rice.
