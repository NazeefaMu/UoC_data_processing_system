Indian High Commission organises GST workshop

At the request of government of Sri Lanka, the High Commission of India organised a workshop on Goods and Service Tax (GST), at the Taj Samudra, Colombo, on March 23.
A three-member delegation from Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), government of India, headed by Commissioner Upendra Gupta conducted the workshop. Director General, Department of Commerce, government of Sri Lanka, Sonali Wijeratne and Indian Deputy High Commissioner Arindam Bagchi were also present.
Several officials from various ministries and departments in Sri Lanka, representatives of the trade chambers, and members from the industry were also present. The discussions highlighted the fact that Sri Lankan exporters will now have access to hitherto unexplored markets of various states in India, thanks to uniform rates of taxation all over India under the new GST Act.
Launched in July 2017, GST is hailed as India’s biggest tax reform since independence. GST has resulted in economic integration of India, by subsuming more than a dozen State and Central levies into one tax.
GST has unified 29 states of India into a common national market for the first time. GST has also substantially increased ease of doing business in India. The new tax system has mitigated cascading effects in taxation as well as ensured transparency, certainty and simplicity.
The new GST system will bring down the cost of imports and exports for Sri Lanka from and to India.
Traders based in Sri Lanka will not have to bear the cost of any indirect tax except the basic Customs duty and social welfare surcharge applicable.
Traders in India can now claim GST paid on imported goods as tax credit from the government of India.
