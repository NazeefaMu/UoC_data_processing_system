Joyous Jothi

Epa enna kiyala…moko Menike keewae….. Hinawenna awath…Handewwe oyanae…..
H R Jothipala is an artiste who dwells in common man’s heart forever. As the only local artiste who became more popular after his demise Jothi reminds us of Elvis Presley, the King.
Jothipala’s singing prowess was never recognized by scholars in his living days. Instead he was often undermined by these so-called wise men highlighting the fact that he sang Hindi melodies. Nevertheless they deliberately ignored the magical manner Jothipala rendered justice to Hindi melodies. Jothi often surpassed original singers by bringing value addition to the Sinhala versions.
Sarath Dassanayake, Pandith Amaradewa, Dr Victor Ratnayake and Dr Premasiri Khemadasa were musicians who identified Jothi’s miraculous singing abilities. Hence they made original melodies for Jothi and with his voice Jothi made these songs evergreen ones. In the film Anupama, the way Jothi delivers his voice to the duet Sihina Wilae Nilupuli… is one such example.
70s decade was the golden era of Sinhala cinema. Cinema culture prevailed in the country at the time encouraged families to flock at cinema halls. Gamini Fonseka and Vijeya Kumaratunga captured the limelight. Jothipala’s screen voice breathed much life to these two actors in their singing portrayals on screen.
A lengthy singing career spanning from 1950 bestowed Jothi’s mighty fan club with a gamut of songs sung with his golden voice. When he bid adieu to life in 1987 Jothipala had over 10,000 songs to his merit.
H R Jothipala statue was unveiled in 1988. At the ceremony Vijeya Kumaratunga said “I lost my voice on screen with Jothi’s demise.
His voice was in extreme harmony with my screen personality. Now there is no one who could sing for me on screen.”
Had Jothi born in India or any other country, volumes of books would have been written on this legend. In Sri Lanka senior journalist Earnest Waduge wrote two volumes on Jothipala. Dr Nuwan Nayanajith and Dr Sarath Amunugama have written articles on Jothi for a magazine and cinema tabloids.
Says Dr Nuwan Nayanajith,“Jothipala was not an icon created by marketing. Hence Jothipala brand has no growth stage, maturity stage or decline stage. He is an evergreen figure.
He represents the culture brought forward by Gajaman Nona thus is a cultural figure and that is the reason he stays in common man’s heart forever”.
Dr Nuwan Nayanajith wrote an insightful article on Jothipala to a souvenir produced by SLRC in 2007 for a Jothipala commemorative program.
Commemorative stamp
A commemorative stamp on H R Jothipala was launched at the Gangaramaya on February 12 to coincide with the legend’s 80th birth anniversary.
The occasion was graced by Post, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister Abdul Haleem, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke along with veteran media person Ariyadasa Peiris who paved way for Jothi to become a singer.
Jothipala’s close associates Padmasiri Kodikara, Ananda Padmasiri, Jayananda Alwis and Jothi’s fans too were in the auditorium. Their moist eyes told the untold story of a humble soul who loved people and sang for them until his death even neglecting his own health. Senior artiste Nihal Nelson said at the occasion, Jothipala and Milton Perera would have lived more but liquor took its toll.
He thanked the organizing committee and made a humble request to honour Ariyadasa Peiris too with a stamp as a gesture of appreciation.
Jothipala’s daughter krishni Narmada said, “My father will be a superstar forever within peoples’ minds”.
