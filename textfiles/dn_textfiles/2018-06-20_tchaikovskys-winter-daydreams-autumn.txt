TCHAIKOVSKY'S WINTER DAYDREAMS IN AUTUMN

The greatness in Tchaikovsky is that no one could reach his work to perfection. Try as one would, there will always be a flaw.
His first large-scale compositions began to emerge with Symphony No. 1, Winter's Daydreams among others. By then, he was established as one of the greats of his time, later to become the world's No. 1 composer to date.
Yet, there is no doubt that one thing Brits do brilliantly is to perform their classical music. The rush to get to their seats tonight was one mad scramble in which I too got pushed along until I reached my seat at the Royal Albert Hall, the prestigious, most popular and revered theatre in Britain. The Brits were dressed casually at this formal concert with none of their scruffy overcoats.
Autumn was kind, gentle and soothing tonight.
The vast arena jam-packed rose together as the conductor of Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Vasily Petrenko with a loud round of applause as he entered and stood centre - stage. The occasion, BBC presented the Henry Wood Promenade Concert.
Tonight, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 1 in G minor. WINTER DAYDREAMS took off with no fuss or fervour. A treat to watch the massive orchestra with those talented musicians so very professional, it appeared Petrenko had no problems with his baton.
This Allegro Tranquillo symphony beings as no other symphony of his; more gently or undemonstratively, yet within the next couple of minutes the unassuming flute and bassoon theme and especially the nervous chromatic idea that swiftly accompanies it, have built up an opening to extend a self-sufficient shortest of transitions to the second movement, could have been inappropriate which means that none of Tchaikovsky's symphonic openings was ever to grow more convincingly nor were his second movements to testify more eloquently to his melodic powers. In the neatly proportioned reminder of this first movement, two passages were especially striking they open out impressively and fade away to the end furtively.
Salvaged from an orchestra piece called THE STORM, the hushed string passage that opened and closed the second movement was composed in 1864 as a vacation exercise.
Conductor Petrenko rose to the occasion bringing down his baton between these flanks which is the decorative side of Tchaikovsky's art and elaborate many of the 10 short phrases that make up to the oboe theme followed up by the viola and flute theme that followed and later oboe's fourth phrase.
Perhaps, the pervading gentle melancholy of this lovely Adagio offers some justification for the title given by Tchaikovsky which I find difficult to understand. Yet, it is so alive and clear in character.
But why on earth WINTER DAYDREAMS? This symphony No.1 minor, op. 13 composed in 1866 and revived in 1874, explains all in what was played tonight:
01. Daydreams of a Winter Journey; Allegro Tranquillo
02. Land of Desolation, Land of Mists; Adagio cantabile ma non tanto.
03. Scherzo; Allegro scherzando giocoso
04. Finale; Andante lugubre - Alleegro moderato - Allegro maestoso - Allegr vivo.
These four major movements combined in WINTER DAYDREAMS
In particular, in the Finale the Russian folk song is the foundation both in the slow introduction and rough second movement, in the ensuing sonata movement.
WINTER DAYDREAMS, however, is not Tchaikovsky's outstanding scores but he has one little surprise which is the return of the slow introduction after the recapitulation of the first movement followed by a horror passage leading to the second which probably fill out the blueprint of a sonata form with a mixture of melody and counterpoint. I find The Finale lacks that inner growth that makes the opening movement so impressive but provides an effective ending. For me, it was listening experience that ruffled my head. Some of the movements simply bored me.
When finally Petrenko brought down the baton on the last note. I was revived. That is as far as Tchaikovsky's is concerned but he is beyond a single symphony that may not appeal to me and to so many music lovers like me. Apart from that feeling, to me, Tchaikovsky's symphonies are like a tale of two halves. The first half begins with DAYDREAMS ON A WINTRY ROAD which is the maestro's own title for the first movement of his FIRST SYMPHONY which feels like a fairy-tale, albeit minus the bi-tonal Polish and the Finale to his THIRD SYMPHONY. The second half was scored two years later and together what I was listening tonight at the moment along with about one thousand people.
Tchaikovsky himself confirmed what is already unmistakable; that this is a drama of Fate and of Mankind's struggle to evade it. His symphonic career ended barely two months before his death with the tragic slow Finale to his Sixth Symphony ebbing into the abject gloom.
Something tonight's audience felt after the last note died and faded off.
