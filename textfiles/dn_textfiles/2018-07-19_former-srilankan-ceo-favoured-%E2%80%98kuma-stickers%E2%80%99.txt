Former SriLankan CEO favoured ‘Kuma Stickers’

It was revealed that former SriLankan Airlines CEO Kapila Chandrasena had ordered to handover the contract of providing SriLankan Airlines advertising hoardings to ‘Kuma Stickers’.
The airlines’ Network Planning and Research Manager Priyadarshanai Epitawela said the CEO had ordered as such as the said company had helped the former regime.
This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misappropriation of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka during its sittings yesterday.
She said that proper tender procedures had not been followed when awarding such contracts.
She said so while being cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana.
