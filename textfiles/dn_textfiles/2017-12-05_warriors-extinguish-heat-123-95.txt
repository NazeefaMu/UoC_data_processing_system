Warriors extinguish Heat, 123-95

Los Angeles: The NBA champion Golden State Warriors rode a dominant third quarter to a decisive 123-95 victory over the Heat in Miami on Sunday.
Miami took a 36-33 first-quarter lead despite 16 points in the period from Stephen Curry.
“When they smell blood, they go for it,” said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. “So many of their guys just come alive when they start to get it rolling -- each one of them becomes ignitable.
“They start foaming at the mouth when the game starts to turn.”
The Warriors saw forward Shaun Livingston ejected in the second quarter after making contact with a game official while arguing a non-call. But they roared ahead in the third quarter, opening the second half with a dunk from Kevin Durant en route to a 12-2 scoring run. The Warriors outscored the Heat 37-17 in the third to take a 99-77 lead into the final frame.
Curry finished with 30 points as the Warriors improved to 3-0 on their current road trip.Durant added 24 and Klay Thompson scored 19.
The Warriors seemed fired up by the ejection of Livingston, who thought he was fouled on a shot attempt and leaned in to argue with the referee. He bumped heads with the official, who also appeared to be moving forward, and was instantly sent to the locker room.
The Oklahoma City Thunder held off the depleted San Antonio Spurs 90-87, aided by Russell Westbrook’s seventh triple-double of the season.
Westbrook scored 22 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Thunder, who led 90-82 before failing to score in the final 3:34.
A turnover in the closing seconds gave San Antonio a chance to tie the game, but Brandon Paul missed a three-pointer and Oklahoma City’s Raymond Felton grabbed the rebound to seal it.
Steven Adams added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, whose 20 turnovers made it closer than was comfortable against a Spurs team missing Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. AFP
