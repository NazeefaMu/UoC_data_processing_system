Paris Accord – waiting for the one-eyed physician

The day was Sunday July 4, 1955 and time around 10 o’clock in the morning. This is the day which gave me my first jolt in life.
We were informed by a neighbour that my father had met with an accident at Dodanduwa and had been taken to the Galle hospital. He was a reputed ayurvedic physician at Gonapinuwela and used to treat a lot of patients from Baddegama, Hikkaduwa and Dodanduwa.
On this Sunday, he left home at about 8.00 am on the bicycle to see some patients at Hikkaduwa and Dodanduwa and he had been travelling from Hikkaduwa to Dodanduwa along Galle Road to see another patient when this accident had taken place.
Fortunately, there were only some bruises. The police officer who was investigating told us that he had been crossing the road when a car had come from his blind side – my father had only his left eye - and knocked him down and that he should avoid crossing on the bike and get down and cross and then start riding again.
Although I never thought about that patient who was waiting for him at Dodanduwa on that day, today I tend to think about what would have happened to the patient.
Paris Accord – the comparison
I tend to think that the Paris Accord is also like my father who had only one eye. Paris Accord also looks at climate change only through temperature and carbon dioxide and is blind to precipitation and water vapour.
Of course, there would be a few differences in that while in my father’s case, only the safety of his mobility was impaired, but not his ability to diagnose and prescribe.
However in the case of the Paris Accord, the diagnosis has already been faulted and as such prescription will also be at fault. Another aspect is that my father’s patient will only wait for a few hours and then would seek medical assistance elsewhere; but in the case of Paris Accord we may be waiting till 2100 AD to know that the whole treatment had been based on CO2 and temperature and not the total array of symptoms.
Unlike in my father’s case, the patient’s lifetime is much longer and hence the ailment may change a lot during this lifetime.
Roadmap to 2100
The Paris Accord has already diagnosed climate change to be mainly due to the excessive CO2 generated by the combustion of fossil fuels.
The diagnosis is as follows: This CO2 generated by combustion of fossil fuel increases temperature of the atmosphere.
Then this increased temperature due to CO2 will make the atmosphere pick up more moisture to maintain constant relative humidity. When this additional water vapour enters the atmosphere, it would make the atmospheric temperature go up further.
So, the one-eyed physician (OEP) prescribes what is to be done as follows: Instead of using coal – the fuel with the highest percentage of C in the fuel or the fuel which would emit the highest amount of CO2, i.e. 0.37 kg of CO2 per every kWhr of energy generated, we should use other fuels which emit lesser quantities of CO2 per unit of energy generated; for example, gas which emits only 0.23 kg of CO2per kWhr.
We knew when we use another fuel with a lesser fraction of carbon, the other fraction could be hydrogen to give us the balance energy; and this hydrogen will obviously yield newly formed water vapour during the combustion process.
The OEP may have thought that since the global precipitation per year is about 40 times the total amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, every water molecule which gets into the atmosphere from below would also come down in a matter of 7-14 days irrespective of the temperature at which it enters the atmosphere or the parcel of heat content it takes up with it.
The OEP may have thought that precipitation is not a problem; after all it is only H2O and it is something we experience everyday.
Based on this hypothesis, OEP says that only water vapour that could stay back in the atmosphere for any period longer than 2 weeks is the water vapour getting into the atmosphere to retain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature due to extra CO2 in the atmosphere.
Integrated Global System Model Version 2 (IGSM 2) developed by MIT Joint Programme on the Science of Policy of Global Change clearly indicates that the climate scientist community has missed out on the newly formed water vapour (NFW) generated by the combustion of hydrogen containing fuels - oil and gas – introduced in order to reduce the greenhouse gas effect due to CO2 from fuels like coal.
International Energy Agency
When any group promotes keeping the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere below a certain value – a peak beyond which we should try to reduce CO2 concentration in order to limit the increase in temperature - it implies that the group considers (a) CO2 to be the main reason for the increase in temperature and (b) any effect due to H2O to be due to the positive feedback only.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) very proudly says that the only fuel they intend to increase usage is natural gas. Even in their Energy Outlook – 2013, they say that they intend to be using 18% more of natural gas in 2035 than that which they used in 2011.
This is exactly what the OEP would have prescribed. CO2 is very harmful, H2O is what we drink; so generating energy while reducing CO2 and producing more H2O is good climate policy. They probably didn’t see the harmful side of NFW.
Is natural gas worse than coal
I thought that the best way to convince the climate scientist community regarding the ill effects of NFW over CO2 is to present a comparison table of their effects on the climate. For this comparison I have the usage of coal, gas and oil in 2011 as given in the IEA document. For this comparison, I have identified a few parameters and computed their values for the three fuels coal, oil and gas quantities used in the year 2011.
I have computed the temperature increases due to CO2 alone, NFW as well as any H2O vapour getting into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated atmospheric temperature arising from CO2 and NFW.
These values are given in the table below.
Please note that I am fully aware of the non-linear behavior of the relationships I have used in these computations and am confident that the basic conclusions regarding the relative impacts of CO2, NFW emissions from different fossil fuels considered would be accurate.
I can also explain each and every entry in this table. I leave it to the climate scientists to work these parameters using the different modeling techniques, sophisticated software at their disposal and either verify or nullify the figures given in this table.
I am more interested in the comparison to be drawn between the three fuels rather than in the absolute values of the parameters considered.
 
+ This is the NFW in products of combustion stream.
 
*These figures do not include water in the products of combustion stream (NFW).
The outcome of these computations can be summarized as follows;
 
(1) Potential for increased precipitation due to fossil fuel combustion is zero for coal, highest for gas being almost double that for oil for the same amount of energy released.
 
(2) Depletion of oxygen in the atmosphere is also zero for coal, highest for gas being almost double that for oil for the same amount of energy released.
(3) Total overall increases in temperature for gas and oil, per unit of energy released, are respectively 68% and 44% higher than for coal.
Paris Accord – One-eyed Physician
When we look at these figures one could easily see what the one-eyed physician, who sees only the impact of CO2 and temperature increases, would do to the global climate.
When the Paris Accord talks about limiting (a) CO2 in the atmosphere and (b) temperature to 20C only by 2100 AD, the accord is definitely turning a blind eye towards NFW and precipitation and we have to wait till the OEP completes the assignment in 2100. In the meantime, all of us will get washed away by the increased precipitation reminding me how my father was hit by a vehicle which was coming from behind. Now that we know what Paris Accord – the one-eyed physician will bring us, we need to identify how we are going to resolve these issues. For us to do that we should know what we will have to confront.
Nearly 60% of natural disaster related fatalities in the world is due to flooding. Right now we are confronting wild fires in USA and Canada and floods in Japan. We have just got over from flooding in California.
Chile, a country using near 35% of both hydro and coal power was also experiencing wild fires only a few months ago.
Thus we need to get over increases in temperature and precipitation both and the above table shows us that neither coal, oil nor gas is going to help us. Right now, coal will give us some consolation in that its contribution to both these happens to be the lowest.
Paris Accord – future prospects
If Paris Accord were to identify a source of energy, without any emissions, which is of universal applicability across the world, there obviously can’t be any other better than the solar energy. As it is been practiced today, the main options are (a) solar parks of various types such as photovoltaic, concentrated solar thermal , etc. (b) rooftop installations and (c) floating solar installations. These do have advantages, disadvantages and limitations associated with each of them. A Nobel Prize winner in Physics has said that the main reasons for global warming are (i) deforestation and (ii) tarred road surfaces.
The solar parks, of course, implies deforestation thus depriving the global forest cover certain amounts of (a) absorption of CO2 thus disturbing the material balance of the globe, (b) reflection of solar radiation thus disturbing the energy balance of the globe and (c) water vapour getting into the atmosphere through transpiration disturbing the water balance between the atmosphere and earth’s surface.
All these are detrimental to the environment and will lead to global warming.
It is in this light we present our innovative highway solarisation – that is dedicated infrastructure to generate electricity to power electric vehicles or main grid using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above highways as a solution for climate change - which will enable mankind to tap solar energy to generate electricity and at the same time eliminate 1.4 kWhrs of global warming for every 1 kWhr fed to the main grid or for charging battery electric ehicles thereby negating a significant portion of environmental damage due to highway construction, as a solution for climate change.
Conclusion
We should thank President Donald Trump for making us relook at coal as a source of energy in a more holistic fashion and drawing our attention to the possibilities of photovoltaic solar as having enormous potential to provide energy for American citizens. He has also made us draw appropriate and relevant comparisons between contributions of coal, oil and gas towards climate change and we would not be surprised if he decides to promote coal power again in USA at 30 to 60 degrees North (we need to note that this is in view of how Hadley and Walker circulations affect USA). Of course, he will surely get American climate scientists scrutinize the data we have provided. In a genuine endeavor to bring in a solution for handling all three climate parameters temperature, precipitation and wind, he may look at highway solarisation as another solution devoid of coal, gas and oil.
