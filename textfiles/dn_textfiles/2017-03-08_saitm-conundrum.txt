The SAITM conundrum

The subject of private medical education seems to have gained centre stage and both print and electronic media are laden with very hot news. The whole country has become the hotbed of politics over the subject and many a writer expressed his or her ideas very frankly on the subject.
I took my own time and spent my hard earned money to keep abreast of time and thus I was able to educate some of my friends over the matter during the last few days. Yet, lo and behold, an article written on the subject took my mind away from the main point and I was lost in it, there was nothing in it on the subject, but a long harangue on the language policy of a bygone era. I was not able to find any relevance to the subject, but I sensed some hatred towards some leaders who reined the administration.
That is history.
Now the die is cast.
What we have to focus is the validity of the SAITM degree and its quality and standard, as responsible citizens. Most of the vociferous speakers and writers had touched on the subject with sensibility, but not with sense. Both the writers and the readers should put the relevant subject on the hammer from different angles. It is our bounden duty to educate the public based on the acceptable truth, not on the fabricated stories.
Degree factories
For my own purposes, I cross-examined some members of the general public and found out that majority is against private medical education without the required theoretical and clinical training. Let’s keep apart the theories, but clinical aspect is of paramount importance. Some of the members in favour of SAITM were those who have sent their children there. Some were the relations of the would-be victims. Some others were the parents who wish to send their children there one day, but rational minded right thinking members of the society are dead against it. Money can do many worldly things, but making a doctor with money is illogical. Then a very very moneyed parent could make all his offspring the disciples of Hippocrates, proverbially overnight. I personally know the parents of some of the learned professors there brought them up with great difficulty. If there had been SAITMS by that time they couldn’t have become professors. We have to speak to the very heart’s core in these matters of national importance.
The new breed of medical men generated from these degree factories would widen the social disparity paving for another bloodbath on our soil. So, our deliberations on these matters should essentially be far reaching. The tone of the writers speaks volumes for their inner disposition. On the other hand, if the parents could spend over hundred and twenty lakhs of rupees on one child, why can’t they do something else for the future of their children? After all doctors are born, not made. Let the natural course decide their future. I don’t wish to mention here, but I did it and I conquered. Medicine is a sacred profession and the government has to safeguard its precision.
The writer had displayed a table for us to study the spread of private medical universities in the region.
I was very happy to learn that there was not a single one in our country. He has cited a huge number in India. It is something important. In this paper itself, very recently it reported in the foreign news page that a private medical university manager had issued 100 MBBS degrees for just 100 dollars each.
Private medical universities in India
Another authentic experience with me is that when I was teaching in an island in the Maldives, there was an Indian doctor on the same island. His standard and quality was quite palpable to me. There is a wide spread notion that most of the private medical universities in India offer substandard medical degrees.
The number of doctors in India has posed a national crisis there and should we also here face the same tragedy here by letting our rules loose. Narrow-mindedness should not ruin the country.
Everyone from the grassroots level to the upper echelons seem to have embroiled in the labyrinth of this conundrum, yet utmost care should be taken in giving a solution because all the decision making body has to go before the poor masses for their survival. State medical education and private medical education are two different things.
Never the twain shall meet.
