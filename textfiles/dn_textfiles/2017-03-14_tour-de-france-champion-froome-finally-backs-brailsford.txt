Tour de France champion Froome finally backs Brailsford

London: Three-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome finally rallied to the defence of under-fire Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford on Monday.
Brailsford, the man behind Great Britain’s rise as an Olympic cycling superpower, has been under intense scrutiny but has insisted he will not resign from his Sky post despite being engulfed in rows over both doping and sexism.
British Cycling was already reeling from revelations it mishandled the drugs records of star rider Bradley Wiggins, when Brailsford was labelled “untouchable” in a leaked review publish Friday of how the national governing body handled sexism allegations against a leading coach.
Froome’s relative silence had led to suggestions he was trying to distance himself from Brailsford as the likes of Team Sky colleague Geraint Thomas offered their support. But a statement issued Monday saw Froome, the Tour de France champion in 2013, 2015 and 2016, offer his backing to Brailsford. AFP
