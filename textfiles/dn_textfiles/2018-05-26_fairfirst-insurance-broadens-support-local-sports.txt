Empowers MCA ‘F’ division 25 over League Tournament 2018
Fairfirst Insurance broadens support for local sports

Although a considerably new entrant into the Mercantile Sporting community, Fairfirst have already made their presence felt. The reigning champions of the Mercantile Basketball Tournament men’s ‘A’ Division, Fairfirst also partook for the very first time, in this year’s Mercantile Netball Tournament ‘C’ Division and came in as the runners up. During last year’s Mercantile Rugby 7’s, Fairfirst yet again came in as runners up in the Shield category, despite that being the team’s very first rugby encounter.
Similarly, Fairfirst is a passionate advocate of Sri Lanka’s sporting fraternity. This is not the first endorsement the company has extended. Last year Fairfirst, extended their support to the Sri Lankan basketball team that attended the FIBA 3x3 World Championships that was held in France. They also sponsored the FIBA 3x3 Basketball Nations League 2017 that was hosted in Sri Lanka.
On May 17 at a media conference held at the MCA, Fairfirst Insurance officially secured sponsorship of the Mercantile Cricket Association ‘F’ Division 25 – Over League Tournament 2018.
28 teams pooled into four groups will battle it out for the Fairfirst Trophy. The initial phase of the tournament which is already underway will conclude on the June 17. This will be followed by the elimination stage of the top 16 teams from the league and the grand finale happening on the July 14 at the MCA Grounds.
Speaking on this new partnership was Head of Marketing and Digital Solutions Sasith Bambaradeniya “We have always been a passionate supporter of local talent. This tournament is another opportunity for us to fuel and recognize sportsmanship within the local and corporate community”.
The company’s most recent campaign themed ‘Give It a Try’ is a specimen of the brand’s aspirant and youthful identity. The rather witty campaign portrays some of the brightest and most venerated players of the National cricket team including Angelo Mathews, Chaminda Vaas, Kusal Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dilruwan Perera and Sadheera Samarawickrama.
“This is an exciting proposition for us. We are very happy to be nurturing young talent and influencing them to grow their capabilities” stated Dr. Sanjeev Jha – Managing Director and CEO of Fairfirst Insurance.
