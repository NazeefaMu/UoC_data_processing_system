Lloyd Paternott 50 years of Cambrian captaincy

Former Prince of Wales’ College cricket captain, Ceylon Combined Schools and Sri Lanka Air Force, Negombo Sports Club, Oman Air Force and Singha Cricket Club Oman cricketer Lloyd Paternott will be celebrating fifty years of his captaincy at his alma mater. Paternott played from 1964 to 1967 and captained the school in his final year before joining the then Royal Ceylon Air Force. Paternott met up with the Daily News at his residence at Katunayake.
Q:What is your full name and date of birth and your native place?
A - Lloyd Allan Paternott. I was born on 20th October 1947 and I hail from Katubedde, Moratuwa.
Q:What is your first school, the Principal and your first class teacher?
A - I had my entire education at Prince of Wales’ College, Moratuwa from Lower Kindergarten to Advanced Level and this period the Principal was J. B. C. Rodrigo. My first class teacher was Mrs. Dorris Mendis.
Q: How did you commence your cricket career?
A - Moratuwites are famous for cricket from my smaller days I played softball cricket with my neighbouring friends and at school too with my classmates. During that period there was no organized Junior Schools cricket in our country and most of the schools played a few friendly matches in the under 12, 14, 16 and 2nd eleven.
Q:Did you attend for cricket practices?
A - No. I had two younger brothers at the same school and my father was very strict on us and he wanted us to study well so I did not attend under 12 practices. But when I was under 14 my classmate (later wicket keeper, opening bat for our college, Moratuwa Sports Club, Colts Cricket Club and Mercantile Services) Srinath Silva was captaining the Gunawardene House team and he took me to play in the under 14 Inter House Matches. Our House did well and came to the finals where we beat Lewis House. I took 8 wickets for 14 runs. Our Prefect of Games K. W. Dharmapala noticed my performances and he asked me to come for under 14 practices. The same year I played under Priyananda Perera and in the following two years I played under Vernon de Mel and Priyananda. I batted left-hand and bowled left-arm leg-spin.
Q: Did you play for the First Eleven?
A - Yes. From 1964 to 1967. My first captain was Priyananda then Nihal Sannasgala followed by Leslie de Silva and in 1967 I captained the team and I played in four big matches and my opposite number was Maxwell de Silva. During my cricket career at school I have taken more than 150 wickets. Against Zahira College I captured 8 wickets for 50 which is still a record for our school against them.
I represented Moratuwa Schools cricket team and played at De Soysa Park against the visiting Indian Schools cricket team and I took 5 for 25. My first wicket was Surendra Amarnath who later went on to play for India. I got him out with my first ball.
Q: Did you play for Ceylon Combined Schools?
A - Yes in 1967 I played against the visiting under 19 England Schools team at the Colombo Oval and my captain was Thomian Priyantha Rajapakse. To mention a few other members were Polycarp Wijesekara, Peter de Neise, Glen Vanculenberg, Tony Appadurai and Kumar Ramanathan.
Then from college I joined the Royal Ceylon Air Force the same year and I was able to complete a double that year by captaining my alma mater and getting into the Air Force.
Q: Did you play for the Air Force?
A - Yes. I served in the Air Force for twelve years from 1967 to 1979 and during this period I played for the Air Force in Sara Trophy, Donovan Andree Trophy and the Daily News Trophy. Those are the three major cricket tournaments during that period. I toured Gan Islands with the Air Force team.
I could not play for the Combined Services but I was in the pool. During my Air Force career some of my team mates were Keerthi Caldera, Hemasiri Hettige, E. G. Hamilton, Hemasiri Fernando, Dr. Cyril Ernest, Dr. Nihal Gurusinghe, Ranjan Samarasinghe, Ajith Jayasekara, Mohamed Faleel, Anura Vithanachchi, Leslie Ratnapulli, Nimal Cooray, Wilfred Basnayake, Charlie Amrasinghe, S. Dharmaraja, Sarath Fernando, Bandula Tennakoon, Nihal Soysa, S. Jebarajah, Tony Opatha, Brian Obeysekara, Sarath Soysa, D.D.P. Alwis, Dilwin Mendis and several others.
Q: After leaving Air Force did you play club cricket?
A - Yes. I played for Negombo Sports Club in Donavan Andree and after that in 1981 I got an appointment it the Oman Defense and served for sixteen years.
Q: Did you play cricket for Oman Defense?
A - Yes. I played for Oman Air Force team and Oman Singha Cricket Club for several years. I captained the team in 1997/1998 season and won the “B” Division Championship and I was awarded the Best Bowler’s Trophy and in 1985 also I got the Best Bowler’s Trophy in the same tournament. Among my friends I am known as “Patta” and over there in Oman they called me “Ever Green”.
Q: What are the other sports you did at school?
A - During our time football too was popular as cricket in our school and I played for the first eleven team in 1966 and 1967 and awarded colours. I did athletics in the inter house sports meets and I represented the school in 400 yards and 4x440 yards relay team.
My captain was one time Decathlon champion Ranjith Perera and we were sent for public schools. But I could not do well. I won school colours for athletics too.
Q:Who were the best cricketers you came across during your school and club cricket careers?
A - No doubt best batsman was Anura Tennekoon and the best bowler was Barney Reid. At club level I have played with and against very good cricketers of that time. In the Air Force Keerthi Caldera is a class batsman and the best bowler was K. M. Nelson the most dependable batsman was former Sebs and evergreen Norbet Fernando, Sarath Fernando and Dilwin Mendis were the best all-rounders. Sarath was a fast bowler and you are a spinner.
I can remember you won the Best All Rounder’s prize for about three or four times.
I will give my vote to you. I should mention about Srinath Silva he is a very fine hitter of the ball on any wicket.
I should mention that my father though he was against my playing cricket earlier in my career when I played for college he never missed a match.
Q: What is the advice you can give to young Cambrian cricketers?
A - Present day cricket is a different game and now it is commercialized. There were no inter school tournaments during our time and all were friendly games.
Present day you have to play very seriously. When you are inside the rope you forget everything and concentrate on the game.
Don’t under estimate any school team because they are all very good sides. Also don’t neglect your studies at any cost.
Finally I remember my College, Air Force and all other cricketers who have played with me and against with gratitude. God Bless Prince of Wales’ College.
