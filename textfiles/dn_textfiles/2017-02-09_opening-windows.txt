Opening windows

In architecture, comparisons between then and now are inevitable. Also, we cannot help but imagine what life will be like in the future. As human beings, we question our environment. In doing so, we also contemplate on the kind of changes that will take place and have taken place. This is necessary for growth. Without comparing, we cannot grow. Archworld meets up with architect Asanga Samarasekara to discuss footsteps in the sand.
“The Egyptian pyramids and massive reservoirs built by ancient kings, great ancient creations such as Sigiriya are definitely timeless creations. The sky scrapers and massive construction that we experience now cannot be compared with these so-called timeless creations. I believe being architects, we have been inspired by those master pieces pertaining to that era,” said Samarasekara.
We live in an era where everything around us is rapidly changing. Science is making amazing advances. Dolly the sheep was the first mammal cloned. If life can be created in such a way, can there be substitutes for architects?
“I don’t think robots and computers can take over the creativeness of an architect. Artificial intelligence won’t be able to beat the creative power of an architect. Minimizing mistakes and providing a certain level of accuracy are just technical aspects with respect to achieving a certain creation,” stated Samarasekara.
Sometimes we are torn between our deeper human needs, such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security, and running after prestigious images and symbols of the consumerist culture.
“Always in achieving a comprehensive product, an architect will be addressing the deeper human needs such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity, security aspects, the lifestyle and behavioral pattern of the particular user through a unique concept. The particular images, forms and symbols may be some of the elements and tools that he can adopt,” pointed out Samarasekara.
Death has been personified as the grim reaper, absolutely impartial and not a respecter of persons.
“The inevitable death of humans and the decaying of buildings over the years can be conceded as the ultimate finale of a certain era, but the particular architectural language and style will be unique and inherent to that particular period,” explained Samarasekara.
In previous articles, we touched on emotions. Like sociologists and psychologists, an architect is privy to the complex emotions of the mind.
“An experienced architect can understand the nature of a certain client, throughout the design process and also through various discussions prior to this. The ultimate product will be providing solutions to various emotions associated with the particular user. His unique design concept consisting of various tailor-made spaces may provide solutions to various emotions such as anger, fearfulness, tiredness and stress,” elucidated Samarasekara.
The secrets pertaining to various professions may be different from one to another. But the way you deal and react to your client, your ability to convince someone and the products you deliver will be helpful to retain the stability of any professional.
“When you satisfy the client’s various needs through a unique design concept, then it always becomes a livable space. Ultimately with a proper sequence of various steps that you may adopt, it will lead to achieving a practical product, which may be more logical with a timeless beauty, reflecting the creativeness of the architect,” pointed out Samarasekara.
The service of an architect must never be underestimated. It is he/she that makes the difference between something really good and something really great.
“Always great architecture will reflect friendliness to its environment. The relationship with purpose, along with the form and the uniqueness of addressing the various needs of the user will automatically make it great,” said Samarasekara.
Being in the tropics is fun! You get ample sunlight throughout the year, you can open your windows and let the wind blow in! There are so many fun things you can do in the tropics. Your inside and the garden outside can be merged together because you don’t have to close the windows. You can have a courtyard. You only need to guard against the rain. With the ample sunlight, you can create so many contrasts and shades. You can orient your house in so many ways.
Being in a tropical country, the buildings put up in Sri Lanka should always address various climatic aspects through various elements and forms. When you design a residence for someone through a proper design process, an architect will be providing solutions for various inevitable issues. In that sense building in the tropics provides more possibilities when it comes to achieving something,” explained Samarasekara.
The challenges that you encounter may differ from one case to another for an architect. The nature of a particular response will depend on his experience and maturity. There may be some successful ways of merging traditional style with modernity. All this will depend on his creativity.
“The architect will be the ideal person who can provide solutions for environmental, climatic, urban issues and financial crisis. The architectural education consists of a variety of subjects which helps to develop the thinking pattern of an architect in addressing such issues,” argued Samarasekara.
Again practicing architecture in the tropics with the abundant sunshine allows us to create unique spaces. We can use these natural attributes to create some fine architecture. We can create so many moods and experiences.
“Approach to spirituality will always depend on the ability of visualizing the space. It may be a very interesting exercise to practice spiritual spaces,” summed up Samarasekara.
