HP debuts Envy, Pavillion laptops with sophisticated designs in SL

HP announced a new lineup of Envy and Pavilion laptops with sophisticated designs, and features to inspire today’s students and tomorrow’s reinventors.
Every aspect of the company’s Envy PCs were designed to push creative boundaries and unlock new opportunities, reinforcing HP’s place at the forefront of reinvention.
Bold engineering and cutting-edge design decisions will delight a generation eager to use technology as a canvas for self-expression. 
The Envy PCs bring extra ordinary performance in every millimetre, empowering users to change how they work, create and play without compromising style or function.
The new Pavilion convertibles and laptops deliver a rich set of features and performance options previously reserved for higher-end products, including the addition of premium materials like 3D metal to help remove all visual seams, USB-C for more connectivity options and active pen support to bring Windows Ink 1 to life on Pavilion x360s.
“Our latest Pavilion is a convertible offering features typically reserved for our premium products, including pen for those who want to draw or take notes directly on the screen, so students and aspiring digital creators can interact and create on our PCs in new and unique ways.”
The latest Pavilion laptops bring amazing new designs inspired by HP’s premium Spectre and ENVY line-up. In bringing quality new designs to the Pavilion portfolio, HP is able to offer its Pavilion customers scalability and performance.
The use of 3D metal, a single piece of metal that wraps around the sides and back of the PC effectively removing visual seams, on the 2017 Pavilion laptops adds durability and an elegant look while the combination of hues, finishes and textures give the PCs a more sophisticated look. HP’s Pavilion x360 and Pavilion laptop devices feature a wide-range of configuration options to meet the needs of the consumer needing the reliability to connect and get things done or be entertained. Pavilion gives consumers a PC that not only performs, but is also a true reflection of how people interact with their devices.
