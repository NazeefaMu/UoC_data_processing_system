Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge under repair

Heavy rains yesterday led to soil erosion below the Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge at its intersection with the Kelani River bank, putting one side of the bridge at risk.
Vehicular movement along the bridge had to be restricted to one side and Police informed motorists to use alternate routes to avoid congestion.
RDA Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi told the Daily News that soil erosion was not severe and that the RDA workers were working on repairing it.
“We should be able to open both lanes by Friday”, he said.
