Ladies College the new force in schools netball

Ladies College reached a milestone in their sporting history when they became runners-up in the recently concluded All Island School Games Netball tournament.
Brenda Rajapakse who is in charge of netball at Ladies College shares her views on the rise of netball at the school.
Q: What is the secret behind the success of netball at Ladies College?

A: We always pray before and after our matches no matter what the result is. Our Principal Eesha Speldewinde has been a source of encouragement and strength supporting us all the way. The Teacher in Charge of Sports Kamala Kulatilake has helped us coordinate everything and is present at all the tournaments encouraging all of us. The same students participate in many other sports but with the arrival of coach Mr Deeptha Bandara who joined us in 2015 and with the support of coach Mrs. Pushpa Navaratne, the players showed more commitment and dedication towards the game. Practice schedules made by the coach Deeptha Bandara and playing many practice matches arranged by him, against other schools, sports clubs and specially practicing with the Sri Lanka Air Force netball team has helped us immensely, especially in developing the skills and confidence of all the players.
Q: Being an elite school in Colombo what are the barriers faced by netball in the past history?
A: Especially having to play against some of the best schools in the island early at circuits and at zonal level and playing according to a knock-out format is a huge challenge for us. Also getting all the top players together for all 4 tournaments through the year was a tremendous challenge since they have exams and other sporting commitments locally and internationally. A lot of hard work was put in by these players and the coaches for many years.
Q: What are Ladies College’s achievements in sports in the last couple of years?
A: We as a private school have being performing well in the fields of tennis, athletics, swimming, water polo, rowing and many other sports individually as well as in team events. Performing well at the Circuits, Zonals,Western Province as well as All Island and in other private meets in netball was unusual but we really did well this year.
Q: Ladies College has good facilities than most other schools, why do you think it’s taken such a long time to enter the top level at netball and what is the reason for this dramatic turnaround?
A: I personally think it’s the commitment of the coaches and the players because as Mr Deeptha joined us only in 2015 the players have showed great improvement by becoming champions in the Circuits and qualifying through Zonals and Provincials for the All Island.
It was a huge challenge for us to get through from the Western Province since only two teams finally get through from our province and both teams came to the All Island finals. As I said before playing according to a knock-out basis is really tough. More than the facilities I think it’s the new techniques, training and knowledge put in by the coach and the team being coordinated was the key to our success.
Q: What is the contribution the players and parents have made?
A: The contribution put in by the players especially the ones who are in this particular team (under 18) I have no words to explain. We have most of the players who engage in other activities, such as Anika Seneviratne representing our school and in many International Tennis Tournaments.
She represented Sri Lanka in the Asian Games this year which took place during these tournaments and has also won the prestigious triple crown at the Sri Lanka Open Nationals in August just before the netball finals. She also represents the school at athletics. Sarisha Gunasekara took part in the Junior South Asian Games in the shot putt event and won the Bronze medal for her country, Sulani de Silva represented the school in hockey and water-polo (other than netball), Ovidini represented the school in basketball, Ganya Senanayake in athletics, Nuwangi Gunawardane in table tennis.
Bimanya is our shooter and a key member of the team. Ganya, Anika and Bimanya were selected for the National under 17 netball pool, but always attended school practices without any hesitation while they were selected and practiced at the junior netball development pool which played matches against the Singapore national team and a British club side. Although they had multiple practices to attend they gave their full dedication and commitment. All the players were right on the dot at 6.00 in the morning for their netball practices and fitness.
The parents too did their part and supported me in many ways throughout the years. During the school holidays they sacrificed all their personal commitments towards the success of their children and the school. A special ‘thank you’ goes to them.
Q: How many players represented the Sri Lanka team from Ladies College?
A: We haven’t had any players representing the Sri Lanka National netball team but we have had many players for the past many years representing the Sri Lanka Schools netball team for the Waverly International School netball tournament held annually in Australia. Three players Ganiya, Anika and Bimanya represented the under 17 national side this year.
Q: Your views on the school netball association and their contribution to the school’s netball development.
A: The schools netball association has given its fullest support towards organizing many inter schools tournaments which has provided the opportunity for the students to participate in many tournaments. Through this they have given many opportunities for the players to develop their talents, skills and also to gain experience. The junior national squad is a good example.
Q: What are the future plans for the development of netball at Ladies College?
A: We have already approached many youngsters to come in for practices in different age groups and are hoping to do some coaching camps for the players. Our main goal is to become overall champions at the Nationals. This performance as runners up has really helped make netball a popular sport in the school.
Q: Tell us something about Ladies College sports history?
A: We have had many students representing the country for over 100 years. Damayanthi Darsha who is an old girl of Ladies’ College, her performances were exceptional in track events, many tennis players and swimmers represented the country and have excelled in many events and hold records in the sports field. Ladies College continues to support all sports equally and have always given their full backing to the national cause.
