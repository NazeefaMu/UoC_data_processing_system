PRESIDENT directs to SUSPEND PROMOTIONS

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday directed to temporarily suspend the Education Ministry’s move to promote teachers and principals said to be politically victimised.
The President took this decision after a meeting with education sector Trade Union representatives yesterday. The Education sector Trade Union action scheduled for today was called off after the meeting.
Eleven Trade Unions representing school teachers, principals and administration officers were to launch a one day token strike in protest of the Education Ministry decision to appoint 280 teachers who claimed to be politically victimized. The TUs charged that these appointments were not fair.
However, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the politically victimised individuals who were deprived their due salary increments, promotions and other entitlements were identified after a screening process and were meted out justice in a legitimate and transparent manner irrespective of party differences. He also said that none of them are given any positions under this initiative.
The President met the TU representatives at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. Following the talks the TUs decided to call off their strike.
