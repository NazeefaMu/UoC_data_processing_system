Sharp drop in Ampara vegetable prices

There had been a sharp drop in vegetable prices at the Ampara district, recently.
This price plummet had also affected vegetables transported to the district from the Nuwera Eliya, Welimada and the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centres.
Beans, cabbages, beetroot, carrots, leeks and other yams are among the affected produce. Okra, brinjals, bitter gourd, long beans, snake gourd and tomato prices, which were around Rs. 150 to 180 per kilogram, had dwindled to Rs. 50 to Rs. 70 per kilogram.
However, the drumstick price range, which is around Rs. 180 to Rs 220 per kilogram, remains unaffected.
Meanwhile, home garden cultivation projects conducted within the Ampara district coastal areas, have at present, made progress. Under the said project, which falls under the National Food Production Battle Programme, residents are encouraged to grow vegetables and fruits.
Cultivators are currently reaping bumper harvests.
