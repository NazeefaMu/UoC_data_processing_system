Foreign Affairs Minister to meet Modi during first overseas visit

 
Sri Lanka’s newly appointed Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana embarked on a three-day official visit to New Delhi, India today, marking his first official engagement overseas since assuming office in August.
In a press release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Minister will hold discussions with his Indian Counterpart Sushma Swaraj.
“Minister Marapana will meet his Indian counterpart, Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj, on 9 September for discussions on a range of bilateral issues aimed at further strengthening the India-Sri Lanka partnership.”
The Minister is also set to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the same day.
Marapana’s visit follows visits by previous Foreign Ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Mangala Samaraweera, both of whose first official visits overseas were also to India.
Marapana will be accompanied on his visit by Prasad Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and M.A.K. Girihagama, Senior Director General of the South Asia and SAARC Division of the Ministry.
