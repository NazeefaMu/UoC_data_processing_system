Australia chief sees way back for Warner

Sydney: Disgraced David Warner still has a future in Australian cricket, the sport's chief executive James Sutherland says, handing the explosive opener a lifeline after a cheating scandal.
Warner was identified as the mastermind behind the plan to use sandpaper to tamper with the ball during the third Test in South Africa this year that shocked the sport.
While former skipper Steve Smith was charged with knowledge of the plot, Warner was charged with developing it and instructing Cameron Bancroft to carry it out.
Smith and then vice-captain Warner were banned for 12 months while Bancroft was exiled for nine months.
All three held emotional press conferences to apologise, with public sympathy for a contrite Smith and Bancroft.
Warner, who was also banned from ever holding a leadership role again in Australian cricket, admitted he was "resigned to the fact" he may never play for his country again.
But Sutherland said the door remained open.
"I think everyone deserves their chance and their own personal redemption story is very much in their own hands now," he told Melbourne radio station SEN late Tuesday. AFP
