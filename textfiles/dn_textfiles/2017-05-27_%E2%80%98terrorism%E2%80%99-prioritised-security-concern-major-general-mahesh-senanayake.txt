‘Terrorism’ is the prioritised security concern: Major General Mahesh Senanayake

The biannual academic sessions of the Officer Career Development Centre (OCDC) at Buttala commenced last Wednesday. Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General Mahesh Senanayake delivered the keynote address as the Chief Guest.
In his keynote address, Major General Senanayake reminded the gathering that the overall pattern in nature of conflict and the entire spectrum of security environment had changed over time. “Degree of escalation of conflicts has been increased in size, dispersion, effect and complexity. States have got bogged down by threats and challenges, like ethnic conflicts, fundamentalism, separatism, insurgencies, illegal migrations, public disorder and terrorism, in addition to the other issues such as those related to environment degradation, mass migration, influx of refugees, epidemics and disasters, etc,” he pointed out.
“On the other hand, increased developments of technological innovations, advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, neurosciences, computing, etc are among other factors that pose a threat to peace and stability.
Similarly, one should not undermine the importance of concentration on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in any future operational environment,” Senanayake underlined.
Referring to the future of military engagement, the keynote speaker highlighted ‘terrorism’ to be considered as the prioritized security concern. “We are the guardians of all Sri Lankans, and the Army is the nation’s means to seize, retain and exploit the opportunities.
Terrorism is at the forefront of our security concerns and we have to nip the origins of terrorism in the bud. Constructive engagement with international and regional intelligence players is therefore, a must. The Army should be agile, lethal, versatile and modernized to suit tomorrow’s operations.
That is the need of the hour. Close combination with Navy and Air Force is another essential component, since the Army should act as a capability-based force and not a threat-based one, because threats are always hard to predict.
Likewise, capacity development in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations of the Army are also needed to be given due attention,” he said.
The two-day long sessions, themed mainly on ‘Changing Security Landscape: Role of Sri Lankan Forces’ have been listed under five major sub topic sessions to suit the main theme in addition to the opening session.
Civil and military resource personnel, drawn from specific spheres of expertise during respective sessions will dwell on ‘Existing and Emerging Threats to Peace and Stability’, ‘Sensitization and Exploitation of Religious, Ethnic & Political Issues’, ‘Technological Advancement, Dependence and Potential Threats’, ‘Geo-political Interests and the World Order’ and ‘Challenges to Sri Lankan Armed Forces in Countering Future Threats’ during the sessions, attended by over 60 senior and middle rank tri service and Police officers.
Major General Ralph Nugera, Brigadier C.S.N Mudannayake (Retd), Nishan De Mel, Lasantha Wickramasooriya, Dr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu and Prof. Imtiaz Ahamed contributed to the sessions on the first day.
Prof. Shantha K. Hennayake, Asantha Senevirathna, Sanath De Silva, Major General K.P.A Jayasekara, Major General B.H.M.A Wijesinghe, Brigadier G.V Ravipriya, Brigadier M.D.U.V Gunatilleka, Colonel S.A Kulathunga and Lieutenant Colonel K.V.P Dhammika addressed the second day sessions.
