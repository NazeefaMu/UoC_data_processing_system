Mukerji tells to open your wings and fly

Talking about Hichki, Rani suffers from Tourette Syndrome in the film. Students make fun of the side-effects of her disease and schools do not agree to hire her. Finally, she gets admitted to one of the schools but has to deal with a set of municipal students who no one wants to teach.Eventually, we get to see the journey of the teacher as well as the misfit students who try to find their place in the world.
Directed by Siddharth P Malhotra and produced by Maneesh Sharma under Aditya Chopra's Yash Raj Films, the film is set to hit the screens on March 23, 2018.
Meanwhile, when it comes her to comeback movie Hichki, Rani had said, "I was looking for a script that would challenge and excite me, and Hichki came my way. Each one of us has a weakness that pulls us back, it could be a disability or any condition but if we just look at it as simply a hiccup, we can emerge as a winner. It won't come in the way of achieving your dreams. Hichki is built on this positive premise and I have decided to take it up."
