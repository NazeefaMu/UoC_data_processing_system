Court refuses to issue order against SAITM protesters

Colombo Additional Magistrate Shanima Wijebandara, yesterday turned down a request made by the Peliyagoda Police to issue a restraining order preventing the organisers from organising a street protest that was to be passed through the Kelaniya area yesterday, against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM).
The Additional Magistrate observed that the Police could use minimum power in accordance with the Police ordinance in an event of causing any disturbance to the public.
Meanwhile, Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court had issued an order preventing the protesters from being a nuisance to the public during a street protest that was to be held in the Colombo city against the SAITM.
Issuing this order in terms of Section 106 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara observed that this order would not hamper any attempts by the protesters to engage in a peaceful protest without causing any disturbance to the public.
