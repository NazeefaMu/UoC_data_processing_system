GMOA lashes out at <U+200B>Health Minister

<U+200B>Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has displayed his ‘political nakedness’ by appointing a Director of the Tobacco Company to the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister cannot justify the appointment by pointing out irrelevant facts such as the person’s educational qualifications and the position he holds.
The GMOA’s stand on the appointment is based on the GMOA’s policy and scholarly opinion, he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the appointed person coordinated the SAITM discussion held with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The GMOA will bring the appointment issue to the notice of the President and the Prime Minister and hopes that the two leaders will guide the Health Minister to take decisions that comply with the State policy, he said.
