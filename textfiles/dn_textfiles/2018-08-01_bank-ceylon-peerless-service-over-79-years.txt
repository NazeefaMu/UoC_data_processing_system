The history of 79 years as the No.1 Bank in Sri Lanka is an extraordinary story to tell. Being recognized as the No.1 Brand in the country by Brand Finance Lanka for the 10th consecutive year, the saga of “Bankers to the Nation” began with the need that arose for a state aided Bank to assist Ceylonese Businessmen just before the World War II. With the essential combination of quality customer service and integrity “the Bank of Ceylon” came to be known as “BOC” over the years, building a base of 12 million loyal customers who consistently seek a credible financial service.
By 2018 the brand “BOC” was rated with a brand value of Rs. 42.87 billion by Brand Finance Lanka which is the highest brand value recorded. In recognition of this achievement the “BOC” was awarded as the “No.1 Most valuable consumer Brand” and “No.1 Rank Banking Brand” in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance Lanka in 2018.

BOC encompasses a structure that is sustainable in the longer-run which is developed around a profound vision, mission and a set of corporate values.
