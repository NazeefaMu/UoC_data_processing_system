Ellanga Gammana System recognized as Global Agricultural Heritage Site

 
The international forum and ceremony to award Sri Lanka’s Cascaded Tank-Village System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Site took place in Rome, Italy today.
The system, known locally as the “Ellanga Gammana,” was recognized as one of the 14 newly designated Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Sites in the world.
The award was accepted by the Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture B. Wijeratne on behalf of Sri Lanka.
The other sites awarded today are in China, Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Portugal and Spain.
An “Ellanga system” is a system where a large number of small rivers are inter-connected based on their geographical locations to nourish one large river.
