Hemas’ Piyawara enriches lives  of underprivileged children

The Hemas’ chain of Piyawara pre-schools has, since its inception in 2002, enriched the lives of underprivileged children across Sri Lanka through a focused early childhood care and development (ECCD) programme.
Piyawara now has 44 such pre-schools across the country with over 3500 children cared for by over 150 teachers daily. This goes on record as being a sustainable and successful model enriching the lives of the most vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka.
The initial foundation provided by Hemas Piyawara resonates throughout their lives. This in turn gives us immeasurable joy as their lives are a testimony to the success of this selfless endeavor,” said Executive Director of the Hemas Outreach Foundation, Shiromi Masakorala.
Launched in 2002, the ‘Piyawara’ programme is the primary Corporate Social Responsibility project of Hemas Holdings PLC in partnership with the Children’s Secretariat of Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. The project focuses on key aspects within the framework of ECCD providing a holistic approach to pre-school education, teacher training, parental awareness programmes, emergency intervention during disasters, child protection etc.
The 42nd and 43rd ‘Piyawara’ community pre-schools were opened in Dehikindagama and Mahasenpura respectively by Chairperson of the Hemas Outreach Foundation (HOF) Abbas Esufally with Trustees Sue Evans and Azira Esufally in attendance.
