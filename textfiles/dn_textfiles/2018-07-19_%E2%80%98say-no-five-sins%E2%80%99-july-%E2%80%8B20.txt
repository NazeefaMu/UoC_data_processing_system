‘Say no to five sins’ on July <U+200B>20

‘Say no to five sins’, a special campaign organised by the office of the Provincial Director of Health Services in the Western Province will be launched on <U+200B>July <U+200B>20 at 3 pm at Nawa Rangahala, Colombo 7, Western Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Anil Samaranayake said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday. He said the five sins are, committing road traffic accidents, breeding dengue mosquitoes, spreading HIV/AIDS, promoting diabetes and consuming drugs, alcohol and tobacco. These five sins should be prevented through a social marketing campaign, he said.
According to Dr. Samaranayake, all religions discourage people from committing these five sins. Road traffic accidents can be prevented by driving carefully. Dengue can be prevented by disposing garbage properly. HIV/AIDS is on the rise due to various reasons including a large number of foreigners coming into the country for various purposes and internal migrations. Sexual misconduct is the main reason for being infected with HIV, he added.
Diabetes is one of the most common Non Communicable Diseases on the rise. It can be prevented or controlled by food. Most Sri Lankan males do not visit health centres to be screened for NCDs even when facilities are available free of charge. The consumption of tobacco has gone down but the consumption of alcohol has gone up in Sri Lanka during the past few years. The illicit drug business has targeted schoolchildren as well, he added.
