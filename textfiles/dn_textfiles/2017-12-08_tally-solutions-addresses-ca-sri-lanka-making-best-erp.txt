Tally Solutions addresses CA  Sri Lanka on making the best of ERP

Baradhwaj, Manager International Business of Tally Solutions India Limited, addressed members of CA Sri Lanka at the CA Sri Lanka auditorium on November 24 emphasizing the importance of a proper implementation of an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system to get to best out of such a system.
Although great business is built on great products, technology is increasingly the underlying driver of a company's success, regardless of the industry or marketplace. From accounting and point-of-sale systems to inventory and fulfilment technology, the efficacy of the solutions you invest in has the potential to make or break your business. Hence, it is vital that the organization selects the correct technology at the very outset.
Baradhwaj pointed out that there may not be anything called 'right' or 'wrong' technology but it is essential to keep ROI in mind in adopting the technology, otherwise the very purpose may be lost. He brought in five facts to be used as a guideline in selecting the technology as cost, deployment and scalability, user access, accessibility and security depending upon the organization.
Most commercial ERP systems are known for certain industry verticals and hence it is extremely important to select the most suitable product where the chartered accountants have a vital role to play since they know exactly what they need.
Once the appropriate technology and the product are selected, the organization has to follow a set of well-defined steps of implementation from setting up objectives till the “Go-Live” phase in a pre-determined time frame.
Baradhwaj emphasized the fact though all these are done in a perfect manner, if the organization does not analyze the data in all the possible angles and convert them to information, there may not be a direct impact from the ERP towards the growth of business.
Baradhwaj concluded his speech by summarizing the fact that choosing a technology and the software which is the right fit for your business, i.e., a product which is designed to fit into your scheme of things. Be it handling exceptions that you may face in your day to day operations or adapting to your way of working, the software should handle everything with the required flexibility. Also, it should empower you to focus on running and growing your business while it takes care of all complexities.
