‘A tribute to a gentleman of par excellence’ - Deivanayagam Eassuwaren

It is with profound sorrow that we record the demise of one of our well respected past Presidents of the National Chamber of Commerce, Deshabandu Deivanayagam Eassuwaren held in very high esteem by the Chamber, who did a yeoman service in his tenure of service to the Chamber and to the public at large. During his tenure, he brought up the concept of conducting Ayurveda Expo by the Chamber which are being continued to date by the Chamber.
Affable, gentle, kind and charming, late Eassuwaren leaves a mark of that genre of gentlemen of a past era, leaving a trail for others to follow. He was a genial head of his organization who never admonished his subordinates for any misdemeanor, but advised them gently as to their requirement.
He was a well respected and recognized Business leader amongst the business community and headed a premier Tea export Company, founded by his father, V. T. V. Deivanayagam, Eswaran Brothers, establishing their humble beginnings in 1964 with their first export of 300 chests of tea to Somalia.
He received many accolades in his lifetime including the prestigious ‘Deshabandu’ National Honor Award from President Maithripala Sirisena only last year. He held many important posts - former Honorary Consul of the Republic of Mauritius, Trustee of the Varatharaja Vinayaga Temple, Former President of the Kanban Kalagam Literary Association, Trustee of the Manitha Neyam Trust among many others. He was also a philanthropist, providing facilities to less privileged schools.
A special significant quality in Eassuwaren was that, being a devout Hindu, he generously contributed to the Buddhist community and culture at large, including the construction of the 70 feet tall Samadhi Buddha statue in Rambadagalla, which is a famous landmark today, and to many other Buddhist institutions and other causes of the needy.
The large gathering of Buddhist clergy from various temples, chanting and partaking at the last rituals, was a testimony of his harmony with the Sinhala Buddhists.
We pay solemn tribute to our dear departed President, Deshabandu Deivanayagam Eassuwaren and pay silent homage to his memory.
