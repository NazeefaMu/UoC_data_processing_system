Ranjan Ramanayake uses RTI on Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat

 
Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has made use of the Right to Information (RTI) Act to obtain information on soil and sand excavation permits from the Divulapitiya District Secretariat. 
‘Just signed a RTI request to get info (sic) from Divisional Secretariat about all soil and sand excavation permits in Divulapitiya. Everyone should use RTI,’ the Deputy Minister tweeted.
The move comes no sooner than the RTI Act came into effect on February 3, 2017, after the Bill was unanimously passed in Parliament on June 24, 2016 and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya placed his signature on the Act on August 4, 2016.
The Divulapitiya District Secretary and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake clashed last week, when the Minister questioned the Secretary’s inaction in relation to illegal sand mining in Divulapitiya the past 7 years.
The Right to Information Act permits access to government information; except in 21 instances; with the intention of promoting equitable governance and upholding the tenants of democracy.  
Access to information relating to soil and sand excavation permits can lay bare corruption at the Divulapitiya District Secretariat, as alleged by villagers clamoring against government inaction in the face of illegal mining.
