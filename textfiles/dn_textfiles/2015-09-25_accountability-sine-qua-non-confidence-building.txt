Accountability is sine qua non in confidence building

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's speech in Parliament last Tuesday came at a crucial juncture of Sri Lanka's contemporary political history. It was made in the immediate aftermath of the release of OHCHR Investigation report on Sri Lanka and days before the US sponsored consensus resolution at the UNHRC in Geneva. It also preceded the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to New York to attend the UN General Assembly.
In this speech, Wickremesinghe outlined the President's and his Government's work plan for durable peace and reconciliation in the country. He vowed to bring about a permanent political solution to the national question, expressing his determination not to pass on the festering wounds of the past to the future generation.
The efforts to find a long-lasting political solution are nothing new as many leaders over the past decades had emphasised on the same, but had ultimately done little to make it happen. One reason may be because the political decisions required for such a move are neither popular nor easy. The tenor of Premier's speech indicated that he was fully aware of the high-stakes it involves, but at the same time was ready to take even the harder decisions it takes to put an end to the ethnic tensions that spring up from time to time in the post-independence Sri Lanka.
"We are not ready to repeat the same mistakes of the past. The solutions to these problems cannot be reached by inciting communalism. We hope to discuss with all parties concerned and arrive at a consensus to solve this issue. This is the best gift that we can think of for our future generation", he noted.
Wickremesinghe also stressed that his Government adheres to a firm policy of always doing the "correct thing for all communities". Explaining in detail on the domestic mechanism to be set up for truth seeking, justice, reparation, and to avoid recurrence of the past tedious experiences, he underscored that "the accountability" is a sine qua non in trust building among communities and restoring the rule of law.
The Premier's words reflected his statesmanship. He spoke for the common good of all, and not to win votes. The famous quote by American theologian and author James Freeman Clarke, "The difference between a politician and a statesman is that a politician thinks about the next election while the statesman thinks about the next generation," could have provided an appropriate prelude for Wickremesinghe's speech.
This speech stood in contrast to ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa's victorious speech in Parliament on May 19, 2009, where he poured out supra-patriot emotion with remarks such as "I value my motherland first, second and third", and that there were no minorities in the country and the only two groups left behind were the ones who love the country and those who have no love for the land of their birth. However, the next six years that followed proved that he was not true to his words and that it needs much more than the chest thumping emotion to deal with the sensitive issues of the country.
Even though a National Unity Government was formed to collectively resolve the long-lingering questions of the country, doubts remain whether it will serve the expectations of building a consensual Parliament. The conduct of Parliament on Wednesday was a strong indication that troubles are far from over.
Opposition walked out of Parliament
A group of about 35 UPFA MPs in the Opposition walked out of Parliament in protest of moving several financial Resolutions for debate, stating they have got no sufficient time to study them. They argued the Government's move contravened the Standing Orders and Parliamentary traditions.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena vehemently opposing the debate demanded to either suspend the sittings to convene a Party Leaders' Meeting to discuss the matter or move the Resolutions for a vote. Dr. Sarath Amunugama also insisted at least two weeks time should be given to study them as those were related to finances of the country, adding that many new MPs were quite eager to contribute for the debate. The Speaker suspending the sittings convened a meeting of the Committee of Parliamentary Business to discuss the matter. Making an announcement when the House resumed, the Speaker stated that he was of the opinion that the MPs must be given adequate time to prepare for the debates in the House, but informed that it was agreed at the meeting to commence the debate without wasting time and adjourn it for October 6 and put to vote on that day.
The reasons for the objections of the UPFA MPs made little sense as the Resolutions were related to the expenditures already made in 2014 and were proposed in the Budget 2013. In other words, those referred to the spending done when they were in the ruling party. They were reluctant to speak on their own Government's financial handling and chose to run away from the debate.
This group was headed by MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Kumara Welgama, Ranjith de Zoysa, Namal Rajapaksa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, and Bandula Gunawardena etc.
It was apparent that the ulterior motive of this incorrigible, self-serving and power hungry group was none other than to disrupt the business of Parliament and put up a media show. Interestingly, all of them were staunch supporters of ex-President Rajapaksa. They caused similar distractions, some say under shadow orders, even during the period of previous interim Government becoming the biggest noise-makers in Parliament.
Several new comers have also joined with this group including MPs Udaya Gammanpila, Prasanna Ranatunga, Geetha Kumarasinghe, Sisira Jayakody, Jayantha Samaraweera and Niroshan Premaratne. Most of them were from minor coalition parties in the UPFA. After walking out of Parliament, they staged a protest near the main road that leads to the Parliament complex, while also giving voice cut to media.
When Parliament turned to pandemonium with the clamour of Opposition MPs, the Prime Minister also lost his cool on several occasions. Expressing his displeasure over the disorderly conduct of MPs, he stated the debate would not be held if the Opposition does not want it.
"When we were in the Opposition, we asked for debates but the Government refused. Now that we are in the Government, we are ready to give them a debate, but they say 'no'. What we have today is an autocratic Opposition and a democratic Government," he observed.
Amidst this heat, the Premier also affronted Vasudeva Nanayakkara by calling him "Vattakka Gediya" (pumpkin) and Chandrasiri Gajadeera by calling him "Kottoruwa" (wood pecker).
Wickremesinghe and Nanayakkara clashed head on once again reminding the audience of the previous episode of their fall out four months ago which ended up in unparliamentary language. This time it all began with the firm objection of Nanayakkara over the Speaker's decision to allow the Government to move the Financial Resolutions for debate. "I am totally against your decision. I walk out of the House to show my objection," he shouted.
However, as some UPFA MPs asked him to stay calm, Nanayakkara once again took his seat. At this point the Premier making a hard hitting remark said, if Nanayakkara remains in the Chamber he must apologize to the Speaker, and if not he must leave immediately.
UPFA Opposition group
With this remark, the UPFA Opposition group started shouting at Wickremesinghe causing confusion in Parliament. However, the Speaker proceeded to commence the debate and the UPFA MPs in the Opposition walked out in protest. Watching them leaving, Wickremesinghe noted, "Parliament is here to conduct debates. If they do not accept the January 8 revolution, there is nothing that we can do for that. I call this move of the Opposition as a beggars' revolution, because those who entered Parliament by begging the votes of SLFP are now trying to rebel".
Interestingly, MPs Lakshman Seneviratne and Dr. Sarath Amunugama remained in their seats in the Opposition benches. Some in the audience were asking whether these two will also take oaths in some ministerial position in the near future.
Meanwhile, Parliament on Tuesday approved the names of Dr. Ahangamage Tudor Ariyaratne, Shibly Aziz and Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy as civil society representatives to the Constitutional Council (CC). With these appointments, the ten members of the CC are now complete.
The Resolution to this effect was presented by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella on behalf of the Prime Minister. Receiving Parliament nod to these appointments, which had been postponed several times during the interim Government period, was an important step forward in ensuring effective and independent functioning of important organs of the country including the public service, judiciary and police. This body is responsible to oversee the appointment of members for the 11 Independent Commissions proposed in the 19th Amendment, and key positions of the country such as the IGP, Attorney General, Auditor General, Chief Justice, Supreme Court Judges etc. The other seven members in the CC include Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, W. D. J. Seneviratne and JVP MP Vijitha Herath. Yet again, MP Dinesh Gunawardena objected to the appointment of Ministers to the Constitutional Council (CC), stating that there was an agreement not to appoint Ministers to the CC after the elections. However his objection did not gather momentum and Speaker proceeded with his usual official duties without much hindrance.
