Political unwillingness delays LG polls: PAFFREL

Political unwillingness has resulted in the delay of holding Local Government (LG) election, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said yesterday.
He said technical issues pertaining to the holding of LG polls have been sorted out.
The election could be held within 75 days of the Amendment Bill being passed in Parliament, he said. Hettiarachchi said the decision on holding the election is up to Parliament.
Parliamentarians should fulfil their duty by demanding to hold the election soon, he said.
Hettiarachchi said the previous regime too responsible for delaying the LG polls since the technical issues pertaining to the holding of LG polls were reported to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry in 2013.
He said the former leaders tried to manipulate the people’s right by holding elections in segments. But postponing the election is worse than that, he said.
The government cannot postpone the Provincial Council Election.
They have to go for a referendum to postpone the election, he said.
