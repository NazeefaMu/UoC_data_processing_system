ANC Education launches MSc in Clinical and Health Psychology

ANC School of Postgraduate Education announced the launch of its MSc in Clinical and Health Psychology and MBA with Hospitality Management programmes in Sri Lanka, at a ceremony held on July 27, at Taj Samudra, Colombo.
ANC Education in collaboration with the University of West London (UWL) now offers British postgraduate qualifications in Psychology and Hospitality that can be completed entirely in Sri Lanka within a period of 12 – 15 months.
For the first time, this enables local students to obtain foreign undergraduate to postgraduate qualifications in psychology and hospitality without the need to go abroad for studies - and for a much lower cost.
Being in the education industry for over 15 years, ANC Education understands the growing demand for high caliber professionals in the field of psychology and hospitality, both locally and internationally.
In Sri Lanka, there’s a huge shortage of professionals in psychology, especially clinical psychologists – which creates more demand for qualified professionals in the industry. Massive scale infrastructure and other development projects in the country after the war, has also given room for the tourism and hospitality industry to boom in leaps and bounds, creating more lucrative jobs in the industry. Professionals in psychology and hospitality can also easily apply as skill migrants and secure attractive career opportunities abroad, owing to the existing high global demand.
Strengthening the years-old UWL-ANC partnership, Vice Chancellor of the UWL Prof. Peter John graced the launch ceremony as the Chief Guest.
Speaking at the event, he admired ANC Education’s commitment to educating the future generation of leaders, in-line with the UWL’s vision and mission. According to him, the UWL has made outstanding achievements in the recent years, jumping up 38 places to No. 58 in the Guardian University League Table 2018 - with similar successes in The Complete University Guide 2018 and The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2017.
