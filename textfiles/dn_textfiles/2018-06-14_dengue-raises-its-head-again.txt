22,284 cases, 20 deaths to date
Dengue raises its head again

A total of 22,284 dengue cases and 20 confirmed dengue deaths have been reported up to June 12 from all parts of the country, the Epidemiology Unit epidemiologists said.
According to them, the highest number of dengue cases - 3,589 - was reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number - 3,255 - was reported from the Batticaloa district. The third highest number of dengue cases – 1,787 – was reported from the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 959 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded a total of 2,630 dengue cases.
The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province was 6,804, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and Consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without using home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which could turn fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season in order to prevent the spread of dengue. Even water retaining in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.
