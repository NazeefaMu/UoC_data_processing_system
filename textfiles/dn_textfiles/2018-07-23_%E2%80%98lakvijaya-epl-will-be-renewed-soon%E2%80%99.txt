‘Lakvijaya EPL will be renewed soon’

Secretary to the Power and Energy Ministry Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda said Norochcholai Lakvijaya Power Plant anticipates a renewal of its Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) before long. He said all environmental and community requirements in this regards are now complete.
Secretary Dr. Batagoda said the power plant has completed 27 environmental and community requirements. “Its operations are now devoid of any discrepancy. “The Lakvijaya Power Plant has fulfilled all its requirements; the Authorities have to renew the EPL. It was only in the last year we failed to obtain the EPL. We have received it seven years before,” Dr. Batagoda said.
Lakvijaya has been running without a valid EPL since June last year as the North Western Environmental Authority decided against the renewal of the EPL of the plant due to debate over environmental pollution caused by it. Dr. Batagoda said the relevant authorities “must renew the EPL, otherwise the power plant cannot continue.”
Dr. Batagoda said a group comprising the Central Environmental Authority, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry officials including the Minister and the civil organizations that have filed cases against the pollution caused the power plant, participated in a ground visit where the new improvements were monitored.
“A group of youth spent hours walking in the power plant and the surrounding area. Their focus was on the recent ash emission controversy. At the end of their monitoring tour, the shoes worn by these persons were checked for ash and other hazardous components. The results came negative, meaning that we are properly managing the operations,” Dr. Batagoda said.
Dr. Batagoda said the constructions of a Wind Barrier is afoot to minimise the environmental impact caused by the waste released from the power plant. “Rs. 750 MN is allocated for the Wind Barrier project. The barrier expects to be of 12 km long and 15 meters high,” he said.
The North Western Environmental Authority is considering renewing the environmental protection licence for the Norochcholai Power Plant, related sources said.
