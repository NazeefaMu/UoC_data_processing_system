Premachandran to support Vigneshwaran form new political party

EPRLF leader and former Parliamentarian Suresh Premachandran said that his party has decided to support Northern Chief Minister C.V.Vigneshwaran in forming a new political party.
The EPRLF leader made this statement in connection with C.V. Vigneshwaran’s media statement that the people in the North requested him to form a new political party to contest for the Chief Ministerial position again provided that the TNA would not nominate him for the next election.
C.V.Vigneshwaran said that he was considering joining another party of which the policies tally with his and not to form a new party.
However, this scenario was created with the TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran’s statement that said the TNA had no intention of nominating Vigneshwaran for the position of Northern Chief Minister again.
