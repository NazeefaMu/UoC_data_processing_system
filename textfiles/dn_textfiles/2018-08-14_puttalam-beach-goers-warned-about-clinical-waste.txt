Puttalam beach goers warned about clinical waste

The Marine Environment Protection Authority yesterday warned beach goers and people living along the coastal line in the Puttalam district to watch out for clinical waste that had been washing ashore.
The Authority said clinical waste consists of syringes, vials, empty drug bottles and they may have originated from India.
Authority General Manager Dr.Termey Pradeep Kumara added that many clinical waste carries labels of Kerala, India.
He added that waste from India, Thailand and Bangladesh washes along the Sri Lankan shore regularly but clinical waste washing along on Sri Lankan shores is a matter of concern as it poses a serious health risk.
Dr. Pradeep Kumara said that experienced personnel should handle the cleaning and they should have safety equipment.
He said fishermen and residents in the area who do not have experience in cleaning hazardous waste should not clean the beach.
