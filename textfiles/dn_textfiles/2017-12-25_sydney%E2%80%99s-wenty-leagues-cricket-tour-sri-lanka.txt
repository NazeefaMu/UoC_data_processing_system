Sydney’s Wenty Leagues cricket tour of Sri Lanka

Twelve promising young and talented cricketers from Sydney will embark on a cricket tour under the banner of Wenty Leagues Cricket Tour to Sri Lanka from 28 Dec to 9 Jan 2018. The squad comprises six cricketers from NSW Cricket Academy and State Challenge 2017 and five cricketers representing Parramatta District Cricket Association.
The tour shall provide the boys opportunities to compete against cricketers from leading Sri Lankan schools like St Joseph’s College and Wesley College in Colombo; Trinity College in Kandy; Richmond College in Galle; and S. Thomas’ College in Mt Lavinia. The tour will enable the young cricketers to experience playing conditions in the sub-continent and compete against the boys who are part of the Sri Lankan junior representative cricket pathway.
The matches will be played at NCC grounds and P Sara Oval (venue of Sri Lanka’s first Test match). They will also play at the Asgiriya Stadium where Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara played most of his cricket as a schoolboy. The boys will also have the opportunity to play at the picturesque Galle Stadium and finally at the tsunami affected Surrey County funded and maintained Maggona Surrey Monty Cricket ground.
Besides participating in the tournaments, there will be various activities and excursions to enrich the boys with Sri Lankan history and culture revolving around the Portuguese, Dutch and British who colonized Sri Lanka over four centuries between 1505 and 1948. For example, climbing UNESCO world heritage listed Sigiriya Rock Fortress, visiting tea and spice plantations in Hill Town of Matale and the Last Kingdom in Sri Lanka before the first colonization by Portuguese – Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
The tour itinerary also includes a visit to SOS Children’s Village. SOS Children's Village focuses on family-based, long-term care of children who have lost their parents.
This non-profit organization provides impressive care, training and support to the orphans with a mission to help them shape their own futures.
“To further advocate the organization’s mission statement, we have proposed to fund the building of a cricket facility and the supply of cricket equipment,” said Ganesh Mylvaganam who has been helping young cricketers in Sydney for the past 15 years and is also involved in coaching and administration of District Cricket (Juniors).
The squad consists of: Raveen Ganesh, Matthew Chatten, Finn Watkins, Jay Noorbergen, Aditya Dhond, Shanuk Karandeniya, Samuel Pickard, Ben Watson, Dillon Meurling, Patrick Xie, Ramana Paheetharan, Debasis Dey.
