Food fascinated

The Colombo Street Food Festival organized by Fairway Colombo began on March 18, transforming Hospital Street in Fort into an exciting hive of activity.
With an amazing variety of the much loved Street Food on offer, combined with music and entertainment for all ages, the first night was a promising start. The festival will continue for 10 consecutive Saturdays until May 20.
