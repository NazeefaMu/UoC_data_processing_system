WADA calls for intelligent, targetted dope testing

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) called for more intelligent and targetted testing for doping in sport, as the 15th Asia/Oceania Region Intergovernmental Ministerial Meeting on Anti-Doping in Sport opened yesterday.
WADA President Sir Craig Reedie, addressing a media briefing at the Kingsbury Hotel during the conference, explained that the rule of thumb was when in doubt to test the athlete, but one could not practically test them all. Thus intelligent and targetted testing, he said, was the most effective and cost-efficient method to use.
“WADA’s technical documents on sport now tells you who they should test, at what event, and at what time. Target-test people who we feel are most likely to cheat,” said Sir Craig.
“This is a 50-50 responsibility between government and sport. Our job is to ensure that everybody has the rules and now starts implementing them,” he added.
As Sri Lanka hosts its first Ministerial Meeting this year, Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA) Director General Dr. Seevali Jayawickreme signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency (ASADA) CEO David Sharpe to collaborate and share knowledge in the fields of testing, education, information technology, legal mechanisms and research.
Dr Jayawickreme, speaking on the occasion, said that SLADA, started five years ago, needed to work together with more established Anti-Doping Agencies like ASADA to develop their skills further. One area in particular they hope to stress on is in that of investigations. They currently have a staff of 27 with one Director for Investigations and Enforcement, but the post remains vacant.
Dr Jayawickreme said they expected to fill the vacancy soon. Given the cost of testing (approximately Rs. 35,000 per test), targetted and intelligent testing is something that Sri Lanka too is pushing for.
“One of the biggest problems we have among local athletes is a lack of knowledge on doping. They may not know that they are taking a banned substance. At times, we have gym instructors directing athletes to use various substances or getting them to import certain banned substances. It is hard to arrest them as many of these substances are not registered under the Food and Drug Authority,” he said.
SLADA President Prof. Arjuna de Silva, in the meantime, said that many athletes who used ayurvedic arishta (herbal drink) were found to have around 10 percent alcohol content and whilst this was not a banned substance, it was not recommended either.
In Sri Lanka, body building, rugby, power lifting and athletics were the high-risk sports, explained Prof. de Silva. Cricketers who are not registered with the ICC also are tested by SLADA.
“Although cricket is not a high risk sport, it is a high-profile sport, so we test them,” he said.
