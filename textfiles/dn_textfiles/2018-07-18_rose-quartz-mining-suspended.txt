Rose quartz mining suspended

Mining in the rose quartz deposit in Ratwatte, Udatenna in Ukuwela, Matale, has been suspended for two weeks, said Ukuwela Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman D.W.M. Chethiyaratne.
The environment committee of the Pradeshiya Sabha took this decision in response to allegations made by certain environmental organisations that the mining is causing environmental damage.
The suspension would be in force until an area investigation is made and a report obtained. Permits were granted for mining when the Pradeshiya Sabha was administered by commissioners. Several government and Opposition members had alleged that the mining had caused damage to the area around the Elkaduwa - Ukuwela road.
