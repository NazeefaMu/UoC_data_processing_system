Tele-drama excellence awards
Although the over-view of the Raigam Tele’es has been broadened, the Raigam Tele’es Secretariat has decided to keep the number of awards allocated for the tele-drama sector unchanged. Accordingly this year too there will be number of awards for year’s best creating, acting, singing and technical talents of multi-episode tele-drama and single-episode tele-drama.
Television media excellence awards
Today the most popular TV program is tele-drama, but most of the air time is occupied by other, different programs. The main responsibility of the TV media should be to telecast these programs targeting the education and entertainment needs of the audience with high quality material and updating viewers on various areas of interest. Therefore with the hope of encouraging production of creative and high value programs to sharpen the minds and tastes of the general public a number of awards will be presented to best efforts in this category including news reading, news reporting, current affairs, educational, children’s, musical, reality, and political Programs. Awards for the best news reader and best presenter will be granted separately for each language Sinhala, English and Tamil.
Most popular awards
An opportunity has been allowed for thousands of television viewers to indicate their most preferred tele-drama, actor and the actress under this category through an SMS poll. Raigam pioneered the use of SMS to select the winners of popular awards. This time too the general public will get the chance to use SMS to elect their choice of the most popular Actor, Actress, and Tele-drama.
