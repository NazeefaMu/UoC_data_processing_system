‘Ranil has no right to occupy Temple Trees’

Ranil Wickremesinghe has no right to occupy Temple Trees as he is not the Prime Minister anymore, President of the All Ceylon Farmers’ Convention, Provincial Council Member Namal Karunaratne said yesterday.
“Wickremesinghe is only an MP now and should be held responsible for the disastrous situation in the country,” Karunaratne said.
He was speaking at a press briefing held at Siyapatha Hotel Complex, Dambulla yesterday.
“No one worries about Wickremesinghe losing the Prime Minister’s post. No one took to the streets to protest against Wickremesinghe being removed from his post. People know the kind of damage that the Wickremesinghe government did to this country. The Wickremesinghe government imposed heavy taxes upon people to minimise the economic repercussions of the Treasury Bond Scam,” Karunaratne said.
“Parliament has become a circus,” Karunaratne further said.
