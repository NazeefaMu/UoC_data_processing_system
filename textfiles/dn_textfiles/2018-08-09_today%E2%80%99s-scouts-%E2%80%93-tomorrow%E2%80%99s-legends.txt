Several activities revolving around the theme and pioneering activities designed by the Sri Lanka Army will be carried out for the Scouts including visits to the irrigation exhibition, Natural history museum, planetarium, wetland park, Sri Lanka Parliament and other adventure activities to stimulate both mind and body. There will be cycle races, football, volley ball tournaments, campfire and a musical talent show conducted by the organising team to build brotherhood and friendship amongst the campers.
The Singithi Scouts and the Cub Scouts will visit the park on August 12 and 13, 2018 respectively.
