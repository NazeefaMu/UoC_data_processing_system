Nestlé launches organic  milk powder product NIDO

World leading food and beverage producer Nestlé launched its first organic full cream milk powder product NIDO in China on Sept 20, to compete in the high-end organic dairy product market.
The product was trial launched in China last year through the cross-border e-commerce channel last year.
NIDO is a member of the Nestlé family with annual sales of over $1.04 billion. Since 1944, Nestlé has been producing NIDO milk powder in Switzerland. NIDO milk sells 60 million cups in more than 80 countries around the world every day.
In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the living standard in China, the demand of Chinese people for imported food has grown year by year. In 2017, China imported a total of $58.28 billion of food, with a year-on-year increase of 25 percent. The average annual growth rate of imported food trade volume in the past five years is 5.7 percent, with organic food drawing a lot of attention from Chinese consumers.
As shown by data of Nielsen Consulting, 40 to 50 percent of Chinese consumers are willing to pay higher prices for natural, sustainable and organic products.
NIDO organic full cream milk powder introduced this time is also a positive response of Nestlé to the changing demand of Chinese consumers, and is expected to bring an option of safe, high-quality organic milk powder to the public, said Roberto Reniero, head of Nestlé’s R&D in China
Reniero said: “Nestlé owns the industry-leading R&D and innovation network, the intensity and depth of R&D helps us to respond to the major changes in social development.” (Chinadaily.com)
