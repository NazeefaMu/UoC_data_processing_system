Kalametiya public market  construction work at a standstill

Construction work of the Kalametiya public market that commenced in October, 2015, have at present, come to a standstill. A sum of Rs. 47.7 million had been allocated for the said purpose, by the present regime. The business community in the area said that three foundation stones were laid for the construction of the public market by the successive regimes, adding that as a result, traders have had to utilise an alternate private land lacking the necessary facilities.
