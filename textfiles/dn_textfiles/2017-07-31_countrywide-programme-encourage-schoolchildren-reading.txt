Countrywide programme to encourage schoolchildren in reading

The Education Ministry is to grant 3,200 schools countrywide Rs. 700 million to purchase library books this year.
Accordingly, special programme to motivate schoolchildren to read books would be launched simultaneously and about 5,000 reading camps and workshops would be held countrywide at school level in collaboration with university lecturers.
Steps would be taken to organise creative writing contests to encourage remote schoolchildren to read, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said at a meeting.
The directors of education in the NWP participated in the meeting held recently at the Wayamba National College of Education, Bingiriya in Kurunegala.
