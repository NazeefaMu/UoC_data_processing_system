UTE recognized by Caterpillar Asia Pacific

Caterpillar Asia Pacific Region dealers were hosted by UTE in Sri Lanka for the first time together with sixteen caterpillar representatives at the CAT Backhoe Loader Dealer Advisory meeting which was held from April 4-6.
While UTE’s overall performance was recognized by Caterpillar Asia Pacific as the bestselling Dealer for the CAT 426F2 Backhoe Loader, Machine Sales Manager, Duminda Perera was recognized by Caterpillar with a special award for his dedication and contribution made towards promoting the CAT 426F2 Backhoe Loader in Sri Lanka.
The main objective of the Dealer Advisory Meeting was to highlight the new features of the CAT 426F2 backhoe-loader, as well as to unveil the next phase of this model, which will offer more advanced features and will be launched later this year.
The CAT 426F2 Backhoe Loader is versatile and can be used in a wide variety of projects, from cable-laying, to telecommunications and warehousing. The model also has a range of applications, including digging, trenching and loading. It is also low maintenance, partly due to the CAT brand backing and warranty.
A key feature of the 426F2 Backhoe Loader is operator comfort. This model comes with a factory-fitted A/C cabin, making it unique, and reflecting the Caterpillar brand’s emphasis on ensuring the wellbeing of the operators who run their machines.
“UTE is excited to conduct the pilot testing for the CAT 426F2 model in Sri Lanka,” said Manager – CAT Machine Sales Duminda Perera. “As an initial step, Caterpillar has provided us with 2 machines for us to offer to customers. This model is multifunctional, low-maintenance and competitively priced. It is also ideal for the Sri Lankan market. It really is the ultimate workhorse for your machine fleet.”
“We have used the CAT 426F2 Backhoe Loader for the past four months. We are satisfied with the performance of the loader which suit our applications” commented Lal C. Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager - Sierra Ready mix (Pvt) ltd.
As part of a special promotion that runs until August, those who purchase a CAT 426F2 backhoe-loader will be eligible to receive an iPhone X with their purchase.
UTE has been the sole authorised dealer for the Caterpillar brand for 71 years. Caterpillar remains the leading brand in construction and power-generation equipment, both worldwide and in Sri Lanka.
