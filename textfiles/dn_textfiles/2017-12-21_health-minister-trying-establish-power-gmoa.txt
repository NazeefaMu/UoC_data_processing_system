Health Minister trying to establish power: GMOA

The Health Minister is trying his best to establish his power within the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by appointing persons who can be controlled.
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has informed the SLMC Registrar in writing to take all steps to hold the SLMC election in a free and fair manner, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will take legal action against the SLMC authorities for tarnishing the image of the GMOA and for insulting it by making a complaint to the police against it.
Meanwhile, the SLMC sources said no one is influencing the SLMC election and it will be held in a free and fair manner.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the committee appointed by the President to solve the SAITM issue had completely ignored the GMOA's proposals and opinion on the issue and had taken decisions to fulfill the requirements of the SAITM owner.
Therefore, the GMOA will not take part in any meeting of the committee hereafter. A letter is to be sent to President Maithripala Sirisena soon in connection with the issue, he added.
