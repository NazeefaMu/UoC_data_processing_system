Why Jacques Kallis is ‘embarrassed’ to call himself a SAn

 
NEW DELHI: Former South African cricketer Jacques Kallis has said he is "embarrassed" to call himself South African, following the ban on four of the country's sports federations from hosting or bidding for major tournaments.
The South African government on Tuesday banned its national cricket, rugby, athletics and netball federations from bidding for international tournaments as a result of a failure to increase their number of black players.
"So sad that I find myself embarrassed to call myself a South African so often these days #no place for politics in sport," Kallis, one cricket's finest all-rounders, said.
Kallis' Tweet received a lot of criticism post which it was taken down and he also posted a reply.
"Comment y'day was re political NOT anti Transformation. 40 underprivileged boys had or having education paid for by JK foundation," Kallis posted on Twitter.
According to a report in ESPN Cricinfo, the ban will be reviewed after the next annual report in the 2016-17 cycle and so, South African cricket is unlikely to be seriously affected. - ZMB
