Government’s intervention sought to solve SAITM issue

The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Parents' Association yesterday called on the government to intervene and provide a permanent solution to the issues faced by their children studying at the private medical college.
SAITM Parents' Association Head Gemunu Wijeratne told the media in Colombo that parents of several students have died and many others have fallen ill due to the plight of their children.
He noted that both parents and children have undergone severe mental stress as the issue concerning the private medical college has been dragging on without any permanent solution.
Wijeratne said is high time that all stakeholders get involved and find a lasting solution to the SAITM issue without heaping further burden on both parents and students.
The parents also criticised the stand taken by the Sri Lanka Medical Council and the Government Medical Officers Association over the SAITM issue. They urged both the President and the Prime Minister to get involved and provide a permanent solution.
