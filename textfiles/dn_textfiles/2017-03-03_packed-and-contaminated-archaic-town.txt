Packed and contaminated archaic town

With 1.8 million people entering Colombo on a daily basis, Pettah is choked by jostling streets, vehicles, nattamis, traffic, a very tired populace and a walk around the neighbourhood of Pettah can be exciting for all the wrong reasons.
The geography of Pettah includes Main Street, Reclamation Road, Bankshall Street, Olcott Mawatha, McCalum Road (now D.R.Wijewardane Rd.), Front Street, 1st Cross Street, 2nd Cross Street, 3rd Cross Street, 4th Cross Street, 5th Cross Street, Keyzer Street, Prince Street, Maliban Street, Sea Street, Gabo’s Lane and Bodhiraja Mawatha.
A daily traveller to Pettah for work, 27-year-old Anjula Samaranayake, an accountant from Madampe, said it was a ‘nightmare’ to walk on the busy streets of Pettah.
“I drag myself through Pettah’s side walks every day during rush hour. Some men purposely bump in to us or brush against us and try to touch us. Some men whisper filth while passing us. Women are both physically and mentally harassed when walking on the streets of Pettah. I usually arm myself with my handbag or my umbrella to keep away certain men purposely bumping into me. Finally as I reach my office or Colombo Fort Railway Station to go back home. I feel angry, tired and abused. Something should be done to help the pedestrians walk freely on the side walk,” Anjula said.
A sales assistant, 35-year-old Ravindran pointed out that the road along the floating market had become a personal lavatory.
“I spend a lot of time walking to and forth on the Pettah streets. A part of Bastien Mawatha that runs behind the Manning market has become a personal lavatory. Some people urinate along the street in broad daylight where women and children pass by all the time.”
“Then if you look at the empty space between the State Pharmaceutical Outlet and some neglected buildings, it has become a spot for smokers. I don’t know if they are allowed to smoke there, but it definitely is happening. Then, there is no proper disposal system to put away leftover meat at the market. The crows bring these leftovers and put them all over the place to rot and stink,” Rajendran said.
“I usually get down near the entrance to the SLTB bus stand as I reach Colombo for work. Then I take the short cut between the lines of boutiques, which leads to Bo-Gaha junction police post. Just as I pass the fruit stalls by the side of the street the whole area smells like a lavatory. There are a few places that sell food near the area as well,” Lakshitha Dissanayake a 27-year-old software developer from Belummahara said. A shop owner, Ramzi, near Olcott Mawatha, said that the area around has become a turf for prostitutes.
“There are prostitutes operating in these streets both day and night. It disturbs the public. It disturbs the businesses as well. They even do make up and wait in some of the three wheelers temporarily parked near where the Kirihala (Highland Milk Shop) is situated, close to the Pettah station. It is alleged that some law enforcement officials are behind this business as well. The fine on prostitutes is only around Rs.100, so they couldn’t care less of being arrested,” the shop owner said.
“Add to that, these women have all the possible venereal diseases in the world. The girls who work in the shops nearby cannot stand in the streets more than ten to fifteen minutes waiting until the shops are open, or for any other other reason because the men around start to think they are prostitutes as well. So men try to brush against these girls and talk filth to them,” he added.
Pettah being one of the main business districts of Colombo has also gone largely unnoticed when it comes to its pavements and roads. Pot-holes and unsafe pavements make an ugly mosaic along Pettah walkways.
A tired Nandani Gamage who had come from Ambepussa for shopping said she could not differentiate the road from the side walk.
“I walked on 1st cross street, 2nd cross street and 3rd Cross Street with my son. In all these streets, I could not figure out where to walk and where not to. People walk everywhere, in the street. Then there are no visible side walks either. If by any chance, the side walks exist, they are not in a condition to be used,” she said.
“The cement tiles are unsafe. They are broken or unstable. I personally am very afraid to walk on these broken pavements. If the pavements are in a usable state, they are dominated by the street vendors when it is the seasonal shopping period,” Nandani added.
“Then there are the Nattamis who shout at the people. We can easily get injured by these speeding carts. But we cannot blame the Nattamis either, because they are transporting heavy loads in their carts. I don’t think they have separate roads to use. Yet we simply do not have a place to move away. The motor bikes and three wheelers use some of these streets as well. So basically, pedestrians, vehicles, nattami carts are all using the same narrow streets,” Nandani continued.
Lack of proper pavements on the roads also affects tourism in the area with entrances to hotels such as the Grand Oriental Hotel being dilapidated and unsafe to access.
Nishanta Chamara, a businessman in Pettah said the beggar-community in and around Pettah was anti-social and it disturbed the daily activities of the area.
“The professional-beggars not only engage in begging but also are involved in drug dealing. The dealers use the beggars as an easy medium to transport drugs. No one usually checks the beggars, so it is an added advantage. Only the people involved in this scheme know from whom to get drugs,” Chamara said.
He also said that SLTB bus station and the front yard of the Colombo Fort Railway station had become sleeping spots for these beggars.
The Urban Development Authority Deputy Director- Planning Priyani Navaratne in the meantime said that the Pettah area would undergo major development transformations under an accelerated Megapolis development plan.
“Following the shifting of the Manning Market, the whole area of Pettah is going to become a multi-model transportation hub,” Navaratne explained.
“The Colombo Fort train station area specifically is now demarcated as a transport hub. The whole Pettah area will be in connection with the rest of the Colombo city under this plan. There is a proposal to restore and revitalize the adjacent Fort area into a historical area as well. Then there is a special plan on developing both Fort and Pettah areas as a top-notch tourist destination,” Navaratne further said. Asked if there was a plan to shift the line of shops by the sides of Olcott Mawatha, Navaratne replied in the negative.
“We are not going to shift all the shops. We will have to shift only the shops which are not compatibly located with the proposed development plans,” said Navaratne. In the meantime, it is yet another rough day on the streets of Pettah.
