Rotation makes the sporting world go around

In Fight Club, his incendiary rumination on the existential thrill of being punched in the gob, David Fincher does a spectacular job of skewering the ìIkea nesting instinctî that lives in most of us. One quote has always stayed in the Spinís mind. After his condo is burned down ñ by himself, the daft bugger, but he doesnít know that yet ñ Ed Nortonís character tells Brad Pitt: ìWhen you buy furniture, you tell yourself: ëThatís it, thatís the last sofa Iím gonna need. Whatever else happens, Iíve got that sofa problem handled.íî
Cricket teams are constructed in a similar way. We have the same nesting instinct, to build a team piece by piece. It came to mind again after Toby Roland-Jonesís wonderful debut at The Oval. Whatever else happens, England have got that backup third-seamer problem handled.
Except they havenít. Roland-Jones could be a lot better than a backup third seamer; and a look up the order to Keaton Jennings shows the inherent folly of inking someone in after a spectacular debut. Teams are always in flux. One minute you buy a lovely new sofa; the next you notice the dining table is chipped. Sure, you can still use it, but thereís a beautiful one on offer at John Lewis Ö
There was little logic in the idea of a permanent XI even before the international schedule became a human-rights issue. Selectors hardly ever pick the best XI for today, because they need to have half an eye on tomorrow. If you always picked the best team for the next match, youíd never give anyone a debut, because it would safer to pick somebody with Test experience.
The Spin has a simple theory on this: if itís good enough for Alex Ferguson, the greatest football manager of all time, itís good enough for cricket. ìWhen we won the Treble in 1999,î Ferguson said, ìit wasnít because of the XI. It was because of the pool.î Ferguson was the pioneer of rotation in this country. At first it was controversial ñ a local MP complained in the House of Commons when he picked Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville to play a League Cup game at Port Vale ñ but after a couple of years it was the norm.
For some reason, and despite the acceptance of squad rotation in what we are contractually obliged to describe as white-ball cricket, it is taking much longer for us to accept it as part of Test cricket. Itís seven years since the old farts (and a few young ones) harrumphed over Englandís decision to leave Andrew Strauss and James Anderson out of the tour of Bangladesh with a view to the following winterís Ashes series. That turned out reasonably well.
We are not advocating wholesale changes, or suggesting England should leave Anderson and Stuart Broad out of the final Test against South Africa. There are clear differences in the demands and rhythms of club football and Test cricket. There are fewer games; you are playing the same team from week to week; you canít put your best players on the substitutesí bench in case of emergency; and you donít have a 25-man first-team squad.
Yet the guiding principle is universal. There are clear limits to what man can endure and achieve, both physically and mentally. (We accept Adam Peaty has slightly undermined our argument in the past week.) This is particularly relevant to fast bowlers, though not exclusively: spin bowlers suffer wear and tear, as Graeme Swann will tell you, and the unique mental strain of Test cricket affects everyone.
In the modern game, the best way to pick a team is surely to have one eye on today and one on tomorrow. Rest is essential for all players, and when you consider injuries ñ not to mention the potential demands of panto season in Bournemouth ñ itís almost impossible to stick with the same team. Even the 2005 Ashes winners, an XI everyone can name, only played four Tests together. The Manchester United team that won the Champions League final against Chelsea in 2008 never started a match before or after; Ferguson came up with a bespoke solution for a bespoke problem. Instead of wondering what happens to Roland-Jones when Chris Woakes is fit, we should be happy that England have strengthened an already decent pool of fast bowlers. They will need them in Australia.
The key to a change of mindset is to de-stigmatise being omitted, and phase out words and phrases like ìdroppedî and ìaxedî. What next: Jennings has been guillotined from the England team? South Africa have hung, drawn and quartered JP Duminy? The words ìrotatedî or ìrestedî are not the euphemisms they seem. Why, for example, shouldnít Anderson be given the West Indies series off? Why couldnít Joe Root or Ben Stokes miss a couple of Tests in the same series? You canít measure mental fatigue but everyone suffers it, even superhero freaks like Stokes.
No player would like being left out, particularly against weaker opposition. In Tests in Zimbabwe, Jacques Kallis had a batting average of 503. Who would want to miss out on that bounty? This attitude is widespread, yet itís a clear case of putting the individual before the team, and years of watching players misuse DRS is emphatic evidence that many have little idea what is best for themselves or the team. If the players donít like it, Anthony Scaramucci can probably advise them on what they have to do.
In 1999, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored four goals for Manchester United against Everton. He scored again in the next game against Valencia. Three days later he was on the bench against West Ham. He wasnít dropped or axed. ìI thought I deserved to play but he is the boss, nobody can dispute his record,î Solskjaer said. ìHeís the best in the business.î
Fans wouldnít like it either. A best XI is a crutch for the 99.94% of cricket tragics who might legitimately be described as anally retentive. And it would do devastating damage to one of our staple pub chats. ìGo on then, give me your XI for each of the next 10 Tests,î doesnít work quite so well as a conversation stimulant.
Cricket has always been strikingly innovative in some areas and weirdly resistant to change in others. The number of cautious declarations show that most would rather draw three games than win two and lose one where the defeat invited extra criticism. The same is true of rotation: if England omit, say, Stokes and Root and lose a Test to the West Indies, it would erroneously be viewed as a mistake that should never be repeated. Itís a pretty immature attitude.
Ferguson was a master of calculated risk when it came to rotation. He would provisionally plan 10 games ahead. Occasionally his tinkering led to embarrassing defeat but there were far more victories ñ and, crucially, his players were usually at their peak when it really mattered. At different points of the Treble season of 1998-99, he ordered Peter Schmeichel and Gary Neville to go on holiday because they looked either mentally or physically fatigued. In the same season he left out four regulars for one of the defining games of his career, the FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal.
There are other reasons for changing a team from game to game. In the World Cup, Heather Knight made it clear England had picked the off-spinner Laura Marsh instead of the slow left-armer Alex Hartley because Sri Lanka had so many left-handers. Marsh took four wickets. Itís good enough for the World Cup winners, yet some saw the menís team as weak for picking a right-hander at No3 to combat Vernon Philander and Morne Morkel. To completely ignore the strengths of the opposition is the height of misplaced machismo, like slicing off a finger on a first date to show how manly you are.
Again, with apologies to those who hate football and/or Manchester United, we can learn from Ferguson. When United played Milan in the 2009-10 Champions League, he gave the diligent Park Ji-sung, usually a winger, the job of neutralising Milanís playmaker Andrea Pirlo. It was a masterstroke. Pirloís influence was negligible, and United won 7-2 on aggregate.
The way we see it is this: if Test cricket exists in the year 2030, rotation will be the norm. Why not get a headstart?
