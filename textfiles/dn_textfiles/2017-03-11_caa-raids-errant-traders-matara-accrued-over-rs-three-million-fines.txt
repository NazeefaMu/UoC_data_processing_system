CAA raids errant traders in Matara: Accrued over Rs. three million in fines

 The Consumer Affairs Authority of the Matara District Secretariat earned over Rs. 348,500 through court fines in sudden raids and inspections carried out in February this year.
Seventy four raids were carried out last month alone in 16 DS divisions in the Matara district, CAA officials said. Selling rice above fixed rates, displaying food items unfit for human consumption, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, and selling expired food items were among the offences committed by errant traders, the CAA officials stated.
The suspects were prosecuted.
