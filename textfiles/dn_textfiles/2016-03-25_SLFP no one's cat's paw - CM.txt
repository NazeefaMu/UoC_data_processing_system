SLFP no one's cat's paw - CM

 
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said the genuine Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members are never ready to be a cat's paw of anyone to split the party.
He said around 35 Western Provincial Council members, who supported former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have already expressed their support to President Maithripala Sirisena.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Head Quarters yesterday.
Asked whether the Joint Opposition is a threat to the SLFP, he said there is no need to panic about the Joint Opposition. Many SLFP Parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition are with the party leadership now.
He said that whatever said, SLFP Parliamentarians hold all key portfolios in the government. The President also represents the SLFP.
"Therefore, it is baseless to say that this is a UNP government when all key ministries are headed by SLFP members," he said.
Chief Minister Dewapriya added that all honest SLFPers including Local Government members are with the party leadership, while a few who committed various acts of misconduct are still supporting former President Rajapaksa.
"President Sirisena never protects persons involved in malpractices including financial frauds. The SLFP could win the hearts of the minorities under President Siisena's leadership" he said.
Parliamentarian Manusha Nanayakkara said the last government was defeated by the people for its misrule and malpractices including assassinations of journalists, monetary fraud, financial misconduct etc.
However, the SLFP is on a forward march to win the next Local Government election spearheaded by party leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
"Under the guidance of President Sirisena, moves are under way to create a broader alliance aiming to secure victory at the forthcoming elections. There is only one SLFP and one UPFA," he said. Resettlement Minister M.L.A.M.Hizbullah said around 11,000 families have to be resettled in the North and East. A committee has been appointed to look into the resettlement programme and furnish suggestions in this regards.
Asked whether the Sinhala people residing in the North and East are discriminated under the government's resettlement programme, the minister noted that no one is discriminated against.If there is any injustice, it is the duty of those persons to complain to the Ministry.
When he was questioned whether tender procedures are being violated by his Ministry, the minister said that a full scale investigation is being carried out into this issue.
