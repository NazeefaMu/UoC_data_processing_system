YMAC celebrates 90th anniversary in style

In celebration of 90th anniversary of Moorsappiddy Young Men’s Athletic Club (MYMAC) in Batticaloa and Sinhala & Tamil New Year, a sports festival was conducted at the MYMAC play grounds recently.
It is noteworthy that young and old belong to Tamil, Catholic, Muslims and Buddhist religions living in the Ward No.10 – Arasady area participated in events harmoniously setting up a good example to ethnic and religious harmony. The event greatly served to strengthen ties among different communities while fostering goodwill and integration among them. The main attraction has been the cycle race event which was worked off from the MYMAC grounds to Kallady clock tower round about and returned to the grounds covering 56kms via Valaichchenai.
The afternoon session included many children s’ events along with many traditional sport events. Batticaloa Municipal Council Deputy Mayor K.Sathiyaseelan was the chief guest at the sports festival and many government and people’s representatives were participated as invitees.
