Point of view
Institutional and HNI interest dominated market activity this week, with crossings over the week accounting for ~52% of total market volumes.
Mid-caps in particular drove market interest, with Hemas Holdings accounting for ~34% of the week’s total crossings of LKR 3.1Bn and Tokyo Cement accounting for ~26% of total market crossings.
Blue-chip JKH also contributed to ~19% of total crossings for the week helping drive the week’s average turnover levels to an 8-week high of LKR 1.1Bn. Despite the positive momentum generated by HNI/Institutional and foreign investors though, Retail investors remained on the sidelines yet again, and Equity markets moved sideways over the week to consolidate at the key 6700 mark as Index losses (~51 points) at the start and end of the week were partially offset by mid-week gains (~47 points).
Markets meanwhile, failed to be moved by the CBSL’s monetary policy decision to hold policy rates steady, gaining a marginal 0.6 points on Friday amid the largely anticipated move by the monetary authority.

Markets in the week ahead are likely to gain some traction although some profit taking is also likely to continue.
CBSL holds policy rates steady
The CBSL maintained policy rates (Repo: 7.25%, Reverse Repo: 8.75%) at its latest policy meeting on Friday, citing an anticipated recovery in H2’17 GDP growth and inflation levels at mid-single digits.
The policy move is the first since the Monetary Authority’s decision in March of this year to increase rates by 25 bps. The CBSL added that although the Sri Lankan economy slowed in Q1’17, a rebound in economic activity is likely in H2’17 as the impact from adverse weather conditions ease.

CBSL added that inflation is expected to further moderate and range at mid-single digit levels by the end-2017, as the impact from VAT revisions and weather-related supply disruptions wane.
The CBSL added that private credit growth is expected to slow amid the prevailing high lending rates, and that the improvement in Gross Official Reserves to LKR 7.0Bn (with the issuance of International Sovereign Bond of LKR 1.5Bn) and moderate depreciation in the LKR (2.3% Y-T-D) also justifies its decision to hold rates steady.
