Burj Khalifa, a must for travellers to Dubai

Peering through the glass walls of the Observation Deck at Level 148 of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, the aerial view of Downtown Dubai, in the heart of the city, is something else: the deep blue of the Burj Khalifa Lake is the centerpiece of architectural excellence around which stands the many skyscrapers synonymous with the city.
The lake itself surrounds a golf course, the contrasting colours of deep blue and green amidst a setting sun, a heady mix indeed. Then again, an aerial view of the Dubai Fountain, the spurting concentric circles, the vertical rise of water, is amazing.
On another side of 'At the Top', as the Burj Khalifa Sky is billed, the maze of wide flyovers, for which this city is famous, is another sight to behold. Stretches of desert then spread out from the heart of the city.
The mega-tall skyscraper is a total of 829.8 m high and is part of a mixed use development plan from Emaar Properties, to make Downtown Dubai, what it is now - the Centre of Now, the world's most visited destination.
After Level 148, the Burj Khalifa thins into a spire which has made it the iconic building it is. One enters the skyscraper through the Dubai Mall. The elevator zooms the several hundred floors in minutes, while its walls screen the architectural marvels of this iconic skyscraper.
As you leave, a Burj Khalifa signboard says 'goodbye' in different languages, a touching testament to embracing the world. For Sri Lankans, it was gihila ennam.
Back in Dubai Mall, the world's largest shopping and entertainment destination is another attraction.
Or if shopping does not beckon, Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo or Dubai Dino, the resident Jurassic dinosaur are other attractions.
"You need six hours to visit the mall," said an official of the property.

The wide boulevard of Opera District, lined with palm trees all lit up, the centre of the 2,000 seat Dubai Opera, luxury hotels and residences, all of which make Dubai a truly global city and world-class destination.

The visits to the venue are also made possible by Emirates airline, which has 27 flights from Colombo to Dubai each week with seven more flights from Colombo to Singapore. (MM)
