British investor to pump US$ 100 mn in  Kantale Sugar

The once high profit recorded Kantale sugar manufacturing factory which the entire operations completely came to a standstill during the past 24 years will be recommenced shortly under a new joint venture between the Government and a British investor.
Addressing the media, Board of Investments (BOI), Chairman Upul Jayasuriya highlighted that recommencing the factory operations along with sugar cane cultivations in a 500- acre land helps over 20,000 farmer families in Kantale and surrounding areas to improve their livelihood activities once again.
“As we are aware during the past 24 years these farmer families faced untold hardships due to non functioning of the factory and also the destruction caused to valuable sugar cane cultivation lands which also hit their main income generation source,” he said.
Speaking further, Chairman Jayasuriya said a Memorandum-of-Understanding (MoU) which was signed in August last year between the British investor and the Sectary of the Finance Ministry, the former agreed to invest US dollar 100 million (Rs. 150 billion) in the project.
The MoU also mentions that Government will get 51 percent of shares while the investor company gets 49 percent shares of the total project. In addition the ownership of the factory will be vested to the Government after 30 years .
The investor also agreed to plant a high breed sugar cane variety which is imported from a foreign country as that could produce a bigger quantity of sugar than earlier. Chairman Jayasuriya said that 90 percent machinery and other equipment that were used in the factory 24 years ago are now not in a proper condition and new machinery will have to be replaced very soon. It is reported that some parts of the building is also in a dilapidated condition.
Meanwhile, steps have been taken by the investor to bring new varieties of sugar cane nurseries and seeds to be distributed among cultivators until the equipment and other sugar manufacturing machines be installed.
When asked about the progress of the feasibility study of the building and the cultivation lands, Jayasuriya said that the feasibility study have been undertaken by a German company Bosch.
It is said that the investor has spent over two million US dollars for the feasibility study.
He said spending such a huge amount for the feasibility study reflects that the investors are very keen to start the project as early as possible.
