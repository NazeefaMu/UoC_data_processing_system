‘Lanka’s surgical service at international standard’

The quality of surgical service in Sri Lanka is on par with international standards today. Currently, there are nearly 300 surgeons in Sri Lanka and the number is expected to double within the next five years, College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka President Prof. M D Lamawansa said.
Addressing the inaugural session of the 46th annual conference of the College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka at the Grand Kandyan Hotel in Kandy on August 18, Prof. Lamawansa said the main objective of their membership was to provide a quality service at the proper time. To ensure such quality service, it was important for surgeons to meet and deliberate at regular intervals.
He said their association had its beginnings in 1871 and the annual conference held regularly had been vital for maintaining high standards by updating their knowledge and experience.
He said they had received the tacit co-operation and assistance from the government too for carrying out their duty to the country.
As diabetes leads to other complications like heart attacks, loss of vision, kidney ailments and amputation of limbs following ulcers, they had paid attention towards setting up special counselling at hospitals.
Consultant Surgeon Dr Rasika Kotakadeniya said cancer and Hernia operations were performed without delay in Sri Lanka while patients in many other countries had to languish in a waiting list for nearly 6 months to get the surgery performed.
Prof. K B Galketiya, Prof Srinath Chandrasekara and Consultant Surgeon Dr Sameera Jayasinghe were among the other participants.
