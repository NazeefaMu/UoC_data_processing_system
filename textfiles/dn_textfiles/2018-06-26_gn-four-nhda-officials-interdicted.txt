Inquiry into Pugollagama archaeological site damages
GN, four NHDA officials interdicted

The inquiry made into the alleged damages caused to archaeological monuments in a land at the Pugollagama village in the Ipalogama Divisional Secretariat division of the Anuradhapura district, while carrying out land-clearing activities to accommodate a housing scheme provided by Anuradhapura Government Agent (GA) R. M. Wannainayake, had concluded recently.
Under the instructions of Government Agent Wanninayake, the additional government agent (land) held the inquiry, which was primarily against the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary. The Grama Niladhari involved in the incident had been interdicted along with four Anuradhapura National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) officials.
Investigations revealed that when written instructions were provided by Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake to the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary on April 4, to suspend further proceedings of the housing project as there were concerns raised regarding the selection of beneficiaries, the Divisional Secretary had informed the NHDA to discontinue the project temporarily. However, the Grama Niladhari in the division had not been notified regarding the matter. Subsequently, Anuradhapura District Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage had laid the foundation stone for the housing scheme on April 9. The project had then continued from April 9 to 11 and again from April 17 to 19 sans the supervision of government officials. It was revealed that the Puliyankulama Grama Niladhari was transferred to the Manewa division following the foundation stone-laying ceremony.
The new Grama Niladhari who had reported for duty at Puliyangkulama was not informed regarding the housing scheme as well as the archaeological reservation site in the division. It had been further disclosed that only on April 25, the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary had summoned the Grama Niladhari said that while clearing the land, the Pugollagama archaeological monuments had been damaged.
Thereafter, Archaeological Department officials inspected the site and lodged a complaint at the Ranajayapura (Ipalogama) Police Station. Police said that as a report had not been submitted by the Archaeological Department regarding the damages, the inquiry file would not be submitted to the Attorney-General for further instructions. Speaking on the case against the offenders, the Anuradhapura government agent said the damages were caused due to negligence, lack of coordination and poor supervision, adding that he had instructed the 22 Divisional Secretaries in the district to not release land for any development project without obtaining recommendations from all stakeholder agencies and notifying divisional development committees and the district land utilisation committee, as such procedures were compulsory.
