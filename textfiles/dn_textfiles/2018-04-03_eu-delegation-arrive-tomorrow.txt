EU delegation to arrive tomorrow

A team of European Parliament members have planned to visit Sri Lanka from April 4 to 6, in order to evaluate the first results of Sri Lanka’s accession to the GSP+ scheme and to enhance their dialogue with Sri Lanka on the remaining challenges, the EU Embassy in Colombo said yesterday.
It said the delegation would comprise members of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA) including the Standing Rapporteur for South Asia.
European Conservatives and Reformists member Jan Zahradil, Standing Rapporteur Sajjad Karim, European People’s Party (EPP) member Paul Rubig, Socialists and Democrats (S and D) member David Martin, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) member Tiziana Beghin and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) member Franz Obermayr are members of the delegation.
