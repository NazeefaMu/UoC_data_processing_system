The petitioner alleged that the demolition of the petitioner’s parapet wall was done with the vehicle and instruments of the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha with the blessing of the 1st and 2nd Respondents and 4th Respondent former Kiribathgoda OIC deployed police personnel to provide security on the instructions of 7th Respondent Mervyn Silva.
