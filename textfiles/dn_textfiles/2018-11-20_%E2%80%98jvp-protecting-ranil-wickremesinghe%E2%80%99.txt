‘JVP protecting Ranil Wickremesinghe’

The JVP which set Parliament on fire by hurling bombs in the august assembly has created a bigger conflagration in the country by setting up political parties against each other, Government Co-Cabinet spokesman and former State Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He said the JVP was fully responsible for the turbulence experienced in Parliament today.
Speaking at a press conference at his Aniwatte residence, Rambukwella said the JVP’s hand in the present political crisis was clearly evident from its boycott of Sunday’s party leaders’ meeting summoned by the President. The JVP which championed the cause of Parliamentary traditions and norms, Standing Orders, the Constitution and law and order, has breached the same norms through its present behaviour aimed to protect Ranil Wickremesinghe and his political gang, he said.
