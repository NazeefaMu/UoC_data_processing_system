Drought hit farmers to get compensation before New Year

The farmers who cultivated or refrained from cultivating due to drought in the Anuradhapura district, will be paid compensation up to Rs. 40,000 before the New Year festival, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Severe drought has destroyed the cultivations of the majority of farmers in the district. The water capacity of around 3,000 tanks has come down to zero level.
Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarians Services Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said the number of farmers who cultivated and lost their harvest was 32,533 in the district. They cultivated crops in 23,184 hectares. Somawansa said Rs. 43,464 million has been allocated to pay them crop damage compensation.
The number of farmers who have not cultivated due to lack of water is exceeding 40,000. Rs. 500 million is needed to offer them drought relief. Those who cultivated chena and other types of highland will also be entitled to compensation.
