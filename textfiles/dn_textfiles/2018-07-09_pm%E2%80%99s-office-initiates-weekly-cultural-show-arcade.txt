PM’s Office Initiates Weekly Cultural Show At Arcade

Broadening the horizons of Colombo’s public entertainment sphere, the Tri-forces and the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) have started a weekly cultural show at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo.
The project, initiated by the Prime Minister’s Office, is supported by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). It is also in line with the Tourism Strategic Plan’s (2017-2020) recommendation to expand entertainment opportunities for tourists and locals visiting the Colombo city.
The Cultural show starting at 7 pm every Friday includes musical performance by military and NYSC bands, dancing items and other entertainment. The Prime Minister’s Office said the public could witness the show free of charge.
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister and Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, commenting on the initiative, said it was only a start and the concept would be further developed based on feedback from the public.
“There has been a highly positive response from the public so far. Those who witnessed the show last Friday were excited by the idea and considered it a ‘fresh start’. But, we want to add more colourful cultural elements to the show as we move along,” the Minister said.
He also added this would familiarize tourists and locals with the ‘cultural roots’ of the country.
“We, as Sri Lankans, have a rich cultural heritage and a knack for good music and entertainment. From a tourism perspective, this offers a glimpse of our colourful life. At the same time, it gives an entertainment for those who gather around Independence Square on Fridays just to unwind,” the Minister added.
The project is coordinated by Major General Mihindu Kulasuriya, Coordinating Advisor to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The initiative will be carried out without disrupting the current setting of Arcade and the Independence Square. That’s why we have planned it as a one hour show without much fanfare and decoration. What we need is the quality, not the noise or frills,” Kulasuriya added.
He said the organizers were looking at the possibility of having the cultural show at different locations of the Colombo city, allowing more people to engage with the programme.
