No Lahore security fears - Dayasiri

The Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday dismissed security fears related to the Sri Lankan cricket team's tour of Lahore, Pakistan later this week.
Jayasekara explained that the ICC had cleared Lahore for the tour and stated that the security situation there is good.
"I have also asked our IGP to submit a separate report on security there and he is expected to hand it over by tomorrow", said the Minister addressing the weekly cabinet briefing.
Jayasekara further noted that Pakistan had promised VIP security to the team and had ensured that all precautions would be taken. He stressed that Pakistan is a friendly nation who stood by Sri Lanka during the war and greatly supported Sri Lanka in winning the war.
Jayasekara added that the Pakistani cricket team was one of the few teams which agreed to play in Sri Lanka when the island nation was in turmoil and it is fair for us to support them during such situations. With regard to the coaches who have refused to accompany the Sri Lankan team on tour, the Minister said it is up to Sri Lanka Cricket to decide whether they would continue to work with the team or not in future.
This will be the Lankan team's first visit to Pakistan since the terrorist attack on the team in 2009.
