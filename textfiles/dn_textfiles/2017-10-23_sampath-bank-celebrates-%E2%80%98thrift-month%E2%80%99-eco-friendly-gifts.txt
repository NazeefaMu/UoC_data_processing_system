Sampath Bank celebrates ‘Thrift Month’ with eco-friendly gifts

Sampath Bank, in its continuing commitment to emphasize the importance of saving, has introduced an exciting gift promotion that will both incentivize and help depositors save money.
Sampath Bank is celebrating ‘Thrift Month’ in October and rewarding its general savings accountholders with SLS certified LED bulbs that will help them reduce their overall electricity bill while contributing towards an eco-friendly Sri Lanka.
LED bulbs consume less electricity than CFLs, have a longer lifespan and are mercury free. These gifts were chosen by the Bank for the dual purpose of combating the rising cost of electricity and to help accountholders go green.
Commenting on this exciting new promotion,Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy General Manager – Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank said, “As a national financial services provider we see it as our responsibility to encourage our customers to be fiscally responsible by instilling the habit of saving in them. It is also important to consider our impact on the environment thus our choice in gift this year was a conscious effort on our part to help our customers to not only save more but also help them become more eco-friendly. Therefore, we see the introduction of this promotion as not only rewarding our customers but also serving the nation.”
This endeavor will coincide with World Thrift Day on October 31.
Established in 1987 Sampath Bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to their constant innovation and customer focused approach to business.
