Physical rehabilitation - a new approach

Australian qualified Remedial Massage Therapist, Missaka brings with him over a decade of experience in deep tissue and sports massage therapy. Having obtained his qualification from the University of Victoria and La Trobe University, he also possesses extensive knowledge in Physiotherapy, enabling him to cater to the varied needs of his clients.
Be it highly organized massage therapy to enhance client’s mobility and better flexibility, remedial therapy for those with sports injuries, accident injuries and work injuries, professional spa massage and body treatments or disabled patient care, his versatile prowess allows for highly skilled and precise treatment. With experience in deep tissue and relaxation massages, rehabilitative massages, electro mechanical massages and aromatic massage therapy; he offers a holistic approach that many cannot claim.
His ability to treat 98% of body injuries is also a talent that he is immensely proud of with a majority of his patients enduring sports, accident and work injuries recovering completely.
Explaining the benefits of Remedial therapy, Missaka says, “Remedial therapy may seem a new terminology to Sri Lankans, but for people abroad it is not so. In fact, it is known to provide an effective healing treatment that can be gentle or strong, deep or shallow when muscles and tendons become damaged, impaired, knotted, tense or immobile.”
His newest venture; his therapy clinic makes the benefits of Remedial Massage Therapy available to a wider audience in a manner that is compliant with international standards of practice and protocols. Offering much needed relief to those suffering from physical stress due to long hours at their computers, sports men and women as well as exercise enthusiasts on a long-term basis. Many could benefit from remedial massage therapy visiting the clinic instead of exercising on their own, eliminating the long and arduous process of attempting it by themselves.
