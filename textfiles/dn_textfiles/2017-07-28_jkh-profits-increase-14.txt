The Leisure industry group PBT of Rs.179 million in the first quarter of 2017/18 is a decrease of 68 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year. “The decline was anticipated and arises from a non-cash impact of Rs.203 million on account of the acceleration of depreciation on assets from the closure of “Bentota Beach by Cinnamon”, the partial closures of “Cinnamon Dhonveli Maldives” and “Ellaidhoo Maldives by Cinnamon” for on-going refurbishments,” Chairman Susantha Ratnayake said.

The Financial Services industry group PBT of Rs.239 million in the first quarter of 2017/18 is an increase of 22 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year,
The increase in profitability was primarily due to Union Assurance PLC which recorded encouraging double-digit growth in gross written premiums and John Keells Stock Brokers which recorded a better performance when compared to the previous year. The Information Technology industry group PBT of Rs.71 million in the first quarter of 2017/18 is an increase over the first quarter of the previous financial year.
