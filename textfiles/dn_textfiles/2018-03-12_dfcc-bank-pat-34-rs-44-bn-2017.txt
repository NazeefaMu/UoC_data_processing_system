This Integrated Annual Report serves as a disclosure of the Bank’s strategy, governance, performance and prospects and how they help to create sustainable value within our operating environment giving key financial information while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures.
Continuing with the approach to reporting adopted in the last three years, this Report balances the need to communicate effectively through concise, relevant information (to a large and diverse stakeholder group), while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures.
“Going beyond conventional reporting, we have implemented the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards format for reporting, an update to the GRI G4 format used in our previous annual reports. We continue to update our corporate website with a focus on investor relations, supplemented by an investor relations app for smart phones and other devices,” the report said.
DFCC Bank Annual Report for 2017 covers the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31, 2017 and it also includes impactful thematic images.
“DFCC Bank has continued to grow in 2017. Our results show the dynamic is changing. Profit was up by 34%, expenses carefully managed despite the cost of relocating and upgrading branches and increased investment in building the DFCC brand, Chairman, DFCC Royle Jansz commented to the review.“The Bank has set itself a challenging target over the next three years, and our people are geared to bringing this plan to fruition,” he further added.
Chief Executive Officer, Lakshman Silva commented that the highlights of DFCC’s financial performance speak volumes of its success.
“Advances and loan book was up 15% to Rs 213,676 million, non-performing ratio down to 2.77% from 2.97%, deposits up 38% to Rs 193,308 million and profit after tax up 34% to Rs 4,415 million. DFCC was the only commercial bank to have some form of upgrade during the rating period. The upgrades also reflect the fact that looking ahead, DFCC’s strategies were acknowledged to provide the foundation for a sustainable progress.”
The CEO added that going forward, DFCC has set in place plans to achieve a demanding target within the next three years. “In doing so, we expect to be placed as a Systemically Important Bank in the upper quartile of commercial banks in Sri Lanka. A mix of complementary strategies will be employed, which would also include some ‘Blue Ocean’ initiatives. “In this context, DFCC will explore a range of opportunities in consolidation and offshore markets. The Bank will also leverage on its Group relationships particularly in the area of Public Private Partnerships,” he added.
