Sugar tax revise to benefit fruit juice producers

The recently revised sugar tax is expected to help the local fruit juice manufacturers and the local beverage industry, which suffered as a result of the blanket sugar tax introduced in November 2017.
National Economic Council (NEC) Secretary General Prof. Lalith Samarakoon, in a response to the Daily News, explained that the 2017 tax of Rs. 50 cents per gram of sugar in beverages discriminated against local fruit juice manufacturers and international beverage companies equally.
“There was an inconsistent policy where the government was promoting fruit farming while increasing the tax on fruit drinks, essentially reducing their market,” he said.
Over the past three years, the government, through the Agriculture Ministry and the Grama Shakthi programme, had been encouraging farmers to grow fruits, including for export.
However, 80 percent of their products being purchased by local fruit juice manufacturing companies were increasingly finding the market shrinking due to the tax.
The new revisions propose to have the tax levied only for carbonated drinks with a sugar content of 6g of sugar (per 100ml) and above.
For fruit-based drinks, that threshold was raised to 9g of sugar from 6g. Further, the rate of tax was reduced from Rs. 50 cents to Rs. 30 cents per gram for fruit drinks.
“The government did not ignore the health aspects. Over time, the government should try to force drinks manufacturers to reduce the sugar content and educate the public to minimise sugary drinks. The transition will need time both for manufacturers and consumers,” said Prof. Samarakoon.
The introduction of the colour coding system and sugar tax on beverages in 2017 has helped increase awareness among the public with regard to the sugar content in beverages.
However, local companies such as Ceylon Cold Stores (CCS) under which Elephant House operates, has pointed out that they were not given enough time to switch to ‘sugar-free’ options before the tax was introduced. As a result, they had faced a 33 percent collapse in their carbonated drinks market on top of a currency collapse, which led to an economic downturn early this year.
Foreign companies, on the other hand, which have had experience with the sugar tax internationally, however, had an existing range of ‘sugar-free’ drinks, which were readily rolled out and the companies continued to make a profit.
In April this year, CCS developed a sugar-free beverage portfolio but reprise for fruit juice manufacturers would not have come easily without a revision of the previous sugar tax structure which treated all beverages under the same umbrella.
