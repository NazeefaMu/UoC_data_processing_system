Court recalls arrest warrant against Weerakumara Dissanayake

Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court recalled the arrest warrant issued against the National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake after he appeared before Court, yesterday.
Earlier in the day, the Colombo Chief Magistrate issued a warrant for the arrest of National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake for his failure to appear in Court over a case filed by Cinnamon Garden Police. Cinnamon Garden Police are expecting to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
However, when the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the suspect Weerakumara Dissanayake was not present in Court.
On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Seven suspects - NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian - are currently out on bail.
The Police had informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from the police to organise the march.
They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license.
The Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
