Suraksha   Welcome relief for Schoolchildren

When 15-year-old Semalie Sashintha Senadeera fell off a balcony and injured her spine, her parents, who were from a middle class background, took her to a government hospital first, but the doctors there informed them that she needed a risky operation and that she would have to wait for a specialist team visiting from India to have it done.
It was then that her desperate father came across another doctor at the hospital who told him that if he brought the child to a private hospital in which he was working, he could get the operation done.
It would however cost him Rs. 2.5 million.
“It was not a risk I wanted to take,” said Senadeera* and he promptly moved his child to the private hospital where the operation was done successfully. She is doing well and is back to walking.
He was able to bear the cost through the recent Suraksha health insurance scheme introduced last year by the government, for all schoolchildren between the ages of 5 and 19.
“It was then that I found out about the scheme and applied for it. Within two to three days I was able to get Rs. 100,000. I was probably one of the first people to claim it. Though the cost was not recovered 100 percent, it was something.”
Suraksha was introduced in October 2017 to help children bridge the gaps in health costs during their school career. The insurance covers diseases, accidents, disabilities and the death of either the child or the parent. 
The insurance cover includes surgical and hospitalisation benefits of Rs. 200,000 per annum, as well as outdoor patients’ benefits worth Rs. 10,000 for seven selected ailments. Further, there is a personal accident insurance benefit provided to both student and parents: Rs. 100,000 - to be paid upon the accidental death of the student; Rs. 100,000 in the event of a total permanent disability of the student; and Rs. 50,000 in the case of partial permanent disability of the student. The insurance scheme also covers parents’ accidental death where a sum of Rs. 75,000 is paid to the student for such a loss.
In addition, there is a 20 percent deduction on the bill when obtaining in-patient treatment from private hospitals (excluding drugs) and a 20 percent deduction of expenses or charges of specialists and consultant doctors.
According to the Education Ministry, since the scheme was introduced last year, the government has paid Rs. 89 million in claims to 8,870 people (as of May 18, 2018).
Seven months ago, B.A. Rupika’s (45) husband in Wattemulla met with an accident and passed away. She is now the sole breadwinner in her family. As she struggled to make ends meet, her child’s school informed her that she could apply for a claim through Suraksha. The claim took 1.5 months, but she was able to get Rs. 75,000 for the death of her husband, “It helped me a lot,” she said.
According to the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, 3,101 persons died as a result of road accidents in 2017, but only 89 applicants were paid compensation through insurance schemes. Suraksha thus opens up a whole new avenue for compensation payments.
J.H.D. P. Indika Jayasundera’s (44) son Vidura got dengue twice, as schoolchildren are one of the most vulnerable groups in terms of the disease. “The first time, Suraksha helped meet part of the hospital bill, and the second time, we were able to recover the whole amount through Suraksha,” he said.
“People are always reluctant when you talk of an insurance scheme, but it is not that bad. We went to a private hospital because of the hassle we have to face in a government hospital. There are visiting times and you have to wait in line for tests, etc…and the scheme helped us have that option with the private hospital.”
 
Children are accident prone 
Ratnapura’s St Aloysius’ Principal Sunil Rajapitiya’s school is located in an area which faced frequent natural disasters. “We are constantly having floods and landslides in these areas, so this insurance scheme is very good for the children,” he said. Last year a student was killed by the floods. 
“This is very valuable to my children because they undergo a lot of hardship when they are sick. We had a child die of cancer and the family struggled for a long time with the costs involved.”
He explained that it was common for the schools and the parents in the area to band together to collect money whenever a child was grievously ill, as the costs were high even with a free healthcare system in the country. “When a child at the Udugama school was sick recently, we sold tickets and had various fund-raising activities to collect the money needed.”
The health insurance scheme, thus, he said was most helpful to children in the area.
If Rajapitiya’s children in Ratnapura were having a problem, so were the students in the capital of the country, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte.
On January 2017, Sri Jayewardenepura Maha Vidyalaya, Kotte, was the first school in the country to have a Cloud Smart Classroom, but according to its Principal, Major D.A.D. Wanaguru, many of his students come from economically poor family backgrounds, making healthcare one of the biggest costs in the family.
“I have seen families split because of this. A child gets sick and the parents cannot afford the costs,” said Major Wanaguru.
He appreciated the introduction of the insurance scheme, free to all students, whether they have money or not.
“Schoolchildren are always prone to accidents. So the cost of child healthcare is there throughout a child’s schooling career. This will help many.”
He noted that similar to the difference made in the lives of schoolchildren through government schemes like free uniforms, textbooks and the mid-day meal, this scheme too would have a huge impact on the lives of the children. “I remember when I was a teacher, children came to school just for the mid-day meal. So I know this too will solve a main issue in the country.”
Children in his school, however, are yet to apply for a claim from the insurance scheme. Major Wanaguru said the idea was yet to sink in among the general public and that though they had conducted awareness sessions, many were still not aware of the specifics of the scheme.
“The school alone cannot do this. The insurance company (Sri Lanka Insurance) should also take an interest in spreading the word,” he said.
 
Improvements to the system
Lack of awareness is a common issue brought out by many in the school system. A school teacher in a government school in Matale said that there was a parent who desperately wanted to get the scheme for her sick child, but was unable to do so because she did not get the right information on time. “It was too late, the child died,” she said. She added that she did not even know what the scheme was all about and that the school took little interest in promoting it to the students or making the teachers aware of its contents.
A parent from a leading semi-government Muslim school in Colombo, in the meantime, found out that her child’s school had not registered with Sri Lanka Insurance, when she called them up to ask whether her child was eligible for the scheme. 
“The school just sent us a leaflet about it once, but thereafter they did not collect my son’s information or tell us how we could apply for it,” she said.
All private, international, semi-government and pirivena schoolchildren are automatically registered under Suraksha, but the responsibility of collecting the student’s information and registering them with the scheme and making parents aware of the benefits has been delegated to the school authorities by the Education Ministry.
Jayasundera in the meantime, said that though they had applied for the scheme, at first they were not aware of what exactly it covered. “Admission charges to private hospitals are not covered. It is only when the child is going to be discharged that they tell us what is covered and what is not. They should inform the parents about this at the start,” he said.
Further he highlighted that there were many delays when applying for claims, especially when it was applied through a branch office of Sri Lanka Insurance,
“The first time we applied, we did so through the Kaduwela branch and we had to follow up so many times, because they told us that the claim has to be sent to their head office to be processed. The second time around, it took less time because we knew the system and applied directly at their head office.”
The only reason Senadeera received his claim so fast was because he himself worked in the insurance profession and knew how the system worked.
They should have officers around the country to process claims and not have to send it to head office, said Senadeera. This, he said, would greatly cut down processing time, a must when you have a sick child in hospital.
He further asked that the amount given per day to the child admitted at a government hospital be increased. “This scheme is most helpful to parents who can’t afford healthcare. So Rs. 1,000 per day is not enough, it should be more.”
Senadeera also explained that many poorer parents were reluctant to claim through Suraksha because either way they would have to foot the initial amount on their own and only later get it reimbursed. “Many people cannot afford to put up that initial sum. So they don’t bother with insurance. There must be a direct payment scheme where the insurance covers the cost without us having to pay it first. If you connect the hospitals directly to the insurance company, many more people will make claims.”
Though government hospitals are meant to be free, in reality healthcare is not. There are many expenses people have to bear, from costs in care to tests, he added.
The Education Ministry’s Director of Education, School Health and Nutrition Branch, Renuka Peiris when contacted by the Daily News said they had conducted an awareness programme for schools on December 7, 2017. “We understand that there is a problem with the level of awareness about Suraksha in schools. Some schools are doing a good job whilst others are not interested,” said Peiris.
She said that they were having discussions with Sri Lanka Insurance to have more awareness programmes conducted in schools. Further, they have also asked whether the Insurance Corporation can look at a scheme to directly connect their services with the hospitals. “We were hoping that at least some hospitals could be selected to do this at the start and later it could be expanded to all others,” said Peiris.
Sri Lanka Insurance is yet to agree to the proposal.
Overall however, the insurance scheme has been a welcome relief to many parents struggling to earn enough to cover the expenses of their children. Ideologically, whether health insurance is needed or not for a country which offers free healthcare, for the moment Suraksha has helped many deal with the realities of the system.
