Government has taken several meaningful steps to encourage exporters, said State Minister of International Trade, Sujeewa Senasinghe.
He was speaking at the 6th Exporters’ Forum at the EDB Auditorium.
State Minster said that the national export strategy was launched to encourage Sri Lankan exporters.
“In addition the national program for creation of 2,000 new exporters by 2020 is in progress.”
The Presidential Export Awards ceremony was also held recently mainly to encourage exporters and the government is doing similar events towards promotion of exports. The minister further said that all necessary measures will be taken to give maximum support to the export community as exports are vital for economic development of the country.
A number of representatives from government agencies and private sector participated in the forum and exporter’s issues were discussed and solutions found to most of their issues.
The exporters’ forum is held once in every two months.
