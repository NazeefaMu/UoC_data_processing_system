Tea Talks on “The Chitra Lane Way”

“The Chitra Lane Way”, a recently launched book about bringing up children; especially those with special needs, was the centre of a fascinating discussion that took place as part of the ‘Tea Talks’ series held at Maniumpathy boutique hotel.
Authored by well known and respected Clinical Psychologist Nishalie Fernandopulle, “The Chitra Lane Way” documents the experiences and insights she has gained during her decade of work at the Chitra Lane School.
“This book describes the various stages and milestone of a child’s development and lets parents know what they need to be aware of at every stage. In that sense it is a book that can serve as a valuable guide for any parent, not just those who have children with special needs. Of course, special needs children are the main focus, and we have called on our years of experience to document the methods, interventions and management techniques that we have found to be most helpful and holistic when it comes to caring for and educating children with special needs,” Fernandopulle said.
Founder of the organization, Delysia Gunewardene, who continues to devote her time to guide and inspire the Chitra Lane family, was also present and offered in depth insights into the book “When Chitra Lane started over four decades ago, there was nowhere for parents of children with special needs to turn to for help and support. We started with a single room, and now, we reach out to over 2,000 students across the country annually. This book shares the experience we have had and the knowledge we have gained, and we hope that it will serve as a tool for the parents, educators and caregivers of these very special children, so that we ensure that we do everything we can to give them the gift of independence, and help them reach their full potential,” Gunewardene said.
The talk was the third in a series of ‘Tea Talks’ held at Maniumpathy Boutique Hotel, a property of Manor House Concepts. As always, the talk was structured to allow a small group of individuals to come together and enjoy an insightful inspirational conversation.
