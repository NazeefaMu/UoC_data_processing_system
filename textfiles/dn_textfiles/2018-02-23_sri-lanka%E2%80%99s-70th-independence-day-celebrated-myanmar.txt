Sri Lanka’s 70th Independence Day celebrated in Myanmar

The 70th Anniversary of Independence of Sri Lanka was celebrated at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Yangon, Myanmar on February 4, under the patronage of Sri Lankan Ambassador to Myanmar K. W. N. D. Karunaratne, with the participation of Embassy staff and Sri Lankan expatriates in Myanmar.
The ceremony commenced with Ambassador K. W. N. D. Karunaratne hoisting the national flag, which was followed by the national anthem. Two minutes of silence were observed in honour of all those who had sacrificed their lives to safeguard the motherland.
The traditional oil lamp was lit by Ambassador Karunaratne and his diplomatic staff, along with the Sri Lankan Association in Myanmar (SLIM) Chairman. The Multi-faith religious observances in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam were conducted by religious dignitaries.
Independence Day messages from President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana were then read in all three languages.
Addressing the gathering, Ambassador K. W. N. D. Karunaratne stressed the importance of the day and said Sri Lankans living abroad should work together and contribute to the development of the nation.
