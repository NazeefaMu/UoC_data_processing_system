Sovereign right to decide on foreign judges with Sri Lanka: Health Minister

 
Deciding on the participation of foreign judges with the investigations on Sri Lanka’s war crime allegations and human right violations is a sovereign right of the Sri Lankan government and will be decided by the Sri Lankan government, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said that no foreign judges would join the investigations on war crime allegations and human right violations.
The UNHRC High Commissioner during his recent visit to Sri Lanka said that he proposed the participation of foreign judges in the judicial process on alleged war crime. Although he proposed it, he said that it was the sovereign right of Sri Lanka to decide. Accordingly, it proves that the Government of Sri Lanka is the authority that decides the participation of foreign judges, Senaratne said.
