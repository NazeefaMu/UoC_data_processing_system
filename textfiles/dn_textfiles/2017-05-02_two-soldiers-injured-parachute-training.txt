Two soldiers, attached to the Kuda Oya Army Camp, were injured during a parachute training held at Embilipitiya Army Training Camp.

He said the female soldier had suffered minor burnt injuries when she fell on a high tension wire while jumping to land on the Embilipitiya ground. The female trainee’s hands and legs have been burnt.
The male soldier, who is a Commando Captain, had injured his ankle due to an error in his landing, Brigadier Senevirtane said.
