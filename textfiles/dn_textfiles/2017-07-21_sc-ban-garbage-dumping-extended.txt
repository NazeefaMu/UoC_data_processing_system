The Supreme Court yesterday further extended its Interim Order till July 25, preventing authorities including the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from dumping garbage in the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
The three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera made this order pursuant to a fundamental rights petition filed by 35 five residents.
These residents are living in close proximity to the Muthurajawela Sanctuary seeking an Interim Order directing the authorities not to store or dump garbage in the Sanctuary.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the respondents informed Court that the CMC was not disposing garbage at the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
The petitioners cited Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Municipal Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environment Authority (CEA), the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha and six other parties as respondents.
The petitioners further stated that the petitioners and their families and other residents living in close proximity of Muthurajawela Sanctuary have been severely affected and continue to be affected by this dumping.
The petitioners further stated that the area in question is declared a sanctuary under the Flora and Fauna Protection Act by the gazette dated 31.10.1996 in recognition of its vast bio-diversity.
