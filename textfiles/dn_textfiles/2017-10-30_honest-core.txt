Honest to the core

Women play a significant role in development spheres and contribution to the national economy is enormous. Helen A. Meegasmulla, took on duties as the Commissioner General Department of Excise on September 18, 2017 to building a healthy society in Sri Lanka, which is free from illicit liquor and narcotics drugs. She is the first ever woman to head the department in its history.
The Department of Excise operates under the purview of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. It has legal authority for the implementation of excise policies of the Government and relevant activities including the protection and collection of excise revenue. In addition the authority and responsibility for administration of Tobacco Tax Act, the collective responsibility for the enforcement of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance with the Police and other relevant agencies and the responsibility of effecting of National Authority Act on Tobacco and Alcohol are also mandatory functions delegated to the department. The department is engaged in performing a national mission providing social security, by collecting a part of government revenue to finance the country’s economic development as well as preventing the use of illicit liquor by detecting illegal activities falling under the legislations.
The department sees efficient and effective administration of the Liquor and Tobacco industry in Sri Lanka through the collection of revenue, preventing of illicit manufacture and sale of products for development and welfare of the society as its mission. “Families face many issues due to illicit liquor. Illicit liquor is consumed by the poor and they become even more poverty stricken. It is unhealthy for the human being. Illicit liquor is manufactured and distributed in every part of the island.
There are six special units in the department to detect such places and bring them under the law of the country. The persons holding the permits are also monitored to see whether they adhere to the rules and regulations. Our officers will prepare a technical crime report and fine the wrong doers,” Meegasmulla said.

While eradicating the use of illicit liquor she is aimed at uplifting the toddy tapping industry one of the oldest traditional industries in Sri Lankan history.“Our aim is to free the society from liquor. Together with narcotic units and the police department we raid many placed where illicit liquor is made. During British ruling coconut industry was introduced to our country. Coconuts were abundant those days, but now there aren’t coconuts enough for consumption so people make artificial toddy which is very unhealthy,” she said.
“We will assist the toddy tapping industry to develop. We welcome suggestions and ideas of those who are involved. There are shortcomings in the industry which hinders its development. The diminishing of the toddy tapping industry would see the increase of the consumption of illicit liquor. Toddy is said to be a healthy beverage with medicinal values if manufactured according to the standards and consumed adequately,” Meegasmulla said.
“The Government estimates revenue from this industry of which there is a 30 per cent decline. It is our duty to see the targets are achieved. At the moment there are leaks in the collection of taxes. The Excise Department has officials will work to overcome these issues,” she added.
Commenting on her responsibilities as the Commissioner General, Meegasmulla said it is prestigious position bestowed by the people. “People chose us as their leaders. When I carry out my duties I think of the staff, the Government and the ordinary people of the country. I have to bring all three sectors on one platform and balance how I treat each party. I have to learn from people and take what is beneficial for the country to develop the economy. At the same time I have to communicate with the political leaders to achieve the revenue targets of the Government,” she said.
The door is open
“No one has to wait in a queue to meet me. The door is open for anyone to come and meet me regarding their issues. Some illicit liquor manufacturers have their own grief. When they admit they did wrong I cannot turn aside without opening up any avenue for them to earn an income. After all they have their families to look after. I try to help them to be good citizens in every possible way,” Meegasmulla said.
“I am also concerned about the women living in estates communities. They are vulnerable to many unhealthy practices due to low economic status and social inequalities. Steps should be taken to uplift their lives. Living and working in outstation areas as a District Secretary has exposed me to the hardships of life of women. It laid the foundation of my career and equipped me with the necessary experience to address issues at a larger scale,” she pointed out.
Different perspectives
Meegasmulla says a woman tends to look at things in a different perspective. “Whether you are a woman or a man you should be honest with your work and carry out responsibilities accurately. You have to put your heart and soul into your duties, be creative and innovative. A woman has the ability to handle work under any circumstance. As a daughter she grows up close to her mother and learns discipline and learns to take the responsibility to be a mother one day.
Most women don’t earn money unnecessarily or misuse money. Women being in top positions will benefit the country,” she said.
Meegasmulla also hopes to launch several programmes to safeguard young children from drug addiction. “School children are addicted to drugs at present which has become a menace. The officers of the department will also be trained to carry out their duties efficiently and effectively. Finally I hope the society will be a better place for all of us to live in,” she concluded.
