How to battle hateful workplace tittle-tattle

Problems at work are anything but uncommon. One of the most recurrent problems that someone might run into is slander in the workplace. This can be malicious gossip, or outright lies. Slanderous gossip in the workplace involves telling lies or spreading half-truths that might hurt or damage someone’s reputation when they are not present to defend themselves.
Such defamatory tittle-tattle is widespread in most workplaces. Sometimes, it seems, as if people have nothing better to do than engage in scandalous chit-chat. Ok, let’s admit it. It is darn difficult not to become involved in tell-tale natter at work. After all, people revel in gossip and fascinating bits of scandalous information that beats the pants off monotony any day. It is true that in small communities and workplaces scandalous rumour travels at the speed of boredom.
In every community or institution there is always a great deal of idle chit-chat swirling around. Yet we are all aware that juicy calumny is what no one claims to like, but everybody enjoys. The only time we dislike slanderous hearsay is when gossips gossip about us. And always remember the old adage that whoever gossips to you will be certain to gossip about you. Although most people will claim to disapprove of such damaging chatter, curiously enough in these same places of employment there are so many who don’t approve talking about others behind their back. Slander in the workplace will often continue to happen, even if there are rules mandating that employees not participate in this type of behaviour.
Learning how to deal with slander in the workplace involves understanding why it happens in the first place. Most people engage in defaming others because of deeply entrenched fears that they have about their own values and life. These low-life creepy, crawly creatures are referred to as the ‘Slander Serpents’ who slither around hissing their poisonous canards into as many scandal-starved ears as possible.
Bringing a lawsuit
There are also some who use mudslinging as a shield so that they can participate in conversations without having to reveal anything about themselves or their own feelings. Bringing a lawsuit against a company that you work for is an option if the slander becomes so severe that it causes harm to your reputation that is life damaging.
But not everyone wants to go to such lengths to deal with slander in the workplace. Gossiping can develop like a cancer spreading through the office and creating a backbiting and stressful environment where half-truth and innuendo replaces truthful transparency. Spiteful workplace gossip is self-defeating, corrosive and belittles both the speaker and the person who is the victim of the gossip.
It can be a vicious way in which ambitious staff may see to undermine a competitor. Or it may be idle gossips, lacking a motive, but still being corrosive and damaging. Rumour can be an insidious form of bullying. It is demeaning. It promotes lies and half truths about people when they are not present. It is often designed to hurt and denigrate people and destroy reputations behind their backs. It is equivalent to a bullying episode putting someone down or denigrating them without the victim knowing it is occurring. The victim may only be aware of sniggers behind their back and the whispers in the background, which can destroy morale and trust.
Here are some tips on how to battle malicious tittle-tattle. One of the first things you can do to help with the problem of slander in the workplace is to not participate in it yourself. The main reason you don’t want to do this is that if you do say the wrong thing, the person you are talking about can take you to court. Another reason that it is best to avoid such prattle is that you earn a reputation as being a gossiper.
Derogatory tales
If you do hear someone gossiping about a co-worker, you could talk to them and ask them to stop for the good of themselves and the entire workplace. Explain how they could end up in court for spreading derogatory tales about others. They should be apprised why such behaviour is just not on in the workplace, making it impossible for colleagues to get along with one another. In the case of someone gossiping about you, the best thing to do is to try and find out where the gossip started. Office gossip can spread like wildfire and you really have to take some time to find out who started it. Once you know this, talk with that person and ask them why they are saying damaging things about you.
If the slander has got so out of hand that makes it uncomfortable to go to work, talk with your boss or supervisor about the situation. Ask them to take care of the problem. In many cases this helps curb the scandal mongering. But if it doesn’t you do have the option of changing your place of employment.
Spreading their evil
Thus, the poisoned smear campaigns spread their evil like a virus, not only reaping anger, fear and distress about the intended prey, but compounding it with accusations and lost friendships. Such bad-mouthing is often sparked as a result of malignant envy. They are people obsessed with a revolting emotion which focuses on the removal or destruction of the envied object and his or her reputation. More often than not the muck-raking is triggered by jealousy, spite or malice.
It can be tempting to listen in on office gossip but to do so puts your career at risk. Although work may be frustrating for you at times, it's best not to indulge in the exchange of incendiary workplace stories, even if it helps you cope with your frustrations.
The best thing to do is disassociate yourself from the person and try to defuse any gossip when you find yourself unable to get away. Slander in the workplace is simply wrong and detestable. Not only should you curb any gossip about others if you hear it, but you should not participate in giving ear to it. If everyone could follow this simple advice, spending time at work could be a more pleasant experience.
