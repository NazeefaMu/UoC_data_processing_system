Pathum’s double-ton marks the start of Under 19 Div. 1 tourney

A dominant bowling performance followed by Pathum Nissanka’s unbeaten 205 steered Isipathana to a last-minute innings victory over President’s, Rajagiriya in one of the U19 D1 first-round fixtures concluded last Tuesday at Colts ground. Madushika Sandaruwan and Lahiru Dilshan both completed 6-wicket match hauls as President’s were bowled out for 145 and 173 in their two innings in reply to the enormous 319 for five scored by Isipathana in mere 60 overs in the only innings they batted.
Sri Lanka youth player, Pathum Nissanka’s unbeaten 205 that he scored off just 188 balls with 29 fours and 4 sixes was his career-best at any level of cricket in his cricketing career. This was Pathum’s second double ton at U19 level after his 200 for Kalutara Vidyalaya against Debarawewa NS in 2014/15 season.
It actually was a dramatic finish as President’s needing 175 to make Isipathana bat again fell just two runs short of the target when they lost their last second-innings wicket with the score at 173 despite Hiruna Sigera’s stubborn 86 at the top.
President's: 145 in 41.5 overs (Hiruna Sigera 35, Shanaka Bandara 30, Mohomad Rifaz 22, Madushika Sandaruwan 4/30, Neranjan Wanniarachchi 3/33, Lahiru Dilshan 2/30) & 173 in 66 overs (Hiruna Sigera 86, Lahiru Dilshan 4/31, Madushika Sandaruwan 2/57)
Isipathana : 319/5 dec. in 60 overs (Pathum Nissanka 205*, Sanjula Bandara 31*, Heshan Fernando 25, Kalana Perera 22, Thanula Chamod 2/79)

Vimukthi Wijesiriwardana completing a match-bag of 13 wickets including two five-fors helped Kingswood gain first-innings advantage over St.Sylvesters in their U19 D1 first-round fixture concluded on Wednesday in a tame draw at Peradeniya Campus ground.
St. Sylvester’s : 175 in 76.2 overs (Avindu Herath 30, Kavinda Perera 26, Lasantha De Soysa 24, Vimukthi Wijesiriwardana 7/67, Rangana Rathnayake 2/19) & 149/7 in 42 overs (Avindu Herath 76, Vimukthi Wijesiriwardhana 6/58)

Bowlers put Trinity on top of St.Servatius
Vimukthi Nedumal and Thisaru Dilshan sharing seven wickets helped Trinity defend a modest first innings total and claim first innings points over St.Servatius College, Matara in their drawn U19 D1 fixture concluded at Trinity ground on Wednesday.
Trinity, thanks to two fifties from Hasitha Boyagoda and Kalana De Zoysa scored 163 for one in their second innings at close of play on the final day after Servatius had made 166 in reply to the Trinity’s first innings total of 188. Thilan Prashan scoring a 53 and Shashika Dilshan with four wickets played well for Matara school.
Trinity: 188 in 67.1 overs (Hasintha Jayasuriya 58, Thisaru Dilshan 30, Shevon Fersivel 25, Thilan Prashan 2/27, Shashika Dilshan 4/44) & 163/1 in 39.2 overs (Hasitha Boyagoda 68*, Kalana De Zoysa 57*, Shammuganadan Sanogeeth 33)

Gurukula in first-innings win
Lasindu Arosha and Sachintha Chamith well defending a meagre 188 bowled St.Joseph Vaz out for 167 helping Gurukula claim first-innings points in their U19 D1 match concluded on Thursday at Albert Peiris Ground. Shehara Ranatunga’s untiring all-round effort with a five-for and a half-century went in vain as Joseph Vaz’s reply innings disintegrated so pathetically that they could manage only 167 even after Shehara Ranatunga played a lone-hand with a determined 61 with the bat.

All-rounder, Supun Waragoda who made the most of a collective batting effort by Ananda batters following his two wickets with the ball became the mainstay in Ananda’s first-innings win in their U19 D1 match against Mahinda College, Galle concluded on Saturday at Panagoda Army ground. With time permitting, Ananda had an outside chance to complete an outright victory as Mahinda in their second innings were reeling at 133 for seven with a slim lead of 23 runs when match dribbled to a result-less conclusion.
