India-Sri Lanka series starts November 16

New Delhi: Sri Lanka will play a three-day warm-up match in Kolkata ahead of their series against India starting November 16, the Indian cricket board said Tuesday.
The island nation will play three Tests, three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches between November and December. This will be Sri Lanka's return tour following their 9-0 rout by the Virat Kohli-led team earlier this year.
