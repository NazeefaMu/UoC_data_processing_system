I don't carry any shoulder injury which need surgery - Muthuthanttri

Former S. Thomas’ College Mt. Lavinia and Sri Lanka national 7's rugby captain Sudarshana Muthuthantri has denied reports appearing in the media that he has a shoulder injury that needs surgery.
“I was utterly shocked, dismayed and confused to see that I had to keep off the Asian Sevens Series Colombo leg reportedly due to a shoulder injury which needs surgery. I must tell you that I am not having any shoulder injury or any other injury which needs surgery in the first place,” said Muthuthantri.
“I was getting several calls from the rugby fraternity and my fans inquiring about the shoulder injury. In fact I played a rugby match against Air Force last Saturday the 20th for my club CH & FC at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana," he said.
