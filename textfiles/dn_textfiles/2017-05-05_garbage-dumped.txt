Garbage dumped

A fire which erupted in a garbage dump at the cemetery at Central Road, Kattankudy, was doused by the Batticaloa Fire Brigade which was summoned to the scene by the cemetery keeper. Several tombs at the cemetery were damaged. Garbage dumped at the cemetery belonging to the Jamiullafireen Jumma Mosque remained uncleared for the past several weeks, Kattankudy UC Secretary M S M Safie said.
