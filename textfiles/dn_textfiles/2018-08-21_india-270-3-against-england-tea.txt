India 270-3 against England at tea

Nottingham, Monday: India were 270 for three in their second innings, a lead of 438 runs, at tea on the third day of the third Test against England at Trent Bridge on Monday.
India captain Virat Kohli was 93 not out, having made 97 in the first innings, with vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane unbeaten on 17.
England will need to set an all-time record if they were to pull off an improbable victory as the most any side have made in the fourth innings to win a Test match is the West Indies’ 418 for seven against Australia at St John’s, Antigua, in 2003.
The corresponding England record is their 332 for seven against Australia at Melbourne back in 1928/29.
England lead this five-match series 2-0.
