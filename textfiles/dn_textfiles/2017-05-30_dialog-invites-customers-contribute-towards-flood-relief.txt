Dialog invites customers to contribute towards flood relief

Dialog Axiata extending its successful flood relief programme in 2016, whereDialog customers donated Rs. 15 million and Dialog added a further Rs. 50 million towards helping those affected by floods and landslides, invites yet again its valued subscribers to contribute towards helping our fellow Sri Lankans affected by the ongoing natural disaster.
Mass evacuations continue in flood-hit Sri Lanka as relief items and assistance continued to pour in from all parts of the  country for those affected by the floods while several centers were set up for people to donate dry rations, food, water and medicine. Picture courtesy: (newsin.Asia)
The donations could be made via SMS, Star points or eZ cash and Dialog will triple these customer donations and contribute to flood relief activities.
This initiative is conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Disaster Management.
Dialog customers simply need to type DON and SMS to 7700 to contribute Rs. 50 towards this cause and Dialog will triple the customer donation by adding another Rs. 100 to contribute a total of Rs. 150 towards flood relief.
Customers are welcome to send any number of SMS for donations and these will be tripled by Dialog. Customers could also donate using Star Points by dialing #141*1# from their Dialog mobiles, or with eZ Cash by dialing #111*6# and Dialog will all triple these donations.
Customers of Etisalat and Hutch can also contribute to this programme using eZ Cash. Sri Lankans living overseas could also send in their donations by visiting www.worldremit.com.
This programme was initiated in Colombo on May 27 at the Disaster Management Centre, with senior officials from Dialog Axiata, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Disaster Management. The disbursement of funds and related activities will be independently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
