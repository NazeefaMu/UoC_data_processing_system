Afghanistan opt to bat against Sri Lanka

Afghanistan have won the toss and have opted to bat first against Sri Lanka.
 
Afghanistan: Mohammad Shahzad, Noor Ali Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai, Karim Sadiq, Gulbadin Naib, Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan
 
Sri Lanka: Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Chamara Kapugedera, Angelo Mathews, Milinda Siriwardana, Shehan Jayasuriya, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana Herath
 
Pre-match: Lost in transition, defending champions Sri Lanka will look to come out of the rut and start well against a spirited Afghanistan in their World Twenty20 Super 10 opener at Eden Gardens.
 
The defending champions, who were also runners-up in 2009 and 2012, have managed to win only four of their 14 matches since they beat India to win the 2014 edition in Mirpur. They are in the middle of a transition phase after Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene's exit. (CricketNext)
