Lankan heart surgeons train in Bangalore

Apollo Hospital Bangalore hosted surgeons from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for a workshop and training session in minimally invasive cardiac surgery, recently. The programme was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Satyaki Nambla of Apollo Hospital.
The Sri Lankan surgeons included Dr. Priyanga Ratnayake and Dr. Santusht Perera. Two surgeons from Bangladesh, Dr. Sohail Ahmed and Dr. Zakir Hossain also attended. The programme was facilitated by General Sales Manager of Johnson & Johnson, India Manu Dixit.
Participants said the programme was well-organised and helpful in improving their clinical practice. Dr. Ratnayake said minimally invasive surgery is the future in clinical medicine and as Sri Lanka did not have a dedicated programme for minimally invasive heart surgery, this programme could motivate local surgeons to establish a similar unit.
Dr. Perera said despite the procedure’s steep learning curve and need for specialized instruments, it would benefit patients in Sri Lanka if a heart centre decided to pursue such a programme.
The benefits of minimally invasive cardiac surgery, performed through the left chest (rather than a mid-line frontal chestincision), are many. The length of stay following the surgery is usually three to four days (as opposed to 8-10 days with conventional heart surgery).
The pain following the heart operation is markedly less than conventional surgery which helps patients get out of bed and start walking the day after the procedure. The blood loss during minimally invasive heart surgery also tends to be less than that with conventional heart surgery.
This programme at Apollo Hospital has hosted several surgeons from Sri Lanka in the past.
