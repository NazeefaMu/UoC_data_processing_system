Fox and Green  reunite?

 
The cast of the 3D action comedy film 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows', are hoping for the American actress Megan Fox and the 'Terminator' actor Brian Austin Green to make it as a couple. As stated by PEOPLE, Fox is pregnant with the celebrity couple's third baby. Fox and Green already have two young children - three year old Noah and two year old Bodhi.
However, it has been reported that Fox filed for divorce from Brian last summer. The couple had been sharing family time since that point, but, Megan and Brian are not acting like a married couple. Despite of that, Megan and Brian are trying their best to make things work for the sake of their children.
TV 3 reported that the American television and film actress - Brittany Ishibashi, is hopeful that the couple's third baby will help Fox and Austin Green fully reconcile.
Brittany, who portrays Karai in the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows' film, stated that she was excited to hear Megan's pregnancy and Brittany recalled Megan's dedication to her family while on set.
Ishibashi stated, "I have a 2-year-old. We bonded over kids. And I worked with Brian Austin Green a few years ago on 'Desperate Housewives'. He's such a sweet guy. They are both such sweet people - super chill. They're very spiritual people, very kind and generous. And she's an amazing mother. She was always talking about her kids and FaceTiming with her kids. And I think Brian's a great dad. They're such cool people." Ishibashi also talked about being hopeful after she knew that Megan and Brian recently spent time together vacationing in Hawaii. Ishibashi said, "I was like, 'Aw, there you go, guys. And the big island on Hawaii is a very special place, very spiritual - that's where they got married, at the Four Seasons on the big island of Hawaii, at Hualalai. And they were back there."
