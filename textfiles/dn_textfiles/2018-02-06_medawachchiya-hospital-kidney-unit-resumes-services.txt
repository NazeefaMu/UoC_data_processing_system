Medawachchiya Hospital Kidney Unit resumes services

The Kidney Unit of Medawachchiya Hospital, which was temporarily out of commission, resumed services on February 1.
The unit, costing Rs. 57 million, was opened on April 8, 2017, by Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, in the presence of former Provincial Minister K. H. Nandasena.
Although equipment costing nearly Rs. 9 million was installed at the Dialysis Unit, it remained out of commission due to the lack of necessary staff.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has currently appointed the required staff, including doctors and nurses to the unit, responding to a request made by North Central Province Governor P. B. Dissanayake and Provincial Health Ministry Secretary Saman Bandulasena.
The unit is capable of providing dialysis treatment to eight patients, daily.
The opening ceremony of the Kidney Unit was held on February 1, under the patronage of provincial Health Ministry Secretary Saman Bandulasena.
