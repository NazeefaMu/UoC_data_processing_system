China to help combat kidney diseases
Pilot project for ground water treatment

The Chinese government will launch a pilot project for ground water treatment under the chronic kidney diseases prevention programme of the government.
China also plans to offer a kidney disease treatment hospital and kidney ailment research laboratory to Sri Lanka which will be established in the Anuradhapura district. Chinese help is extended based on the recommendations of a Chinese delegation of experts including geologists, geographers etc. who will be in Anuradhapura on a three-day visit.
The 10-member team is headed by Chinese Academy of Science Deputy Director General Chang Hong Nie.
Their visit is a result of the representation of information about kidney diseases spreading in Sri Lanka by President Maithripala Sirisena during his visit to China in March. During the visit, the Chinese Academy of Science signed an agreement with Sri Lanka's Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Ministry to conduct a comprehensive investigation and research into the spread of renal ailments in the North Central Province and to offer assistance for a mechanism to purify ground water resources in the affected areas.
NCP's Water Supply and Drainage Board Kidney Disease Prevention Special Water Supply Project chief engineer H. A. Jayasiri said the Chinese delegation would visit Kahatagasdigiliya and Medawachchiya areas where kidney patients are high.
They are to discuss healthcare, welfare etc with patients and families.
The Chinese team will also visit the Katuwela village to inspect the water supply arrangements using reverse osmosis filtering mechanism.
