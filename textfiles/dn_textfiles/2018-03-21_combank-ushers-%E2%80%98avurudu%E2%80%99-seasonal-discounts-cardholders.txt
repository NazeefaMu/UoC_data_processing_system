Combank easy payment plans for jewellery will be available up to 24 months on credit cards, and will be valid until 31st December 2018, the Bank said.
Lifestyle product retailers participating in the promotion include Lifestraw, Neeliyas, Comfort Bedding, VLCC, Celcius, and CIB Curtains.
In addition,Credit cardholders can enjoy discounts up to 25% at Arpico Supercentre for fresh items such as fruits, vegetables and seafood till April 29.
To ensure a wide cross section of Credit and Debit cardholders benefit from the promotion, the participating retailers offer an extensive choice of products at different price levels.
Besides spoiling Commercial Bank Credit and Debit cardholders for shopping choice this Avurudu season, and making exciting holidays more affordable, these promotions significantly enhance the benefits already offered by ‘Comdeals,’ a programme which provides value addition to Commercial Bank Cardholders through discounts at a number of major retail outlets in the country and 0% easy payment schemes for Credit Cardholders, the Bank said. Commercial Bank Cardholders are also eligible to participate in global promotions carried out by Visa and Mastercard.
The Bank is the first to offer loyalty rewards for both Credit and Debit cardholders under its Max Loyalty Rewards scheme, and was a pioneer in extending promotional discount offers, which were traditionally only offered for Credit cards, to its Debit cards.
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in Credit and Debit Card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The Bank offers a variety of Credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and Mastercard as well as Visa Signature, World Mastercard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ‘Tap & Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network. Commercial Bank Max Loyalty Rewards scheme is the only loyalty scheme that offers loyalty rewards points on both Credit and Debit cards.
