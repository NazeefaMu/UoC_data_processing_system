VOICE OF JESUS OVER VANNI

And that voice belonged to Bishop Valence.
It fell over his worshipers in their thousands when they flocked to hear his voice rising from within wilderness of Vanni.
Over the spacious Vanni when the dew in the morning had evaporated to let the calm settle, one could hear even a pin drop in a crowd so large when Bishop Valence spoke, it was the voice of Jesus I heard. There would have been many who felt it that way.
It was a day of healing as derived from the parables of Jesus when his wondrous chosen child, moved over to replace him on earth. The church was the venue, Lord Bishop of Chilaw, Rt. Rev Dr, Valence Mendis the shepherd to thousands of believers who are spiritually drawn to him where ever he preaches.
As I stood under a shady sprawling tree away from the flow, I was baffled the way they were dressed, illuminating arabesque colour as against the rising sun in the morning. I was able to watch every devotee from a distance; men, women and children as though heading for a wedding mass.
I mused to myself. ‘Why all this fuss’?
Then it dawned; it was the Sabath. These simple rural folk in their Sunday best had come to the house of prayer, dressed in what God has blessed them with.
Were they spiritually drawn or not no one knew and whatever doubt I had was blown in the air when their shepherd rose to the occasion. Said Bishop Valence in his usual eloquence to touch each and every heart about the wonders of spiritual healing:- ‘Healing spreads over both body and mind on the believer. It is simple people like you who gathered around Jesus throughout his life on earth seeking his touch of heal and he responded with love and care. The parables found in the Holy - Bible says so. Trust in Jesus and he will hear you. You will feel the spiritual experience when you place your trust in him. Bishop Valence extended his faith, the purity and love that draws him like a magnet and the reverence with which they look up to him. ‘Today is a day of healing’ he elaborated as found in Mark 5. 21. ‘Jesus went back across to the other side of the lake. There at the lakeside, a large crowd gathered around him. Jairus, an official of the local synagogue arrived and saw Jesus, he threw himself down at his feet and begged him earnestly. ‘My little daughter is very sick. Please come and place your hands on her so that she will get well. Then Jesus started off with him. So many people were going along with Jesus that they were crowding him from every side.
There was a woman who had suffered terribly from severe bleeding for twelve years even though she had been treated by many doctors. She had spent all her money but instead of getting better she got worse all the time. She had heard about Jesus,
She came in the crowd behind him, saying to herself If I touch his clothes I will get well’.
She touched his cloak and her bleeding stopped at once: and she had the feeling inside herself that she was healed of her trouble. At once Jesus knew that power had gone out of him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked ‘Who touched my clothes?
His disciples answered: “You see how the people are crowding you, why do you ask who touched you?
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. The woman realized what had happened: so she came trembling with fear, knelt at his feet and told him the whole truth. Jesus said to her ‘My daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed of your troubles.
While Jesus was saying this, some messengers came to Jairus from his house and told him ‘You daughter has died. Why bother the Teacher any longer’ Jesus paid no attention to what they said but told him, ‘don’t be afraid, only believe. Then he did not let anyone else go with him except Peter and James and his brother John. They arrived at Jairus’ house where Jesus saw the confusion and heard all the loud crying and wailing. He went in and said to them ‘Why all this confusion? Why are you crying? The child is not dead, she is only sleeping.
They started making fun of him, so he put them all out, took the child’s father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the child was lying. He took her hand and said to her ‘TALITHA KOUM’ which means ‘little girl’, I tell you to get up. She got up at once and started walking around. (she was twelve years old). When this happened, they were completely amazed. But Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone and he said, ‘Give her something to eat’
Bishop Valence continued to outline these parables by explaining that Jesus as a man of authority and action as seen in his teachings, in his power over sins and forgiving his people their failure to understand his mission. He explained about Jesus’ ministry of healing and teaching.
This particular day of spiritual healing came easy on words for Bishop Valence being a philosopher. In the process of his delivery, he rekindled the power of faith a woman can possess; words of wisdom to a trusting woman and among the devotees present, women outnumbered men.
After his sermon and blessings, he moved over to where the crowd waited en masse and from a distance, I could barely see how they grappled to touch him which flashed in my mind how the followers of Jesus wanted to touch him and be healed.
It was reminiscent and mindful of the Bishop as its central figure, brought to life as found in the parable. Today, they were all drawn to this humble child of God who had compassion for these simple Christians.
It was the WAY and the PATH he created for me that morning as I faintly heard his beautiful voice fading in the wilderness through which I drove back, my heart filled with joy.
BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CHURCH
In the Diocese of Chilaw and sited in near-wilderness of Vanni, Angunawila, was a dot of a shrine in 1905 which dates back to over one hundred and thirteen years which is certainly a long life for a church to survive into a world of high-tech development where one could read the Holy Bible on internet. With time moving slowly and few rural folks worshipping on Sundays, it was shifted to another location in 1950. The church has undergone systematic changes.
From a humble beginning in 1905 for its survival from an area called ‘Rajamakumara Vanni Palatha’ in Vanni where hundreds of priests would have preached from behinds its altar, today Rev. Fr. Maurice Anderson is the custodian of its spiritual heritage as its Parish Priest who tirelessly tends to the church’s congregation.
