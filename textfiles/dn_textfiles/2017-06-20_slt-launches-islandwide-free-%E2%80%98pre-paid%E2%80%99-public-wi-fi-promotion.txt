SLT launches islandwide free ‘Pre-Paid’ public Wi-Fi promotion

Following the successful conclusion of free ‘post-paid’ public Wi-Fi promotions in February and March, Sri Lanka Telecom has launched an islandwide promotion, providing free Internet access for all ‘pre-paid’ SLT Wi-Fi scratch card users via public Wi-Fi hotspots.
This promotion will take place between June 23-30.
Nearly 200 Wi-Fi hotspot locations will be available for free Internet access to all users who have obtained an SLT pre-paid Wi-Fi card. The SLT Prepaid SSID is accessible from public hotspot locations by use of an SLT pre-paid Wi-Fi scratch card, whilst the data allocated via scratch card will remain unconsumed until the conclusion of the promotion.
The validity period of a pre-paid card will begin at the initial registration for the SLT pre-paid Wi-Fi service.
In the recent months, following SLT’s ‘Sunday Funday” promotions, which offered free post-paid public Wi-Fi access, the popularity of the brand’s Wi-Fi hotspots have increased tremendously.
Such initiatives serve as a means of emphasizing SLT’s position as the provider of the highest data volume, fastest Internet and best value for money. The SLT pre-paid Wi-Fi promotion offers mobility to the brand’s home and office broadband customers, and also encourages non-SLT internet users to acquire a SLT prepaid Wi-Fi facility to enjoy the very best experience.
