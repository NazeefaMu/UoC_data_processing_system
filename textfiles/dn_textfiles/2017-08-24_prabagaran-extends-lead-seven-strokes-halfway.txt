Prabagaran extends lead to seven strokes at halfway

Sri Lanka Open Golf 2017:
K. Prabagaran the overnight leader by 4 strokes, extended his lead in the Sri Lanka Open 2017, to 7 strokes with an even Par 71, second round in the Sri Lanka Open Golf Championship continued at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club yesterday. On a perfect day for Golf, the weather was bright and sunny but there were no scores under Par.
Prabagaran, Mithun Perera , B A Sanjeewa and N. Thangaraja returned even Par 2nd round scores which described the difficulty in scoring on a day with great playing conditions. Players commenting affirmed the extremely tough pin placements contributed to the degree of difficulty in breaking Par. Nonetheless, B A Sanjeewa did the impossible by holing-out in ‘ONE’ in the Par 3, 15th hole.
