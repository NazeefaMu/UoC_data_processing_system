29th L. E. Blaze Trophy today :Wesley firm favourites against dejected Kingswood

 
Wesley College and Kingswood College Kandy are yet again set to battle it out for their power in rugby when they play their annual inter-school encounter for the coveted L.E. Blaze trophy on Saturday 14 May, at the Royal Sports Complex. Kick off will be at 4.30pm.
In honour of this great gentleman Blaze, brother schools Kingwood and Wesley set out to play an annual encounter of rugby which consists of two legs each hosted by the schools in Kandy and Colombo.
The first L.E. Blaze Trophy game was played on 17 July 1986. The game was won by Kingswood that year. Kingswood was captained by Ronnie Ibrahim and Wesley by Sumedha Kuruppu. In the history of the L.E. Blaze Trophy out of 28 encounters, Kingswood has won 20 and Wesley has won five while three games have ended in draws.
This year, Wesley is captained fourth year coloursman, prop forward Zayan Sabar and coached by former Thomian Jeewan Goonethilaka. Wesley commands the No. 4 position in the Singer Schools rugby league 2016, Division 1 Group ‘A ‘points table so far having registered victories against St. Joseph’s College and D.S. Senanayaka College respectively.
Kingswood is captained by third year coloursman centre three quarter Sachintha Udagalahitiyawa and coached by newly appointed ex-Kingswood old boy Mothilal Jayathilake.
So far Kingswood has failed to win a single game thus losing to all the schools they have confronted and hence currently occupy the last slot at number six position in the Singer Schools rugby league 2016 Division 1 group ‘B’ points table.
The game is tipped to be an exciting 80 minutes display of rugby, with both schools playing for glory in this annual encounter.
