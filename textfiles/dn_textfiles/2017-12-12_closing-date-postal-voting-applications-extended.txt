Closing date for postal voting applications extended

The closing date for postal voting applications for all 341 Local Government bodies has been extended until December 22, 2017, Additional Election Commissioner M.M. Mohammad yesterday said.
He was speaking at a media briefing at the Police Headquarters last evening. The applications for postal votes for 93 LG bodies were called on November 28, 2017. Applications for the rest of the LG bodies were called for on December 4, 2017.
Since there would be two deadlines for receiving postal vote applications, Mohammad said that a discussion was held to decide on a single date to conclude receiving applications.
