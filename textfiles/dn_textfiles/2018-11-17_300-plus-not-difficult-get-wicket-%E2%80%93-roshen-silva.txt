300 plus is not difficult to get on this wicket – Roshen Silva

PALLEKELE, Friday – Sri Lanka’s first innings top scorer Roshen Silva said that chasing a target of 300 plus on the Pallekele International Stadium pitch was not impossible at the end of the third day of the second Test against England yesterday.
“I think they've got a good score on the board and it's not impossible to get 300 plus. So we have to claim another wicket in the morning first,” said Silva who made a composed 85 on the second day to give Sri Lanka an important 46-run lead on the first innings.
England in their second innings finished day three on 324-9 to lead overall by 278 with one wicket in hand.
Assessing the pitch Silva said, “Actually, this is not the wicket we expected. We thought it would spin more. However, according to the way the batters batted yesterday and today and also considering the way we bowled, I don’t think there was a big change during yesterday and today. Despite the fact that they scored over 300 runs, I don’t think our three bowlers bowled that badly.
“England batted well and we also bowled well too. I really don’t know what will happen tomorrow. It may remain the same or may take a little more turn. There was an odd ball turning too much but basically, there was no such magical turn in the wicket.
It may be easy to play when the ball gets older. I will not say it’s going to be easy. But cricket is such an indefinite game.
We may get this total but it's not easy because, their three spinners are really good,” said Silva.
Assessing the day’s play Silva said, “Yes we had 46 runs lead but if you look at in the morning and the way Rory (Burns) and (Keaton) Jennings batted, they batted really well.
I think we didn't bowl badly on that wicket, but they played some good sweeps and reverse sweeps. Because of that, they got a lot of runs. England is one of the best teams that normally plays sweeps and reverse sweeps. They are really good in that.”
Silva said that Joe Root the England captain who scored a century played positively and it paid off.
“As soon as he came, he realized the situation and he took some risks and it paid off. It’s risky to play those shots and you need courage to play them. It's a brilliant knock.”
Commenting on the five-run penalty which England were awarded, Silva said, “I was just standing near the crease thinking it was a boundary.
When Moeen (Ali) threw the ball in, all of a sudden Akila said Bunty Aiya run, run.
I wasn't sure whether I had creased or not but I ran.
Then the umpires came to me and said I had not creased. I apologized for my forgetfulness.
However, the umpire had a chat with the other umpire and explained to me about the law, despite the fact that I didn't do it deliberately. I was shocked when he awarded the penalty runs.”
