‘Implementation of RTI Act successful’

The Right to Information Act is being successfully implemented and 80 percent of information officers were appointed to state institutions, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said.
He said the appointments had been delayed in certain ministries and departments due to the complex nature of those institutions. But, according to the terms of the RTI Act, the Head of an institution automatically becomes the information officer where such an appointment had not been made. Therefore, delay in providing information would never occur.
Steps had also been taken to train all information officers this year, the Deputy Minister said that they would be able to implement 100 percent of the RTI Act soon.
Paranavithana said the Mass Media Ministry was performing a colossal amount of work to implement the RTI Act and the Information Commission was established as an independent commission.
This would ensure open governance where government activities would be carried out in a responsible and transparent manner. The RTI Act tied down state institutions with a legal responsibility and a new work culture was required for its proper implementation.
He said the RTI Act No. 12 of 2016 approved by Parliament on August 4, 2016 is in operation with effect from February 3, 2017 and in terms of it, people can seek any information dating back to 10 years from any state institutions.
