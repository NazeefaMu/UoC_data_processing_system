Poor show from govt institutions at LBO/LBR Brand Summits

Though ‘free attendance invitations’ were offered to several public sector organisations to attend Lanka Business Online (LBO) infrastructure and digital summits, only a handful of state institutions responded, Lanka Business Online (LBO) Summit Curator Founder and Director Lakshman Bandaranayake said.
Speaking at the fifth LBO/LBR Brand Summit announcement launch press conference he said the Urban Development Authority, Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Tourism and Ports Authority responded and gained knowledge from the summit.
He said health, education and transport sectors could gain valuable knowledge from these seminars but these opportunities offered free to them are not being used. He said that though Sri Lanka is fast moving in digital adaptation, government institutions have not geared up to meet the people’s demands.
He said there are over 2.6 million mobile SIM cards and over 35% of the population use internet. In a addition there are over 450,000 Facebook uses and 40% of the population has smart phones.
He also said though banks and travel and air service companies use this to their advantage, even the FMCG sector is backwards
into moving in this area. He said that even in companies, employees are reluctant to move to the digital era. “May be the older work force due to retire soon don’t want to move into the digital era as they don’t want to take risks and unnecessary education (which they think).” Bandaranayake also added that it is the younger work force that are tech savvy and the older work force doesn’t want to learn from them and don’t respect their changes. “However this is an unfortunate situation.”
He also cautioned that not adapting to digitalisation may even result in the closure of companies (specially family owned) which is happening all over the world.
Lanka Business Online, LBO, will be hosting their fifth consecutive annual edition of LBR LBO Brand Summit on Wednesday the May 3, at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand Hotel. “LBO has earned a fine reputation as Sri Lanka’s foremost conference host on technology, marketing, management, infrastructure and economy. LBR LBO Brand Summit, over a period of five years, has now become the most sought after thought leadership engagement on transforming marketing through technology and analytics.
“The LBR LBO Brand Summit provides a forum for corporate executives from all branches of industry, business and academia to gain insights to how digital could be leveraged to redefine, re-imagine, and reinvent the relationship between brands and consumers.” said Bandaranayake.
