Marathon man  Cooray undecided  about future

 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Former South Asian Games gold medallist Anuradha Indrajith Cooray said he will take a final decision about his athletic career after discussing the matter with the Sports Minister and sports officials, including those in the National Olympic Committee.
Speaking to media before his departure from the Olympic city, the 38-year-old veteran long distance runner said he is still undecided on his future. “There is no age barrier for long distance running and there are several good marathon runners who are older than me and doing well. It’s a matter of stamina, staying power and endurance you develop over a period of time,” he said.
“Once I go back to Sri Lanka, I want to discuss about my sports future with the Sports Minister, Olympic and other athletic officials. If they support me further to sustain in the sport and contribute to Sri Lanka sport, I am willing to do that,” he said.
Cooray feels that there is some more athletics left in him and is keen to contribute for Sri Lanka sport until the country finds “somebody better” than him. “I am not going to hang on to this place if there is somebody who could run at least closer to my timings. I will retire immediately if there is somebody who could run a marathon under two hours and 20 minutes,” he said he would give all support and encouragement to any of up and coming marathon runner from Sri Lanka.
The London-based long distance expert said he is even winning to lend a helping hand to any Lankan marathon runner who is capable of achieving a better timing than him. “As I said, I will not only encourage any emerging marathon runner from my country who could do a 2:20 but would also use my contacts to find a training opportunity in Kenya,” he said.
Cooray who has been a frequent visitor to Kenya to train alongside some of the top long distance runners in the world, produced by the African nation, said he was happy with his performance at the 2016 Olympic marathon yesterday. Cooray clocked two hours, 17 minutes and six seconds to finish 34th out of 155 competitors.
“It was not easy, running a marathon against the cream of world class marathon runners in the world. Most of them had full scholarships and sponsorships. In contrast, I only had the normal monthly allowance paid by the ports Ministry to Olympic athletes, that too during the last few months. I also had a short training opportunity in Kenya prior to the last South Asian Games. I am not trying to put the blame on anyone, but just explaining my plight,” he added.
“It is a struggle when I have to work for my living and to find time for athletic training. If the Sports Ministry could grant me a better allowance, I could reduce some of my overtime work in the job and use that precious time to train a longer duration,” he explained.
“I feel that I have something more to offer for Sri Lanka. If I gain support from the authorities, I will continue to run until the next Asian Games. Then I would make my own evaluation. If I find there is nobody close to my timings even then, I would continue to work harder and qualify for the next Olympics as well,” said Cooray, who has now taken part in three Olympic Games – Athens 2004, London 2012 and Rio 2016.
Cooray was not among the first 65 runners in Rio 2016 marathon until he reached the first 15km but since then, gradually accelerated to advance. The most notable advancement made by Cooray in the whole race was between the 35 to 40km marks. By the 40km mark, he stormed into the 36th place in 2:09.50. “I holding on to the batch with Canadian runners and that made my task easier. Overall, I am happy with my performance in Rio Olympics,” he concluded.
