Man takes own life after strangling daughter

The body of a man who had disappeared from his home in Eriyagama Tambuttegama after throttling his 12-year-old daughter from the first marriage and thrown her into a forest leaving her for die, was found below the flight of steps leading up to the Wessagiri cave in the Anuradhapura Sacred City.
The body was found by Anuradhapura Police Emergency Response Unit in the wee hours of yesterday. The suspect had been absconding for five days fearing arrest for the ill treatment caused to his 12-year-daughter from the first marriage.
A letter written to his second wife admitting that he committed suicide by drinking poison was also found near the body by police.
Police said investigations revealed that the man had taken the daughter along with him to the Maradagala teak forest to tether his cattle for grazing. Inside the forest, he had squeezed the girl’s neck until she fell unconscious and left thinking she had died.
The girl had regained consciousness later and shouted in pain when villagers rushed to the aid and hospitalised her.
The man’s second wife arrived at the spot and identified the body as that of her husband. The post mortem was due to be held at the Anuradhapura Hospital.
