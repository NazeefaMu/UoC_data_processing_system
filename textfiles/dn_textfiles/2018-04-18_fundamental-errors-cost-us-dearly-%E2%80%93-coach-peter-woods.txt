Sri Lanka 7’s rugby perform disastrously at Gold Coast
Fundamental  errors cost us  dearly – coach  Peter Woods

Angry, disappointed, dejected, furious are just some of the words one can use to describe the performance of the Sri Lanka Sevens rugby team at the XXIst Commonwealth Games concluded at Gold Coast, Australia.
Sri Lanka made an early exit from the Games suffering three consecutive defeats. They were routed by the Fijians 63/5 in the opening match, thrashed 42/12 by Wales in the second game and finally humiliated 33/12 by Uganda in the final match.
Prior to the departure of the team some Sri Lankan rugby pundits talked big about how their side had prepared for the Games to gain glory for the country but in the end they could not win a single match and were placed a miserable 15th out of 16 teams in the competition.
Sri Lanka should thank the minnows of rugby Zambia for taking part for if not for them they would have ended up 16th and last.
The Commonwealth Games rugby debacle comes on the heels of the consecutive defeats the Sevens team suffered in the Borneo seven’s last month.
Sri Lanka head coach New Zealander Peter Woods speaking to the media after Sri Lanka’s poor performance said “Our guys are slipping tackles one on one, if we are going to do that against world class teams then they will punish you. Pace and size of our players is a huge difference. But it’s very frustrating to see them missing one on one tackles and basic tackles which we should have made.
“No excuses for missing one on one tackles, especially in contact sports like rugby it’s very disappointing. Mainly against Uganda we lost because of fundamental errors. Where we need to perform better is we need to play more tournaments. We need to get a simple structure that we can develop more players and need to move forward. It’s only simple steps. The gaps between the other international teams are huge. You can see with the results of other teams like Uganda and Papua New Guinea who played well with top teams. We first started playing only from March 1 this year whereas teams like Uganda have been playing tournaments from last November. We must keep improving on conditioning as well as work on basic skills and fundamentals of the game. We definitely have to work on basics to get better,” Woods said.
“I thought Sri Lanka played well against Fiji and Wales considering they are two of the top 10 teams in the world; especially Fiji being the No.1 rugby team in the world. They also had five guys over 6’3,” said Sri Lanka Rugby CEO Priyantha Ekanayake.
“However, I must say that I was a bit disappointed with our performance against Uganda. We did not really expect to win but we always felt that if we kept the scores close, anything could have happened in the last minute. Having said that if you look at Uganda, they had just played in the recently concluded Hong Kong 7’s and participated in many 7’s tournaments.
“If you look back 10 years ago, we beat countries like Kenya and USA but now for us to beat a top team is just a dream. Most of the countries including the Asian countries are spending lots of money on the 7’s and they have separate squads only for 7’s. They are also playing tournaments right throughout the year. In our case we only get the players after the 15’s and therefore to condition the players and get them accustomed to play 7’s is a bit of a challenge,” he said.
“We need to give 7’s more prominence like the 15’s and have at least 6-7 local tournaments. We also need to give more exposure to our national teams if we are to beat top level sides. It is also important that we have Junior National squads U16, U18 and U20. This is something that we are looking at now,” Ekanayake said.
