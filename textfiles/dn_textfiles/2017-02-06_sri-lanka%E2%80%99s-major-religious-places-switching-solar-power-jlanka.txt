Sri Lanka’s major religious places switching to Solar  Power with JLanka

Sri Lankan can gain huge benefits from switching to Solar Power. But although being a tropical country’s that has a sunny weather throughout over a half year annually only a less than 0.5% all households in the country had adopted Solar Power to their day to day electricity generation that is being consumed.
Whilst the government has also stepped in to promote Solar Power as a renewable energy source that helps creating a sustainable and greener environment country’s leading Solar Power solutions provider JLanka has taken an initiative to install Solar Photovoltaic systems in country’s major religious places of worship and religious institutions.
Accordingly five major scared sites of historic and sacred Atamasthana in Anuradhapura including Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ruwanweli Seya. Thuparamaya, Abhayagiriya, Jetavanaramaya, Mirisavetiya, Lankaramaya and the Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, Malwathu Maha Viharaya, Asgiri Temple, Thanthririmale Rajamaha Viharaya, Somawathi Rajamaha VIharaya, Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya will be Solar Powered under the project. Further Archdiocese of Colombo, Muslim Mosque in Galle, Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya, Nallur Kandaswamy Temple Jaffna, Koneswarama Temple are also included to per powered with Solar Photovoltaic systems under the project.
On the other hand, Solar Power engineers highlight that Churches are ideal places for Solar panels. In a benefit, unforeseen by medieval architects, the traditional east-west structure, with the altar at the east end of the nave, calls for a long, south-facing roof with a pitch that perfectly captures sunlight.
JLanka Technologies, this initiative will help the religious places and temples at large to bring down their energy and utility bills while contributing to a more greener and a sustainable environment which will also indirectly motivate the devotees to switch to renewable energy. Experts outline that over the past six years, the cost of solar energy has dropped dramatically, to the point where it is now even cheaper than wind power in emerging markets like in Sri Lanka, China and India.
This may be largely due to rising investments in solar over the last few years. This is great news for developing nations like Sri Lanka, which do not generally have the kind of infrastructure that developed countries have dedicated to fossil fuels already in place.
