Wanted: The Real You

It was going to be the biggest presentation of my life — my first appearance at the SAARC writer's summit held in Delhi early this year — and I had already thrown out seven drafts. Searching for a new direction, I asked my friends for suggestions. “The most important thing,” the first one said, “is to be yourself.” The next six people I asked gave me the same tip.
Prince charming
I wasn't surprised. “Be Yourself” is a slogan that screams at us on the covers of self-help books and Facebook wall posts. It is one of the most common themes (behind “Expand your horizons,” and just ahead of “Never give up”) in university convocation speeches. It's the one secret guaranteed to bring us success in life, love, and career. “I certainly had no idea that being your authentic self could get you as rich as I have become,” Oprah Winfrey said a few years ago. ” If I’d known that, I’d have tried it a lot earlier.”
Easier said than done. How can you find your authentic self? Especially when the real you is the person you are when nobody is watching. But when other people enter the picture, things change. It’s how a rough-around-the-edges guy becomes prince charming to get a girl. It’s how a shy student with no prior interest in sports starts playing cricket to fit in. It’s how a fun loving person acts serious around serious people so as not to offend anyone or get embarrassed.
It’s why some people like to keep friend groups separate because they use a different identity with each group.
There are benefits to altering yourself of course,(such as fitting in nearly anywhere), but the consequence is that every time you do it, the real you is hidden, and with enough repetition, you can lose yourself in a pile of masks. It will never feel quite right either, because the real you is the only version that feels completely natural.
So, what does it mean to be real? Being yourself or being authentic means erasing the gap between what you firmly believe inside and what you reveal to the outside world. As Brene Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston, defines it, authenticity is “the choice to let our true selves be seen.”
To be yourself, say the experts, don’t worry about yourself. It’s only when you analyze how you come across to others and what others are thinking about you that behavior modification seems appealing.
Habitual masks
When you look at others with yourself in mind, it’s like using them as a mirror – you try to see yourself through their eyes and adjust the image accordingly.
The best thing to do then is to drop the masks we wear when we are around people. Merry Lin, the author of the Fully Lived Life says dropping the habitual masks she puts on to please and impress others was pivotal to transforming and healing her life. “Faking your way through life is believing that if you let people know the real you, they won't like you,” writes Lin. “Maybe it seems that nothing you ever do is ever enough. The tapes that play in your head say that if people really knew what was going on inside you, they would lose respect for you.
Maybe you keep trying to pretend to make others happy, and you are exhausted, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I would never discover my true identity ... unless I began identifying and laying down my masks, and so I began a process of stripping down the defenses I had built up over the years."
Obviously, there are times when it is adaptive to protect your true self or your thoughts and feelings. Some people and situations are unsafe and it is wise to hold back.
That said, if you identify yourself as frequently donning masks in "unsafe" situations (where you fear criticism, belittling, anger, etc.), it may be worth looking at how to reduce your exposure to these people and/or situations.
According to Susan Biali, in 'Psychology Today', as you become more aware of the circumstances in which you don a certain mask, don't be frustrated if you can't change your behavior right away.
You have likely been doing this for years, perhaps even your entire life. Be patient and gentle with yourself. The first step in change is simply to watch out for and notice when you engage in a behavior that you want to change.
Negative result
Notice what event or person triggered the donning of a mask. How did it feel when you were wearing it? How did you feel afterwards? Did it achieve anything? Was there a negative result? What would you like to do differently the next time you're in that situation, in order to be more authentic?
Awareness is everything, says Biali. “Don't put pressure on yourself to change overnight, and be compassionate with yourself.
Trust that if you set the goal of being more real, via the dropping of your habitual masks, you will be able to do this with time. And it will feel so good!”
Too short? Too weird? Too quiet? Not true. There is only one word that can really define you – the real you. You are awesome! If you don't trust me, trust Mark Twain. As Twain said, you simply have to be yourself because everyone else is taken.
