Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office opens in Hambantota

Sri Lanka and China have jointly launched the “Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office” in the Port of Hambantota.
The office will overlook the operation of the 50-square-km Industrial Zone officially established in January and serve as a workplace for the Sri Lankan and Chinese staff, Xinhua news agency reported.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the launch ceremony on Saturday that the office was an important milestone in the strong ties between both sides. The Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone will transform Sri Lanka into an important trading and logistics hub and attract massive investments to the Hambantota area, he added.
“This is the beginning of a new chapter in the Indian Ocean and I believe Sri Lanka will also become a transitional point for China soon,” Wickremesinghe said.
PM also said that discussions are underway for the setting up of an oil refinery and LNG power plant.
“Other resources, such as steel, cement and rocks are necessary. But these won’t stop here. This includes the trade zones spanning throughout Hambantota and Moneragala. We further expect to install housing, hospital and education facilities for the people in the trade zones,” he said.
This zone will not be limited to Sri Lankan and Chinese factories but will be open to other countries for them to come and invest and install their factories here. All these efforts will be streamlined from this office.
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, said the opening of the office was an important step as many enterprises from China and other countries had expressed interest in investing in the zone.
Last July Sri Lanka signed a US $1.1 billion deal to lease out a 70 per cent stake of the strategic Hambantota port to China, amid concerns over the massive debt the island nation incurred in building the port.
Cash-rich China has invested millions of dollars in Sri Lanka’s infrastructure since the end of a brutal civil war in 2009. As part of the deal, the stake in the loss-making port has been sold to China’s state-run conglomerate China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort). (yahoo News.)
