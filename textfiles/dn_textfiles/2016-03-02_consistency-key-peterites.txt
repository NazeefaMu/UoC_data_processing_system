Consistency is the key for Peterites

St.Peter's College Colombo which started playing cricket in the early 1930s has not only produced several outstanding cricketers but also been a major force in the school cricket scene during the last four decades.
They will be vying for major honours against their arch rivals St.Joseph's College in their 82nd 'Battle of the Saints' encounter which will take place at the P.Sara Oval on Friday and Saturday. The encounter is played for the Rev.Fr. Maurice Le Goc Challenge Trophy.
The Bambalapitiya school has not only produced several champion teams, but also several outstanding cricketers who have represented Sri Lanka with distinction. Clive Inman who holds the individual batting record in the Joe-Pete series with 204 not out in 1954 went onto play county cricket for Leicestershire and for Sri Lanka, wicket-keeper H.I.K. Fernando who represented the national team for several years was once rated as the best wicket- keeper in Asia.
David Heyn who was one of the best cover point fielders also played for Sri Lanka. He is best remembered for the two fine innings against India in an unofficial test in 1975 when he made 105 and 84. He also made a fighting knock of 69 for Sri Lanka in the unofficial test against Garry Sobers’ West Indies team in 1967. Paceman Tony Opatha, also represented the national team for several years and was instrumental in skittling out the formidable West Indies team for a mere 101 runs at the P Sara Oval in 1975 when he captured four wickets along with D.S.de Silva who also took four wickets.
There was that stylish batsman Roy Dias, who scored a brilliant 77 in the second innings of the inaugural Test against England at the P Sara Oval in 1982. Dias also made a match saving century in the third test against India at Asgiriya in 1985 which helped Sri Lanka to force a draw. Opening batsman and wicket keeper Amal Silva made 102 not out in the second innings of the Lord's Test against England in 1984.
The two pacemen Rumesh Ratnayake and Vinodhan John represented the country in Test cricket in the 1980s. Ratnayake had a remarkable season in 1980-81 for St. Peter's when he captured 111 wickets. Incidentally Ratnayake was the national coach of the Sri Lanka team a few years ago.
In recent years Russell Arnold and Malintha Warnapura played Test cricket for his country. Arnold who scored a superb century in the Asian Test Championship against Pakistan in 1999 is a leading international commentator today.
In 2012, the Peterites emerged victorious in the "Battle of the Saints" against St. Joseph's under the leadership of Shehan Fernando with left-arm leg-spinner Julian de Zilva being the hero with a match bag of 10 wickets for 86 runs. He had an excellent season last year in which he bagged 90 wickets.
This year the Peterites are led by experienced player Vinu Mohotty who is a source of inspiration to his teammates. In the current season, SPC has recorded six outright victories against De Mazenod, President's Kotte, Prince of Wales, DSS, St.Benedict's and Gurukula MV Kelaniya.
Looking at their performances, the Peterites can be satisfied with their consistency. Their batting line-up is powered by four centurions. Lakshina Rodrigo who has scored over 1000 runs has played a key role in Peterites success while Hashan Wanasekara who has scored more than 800 runs including two centuries will be an essential batsman in their batting lineup.
The other key batsmen for St.Peter's are Ranmith Jayasena who scored 650 runs and Santhush Gunatilleke. Manelker de Silva, captain Vinu Mohotty, Inesh Fernando and Anishka Fernando will be the others of whom much is expected.
The Peterites have a strong bowling attack headed by Taneesha Weerakoon who has captured 80 wickets and skipper Mohotty who has claimed over 70 victims.
Sadish Pathiranage, Dinal Jayakody, Ravindu de Silva and Manelker de Silva will lend the support to curtail the Josephian batting line up.
