Daya Sahabandu

I bumped into Daya Sahabandu at the Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters at Maitland Place, and when I requested from him for an interview he casually mentioned that I interviewed only the Anandians and Nalandians, therefore just to put the record straight I have asked a few Royalists and one Thomian ex-cricketer for interviews earlier and the reply I got was not favourable, under such circumstances my interest in approaching them were nipped in the bud, However when I met Daya I found him to be a down to earth guy and was he a Royalist with a difference?
Daya mentioned that he was not comfortable with the SSC set up who literally cold shouldered him and he went on and stated that on an occasion when Stanley Jayasinghe visited the SSC he wondered why Daya was not playing for Ceylon leave alone Sara Trophy.
Daya said that he went to Royal College from his younger days. I found him to be a humble human being who was not willing to go against the grain when dodgy questions confronted him. It is the author’s view that his humbleness did not go down well with the pompous crowd at the SSC. Fortunately for our budding cricketers, cricket had spread its tentacles far and wide which
enabled the outstation cricketers to be welcomed by the elitists clubs like the SSC and one would have to thank Minister Arjuna Ranatunga for breaking the shackles.
Daya showed his bowling talents in no uncertain terms. He played under four captains for Royal, they were Michael Wille, E.L. Pereira, Sarath Samarasinghe and Michael Dias. Daya of course was not a Colin Bland or a Jonty Rhodes and as a result Wille did not have a high regard of him and he was deprived of his colours that year lamented Daya. Out of the lot Sarath Samrasinghe was the most successful and Daya noted that this was not because of Samarasinghe’s capabilities as a captain but because that team was studded with coloursmen.
He played for Royal with distinction from 1956-60 and during a practice session before the big match in 1956 Gamini Goonesena saw Daya bowl a couple of balls and said that he would play for Ceylon one day. He played three seasons at the SSC after school but was never given the opportunity to play Sara cricket.
Daya was more at home when he joined Nomads in 1963. He was more at ease with the set up there and under the able guidance of D.H. de Silva he blossomed into brilliant left arm bowler.
Daya mentioned that he played under 3 captains namely D.H. who also was his boss at the Municipality, Michael Tissera and Dhanasiri Weerasinghe. D.H. was a fatherly figure to him and a good shrewd captain. Tissera was a brilliant tactician he noted and he would set Daya’s field and instructed him just to bowl middle and leg or middle and off as the case maybe.
Dhanasiri was the more attacking of the lot and Daya stated that although he was the captain he was at ‘machang’ level with him and used to tell Daya “dapang eyage meda pollata”. I read between the lines and realized what Daya intended to say and at times a bowler is relaxed when the skipper cracks a joke.
Daya recollects how he went by bus no. 154 from Wellawatte to Borella and had to walk all the way to Wanathamulla Oval to participate in his very first international match and to make matters worse he had to carry his kit as well.
Reports stated that one young cricketer took a moon light walk and lost his way and appeared in the wee hours of the morning and another brimming with talent has broken the curfew and gone night clubbing and was severely punished.
In this day and age when dog eats dog I found Daya Sahabandu to be a modest cricketer who had no false airs about him. It must be mentioned that Daya has a son named Janaka Sahabandu also a Royalist who is a banker at Hatton National Bank Ratnapura and his dear wife Swarna Sahabandu who has been a tower of strength to them.
