The LCI subsidiaries include several local manufacturing organizations with international reputation for quality exports. The company continues the manufacturing customized products for global giants.
The financial year 2016/17 also reaped the benefits of the major transformation project which included re-structuring and re-strategizing of the group to be a medium sized, diversified conglomerate. The change of ownership and guidance from two corporate giants – Galle Face Hotel Group and Haidramani Group together with Entrepreneur/Investor Ajith Devasurendra along with the appointment of top corporate personality and renowned industry veteran Murali Prakash as the Group’s Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer proved to be the right formula resulting in this exceptional outcome.
During the current year (2017/2018), the group is keen on continuing this positive trend and achieving exponential growth. Plans are underway to further revamp and re-strategize with a future oriented growth strategy with the objective of building and nurturing a profitable and sustainable diversified conglomerate that gives the shareholders a positive return on their investment.
