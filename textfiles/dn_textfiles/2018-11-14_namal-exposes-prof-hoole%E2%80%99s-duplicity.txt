Namal exposes Prof. Hoole’s duplicity

Former MP and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Founding Member Namal Rajapaksa yesterday, questioned Election Commissioner Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole’s action of petitioning the Supreme Court to hinder the passage for a general election.
Prof. Hoole petitioned the Supreme Court against President Maithripala Sirisena’s action of dissolving Parliament to allow people to elect a new Parliament that resonates with their aspirations.
“The Election Commission’s job is to ensure holding election not to prevent it,” the former MP said in his Twittter account.
“Where was that election commission member when the previous Government postponed elections multiple times? Why did not he go to the Supreme Court then? Now, when an election is called he works towards eliminating it,” Rajapaksa said.
