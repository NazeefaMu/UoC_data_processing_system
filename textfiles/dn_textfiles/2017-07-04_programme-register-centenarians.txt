Programme to register centenarians

The National Secretariat for Elders has launched a programme to register persons aged 100 years and over.
The Secretariat is also gathering information about elders over 75 years with 15 or more children.
The Secretariat’s Director, Suwinda Singappuli, said they are gathering information about them to honor them at the upcoming National Elders’ Day.
“We request the public to provide information about elders aged 100 years or above, and elders aged 75 and over who have 15 or more children, to the Divisional Secretariat,” he said.
The Secretariat will celebrate National Elders’ Day on August 1 at the Water’s Edge Hotel in Battaramulla, Colombo, with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena and Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayaka. The elders will be taken to the celebration at Water’s Edge in a vehicle parade from Galle Face Green, Colombo.
He said the National Elders’ Secretariat paid tribute to 150 elders of over 100 years, and 50 elders with over 15 children last year.
