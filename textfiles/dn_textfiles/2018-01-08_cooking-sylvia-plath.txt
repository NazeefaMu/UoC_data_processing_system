Cooking with Sylvia Plath

In Valerie Stivers’s Eat Your Words series, she cooks up recipes drawn from the works of various writers.
In her diaries, Sylvia Plath (1932–1963) liked to boast about her “damn good” lemon-meringue pie, which she was able to produce even under difficult conditions. She once wrote that she “cooled lemon custard and crust on cold bathroom windowsill,” presumably due to lack of refrigeration at a rental apartment at Smith College. Pie-making enthusiasts will know that keeping the dough cold, cold, cold is the trick, and also that the fridge is pretty essential for setting a lemon curd. They will marvel, as I do, at Plath’s excellent domestic skills.
Plath was committed to perfection both as a writer and as a woman of the 1950s, a work-life dilemma that still resonates with women today. In her stories, she tends to distill the nightmarish aspects of the feminine. In “Mothers,” for example, Esther, a character trying to fit into small-town life, cooks a giant rutabaga, which looked “storybook” at the market but “after two minutes in the pressure cooker … shrank to a wan, orange mash that blacked the bottom and sides of the pot with a slick, evil-smelling liquor.” Later, Esther dines at a buffet containing “a startling number of cakes, all painstakingly decorated, some with cherries and nuts and some with sugar lace.” There’s a sense of time wasted, of an intelligent person confronted with the absurd that I, who once set off for my Manhattan office job still wearing my apron, recognize myself in.
In Plath’s diaries, however, the quotidian is mostly a source of joy. She loved to eat and cooked maniacally for dinner parties. In The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath, she calls the author of the cookbook The Joy of Cooking, “my blessed Rombauer,” and reads the book “like a rare novel,” full of “delectable recipes … with all the right touches of seasoning.” She laments that instead of “studying Locke, for instance, or writing – – – I go make an apple pie.” But the pie makes her happy.
I made a breakfast mentioned in her journals of sautéed cabbage on toast with bacon and potatoes, based on a technique found in the cabbage section of The Joy of Cooking. That “right touch” of seasoning is paprika. Though Plath loved coffee (“we sipped scalding coffee, felt gray and diffuse as the wet weather”), I paired the toast with her husband’s preferred morning drink of “brandy milk.” Then, influenced by the scene in the movie Sylvia where Gwyneth Paltrow bakes all the cakes—itself based on a story idea noted in Plath’s diary —I tried to produce “a startling number” of desserts. I did Plath’s lemon-meringue pie and then, through a tantalizing mention of an “angel topping” in her diaries, made two more curds, of lime and orange, and two curd pies with “angel” crusts. I also made a loaf cake with a fancy decoration of nuts and cherries.
Plath committed suicide in her kitchen in 1963, at the age of thirty, carefully taping off the room her children slept in before turning the gas on and putting her head in the oven. Her diaries are full of the fight between her “good self, that loves skies, hills, ideas, tasty meals, bright colors” and the “demon [that] would murder this self.” Yet as bad as it got, she always felt that “dusting, washing daily dishes, talking to people who are not mad … helps.”
