Sri Lanka Cricket has hired the services of Peter Sleep and Timothy McCaskill to work with the Sri Lanka cricketers to enhance their skill levels.
The duo will start working with the preliminary squad, who will undergo training in Pallekele for a two-week period in view of the upcoming West Indies tour.
Sleep, the former Australian leg-spinner will work with the spinners, while Cricket Victoria’s High Performance Manager McCaskill will work with the squad’s fast bowling unit.
Both were hired as short-term consultants, under the recommendation of Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha. Sleep will work with the squad for 15 days, while McCaskill will work for 10 days.
McCaskill is hired primarily for his expertise in working with international bowlers in remodeling their actions after major injuries.
