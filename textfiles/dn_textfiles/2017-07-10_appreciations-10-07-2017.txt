[APPRECIATIONS - (10-07-2017)]

Chandralekha Mendis
She was a sincere mother
It’s three months since you passed away suddenly left us in sorrow. You were sincere, generous and compassionate and you never complained about anything.
You were concerned about others, especially your sisters and their children. It was wonderful to know that you had given up all your worldly possessions such as jewellery and all other items of value.
As a teacher, your commitment towards your students was exemplary. In your silent and humble way, you were so dedicated towards their education and helped them in many ways. You never forgot to wish your friends and relations on their birthdays.
Though you were bedridden and found it difficult to talk, your mind remained razor sharp and you could recall any incident with accuracy. Though born and bred to a Buddhist family, you never forgot to attend church on a special day, such as on Christmas and listen to Christmas carols. You observed sil every poya day until it was difficult to walk about.
You have completed your race on earth and you have fulfilled your obligations. So thank you, our elder sister, for all that you have done for us.
We take comfort in Rabindranath’s Tagore’s words, “Death is not extinguishing the light. It is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.”
Your sisters, friends and family members.

He led an orthodox life
Norman Edward Abeysirigunawardena was my one and only brother. He hailed from Agaliya blossoming village in the outskirts of famous Baddegama township which was historically-earned name as the place which held the Baddegama Vaadaya debate, that aroused the Western world.
My brother was a proprietary planter who lead an orthodox life. He was married to P.D. Some from Ratnapura. They were childless. At Agaliya village, he was held in high-esteem by the villagers of Agaliya and surrounding villages. People addressed him as ‘Golugewatte podi mahattaya.’
He passed away from a sudden, complicated illness on July 21, 2016, in a matter of few seconds, leaving sad memories in the minds of relations and friends. He was 80 years old at the time of his death.
He was educated at Christ Church Boys’ English College, Baddegama and Prince College, Galle.
He was the younger son of proprietary planter, late Robert Dias Abeysirigunewardena and late Ellen Caroline Dissanayake, both of Agaliya village.
He leaves me, his elder brother and a sister, Punya and a host of very close relations.
My brother looked a dab hand in his prime.
May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!

K. Joseph Mervyn Perera
He was a loving father to his children
It is with profound sorrow that I write these few words of appreciation on my father Kurukulasooriya Joseph Mervyn Perera, who passed away 30 years ago on April 24, 1987.
He was born on April 19, 1931 and hailed from a very respectable Catholic family in Moratuwa.
His sudden heart-attack at a comparative young age of 56 was a blow to all of us.
He was the eldest in a family of three children. My father, who had his education at St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, qualified in the senior school certificate examination (English) in 1948 with good results. My father attended St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, from 1937 – 1948. After his school career, he joined the Colombo Port Commission as a clerk in 1950 and became the time-keeping officer in the PHI division in 1970.
He was the senior TKC at the time of his death in 1987 and completed 36 years of service at this institution, which he considered to be his second home.
He married my mother Rita on January 15, 1959. They lived an exemplary and happy wedded life. My mother was always behind my father and looked after him well until his end.
He was a loving father to me and my three brothers late Ranjan, late Andrew and Sharmal, and only sister Anne and also our spouses.
My father was also a great lover of music and every evening he played the mouth organ and enjoyed singing his favourite songs. Music also his life and forte. My father was kind to all, hated none and was like a little child even in his old age.
He had great faith in God with whose blessing he led a happy life until his end. He attended to his own matters up to his last day and we can only be happy that his end was peaceful.
He celebrated is 56th birthday on April 19, 1987 and just five days later, said good bye to all of us to be with the Lord.
My father’s passing away 30 years ago was so sudden and unexpected and saddened our hearts. But we rejoice as we are certain that he is with Our Lord Almighty. Even though he is no more, he will always remain in our hearts forever. I thank Jesus for giving us such a kind and loving father like him.
I thank him for all what he had done for the five of us and for our families.
May the soul of my dear father rest in peace!

Baldwin Kuruppu
A noble teacher to his students
I came to know Baldwin Kuruppu in the mid-1950’s when I was in the SSC class at Ananda College, Colombo. He was not only my class master, but also the Sinhala subject teacher for A’ Level. I became a student of his once again in a Human Resource Management course at NIBM when he functioned as the Course Director.
The nobleness that was intrinsic to teaching was definitely epitomized by him. After leaving Ananda College, he served in varies executive capacities in several organizations in Sri Lanka before migrating to Australia in 1991.
He authored over fifty books–originals, translations and biographies. He was a repository of knowledge and wisdom, sharing his vast knowledge and experience expecting nothing in return.
He also belonged to a class of people who made the word a better place by having lived here, passed this way with the fragrance of their lives. Their live evade the skills of a biographer. They cannot be assessed, there are no windows to their lives. Such was the life of Baldwin Kuruppu.
He was never conspicuous with his emotions, but his immense love for near and dear family was always in plain view.
He gave them the space to express themselves to pursue their adventures and ambitions to become strong and independent, but was always there when they needed his wisdom, strength and love. His uninhibited affection for them would reveal the great tenderness that lay beneath that cool reserve.
Had strong ethics and principles which he never compromised. He was able to bend the world to his will, not with brashness or aggression, but with quiet poise, dignity and his own distinctive brand of compassion.
Throughout his life, he displayed humanism, gentleness and other good traits which are now fast disappearing.
His exemplary ethical conduct, integrity and moral values left and indelible mark on those who came into contact with him. There was no vestige of superciliousness or assumption in him. He was never overbearing and self-opinionated, but unpretentious, always keeping a low profile. In the evening of his life, he developed a mental serenity and tranquility that enabled him to remain calm and unruffled and face life with equanimity.
He lived for 89 years. His demise reminds us of the Buddhist teaching of impermanence. “Material form, feelings, perceptions, formations and conciousness are all impermanent”
May he attain the supreme bliss of nibbana!
