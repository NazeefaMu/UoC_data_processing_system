Follow guidelines, EC Chairman tells media

Chairman of Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday announced a series of guidelines that should be followed by all print and electronic media institutions to ensure a free and fair local government election on February 10.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Elections Commission Chairman said the media has a special responsibility to encourage the participation of the public in the democratic process, and to ensure that the candidates have the opportunity to present their views on an equal basis during the period of an election.
He said every media institution should provide accurate, balanced and impartial information in broadcasting or telecasting their news bulletins and any other programmes relating to political matters. The neutrality and impartiality of the media shall be monitored regularly by the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives on Elections Complaints and the Standing Committee of Permanent Representatives on Media Guidelines.
Every telecasting, broadcasting and print media should also be neutral and impartial in their reporting of matters relating to any election and should not act in a manner which is discriminatory against any contesting political party, independent group or a candidate or causing a special benefit to any such party, group or candidate in allocating airtime and allotting space for such political party, independent group or a candidate in the newspapers.
Editorials published in the newspapers should not be commented by electronic media as opinions in such commentaries may be confused and biased. Whenever an editorial opinion is broadcast, telecast or published, the affected party shall be given an opportunity to broadcast, telecast or publish material to counter such opinion, he said.
He said every presenter of programmes and announcer of television and radio channels should refrain from expressing personal views at the newspaper desks where newspaper headlines and cartoons are presented which may promote one party while prejudice another.
It is the responsibility of the news and current affairs divisions of all electronic and print media institutions not to broadcast, telecast or publish any biased programme or supplement during the election period, if such programme, supplement or news item is inconsistent with the election laws and media guidelines of the Elections Commission.
Every media institution should refrain from broadcasting, telecasting or publishing propaganda that may create or induce hatred and intolerance among Sri Lankan people on various grounds including the religious beliefs, faith practice, languages spoken, ethnicity, customs and castes. Every media institution should avoid broadcasting, telecasting or publishing propaganda activities that promote hateful politics among political activists and within society, he said.
Every media institution should refrain from republishing or repeat telecasting of any statement made previously by any candidate or a supporter about another candidate of another political party without the consent of the declarant and honour the request made by a declarant not to repeat such statement made by such person previously, he said.
Any media institution shall not give coverage to anonymous notices or propaganda and to the notices or propaganda under the names of fake organisations or persons. The responsibility in this regard shall lie with the respective media institution.
The Chairman said the Elections Commission and the Police Department alone cannot ensure the free and fare election and political parties, candidates, media and citizens should also be contributed to the effort.
