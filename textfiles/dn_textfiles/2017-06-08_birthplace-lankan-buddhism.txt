BIRTHPLACE of Lankan Buddhism

Centuries back in 247 BC Arahant Mahinda Thera was seen atop Mihintale. He delivered the first lesson of the Buddhist teachings to King Devanampiyatissa. The king had gone on hunting. He was taught that killing of animals is improper.
This sleepy village and temple complex, 13km east of Anuradhapura, holds a special place in the annals of Sri Lankan lore. In 247 BC King Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura was hunting a stag on Mihintale Hill when he was approached by Mahinda, son of the great Indian Buddhist emperor, Ashoka. Mahinda tested the king’s wisdom and, considering him to be a worthy disciple, promptly converted the king on the spot. Mihintale has since been associated with the earliest introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka.
Each year a great festival, the Poson Poya, is held at Mihintale on the Poson full-moon night (usually in June) to commemorate the conversion of Devanampiya Tissa.
Mihintale Mountain, with the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, began to serve as a residential area for the venerable monks headed by Arahath Mahinda Mahathera. But soon, with the royal patronage, the sanctuary housed a multitude of with monastic buildings-stupas, uposathgharas, bodhigharas- to serve the monks. Sixty eight cave dwellings provided the monks shade and shelter. Mihintale, the sanctuary for many thousands of laymen as well as holy men, had all the facilities and amenities for basic living.
The great stairway that leads up the Mihintale Mountain consists of no less than 1840 rock cut steps. While some of the neat steps are carved into the natural rock, the rest are paved with cut granite.
Exceedingly wide for a pedestrian climb, the impressive staircase of unique distinction, well sheltered and shaded with frangipani flower trees and ever-green wood makes a very pleasant climb.
The blossoms of Araliya (frangipani) make the staircase fragrant while the intrusive hoards of monkeys hover around and hang in the branches of the trees to grab snacks off the visitors.When one proceeds along the ancient stairway-about half the distance, the path branches off to the right into a still steeper climb.
The pathway, which consists of about 80 steps, leads you to the site of the Kantaka Cetiya. The branch pathway is 10 feet wide and about half the size of the stone steps laid on the main path. Mahasaya, Atvehera and Rajagirilena Kanda are approached through similar pathways.
All over the world, high places are given religious significance, with the result that devotees are always climbing steps. Sometimes on their knees. Mihintale is one such place, its various shrines connected by a total of some 1,840 steps that ultimately lead to the summit – steep enough to require deep breaths and a meditative pace. They were built in the reign of Bhathika Abhaya (22 BC–AD 7), although a later paved road provides a short cut up to the first level.
A five-minute drive from the main entrance brings you to the sylvan Pond of Black Water. This peaceful artificial lake supplied water to a monastery that stood here during the 10th or 11th centuries. A few fragmentary monastic ruins stand around the lake including a quaint little structure comprising a facade and roof built onto a natural rock overhang – half cave, half house. The minimalist decoration is misleading, however, since these monks were definitely not roughing it like the troglodytic pioneers of Buddhism on the hillside above, but enjoyed the comforts of indoor toilets and bath houses.
In the beginning Mihintale monastery established itself as the Rain Retreat of the Buddhist monks. In the sixteenth chapter of Mahavamsa, the Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, composed in Pali verse by the Buddhist monk Mahanama narrates Arhath Mahinda and his followers, who spent their first three weeks at the Mahamegha Park in the Royal city of Anuradhapura, chose to retreat to the natural sanctuary of Mihintale, the location of their arrival itself to spend their first Vassa (Sinhala: Rain Retreat) during the months of July to September, thereby initiating an annual ritual for the Buddhist monks. Having heard of the Rain Retreat, King Devanampiya Tissa had sixty eight rock cells at Mihintale made habitable and gifted them to the Buddhist monks on the full moon month of Asalha (in the lunar oriented 12 month Sinhalese calendar) that falls within the months of July-August of the Gregorian calendar.
