One jump ahead…

A dog that can jump more than six feet is among the weird and wacky champions revealed in the 2019 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.
Feather, a greyhound rescue from Maryland, USA can jump 191.7cm (6ft 3in), which is only a few centimetres less than the British women's record set by Katrina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
Samantha Valle, 31, Feather's owner, says her talents became apparent when she saw her jump so high she hit their basement ceiling.
She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm 'effortlessly'.
