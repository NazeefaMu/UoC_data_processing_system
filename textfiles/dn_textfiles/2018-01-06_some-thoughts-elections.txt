Some thoughts on the elections

It is true that relations of Lasantha, Rajudean, Raviraj and Eknaligoda, also Marshal be really disappointed that police still couldn’t find a valid reason to arrest former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Any HR conscious foreigner who reads the above opening statement of this article may wonder what is happening in this country.
Why the government is incapable of keeping in line with the UN resolution.
Why the government is looking for more reasons to arrest a person who as defence secretary directly responsible for crimes committed by military people? Yes, such things happen only under dictatorships, fascist regimes and undemocratic circumstances.
However such things have happened in this country, this is the sad reality in Lanka today. Since the current government came to power promising good governance, there was eagerness to arrest responsible for fascistic crimes.
Oppressed families were relieved but now some see only the exact opposite being practiced. Families of the disappeared expected the entire government machinery to target fascistic villains. But the government behaved, to avoid the blame, towards harassing the current and potential opponents. There was strong revulsion against laws to be twisted at will, to achieve the sinister motives of somebody.
Over the last three years, the government had been effective in suppressing the abuse of the legal system and the police powers. Thousands of people have been questioned by the CID, Bribery Commission, presidential commissions and of course by the FCID but nobody claimed any undue harassment.
Yahapalanaya and Mahinda regime
This is certainly the main difference between Yahapalanaya and Mahinda regime, whose legality itself is in question. Those days every time one of these institutes started an inquiry about a politically important individual, the information is not passed to anybody; family members live in horror. Now no such steps are taken, even when indirect evidence available for brutal crimes. If the case is very important, then it is quite likely that a charge is framed under the Public Property Act. Why Public Property Act? That is because under the Public Property Act the magistrate courts have no powers to grant bail to those who are arrested by police unless there are some exceptional circumstances justifying bail. That is how those who conduct the case can investigate keeping the victim in remand custody for several weeks or months.
Once a person was framed as a suspect and remanded by Mahinda regime, the government media is used to completely tarnish the image of the suspect. That happened to Marshal Fonseka and later Azath Sally. Sadly the private media followed suit due to fear of the regime, whatever its news value. The target was no longer a suspect. He was already projected as a culprit. Long before an indictment was even served, the person’s character was completely destroyed in the public eyes. To the outside world now he is positioned as a criminal who betrayed the country.
How many times have Lankans seen this drama being played over and over again? Since the current government came to power, they have conducted a number of inquiries on Gotabhaya; public may remember only a few. Investigations on Avant Garde maritime services, Rakna Arakshaka security services, MiG aircraft, attacks on some journalists, Welikada prison massacre and the D. A. Rajapaksa memorial were just the most important. Even after three years of investigations government has so far not imprisoned him and stood with judicial rulings.
Local government election
The nomination period for the 2018 local government election drew to an end last week with remarkable changes in political landscape. It is going to be full of clashes but with less bloodshed but with lots of hard words and campaigning will continue earnestly in the coming weeks.
Candidates were given a choice, so are the people. Political debate is hot though not violent as some people predicted. Of course violence was reported here and there; but police was in control. It might be so in the coming period of campaign.
Clearly the nomination period for the 2018 local government election is over and campaigning has begun; inspite of few objections taken to the Supreme Court. How have the early days of campaigning been for the Lankan people? Good, in spite of few bad incidents says police chief Pujith Jayasundara. He is ready to deal with any aggression on people’s freedom!
However some say that the nomination period was eventful for almost all the parties and there seems to have been clashes between aspirant candidates. Because of these clashes and disappointments, some candidates have become estranged from their parties. They have either joined other parties or have become neutralized or hostile.
Fascistic politics
This is unavoidable with seat-oriented candidates eager to try their luck with the village or ward community that they were attached to, and worked for. As there have been close to 100,000 aspirant candidates and their hardcore supporters were vying against each other during the nomination campaign; whether their luck and dedication was fruitful. Unlike in the past with Manapa dominating, social and political grassroots level leaders got more chance with the present system.
Since there were a lot of hopes riding on this process and so many people were fighting for a limited number of places, it is easy for people to get upset and crossover to a side offering palaces without any demand on finance capability.
Of course politics dominate and the masses that are already politically aligned will change their minds although some of their leaders have changed their minds. Of course that means fascistic politics still alive.
They are in an alliance, which includes the SLPP - Sri Lanka People’s Party at the centre. So, apparently others are not under the SLPP but a part of the alliance. ‘The powers of this alliance have been distributed evenly, of course with proportionate privileges to those who have the largest segments of political power.’ That means concentration of power in the fascistic leader. Therefore, irrespective of the numbers of nominees each of sub parties can include differ; they are satisfied with the openings that they received from the leader.
Of course the nomination process appears to have been complicated for all parties. But all democracy-oriented had the support of the rank and file to complete the nominations. In particular young people with education and political awareness were very active. Women were more active more than ever. But it appears that it has been more trouble for the fascistic SLPP. Over 10 SLPP nomination lists have been rejected, which is a lot more than any other party. Why is this? Is it because of negligence, inexperience or internal clashes? For these questions one fascistic leader gave a hilarious answer.
‘If the SLPP had some issues in preparing the nomination lists, it was because the SLPP was handling a lot more aspirants for nominations than any other party. There are political parties who had to struggle to find candidates, for those parties things are easy. But since we had so many applications, the selection process was long and complex. When a process is long and complex, the possibility of minor errors happening also increase, I think this is what happened to our nominations.’
May be we should not laugh. Who knows? The new theory of permanent revolution could be - more mass support leaders have, less revolutions will occur.
