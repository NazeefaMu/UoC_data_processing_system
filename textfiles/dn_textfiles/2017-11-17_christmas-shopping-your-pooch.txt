Christmas shopping for your pooch

Mulled wine, twinkly lights, interesting knick-knacks to peruse… Christmas markets are wonderful places to get into the festive spirit.
But why should only humans have all the fun? Fortunately this no longer needs to be the case as a Christmas market for dogs is coming to London. Your favourite furry, four-legged friend will now be able to get involved in the festive fun at the rather brilliantly named Santa Paws, a one-day market for dogs and their owners.
There’ll be dog-friendly cupcakes (lemon drizzle, red velvet, carrot or banana and peanut), peanut butter for dogs and nutritious treats such as spinach biscuits.
Food aside, you’ll be able to get your paws on stylish dog accessories, from leads and collars to dog jumpers and collar charms.
If you think that sounds a bit crackers, wait till you hear about the dog crackers, available in festive red or green with phrases such as Fleas Navidad, Santa’s Little Yelper and Official Turkey Taster. There’ll also be plenty of dog-related gifts for humans on offer. Always wanted a Christmas family portrait with your dog? Leading pet photographer Rachel Oates will be on hand with a pop-up studio full of festive props to make your dreams come true or you could get a cushion made to perfectly resemble your pooch.The event is being put on by London dog lifestyle brand Fetch and Follow to help raise funds for local charity All Dogs Matter. - independent.co.uk
