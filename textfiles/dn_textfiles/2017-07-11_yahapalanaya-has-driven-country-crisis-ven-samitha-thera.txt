Yahapalanaya has driven country into crisis: Ven. Samitha Thera

The Yahapalana government has driven the country into a crisis by estranging and alienating the Maha Sangha, said Southern Provincial Council member Ven. Dr. Baddegama Samitha Thera. Addressing a meeting held at Baddegama on July 9, Ven. Samitha Thera said, the government mercilessly attacked students who demonstrated against SAITM.
Although the government assumed on a plank of democracy, it was trying to subvert media freedom through a new piece of legislation on the pretext of regulating the media. The Rajapaksa regime had to introduce draconian laws due to the war situation in the country.
Such legislation was quite unnecessary today, as there was absolute peace in the country.
