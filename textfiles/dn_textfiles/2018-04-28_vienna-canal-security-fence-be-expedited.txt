Vienna canal security fence to be expedited

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday directed the Mahaweli Authority to take immediate action to construct the security fence on the side of the Vienna canal on the Badulla - Mahiyangana main road for the safety of the vehicles and passengers.
The President has taken action to provide Rs 26.5 million for this purpose. The President has advised the Road Development Authority (RDA) to accelerate the construction work of the security fence in remaining insecure road areas under RDA.
The road running parallel to the Vienna canal is 13 km long and 8 km of it belongs to the Mahaweli Authority while the other 5 km belongs to the Road Development Authority.
Erecting the security fence on the 5 kms out of the 8 km property belonging to the Mahaweli Authority was completed in 2017. Considering the reports on frequent road accidents in the other stretch of the road, the President has instructed to complete the remaining construction as early as possible.
