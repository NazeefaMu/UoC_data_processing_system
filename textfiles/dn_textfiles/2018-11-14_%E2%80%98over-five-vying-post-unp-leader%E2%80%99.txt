‘Over five vying for post of UNP leader’

Over five persons are now eying on becoming the leader of the UNP. The UNP Leader is trying the same old tactic this time with the former Parliamentarian Sajith Premadasa.
He used this tactic on former Parliamentarian Sarath Fonseka in 2010, let him get defeated, and stayed on as the UNP Leader, former National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian and the NFF Media Spokesman Mohammad Muzammil said.
Speaking at a press conference at the NFF office in Pitakotte yesterday, he said the UNP should not try to solve its internal issues by dragging poor people into it. The UNP should not let foreign countries interfere in the internal affairs of the country because it has its own policy issues. The UNP is scared to ask for the people’s vote because it did not do anything for them and only made their life difficult day by day.
Even the former Speaker is now in line for the post of leader of the UNP. Before him there were several others. Leadership councils, the Rainbow Alliance or anything else will not stop the break up of the UNP, he said.
Now the TNA has already broken into three pieces: the Vigneswaran faction, the TNA, and the faction which left the TNA. They did nothing for the Tamil people during the past three-and-a-half years and only collected money for themselves. The TNA became rich, but not the Tamil people.
Therefore they are dead scared to ask for the people’s vote, Muzammil said.
