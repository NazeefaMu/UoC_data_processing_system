Chandimal and Tharanga carry Sri Lanka to 254/7

BIRMINGHAM: Brilliant fielding and accurate bowling on a good batting pitch by England kept Sri Lanka down to a total of 254 for seven wickets after they won the toss and decided to bat first in the second One-Day International played at Edgbaston here on Friday.
England accounted for two important run outs both involving Jason Roy who got rid of the dangerous looking Kusal Perera for 37 with a direct hit and top scorer Dinesh Chandimal for 52.
Sri Lanka’s innings was built around an 82-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Chandimal and his captain Angelo Mathews who contributed a valuable 44 batting with a dodgy hamstring injury.
Although Mathews declared himself fit it was quite evident the way he batted that he was clearly uncomfortable in his movements. But credit to him for putting up a brave front.
England never allowed the Lankan top order batsmen to forge any noteworthy partnerships other than the one involving Mathews and Chandimal as they kept chipping away at the batting.
Seekkuge Prasanna on this occasion failed to produce his usual cameo innings when he was dismissed for two when David Willey pulled off a stunning catch behind the bowler as the batsman took the aerial route but failed to get the distance.
Upul Tharanga and Suraj Randiv gave an extra impetus towards the end of the innings with a partnership of 63 off 56 balls that got them over the 250-mark.
Tharanga playing with all his experience of 184 ODIs scored his first half century for three years remaining unbeaten on 53 scored off 49 balls with one six and five fours, while Randiv who gave him good support was 26 not out off 27 balls.
Sri Lanka went for an additional spinner when they opted for the off spin of Randiv for the medium-pace of Dasun Shanaka.
With the wicket dry and offering a little spin and bounce playing an extra spinner could become handy for Sri Lanka when England begin their run chase.
The first ODI played at Trent Bridge ended in a tie.
