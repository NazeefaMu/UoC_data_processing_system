Open to indifference

Absurd refers to unreasonableness, foolishness, and Nihilism is the complete rejection of political institutions, religious and moral beliefs. It includes total rejection of all existence and objective reality.
Nihilism is derived from the Latin word nihil which means nothing. Nihilism appeared in Ivan Turgenev’s novel ‘Fathers and Sons’. In it, Bazarov, a doctor is continually in conflict with others, stands alone and believes in nothing. Fredrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus denied objective truths and accepted values. Existentialism owes to the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard (1813-1855) and was popularised by Sartre (1905-1990). It states that man is a unique and isolated individual in an indifferent or hostile universe responsible for his own actions and free to choose his destiny.
Annihilated at death
The Buddhist text, Samannaphala Sutta, mentions six sectarian teachers who advocated incoherent ways of living. Of these Purana Kassapa believed that good and evil deeds were equally devoid of any religious significance. Makkali Gosala was a fatalist. Ajita Kesakambala held a materialist view that man is annihilated at death. Pakuda Kaccayana held the view that human beings disperse at death. These four teachers were ethical nihilists who denied the existence of moral causation. Ajita Kesakambali held a strong philosophical opinion of ethical nihilism (natthikavada). Makkhali Gosala roundly denied all initiative and choice in man (akiriyavada). Pakudha Kaccayana who professed a fatalistic pluralism based on the Upanishadic concept of the indestructibility and the unchangeability of the ‘atman’ has been called ‘sasatavada’ or eternalism.
However, in ethics, it leads to an akiriyavada or amoralism. Nihilism and fatality have been valued concepts in the past. The story of Angulimala illustrates absurdity and nihilism. The Guru ordered Ahinsaka to present a garland of 1000 human fingers (angulimala). This absurd request made. Ahinsaka becomes an outlaw who resorted to cutting off a finger from each traveller. He was making a garland of fingers (angulimala). Which too was absurd. The philosophical doctrine of sunayavada (‘The way of emptiness’) is not equated with nihilism as the term is equivalent in meaning to suchness (tathata) and ultimate reality or ultimate truth (dharma-dhatu). Great Emptiness (Maha sunyata) is the abandonment of even the notion of emptiness.
There is a glimmer or a glimpse of the absurd in Shakespeare’s Hamlet who at times performs meaningless actions in a state of madness or disillusionment. He is at one and the same time gentle and cruel, loving and vindictive, a deeply reflective introvert and a man capable of acting on impulse.
Detached introvert
Kulasuriya in Martin Wickramasinghe’s novel ‘Viragaya’ appears to be an absurd character living a fake existence shunning social and economic ambitions. This statement is only a presupposition. Alienation is a strong theme in ‘Viragaya’. Aravinda appears to be a disinterested, uninitiated and detached introvert. Aravinda matured spiritually with experiences and lived a fruitful life. So there is no evidence to label him as an absurd, nihilist and existentialist character like Meursault in Albert Camus’ novel ‘The Outsider’.
‘The Outsider’ inspired a variety of interpretations. Jean-Paul Sartre described it as an existentialist novel. Other critics like Bree, Thody and Cruickshank described Meursault as a mere representative of the author’s absurdist views. The novel is in two parts. Part One Chapter one introduces the unusual protagonist, Meursault. He is not moved at receiving a telegram that his mother has died in an old people’s home. When going to attend her funeral he sleeps through the journey. The caretaker wanted to show mother’s corpse. Meursault declines to see it. He was not a mourner. He drank coffee and smoked a cigarette. His behaviour at the funeral was unconventional. Chapter 2 reveals that he is unaware of his mother’s age.
He expresses his sensory experiences while enjoying a movie (a comedy) with Marie. This happens on the day following his mother’s death. He enjoys smoking, eating chocolates, and spending that afternoon in a lazy manner. All these behaviour patterns indicate his absurd character. His attitudes are neutral. His attitudes and actions are linked to personal freedom of choice. But Meursault is able to cope with and manage the tragic change. Later chapters reveal his unassuming and disinterested disposition.
Robot woman
To the question of Marie ‘Do you love me?’ Meursault says that the question has no meaning. He is interested in love and sees the incident of his friend Raymond’s beating his mistress, Meursault refrains from calling the police as he does not like the police. He is not ambitious. He is willing to marry Marie but shuns a marriage ceremony. He expresses a curiosity to the little ‘robot woman’ whom he thinks that she is spiritless and mechanical in behaviour. Chapter six is the gruelling chapter with a climax on an unusually hot Sunday on the beach. Meursault is suffering from a sunstroke and is also after a couple of drinks. Meursault murders the Arab (Raymond’s cousin) under unavoidable circumstances. There is no premeditation. But why does he fire four more shots after the first shot? But he does not repent.
In Part Two, the court proceedings are described. Meursault refuses to lie to save himself or for the sake of lessening his punishments. His heatstroke is not given any consideration in the proceedings. The prosecution lawyer proves that Mersault is an absurd person, a nihilist and an existentialist.
The magistrate considers him to be an outsider who does not believe in social conventions. Meursault is not remorseful over shooting the Arab. His view is that the adverse circumstances caused the shooting. Mersault’s responses imply that life has no meaning. In the prison, he speaks to the chaplain in a strange manner. He denies the existence of God and an afterlife. He is aware that death is certain and later refuses to see the chaplain. While awaiting his execution, he realises that he has lived happily. His last wish is that there should be a crowd of spectators at his execution and that they should greet him with cries of hatred.
Meursault has been a subject suffering from a depressive mood disorder. Depressive mood disorder is a relatively common disorder, and its recurrent nature disrupts patients’ lives. It has a lifetime prevalence of 17% 15-20% of patients with depression commit suicide. Meursault exhibits symptoms related to an impairment of emotions, cognition, human relationships and behaviour. His experiences and feelings are unusual. He is alienated as he observes the absurdity of life but continues to live accepting death to occur at any time. Meursault has been convicted largely on evidence unrelated to premeditation of a crime but on character assassination.
He remains a cryptic intellectual.
