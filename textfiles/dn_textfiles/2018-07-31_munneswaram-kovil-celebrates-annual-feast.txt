The historic Eswara Kovil of Munneswaram in Chilaw began celebrating its annual feast yesterday by ceremonially planting kap at the auspicious time.
The chief priest of Munneswaram Kovil Brahma S. Pathamanakha told the Daily News that the annual festivities and other traditional rites and rituals would be conducted for 28 days and the water-cutting ceremony would be held at Deduruoya at noon on August 26. All security measures and facilities have been provided by the Northwestern Provincial Council and about one million devotees are expected for this year’s feast, from all parts of the country and from India. About 1,200 police personnel and 230 private and SLTB buses would be deployed for the convenience of devotees during the feast, said CM Dharmasiri Dassanayake.
