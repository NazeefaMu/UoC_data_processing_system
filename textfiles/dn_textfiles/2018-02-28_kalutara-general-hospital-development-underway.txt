Kalutara General Hospital development underway

The Kalutara General Hospital will be developed at a cost of Rs. 12,000 million under a three-year plan, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after opening several new features of the hospital.
Quarters for intern doctors are being now constructed. An auditorium and the new dialysis unit were already opened. The hospital will become a teaching hospital within three years.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that 5,000 quarters would be provided for doctors and nurses by the end of 2020. A new Maternal and Child Hospital will be constructed at Galassa close to the Kalutara General Hospital at a cost of Rs. 3,400 million.
A new hospital will be set up at Ambilipitiya with French aid. Thousand dialysis units will be set up countrywide by the end of this year for kidney patients. Another 900 dialysis units will be installed with Indian assistance in three phases, he said.
