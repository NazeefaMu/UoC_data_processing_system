The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) engaged in a generous CSR initiative that involved less privileged children in the society,to coincide with the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.

SLIM staff, council members and Exco enthusiastically teamed up to uplift the atmosphere of the sleeping hall of the children’s home by providing curtains, new bedsheets and pillow covers and repairingceiling fans.
The staff of SLIM organised a mini-concert at the venue to showcase the hidden talents of these orphan children and joined them in singing sessions.

SLIM CEO and Executive Director, Sanath Senanayake said at the occasion, SLIM’s quest towards specializing and grooming marketers to suit both Sri Lankan and global contexts go hand-in-hand with social responsibility.

Hence a CSR project of this nature,initiated to contribute towards innocent and needy children is significant for SLIM. It was a new experience for our staff. They were actively involved in this CSR activity from its inception. We were deeply privileged to host this CSR event at the Sanhinda Children’s Home”, he said.
“One of the prime objectives of SLIM is to provide support to uplift the educational standards of the less privileged student community in the country. Therefore, SLIM is committed to conducting CSR activities of this nature on an annual basis and I would like to thank all the members who supported this event generously” saidSLIM President,Elangovan Karthik, responding toa joint request made by the little kids at the Sanhinda Children’s Home made a promise to follow suit next year too with thisnoble CSR project.
