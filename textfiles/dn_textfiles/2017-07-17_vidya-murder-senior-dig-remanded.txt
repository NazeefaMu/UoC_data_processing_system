Vidya murder: Senior DIG remanded

Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe who was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department in connection with the Jaffna schoolgirl Vidya Sivaloganathan rape and murder case on Saturday was remanded until July 25 by the Kayts Magistrate Courts.
Meanwhile, the vehicle transporting Jayasinghe to the Kayts Magistrate’s Courts had reportedly met with a minor accident. But no one was hurt in the incident.
Police said that Jayasinghe was arrested and charged under Section 209 of the Penal Code for harbouring, concealing and assisting the main suspect in the case Mahalingam Sivakumar alias ‘Swiss Kumar’ to flee and evade arrest. Jayasinghe was the Senior DIG of the Kandy Division at the time of arrest.
Senior DIG Jayasinghe was charge sheeted on July 12 and was given a month to respond to the charges.
Sivaloganathan was raped and murdered in May 2015 by a group of people. While 12 suspects were arrested in relation to the case, Mahalingam Sivakumar, the main suspect who was handed over to the Police escaped from a hospital he had been sent to, for treatment.
However, he was again arrested in Wellawatte while in hiding, on a tip-off received by the Police. It is alleged the suspect was attempting to flee the country at the time.
