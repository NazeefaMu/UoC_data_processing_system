Bridge sans access road

The new bridge across the canal on the Hathlaha - Florence Colony Road in the Ambagamuwa DS division in the Nuwara Eliya district does not have an access road, residents complain.
It was constructed by the government at a cost of about Rs. 50 million several months ago.
The villagers of Dombepola, the Florence Colony and Hathlaha say that the new bridge replacing the old suspension bridge was constructed by the government but they are inconvenienced due to the lack of an access road. Affected villagers urge authorities to take steps to complete the construction work on the incomplete road used for transporting building materials to the bridge construction site as an access road to the new bridge.
