'No alternative other than renewable energy'


Sri Lanka has no alternative other than going for sustainable natural resource management by tapping huge renewable energy (RE) sources to meet future demand of energy and environmental sustainability, said Bio Energy Association of Sri Lanka, President Eng. Parakrama Jayasinghe.
He was speaking at the Private Finance Advisory Network - Asia (PFAN-ASIA) Forum for Climate and Clean Energy Financing (AFCCEF8) Road Show, held in Colombo recently.
Sri Lanka's renewable energy developers and consultants including those from bio mass, wind, solar, biogas and mini-hydro enterprises attended the forum.
Jayasinghe said the development of the RE sector in Sri Lanka has also been quite slow and it is the duty of all potential investors to come forward and support the initiative of PFAN to help country's RE developers.
This was the first road show held to create the awareness of local RE developers about the PFAN initiative and also to explore international financing source towards the development of the renewable energy sector in Sri Lanka.
PFAN is a promotional agency to bring together developers of renewable energy projects and potential investors.
PFAN is now accepting proposals to be forwarded at the eighth Asia Forum for Clean Energy Financing (AFCEF-8) Business Plan Competition. Applications for the competition are expected before July 19.
Jayasinghe said several organizations have already come to support the PFAN initiative to help renewable energy developers in our country.
He said the aim of PFAN is to bring together developers and potential investors to make the country's RE sector a success.
According to Jayasinghe, Sri Lanka has so far not been able to get any benefits from this initiative. PFAN is keen to rekindle this interest.
He said PFAN has appointed a new country representative to attract the country's renewable energy developers to participate in the forthcoming Asia Forum for Climate and Clean Energy Financing (AFCCEF8).
Green and Clean Energy (Pvt) Ltd, Director P. R.Wijewardena said green energy comes from natural sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, algae and geothermal heat and these energy resources are renewable.
He said fossil fuels are a finite resource and take millions of years to develop and thereafter it will continue to diminish. Renewable resources are also important in reducing air pollution and mitigate adverse climate effects.
He said according to the latest United Nations climate report on man-made global warming, that fossil fuels needed to be eliminated from the energy supply in the coming decades to avoid catastrophe.
He said the main barrier faced by our RE developers is the access to affordable capital, equity and debt and they can be overcome these with the forthcoming PFAN programme.
He also said the Government has taken many step to develop RE projects by establishing the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) in 2007 and also establishing the Surya Bala Sangramaya.
He said that PFAN will also work with several industry associations to activate the RE sector by helping them with technical inputs and advice.
"In addition, many state agencies are playing a supporting role, such as the CEA, provincial councils, Forest Department, and Irrigation Department as the representatives of the Project Approving Committee of the SLSEA,” he said.
Bio Energy Association of Sri Lanka Council Member Nelson Nagasinghe said he was happy to see that there are many RE developers who have been trying to initiate new projects in Sri Lanka.
“However, one great barrier faced by them is that of access to affordable capital, equity and debt and that can be overcome by the PFAN programme which aims to bring together RE developers and many international investors together,” he said.
He said RE projects could mitigate climate change. He said achieving energy security in Sri Lanka through renewable energy plays major role in economic green growth. Therefore the development of RE sources is a national priority for energy security in Sri Lanka.
He recalled that the energy policy of the country clearly states that at least 20% of power generation in the country should be achieved through renewable sources by the year 2020.
