Huawei  leads at ‘Open ROADS to  a Better Connected World’

At Mobile World Congress 2017 (MWC 2017) inaugurated at Barcelona, Spain, Huawei is leading a number of activities including joint exhibitions, keynote speeches and industry forums, under the theme of “Open ROADS to a Better Connected World”.
Over 100 operators and partners from around the world will demonstrate new innovations and ideas jointly developed with Huawei. The company is also engaging in a dialogue with industry partners about the future of the telecoms industry and best practices to help operators achieve new value-driven growth. The telecoms industry is in a crucial stage of digital transformation as new technologies emerge to drive a high quality user experience. A Better Connected World is dawning and the potential opportunities for the telecoms industry, which is the primary enabler of industry digitization, are beyond our imagination.To compete in this new era, global operators are shifting from an “investment-driven” to a “value-driven” business model, where they are prioritizing the user experience, and the delivery of innovative services and greater value to their customers.
Huawei helps its carrier customers maximize the value of their existing networks to drive greater efficiency, increase revenues, and sustainable business growth. Moving forward, Huawei will help operators leverage their strengths in data transmission to expand into new areas, such as offering video as a basic service, and cloud services to enable other industries, opening up new opportunities in markets worth trillions of dollars.
Huawei deputy chairman and rotating CEO Eric Xu said, “Huawei has remained customer-centric for many years. We create solid value for our customers and strive to become their business partner.” To fulfill its mission of “Building a Better Connected World”, Huawei is encouraging the industry to adopt a Real-time, On-demand, All-online, DIY, and Social (ROADS) experience as a key standard for success in digital transformation.
