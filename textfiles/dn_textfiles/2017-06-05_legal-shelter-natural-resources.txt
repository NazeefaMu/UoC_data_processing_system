Legal shelter for natural resources

Sri Lanka’s environmental law is a curious mixture of civil law and common law principles derived from Roman Dutch law and English law, statute law juristic writings and judge made law. As a result, there is a multiplicity of jurisdictions and institutions in the environmental arena.
The judiciary on the other hand has shown a keen interest in the development of environmental law. Natural resources are managed through the law. Laws provide the tools and the framework for its management.
The numerous tasks of management including policy making, enforcement, application of management techniques and tools and the making of specific decisions have to be performed within that framework.
One trend that should be noted is the inter-polation of a new level of provincial government after the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987.
The constitutional amendment introduced a new level of institutions between the Central Government and local governments. Accordingly, Provincial governments also have legislative and executive power over environmental matters.
The key environmental law at the statutory level in Sri Lanka is the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980 as amended which introduced both EIA and EPL procedures. Apart from this Act, there are many other sectoral statutes that deal with specific areas of resources or development activity.
Concept of Trusteeship
The Doctrine of Public Trust is an important legal principle which has its roots relating to environment and public law. The duty cast on the State to protect and conserve the environment for the benefit of the people is not a new concept that was introduced with the enactment of the 1978 Constitution. In the Danube River case (1997 – General List N92 25th September 1997, ICJ) then Vice President of the International Court of Justice C.G Weeramantry J, referred to the conversation of King Devanampiyatissa (247 -207 BC) and Arahat Mahinda dating back to the 3rd century BC. The excerpts from the said conversation is given below:
‘Or great king, the birds of the air and the beasts have as equal rights to live and move about in any part of the land as thou. The lands belong to the people and all living beings; thou art only the guardian of it ……’ (Mahawansa; Chapter XIV).
Dr. A.R.B Amarasinghe J. in Bulankulama and Others v Secretary of Industrial Development and others (2000), refers to the fact that the king was Bhupathi or Bhupala meaning ‘lord of the earth or protector of the earth’. The Doctrine of Public Trust which was developed through the concept of trusteeship of the kings and rulers is now a well developed legal principle in many parts of the world. In Bulankulama case the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka observed that the organs of State are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people.
In Watte Gedara Wijebanda v Conservator General of Forest and Eight Others (2007), (per Shiranee Tilakawardane, J), the Supreme Court held:
Courts in Sri Lanka have long since recognized that the organs of the State are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and preservation of the resources of the people. This recognition of the Doctrine of the Public Trust, accords a great responsibility upon the Government to preserve and protect the environment and its resources.
Sources of Public Trust Doctrine
There are two possible sources of Public Trust Doctrine namely, (a) Roman Dutch law in relation to environmental law and (b) the notion of trusteeship in the law of Trusts. The Doctrine of Public Trust was initially developed in the Roman- Dutch law, particularly with reference to environmental law and the rights of the public to natural resources. Roman – Dutch law which distinguishes between res nullius and res communes, assigns common ownership to that which comes under the latter category. In assigning natural resources with a sense of common ownership Title I of Book II of the Institute of Justinian is pertinent. This section states as follows:
‘The following things are by natural law common to all – the air, running water, the sea, and consequently seashore. No one, therefore is forbidden access to the seashore ….. for these are not, like the sea itself, subject to the law of nations.’
This notion of ‘common to all’ or common all mankind underlines the fundamental basis upon which the Doctrine operates : all natural resources such as rivers, forests, air are subject to common, or public ownership and therefore are held by the government in trusteeship for the use of the general public and are managed and utilized for public purposes. The doctrine also affirms that endowments of nature should be freely available to public, irrespective of the social or economic standing of the person. The roots and fundamental basis of the Doctrine may also be traced to the concept of trust which dictates that property or resources can be held by one person, on behalf of another.
Basis of Public Trust Doctrine in Sri Lanka
The Doctrine of Public Trust in Sri Lanka is the bedrock of the Constitution and elected officials and the arms of the State are mere enforcing agents of the power that is truly vested in the people. In this regard, Articles 3 and 4, Article 12(1) and Chapter VI of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka are of immense importance and have been cited in many cases regarding the doctrine.
Article 3 of the Constitution provides that ‘in the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty of in the people is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of the government, fundamental rights and franchise.’ In order to establish that the officials are custodians of powers held on behalf of the people, it is argued that these powers are vested in the people and are inalienable by virtue of Article 3. Article 4 provides that the legislative power of the people is to be exercised by Parliament, the executive power by the President of the Republic and the judicial power by Parliament through Courts, tribunals and institutions created, established or recognized by the Constitution.
Moreover, Article 4(d) provides that ‘the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government and shall not be abridged, restricted or denied, saved in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided.’
Also relevant are the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties outlined in Chapter VI of the Constitution and mostly importantly Article 28 which provides that ‘… It is the duty of every person in Sri Lanka – (d) to preserve and protect public property and to combat misuse and waste of public property and – (f) to protect nature and conserve its riches ‘.
