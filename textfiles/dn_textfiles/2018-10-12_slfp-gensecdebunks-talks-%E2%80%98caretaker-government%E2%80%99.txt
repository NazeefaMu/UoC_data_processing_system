SLFP Gen.Sec.debunks talks of ‘caretaker government’

The idea about a 'caretaker government' is only a rumour and gullible talk and no official talks have been held in this direction so far, SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said.
There has never been any form of antagonism within the SLFP – UNP consensus government so far and the SLFP always subscribed to a collective decision within it”, he said.
Prof. Piyadasa said the SLFP took decision after summoning a meeting of its Central Committee.
He said the party's stand was that there should be a Member of Parliament to represent and take responsibility for each electorate. This topic was also discussed during a meeting of UPFA party leaders.
