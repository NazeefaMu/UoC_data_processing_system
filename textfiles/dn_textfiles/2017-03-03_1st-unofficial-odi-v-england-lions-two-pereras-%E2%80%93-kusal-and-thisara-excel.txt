1st unofficial ODI v England Lions: Two Pereras – Kusal and Thisara excel in Lanka A win

Sri Lanka A drew first blood in the five-match unofficial ODI series when they beat England Lions by 47 runs under the Duckworth/Lewis rule at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
England Lions whose target was set at 278 off 43 overs after Sri Lanka had scored 278-7 in 48.1 overs finished on 230-9.
An opening partnership of 123 in 25 overs between Kusal Perera (59) and Danushka Gunathilaka (64) gave Sri Lanka A the platform for their total.
A very sedate Perera took 74 balls to score his runs which comprised eight fours and a six while Gunathilaka had five fours and a six in his 79 ball innings.
England Lions managed to restrict Sri Lanka 191-6 by the 38th over, but another fine partnership of 65 off eight overs between skipper Milinda Siriwardana (48 off 41 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) and Thisara Perera an unbeaten 56 off 35 balls inclusive of five sixes and two fours saw Sri Lanka A to a competitive total.
England Lions needing to maintain a run rate of six and a half an over slid to 133-7 by the 29th over despite a steady knock of 64 off 70 balls from skipper Keaton Jennings.
A partnership of 76 off 11 overs between Liam Livingstone (39) and Craig Overton (60 not out off 45 balls, 3 fours, 2 sixes) saw England Lions put up some late resistance but the asking rate was too much to maintain especially after losing cheap wickets upfront.
The second unofficial ODI is scheduled at the same venue for March 4.
Scores: Sri Lanka A 278/7 in 48.1 overs (Kusal Perera 59, D Gunathilaka 64, M Siriwardana 48, Thisara Perera 56 n.o., T Roland-Jones 2/59, C Overton 2/46, T Helm 2/50)
England Lions 230/9 in 43 overs (K Jennings 64, T Alsop 20, L Livingstone 39, C Overton 60 n.o., S Jayasuriya 2/34, L Madushanka 3/50, A Aponso 2/37)
