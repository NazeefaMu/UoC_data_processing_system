[APPRECIATIONS - (24-07-2017)]

A. A. Latiff
A forthright individual
The 24th death anniversary of senior journalist A.A. Latiff fell on the first day of the holy month of Ramazan. Abuthalib Abdul Latiff, passed away in 1993 on the first day of the Ramadan. His death occurred a few months after his retirement as an Information officer at the USSR embassy in Colombo. A leading journalist, author and teacher, he was well known for his forthright and forward thinking views on matters relating to social and religious reform.
A. A. Latiff was born to an illustrious family from Matale. His father was Naina Mohamed Abuthalib Lebbe, and his mother was Mabokke Muhandiram Walauvvage Uduma Lebbe Marrikar Saida Umma. Her ancestors had served as Headmen under Sinhala Kings.
Latiff had his primary education at Vijaya College Matale when V.T. Nanayakkara was its Principal, and pursued his secondary education at Zahira College Colombo under T.B. Jayah. He also attended Zahira College, Matale. Both, Nanayakkara and Jayah, were leading educationists and politicians of their time and served as Members of Parliament. At Vijaya and Zahira
Colombo, Latiff came under the inspirational influence of Nanayyakkara and Jayah. He edited the Silver Jubilee edition of Az Zahira, the official magazine of Colombo Zahira.
Regrettably, the sudden death of his father caused Latiff to cut short his further education, and to take to the teaching profession. Jayah had visited his home to try and persuade him to continue with his education.
He began his career as an English teacher at Madawala Muslim Vidyalaya and later joined the teaching staff at Zahira College, Matale. Latiff did not limit his activities to teaching and soon became involved in social service activities.
He was the General Secretary of the YMMA-Matale and of the Matale Study Circle, the latter a socio-cultural organisation, comprising educated personalities from all communities. He was also involved in activities for the upliftment of the estate labour community.
In 1961, he left government service to join the Chinese Embassy in Colombo as a Press Officer. Two years later, he joined the Novosti News Agency of the USSR Embassy.
A long standing and leading member of the Afro-Asian People’s Solidarity Organisation and Ceylon Peace Council, he and Jaya Pathirana attended the Cairo conference which gathered to discuss the issue of Bangladesh.
For many years, he edited the Communist Party journal ‘Desabimani’ and acted as contributing editor of the party’s English journal ‘Forward,’ which was edited by Pieter and Maude Keuneman. Latiff did not see a contradiction between Islam and socialism. He believed in their egalitarian philosophy.
In the 1960s, he published and edited the Islamic news weekly ‘Insan,’ which was enormously popular among the Tamil-speaking population. Several budding writers and poets found their feet and established their literary reputations through Insan, which gave them the space and the opportunity to do so.
He wrote a regular column for the Tamil daily ‘Thinakaran’ under the name ‘Ram-Raheem,’ which attracted a wide readership. Equally fluent and facile in English and Tamil, his short stories, poems and other writings have been published in many journals. DRCA Goonetilleke, in ‘Sri Lankan English Literature and the Sri Lankan people 1912-2003’ reproduced Latiff’s poem ‘Dreams are Dying’ describing it as ‘a cry from the heart, adding: ‘Latiff is just in bringing out the sheer tragedy of the (ethnic) conflict, the sheer pity of it’.
Through his writings, both in English and Tamil, Latiff popularised the works of the great subcontinental poets Allama Iqbal, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, also translating them into Tamil. In his writings, he condemned religious bigotry and hypocrisy in the strongest terms.
Latiff contributed in no small measure to the debate on Muslim personal law reform in the late 1980s, when he stood up in support of granting equal status to Muslim women, arguing against fundamentalists’ resistance to women’s equality, emancipation and rights.
A deep thinker, he was widely read and many sought his wise counsel on matters relating to politics and current affairs. The late M.H.M. Ashraf approached him with a request to join his party, promising him an important position within the hierarchy. Not given to seeking office, he declined. He was opposed in principle to the formation of a party along ethnic lines.
When Al Haj A.H.M. Azwer was the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, he was honoured by President D.B. Wijetunge for his contribution towards Islam and peace.
When A.C.S. Hameed took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs during President J.R. Jayewardene’s tenure, Latiff was offered to become Sri Lanka’s envoy to the USSR, but he politely turned down the request.
He attended international conferences on world peace at Aden-South Yemen and Moscow. In late 1980s, he was honoured by the Soviet Parliament by awarding Order of Merit—Lenin Prize for his services for world peace.
One a personal level, he remained a sincere teacher and advisor for several years until his death.
His visits to Matale were occasions for his friends and acquaintances to gather at his place to discuss current issues till late at night. Several politicians, cultural activists and youth leaders paid their last respects before his janaza left to Matale for burial. At the Janaza ceremony, the late Foreign Minister A.C.S. Hameed said: “His demise is a great loss for the community and country.”
May Allah reward him with Jennathul Firdous.

Gamini Gunawardena
He had a good heart
I learnt with sadness that Gamini Gunawardena had passed away in London. Gamini was a distinguished old boy of St. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. He was a larger-than-life character and had a great sense of humour—I always remember his stories and his hearty laugh. My earliest memories of Gamini were at St.
Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia, near the Warden’s office where Gamini would ‘hold Court’ with his friends all around him! He was the life and soul of St. Thomas! He really loved his alma mater. I regret that I lost touch with Gamini during recent years.
Gamini’s father, Patrick Gunawardena, was a wonderful educationist, he was Sub-Warden at St. Thomas’ College when I was in school and we held him with the utmost respect.
He sent me a wonderful letter before he passed away. Gamini and I came up with an idea to honour him as he was such a powerful force for good in the field of education in Sri Lanka—he was so humble and unassuming, he had a heart for the vulnerable. So we organised the ‘Patrick Gunawardena Awards’ in the Palace of Westminster in the presence of Members of Parliament from the House of Commons, peers from the House of Lords and CEOs of British charities.
The awards created history when MP Linda Perham mentioned them in the chamber of the House of Commons in a debate—a huge honour remembering Patrick Gunawardena—Gamini was humbled by it.
Gamini was President of the Old Thomians Association in the United Kingdom in 2010. He raised funds for the College, organised dinner dances in London and was in the thick of it and he loved it! During his tenure as President, a cricket match was organised by Gamini and the Old Boys and the Oxford University Sri Lanka Society and the match was played at Oxford.
I must confess I had some fun with Gamini back in 1997. Gamini was in the Old Thomians cricket team and I used to tease him saying: “Gamini and his donkey drops!” Gamini was a really good spinner and back in 1997. I wrote an article about him routing the Old Royalists in the traditional Old Royalists vs Old Thomians match in London—it was published in the
Daily News in Sri Lanka—Gamini hit the headlines on the sports pages. On one side was the headline on Sanath Jayasuriya hitting 340 runs against India in Colombo and then the adjoining article was “Gamini Gunawardena sinks the Old Royalists!” He burst into laughter when he saw my article which was also reproduced in the Old Thomians Magazine in the U.K.
I will always remember something deeply illuminating about Gamini. He really had a good heart. When he heard that my father Vernon Corea had died in September, 2002, he was one of the first to arrive at my sister’s home in New Malden. The funeral service was held at Emmanuel Church in Wimbledon Village—Gamini had gathered together a group of Old Thomians to attend the funeral—out of the kindness of his heart.
He had organized the ushers, made sure the food was on the tables at the church and oversaw the pall bearers at the funeral. He was capable of such kindness and compassion—he wanted to support his friend in his hour of need.
Gamini had a deep and abiding faith in God. We had some deep conversations at times and he even went with me to a Benny Hinn Crusade held at the Excel Centre in London Docklands, many years ago, as he was interested in the area of healing.
His remains will be flown back to Colombo and to his roots in Gampaha. I know that Old Thomians will be there to remember Gamini. May his soul Rest In Peace, in the arms of Jesus.

Ranjith Samarasekera
A modest man
During the memorial service in honour of the departed Ranjith Samarasekera at St. Theresa’s Church, my mind went back to the period that I first spotted Ranjith, but did not meet him.
I was a young teenager among the throng of spectators watching the Annual Public Schools Championships the ‘blue ribband of schools’ athletics. That was possibly in 1955or 1956.
Ranjith, fair, good-looking and seemingly modest, was an excellent javelin-thrower who won the event. It instantly enhanced his image. In the old days, to be a champion at the ‘pubs’ was some achievement.
I also recall that Anandian Sarath Wijesinghe, won both the other throwing events—the discus throw and the shot-putt, at that meet. I never imagined that both, Ranjith and Sarath, would be my friends someday. Fate was kind, but also inscrutable. Alas! both, Sarath and Ranjith are dead now.
Ranjith, like several others of those mellifluous post-independent years, was a true representative of that era. He was an embodiment of dignity and decency.
Years later, at the Colombo Colts Cricket Club, where we first met as comparatively young men, he showed total commitment, first as a player, secondly as a coach and finally, as an ExCo member, Vice Patron and Patron.
Colombo Colts owes its gratitude to some of its senior members like Ranjith, for their varied services which over the decades had helped to make that 144-year-old Institution a key component of cricket development in this Island.
How do individuals break out of the ranks of the average and emerge into limelight? There are some basic and early inputs of character building. Among elements of a good upbringing are the home, school and the society you move in.
St. Anthony’s College, Kandy, which produced Ranjith, is a front-ranked educational institution. If we consider the sports arena during the years, Ranjith studied at St. Anthony’s College, Kandy. It was the leading educational institution in Kandy, in athletics and cricket, surpassing the other great Kandy school; Trinity College.
Let me justify the above. Even before Independence, the ‘pubs’ was dominated by Royal, St. Thomas and St. Joseph’s. In the mid 1950’s, St. Anthony’s Kandy broke through the shackles of the virtual domination of such schools to grab at least a part of the limelight at this prestigious meet. St. Anthony’s went on to produce champion athletes S. B. Miyanadeniya, Ivan Boteiju, Jeeva Weerasinghe, R. A. F. Perera, besides Ranjith Samarasekera and others, to project the school’s prowess in the sport. In Cricket, also during that era, St. Anthony’s had some excellent cricketers, which made it a force to reckoned with.
When penning this appreciation, I need to mention a distinguished old Antonian who provided me with valuable insights into his old school.
He is Dr. Janaka Goonetilleke, whom I met for the first time at Colombo Colts in the early 1970’s. He was then a young doctor. He vanished from our sight and reappeared after nearly three decades, publicly, in Colombo, with an excellent book on the history of ‘Atapattu Walawwa,’ the 260-year-old mansion in Galle, which his wife inherited. The media praised the book.
It was Janaka, now a retired specialist of the British Medical Service, who revealed, among other facts, how the great Antonian Cricketer A. C. M. Lafir, was discovered. It was Janaka’s maternal uncle, the notable Cricket Coach John Halangoda, who had identified early, the prodigious natural talent of the greatest of all Antonian cricketers of the 1950’s.
Before I conclude this appreciation, which hopefully gives an insight into the varied characteristics of the good citizen and sports personality Ranjit Samarasekera, I need to mention one other fact. This relates to the intermittent interaction he and I had in yet another vital field—Trade and Commerce, particularly during the long years I served at a leading Chamber of Commerce, then located in Fort.
Our exchanges principally revealed yet another aspect of his personality—he was patient and calm and he knew his limits in the field of shipping and freight forwarding a highly competitive sphere in which he was engaged in.
May Ranjith rest in peace.

Life member and Vice Patron,

Jehan K. Cassim
A true gentleman
After attending a glittering wedding ceremony of my niece Huda, in the banquet hall on Nugget Avenue, Scarborough, Ontario, I was not so destined to receive a joyous message, but it was a grim and gloomy SMS from my good friend and former Mayor of Colombo Omar Kamil, of the news of the demise of Alhaj Jehan K. Cassim. This made me feel profound sorrow.
It was quite recently that I visited Jehan with my good friend and former President of the Sri Lanka football federation F.A. Yassin, another intimate friend of Jehan, at his residence down Lake Drive in Rajagiriya. He was, for a long period of time, bed-ridden and showed no sign of recovery, although his beloved wife was meticulously attending to his medical care.
I came to know Jehan about fifty years ago, in the company of some great Muslim leaders at that time at the All-Ceylon Muslim League. His father Kamar Cassim and uncle Senator Shums Cassim, were close associates of Doctor T.B. Jayah, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Alhaj Falil, A Caffoor, Jabir A . Cader, M.A.C.M. Saleh—stalwarts of the Muslim factor in the independence movement. Jehan very ardently followed the footsteps of his elders. He was a compelling follower of the Muslim League leadership in all social, religious and political spheres, which inspired Jehan in later life to propel himself up as an ardent worker in the cause of Sri Lankan Muslims, and made him one of the most likable and lovable personalities in the society.
Jehan always stood for national unity and amity among all sections of the people. Not only did he build up a sense of great brotherhood with the learned Ulemas of Bahjatul Ibrahimiya, a seat of higher Islamic learning in the South (Fort-Galle)—the place where even Mamoon Abdul Gayoom graduated in Arabic—but also established a close rapport and bondage of friendship with all the Sinhala leadership including learned Buddhist clergy, like Ven. Elle Gunawanse Thera and leaders of other religious communities. He was a true protagonist of reconciliation and a bridge builder of peace and unity. Following the principles and philosophy of the great national leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah, he always persisted for a united Sri Lanka, which consists of the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malays, Memons, Borahs etc. The like of whom we are so sorely missing amidst us in the present context of time.
Jehan dedicatedly and devotedly, threw his lot with President Premadasa, and was a tower of strength to the President in his forward march of development; he gave immense support to President Premadasa in all Gam Udawa programme, joining hands with his erstwhile friend B. Sirisena Cooray to make the Gum Udawa concept work successfully.
Jehan, indeed, followed Sirisena as the Chairman of the newly created Common Amenities Board and performed a remarkable job in the clearance of Shanties and helped to improve essential service to the downtrodden people living in
muddukkus, in the city of Colombo.
The success story of Jehan followed through and through and saw him appointed as the Chairman of the premier banking sector—The Bank Of Ceylon. The international Muslim factor also drew the attention of Jehan. He backed me to the hilt when ever I approached President Premadasa to close the Israeli Interest Section working in this country at that time. Jehan was the happiest man when Premadasa declared that “all inimical forces to the interest of Sri Lankan Muslim population would be closed down.” His happiness saw no bounds when Premadasa told a U.S. emissary visiting
Sucharita, to change the Sri Lankan leader’s mind, his residents at Keselwatte that “there are no Zionists but only Muslim voters in Sri Lanka.”
Jehan was also an encouraging factor in the establishment of the Ahadiya school at the Sucharita Hall parallel with the Budhhist Daham Pasala. Jehan further enamoured us to encourage the President in the establishment of a Fund for Muslim widows with Sheriffdeen (later Ambassador to Kuwait), as it’s secretary. In the many phases of my political career, Jehan was always kindling in me a passion to promote better ideas in the social welfare activities. I still remember with nostalgic memory that whenever I concluded my interpretations of President Premadasa’s on public platforms, I would always encounter the countenance of the gleaming face of Jehan, patting me on my back: “Well done, Azwer!”
Jehan possessed superlative qualities with which one could attribute in life—he was soft-spoken, polite, kindhearted, forthright, humble, trustworthy, dedicated and utterly devoted to the task assigned to him. He was an utmost patriot who loved his country dearly with gleaming pride and honour. In all sense of the words, he was a true gentleman that I had come across in public life, whose memory would always sway us into action.
May Almighty Allah (SWT) grant him the highest felicity in Jannatul Firdous!
A.H.M. Azwer,
Former MP/Minister, General Secretary, Sri Lanka Muslim Progressive Front, Toronto, Ontario
Janappriya Ratnayake
He stayed true to his name
My first encounter with Janappriya was half a century ago in 1967, when he came as a young Trainee Assistant Superintendent to Madampe Group, Rakwana. Thereafter, much water has flowed under the bridge, with both the good and not so good times. I cherish the friendship that we cultivated and grew over a period of time.
Janappriya hailed from the Deep South. He was from an aristocratic family of Ratnayakes in Deniyaya. He was the eldest son of Wijesena and Phyllis Ratnayake. He grew up with two sisters and a brother. His alma mater was Richmond College, Galle. He captioned the school cricket team in 1966. On leaving school, he joined the bandwagon of Planting, which was running in his blood from his forefathers.
At Madampe, he surpassed the expectations of his tough task master, a senior planter by the name of late Van Twest. This young lad performed in an excellent manner, riding on his in-born talent. Ironically, after the retirement of Van Twest, it was none other than Janappriya who cared and looked after him like a son to a loving father.
Consequent to his successful performance at Madampe, he moved to an upcountry estate named Abbotsleigh situated in Hatton. The experience he gathered at Madampe assisted him immensely to turn around the division of Abbotsleigh assigned to him. Whilst at Abbotsleigh, he married Manjula Kulatunga and they were blessed with two children.
The daughter, Dayanji, has settled down in the United States whilst the son, Millinda, is engaged in business locally. Millinda dutifully and with much affection looked after his ailing father during the final stages of his brief illness.After a very successful planting career in Hatton, Janappriya took over the reins as the Superintendent of Willie Group, Deniyaya. During his tenure, Willie Group achieved the best performance ever recorded at the time. He mastered the art of excellent public relations, tea cultivation, processing and other management techniques that propelled the Group to be at its best. Janappriya had the ability to strike a balance between volume and quality that contributed to the success of the group.
It was during Janappriya’s stint at Willie Group that proliferation of private tea factories came into being in Southern and Sabaragamuwa regions, catering to the small holder growers. There was a paradigm shift in how the tea industry operated at the time, which resulted in the tea-broking firms looking for experienced personnel particularly with expertise in the field of factory development and manufacture. Janappriya, with his wide experience in all three tea-growing elevations, not only in manufacturing, but in all other plantation aspects, was handpicked by M/s Bartleet and Company, where he joined as an Executive. He excelled at his job functions, delighting the clientele of the broking company. I recall that during this time, the catalogue of this company had a significant market share particularly in the low grown sector.
Janappriya, with his knowledge, versatility and being an excellent “PR Man” was in demand.
He served as a Director of M/s Mercantile Brokers (Pvt) Ltd and later joined M/s Asia Siyaka where his role included managing tea factories and estates, until his retirement.I have many nostalgic memories of my dear friend. His beloved mother gifted him with a Mitsubishi Colt car on his 25th birthday. It so happened that he was the only person who had a car whilst we were on Motorcycles. So with Janappriya having a car, we planned so many aimless trips. One of the trips that I recall was the journey to Kataragama and Jaffna, motoring through the East Coast. The understanding we had was that Janappriya provides transport and the late Tissa Silva (who became the member of parliament for the Rakwana electorate subsequently), to bear the cost of fuel which was Rs. 3.50 per gallon and for myself to arrange for accommodation. What a memorable trip, it was! Our journey to Jaffna took three days passing through crossings in ferries and beaten tracks. In Kayts, we were met by a friend of mine, attached to the Excise Department who provided us with accommodation. This unforgettable trip took place over a period of ten days.
I have so many golden memories and silver tears and as all things have to come to an end, Janappriya bid adieu, after a brief illness. He will live in my heart for evermore until we meet at Sassara.
Adios, my friend!
Edward Welikala
