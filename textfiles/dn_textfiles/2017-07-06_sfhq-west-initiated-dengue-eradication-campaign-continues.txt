SFHQ-West initiated dengue eradication campaign continues

The special week-long dengue prevention programme, now underway in Colombo as an initiative of the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West), continued for the second day on Monday covering the Mahawatta area in Colombo.
A total of 40 teams, each team comprising five Army personnel, one Policeman and one Public Health Inspector, moved out to most congested areas in search of dengue breeding spots and other vulnerable points.
In parallel to the programme, nearly 60 more Army personnel are currently engaged in dengue eradication drives in Kaduwela, Piliyandala, Hanwella, Homagama and Kahatuduwa areas.
The week-long campaign in Colombo started on Saturday at the MOH office near the Sugathadasa Stadium after a brief discussion, headed by Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, Commander, Security Forces - West, Medical Officer of Health for Colombo North and Colombo Municipal Council authorities.
The programme will continue until next Saturday (June 8).
