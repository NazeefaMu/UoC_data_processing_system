Boost for water sports in NWP

The coastal belt from Wennappuwa to Chilaw of the North Western Province is an ideal location for ocean based water sports such as scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing, yachting and surfing.
The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme has decided to set up a Marina in the deep sea off Marawila which would help to anchor sailing boats, yachts and motor boats which would immensely benefit competitors in the ocean based sports.
Local and foreign competitors from Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are likely to take part in these events which would help to promote the region as a tourist destination as they will be visiting the country along with their family members.
