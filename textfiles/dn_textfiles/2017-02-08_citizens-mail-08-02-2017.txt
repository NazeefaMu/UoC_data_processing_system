[CITIZENS' Mail - (08-02-2017)

Flag down the rag
On January 19, two Sinhalese newspapers reported a tragic case where a student in Peradeniya University who opposed ragging was assaulted by a group of ‘raggers'. The victim needed admission to hospital and he is said to be the son of a judge. I congratulate the student for his courage and wish him a speedy recovery.
Over the past few decades (since I was a medical student) the despicable practice of ragging has become increasingly depraved and dangerous.
In 2015, a 23-year-old female student at Sabaragamuwa University was mentally traumatised by ragging - she committed suicide. In 2012, a 21-year- old female student fell during a ragging session and suffered a spinal injury. In 2010, my grand-nephew, then a medical student at Peradeniya University, paid dearly for his stance against ragging. The raggers assaulted him, fractured his nose and lacerated his face. He needed surgery and still has scars as a reminder of the ordeal.
In 1995, a nephew of mine, now an architect, and his batchmates had been ragged at the Moratuwa campus for three months. The perpetrators issued orders in rude and foul language. The orders had been to crawl up to the fourth floor almost daily and staying crouched under chairs when lecturers were not around. On the last day, they were barred from urinating for several hours. It was a humiliating and harrowing experience for the victims.
Subsequently, the nephew's younger brother refused to go into any university because of ragging. I am sure there are many other untold stories of humiliation, horror and hurt in our highest seats of learning.
Sadly, after burning midnight oil for years, students in Sri Lanka begin university life not with elation but in fear (of ragging) and their parents are equally apprehensive and anxious. It is incomprehensible that no one has been able to stop this dastardly practice by thugs who consider the universities to be safe havens to give vent to their sadistic urges.
There should be no ragging
whatsoever, in any form or degree and raggers should be barred from universities for life. I hope that
someday every university will be a happy place for every student from day one.
