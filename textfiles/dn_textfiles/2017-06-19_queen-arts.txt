Queen of arts

At one point in The Value of Virginia Woolf, Madelyn Detloff talks about variations in categories of identity. She gives examples of relatively new ones (such as intersex, queer, or transsexual) and points out that the arrival or departure of viable statuses is not in itself a new phenomenon. “It was simply not possible to identify as an American, for example, before the seventeenth century.” This must have been hard. Even more unexpectedly, she continues: “Nor is it possible today to identify as the King of France, although the category certainly existed in the seventeenth century”. I don’t know how many people are (or were) personally affected by this cancellation of potential. But there is at least one king of France who has been alive and well for some time. Bertrand Russell brought him into legitimate existence as a logical problem of reference, with the announcement, in an article of 1905, that “The present King of France is bald”. Thus exposed in a wigless twentieth-century world, this French monarch has nonetheless continued to enjoy a high level of recognition in the pages of philosophy journals and student essays ever since.
Virginia Woolf was attuned to the shifting ambiguities of identity and identification. In A Room of One’s Own, she speculates about a day to come, a century into the future, when people might well exclaim in surprise at the sight of a woman. Even the most commonplace, common-sense categories, in other words, may disappear or be superseded by other modes of existence or classification. Post-American, for instance; or, at the opposite, King-of-France-end of the spectrum, a new kind of uniqueness may emerge from a category currently without any occupant. In the same essay, Woolf invents a fictional non-fictional sister of Shakespeare – who didn’t exist in reality, but might have, and if so would not, Woolf insists, have survived in the real time of early modern London.
A successful sixteenth-century Judith Shakespeare would be a contradiction in historical possibility, and Woolf does not try to imagine her. Instead, she gives a brief but detailed and poignant story to show how the life of a gifted young woman born into the same world as Will would have run an entirely different course from his, even after a childhood in which reading and thinking were not out of reach. Not only would she not have been able to get involved in theatrical productions in the same way as a male counterpart, but being a woman she would have come up against every form of sexual discrimination and harassment (as they weren’t yet called in the early twentieth century, let alone in the sixteenth). But she would also have experienced such external barriers as a conflict within her own mind, so that, all told, “To have lived a free life in London in the sixteenth century would have meant for a woman who was poet and playwright a nervous stress and dilemma which might well have killed her”.
Judith’s real-life brother, meanwhile, was not constrained in these ways, and Woolf is rapturous in her description of his unbounded capacities: “his poetry flows from him free and unimpeded. If ever a human being got his work expressed completely, it was Shakespeare. If ever a mind was incandescent, unimpeded, I thought, turning again to the bookcase, it was Shakespeare’s mind”. Yet the great man’s existence comes over as somehow less interesting than the woman’s. The sister’s story has tensions and tragedies, a miniature blighted Bildungsroman that takes its thwarted heroine from a home where she reads in the apple loft to all the dramatic risks of the big city. Shakespeare, back in the bookcase, just “got his work expressed completely” – job done.
Shakespeare is today, as he was for Woolf, the peerless figurehead of English literature. And as Woolf was already able to report, the prospects for gifted sisters have improved, with women writing about modern lives like their own; the creation of Judith is itself a symptom of that continuing change. In the later part of the twentieth century a further movement began. A multiplicity of causes converged to make women’s writing a primary focus of literary-critical attention, not least on school and college syllabuses. Woolf acquired a prime position, becoming something like a queen in the widening world of women and literature. There had been a more doubtful period when her writings were sometimes disparaged or downgraded, and her Bloomsbury associations might detract from her status as a thinker. But by the time she came out of copyright for the first time in 1992, she was all set for the long canonical haul: ripe for instant endowment with the footnotes of scholarly and studently editions. She could be called on at any time and in most contexts for a challenging, memorable quotation – not just about women or literature, but about any topic of current or universal interest, from war to love to money to colonialism to class. Alongside Shakespeare, Woolf is a literary celebrity, to be found in every corner of cultural consciousness and public or private space: from mugs to T-shirts to films and plays. On the purely textual front, as with him, there is a steady output of Woolf books and articles. No other non-male writer has received anything like this degree of recognition and attention. It is not clear whether this is more of a consummation or an irony, but without a doubt Woolf has herself become Shakespeare’s sister.
