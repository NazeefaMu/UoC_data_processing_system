Ideal solution for Kandy

If you think that Colombo’s roads are congested and polluted, just visit Kandy, where it is much worse. Kandy’s woes are worsened by the fact it is boxed in by mountains, with fairly narrow streets already bursting at the seams. Kandy suffers from bumper to bumper traffic and severe air pollution. Parking is a nightmare on the labyrinthine one-way streets.
With the authorities ruling out opening the road in front of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, which no one can fault given the sacred site’s religious and cultural significance, other alternatives have to be found to reduce traffic congestion in the country’s second biggest city. This is not easy, because some of the solutions that work in Colombo are practically impossible to implement in Kandy due to its hilly terrain.
It is in this context that the Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority (RDA) began to earnestly study the possibility of building a network of underpasses or tunnels in and around Kandy. Although this will be an enormously expensive undertaking, it seems to be the most viable solution that will also address the issue of air pollution. Clearly, foreign funding, expertise and assistance would be needed for a project of this magnitude. The pedestrian underpass in Borella is the only such existing project in Sri Lanka, though the Kandy project will be much bigger in scope, being a vehicular tunnel.
The good news for residents of Kandy (and for visitors) is that the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of Korea has approved US$ 200 million for the Kandy tunnel construction project, according to the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka. The project comprises four tunnels with a total length of 5.5 Km from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura via Bogambara and Ampitiya which will be the longest road tunnel in Sri Lanka. The Korea Exim Bank will finance this project with a concessional loan with a 0.15 percent interest rate and 40 year repayment period including a 10 year grace period. The project also includes building a number of bridges and roads and will cost US$ 250 million.
The main objective of the project is to ease traffic congestion in the centre of Kandy City by constructing bypass tunnels for vehicles heading to the west or east of Kandy without entering the circuitous Kandy Lake road. The tunnel is expected to reduce the travel time from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura from two hours to less than 30 minutes even at morning and evening rush hours. This will make a huge difference to motorists and save a colossal amount of money that would otherwise go for extra fuel.
Experts say the tunnels will also boost the economy of Kandy by providing a short connection between the Kandy Industrial Zone and the A1 Road to Colombo. Coupled with the Central Expressway now under construction (completion slated for 2019), the tunnel and road network will give a much-needed boost for goods and passenger transport to and from the Hill Capital. The train service too must not be forgotten – it should be a prime candidate for rapid electrification which should slash journey times further for the Colombo-Kandy intercity express service.
We hope the authorities would take extra care to ensure quality control and adherence to environmental guidelines in both the tunnel and expressway projects in the light of concerns over the Southern Expressway after the recent floods. Many allegations have been made that the construction of the Southern Expressway without necessarily taking environmental concerns into account may have contributed to the recent floods in some of the areas traversed by the expressway. The authorities should investigate these claims without delay and apply any lessons learned to ongoing and future projects. “Building back better” should always be the aim of previous lessons learned.
The Government has embarked on a series of expressway and road development projects that will link every part of the country including the North and the East whose road infrastructure must catch up with the rest of the country. Among them are the Rajagiriya flyover, Ruwanpura Expressway, Central Expressway and proposed expressways linking Jaffna, Trincomalee and other Northern and Eastern cities. Most of these will be elevated, but serious thought should be given to underpasses where they could be more viable. The authorities are also saddled with the massive task of repairing the roads, bridges and culverts damaged in the recent floods. Again, the motto should “build back better”.
The Government should pay equal attention to developing road and rail public transport. Sri Lanka will soon have eight million vehicles in line with current registration trends with no immediate solution to congestion in sight. The only alternative is to build a quality public transport network that can lure a percentage of motorists who will then keep their cars at home. Fortunately, the Government will shortly embark on Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) projects in key cities. These projects will hopefully come on line before our roads become more or less permanently clogged. A better public transport network is the best answer yet to the private car.
