Woman marries 300-year-old ghost

Amanda Teague had a beautiful fairytale wedding complete with a gorgeous white gown and family and loved to celebrate her special day.
There is just one big difference at this wedding from the usual ones you may have attended. The man Teague married is a 300-year-old ghost named Jack, the Metro reported.
Jack was a Haitian pirate who was executed for his crimes in the 1700s, according to the report. He also has the ability to switch stereos and lights on and off and even move objects.
Despite the unusual circumstances, the 45-year-old from Northern Ireland revealed their relationship started out like any other and was normal. What started as a friendship soon grew into something much more.
“We became really close, the more I learnt about him, the more I liked him. One day he said to me ‘We can actually be together you know’ but I had never heard of an intimate relationship between a spirit and a human before,” she is quoted as saying my the Metro.
So Amanda, a female Jack Sparrow impersonator, decided to do her own research into these kind of spiritual relationships and learned there are a lot of people in her situation.
So what is sex like with a ghost? Amanda says it’s similar to that with a human.
“The only difference with having a sexual relationship with a spirit is obviously that sense of touch goes a lot deeper,” she revealed in the report.
Adding, “You can literally feel the physical act of what the spirit is doing to you, and the spirit can feel it too.”
She also revealed the connection they have is unlike any other she has ever experienced. As their relationship grew, Amanda expressed to Jack the desire of have something long-lasting. “I told him I wasn’t really cool with having casual sex with a spirit and I wanted us to make a proper commitment to each other,” the Metro reported.
So when Jack proposed to Amanda, who had five children from a previous marriage with a human, she accepted. The wedding took place on a boat and a medium was used for Jack to be able to say ‘I do’. A skull and crossbones flag was also used to represent him on their special day.
