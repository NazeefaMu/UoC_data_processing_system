NCM procedure not followed properly – Cabinet Spokesmen

President Maithripala Sirisena has power to run the country for three months using the funds of the Consolidated Fund according to the Constitution, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday evening he said this power is granted to the President under Section 150 of the Constitution but President Sirisena will make decisions quickly without any delay and there will be no need to use the funds of the Consolidated Fund to run the country.
According to Minister Jayasekara, both the UNP and the Government did not have the majority seats of the Parliament which is 113. “There were several lists of names. Nobody knows what was written inside the piece of paper handed over to the Parliament Secretary General by JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He did not hand it over to the Speaker. We attended the session because we respect the Parliament.”
Co-Cabinet Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that there were names in handwriting in the list and all saw how some MPs signed the list inside a room of the Parliament after handing it over to the Parliament Secretary General.
“There is a proper and accepted way of bringing in a no confidence motion in Parliament. If a no confidence motion is handed over to the Parliament Secretary General with the required signatures, it should be put in the Order Paper. Then it should be taken up during the Party Leaders’ meeting and a date fixed for inclusion in the Order Paper. A debate and a vote will follow. A date should be given as early as possible. This is very clearly mentioned in the Standing Orders. But none of those steps were followed,” he said.
