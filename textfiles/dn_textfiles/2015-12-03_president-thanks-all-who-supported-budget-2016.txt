President thanks all who supported Budget 2016

President Maithripala Sirisena thanked all government and opposition members who contributed to pass the Budget 2016 in Parliament yesterday.
The second reading of the Budget 2016 was passed in Parliament with a majority of 107 votes.
The President also visited the parliament yesterday to witness the second reading debate on the budget. He had a meeting with the SLFP parliamentary group in the morning and urged them to vote for the budget or abstain if some MPs do not want to vote in favour.
However, a few SLFP dissidents had voted against the budget despite the President's call.
