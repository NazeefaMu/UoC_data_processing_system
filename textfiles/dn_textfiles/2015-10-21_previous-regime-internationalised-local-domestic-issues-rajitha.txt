Previous regime internationalised local, domestic issues - Rajitha

Persons with a balanced view rule the country today, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a ceremony at Beruwala to felicitate members of the armed forces who helped end the clash at Dharga town, Beruwala on June 15, 2014, the minister said it was the previous government which internationalised local and domestic issues.
"Sri Lanka is the only country which protested against the UN. Racism received state sponsorship under the previous regime," Dr. Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the clash in Dharga town led the Muslims to vote against the previous government.
"The Armed Forces did an excellent job to solve the issue and establish peace. Rs. 250 million was allocated for rehabilitation work but broken hearts cannot be mended easily," he said.
