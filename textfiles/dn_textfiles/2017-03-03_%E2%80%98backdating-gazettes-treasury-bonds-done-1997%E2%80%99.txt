‘Backdating gazettes on Treasury bonds done since 1997’

The backdating of gazettes issued on treasury bonds have been the norm since 1997 and that this alone was not the problem in the Treasury Bond Scam, SLFP MP and Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna yesterday said addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters.
Alagiyawanna, who was also a member of COPE committee, which investigated into the Bond Scam said, “We all have asked that this investigation be done transparently, and we need to create a conducive environment for the Presidential Committee to carry out their work.”
He stressed that media conferences and fiery rhetoric on issues such as the ‘gazette’ would only hinder the work of the Committee.
“Since the introduction of Treasury Bonds in 1997, gazettes have been backdated to the previous year. Prior to 1997, the Central Bank would gazette in the manner in which it planned to raise money and the dates on which such transactions are expected to occur on January 1 of that year. But with bonds, it was practically not possible to do that as this would include the issue of bonds.
"So the process which was followed was to allocate a day the year after the financial year in question to issue the gazette. For example, the details of bond issue of 2012, would be released in a gazette in 2013,” Alagiyawanna explained.
He, however, noted that there was an anomaly in 2015,
“In 2015, January 8, Mahinda Rajapaksa lost, and there was a change in who was the Finance Minister, so there has been a mistake here as they should have issued a new gazette under the new Finance Minister. The issue here is to find out whether a new gazette was not released on purpose or by mistake and then take action,” he said.
The SLFP Deputy Minister stressed that the issue of gazettes a year later was not new and that the Committee be allowed do its job. He added that the COPE did not concentrate on this aspect as its report was released on October 28, 2016 and the gazette was released in September 2016.
