Ranjan ticks FCID on US$ 7.6 bn funding for MR’s campaign

Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake lodge a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) today against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over an article published in the New York Times on transactions between Sri Lanka and China during the former regime.
The New York Times in an article titled “How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port” published on Monday (25) revealed that nearly US$ 7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbour’s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of former President Rajapaksa’s campaign.
It further stated that the details were on a document from an internal government investigation.
The article stated that “the document details China Harbour’s bank account number - ownership of which was verified and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out”.
Minister Ramanayake addressing the media after filing the complaint said that he contacted the Times journalists who revealed the allegations before making the complaint to the FCID.
He challenged former President Rajapaksa to file a case against the NYT if they claim to refute all the allegations exposed in the article.
