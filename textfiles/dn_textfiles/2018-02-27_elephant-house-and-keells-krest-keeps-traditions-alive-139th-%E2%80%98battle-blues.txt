Elephant House and Keells Krest keeps traditions alive at 139th ‘Battle of the Blues'

The world’s second longest uninterrupted school cricket encounter, the Royal-Thomian “Battle of the Blues” Big Match, will be held in 2018 with the support of Elephant House and Keells Krest as its “Food, Beverage and Ice Cream Partner”.
Now in its 139th consecutive year, the “Battle of the Blues”,between Royal College and S. Thomas’ College, will be played from March 8 to 10 2018 at the SSC Grounds in Colombo.
In partnering with Sri Lanka's premier school cricket encounter, Elephant House and Keells Krest continues to lend support to a 139-year heritage that has seen many prominent Sri Lankans play in this big match
Itself backed by 150 years of tradition, Elephant House continues to be widely respected today for its recent unveiling of new high quality products that allow one to truly experience the ‘goodness of life’, especially its perfect Lemoki, refreshing isotonic sports drink F5, and the FitO range of fruit drinks.
Considering this is one of the longest running sponsorships for Elephant House and Keells Krest, the “Battle of the Blues” cricketing encounter is an event that encompasses a high level of planning annually, particularly since it requires Elephant House and Keells Krest to, every year, supply a full range of products for thousands of hungry and thirsty spectators over the three-day big match. This is a vital task as many people, from the cricketers and their fellow schoolboys, to old boys and parents and their friends, are relying on Elephant House and Keells Krest to help them make new memories at the “Battle of the Blues.”
