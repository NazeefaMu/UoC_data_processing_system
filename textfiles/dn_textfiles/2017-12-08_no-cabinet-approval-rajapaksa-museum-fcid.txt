No Cabinet approval for Rajapaksa Museum - FCID

The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) has informed the Colombo Magistrate’s Court that Cabinet approval has not been obtained for the D.A.Rajapaksa Memorial Museum in Weerakatiya, Medamulana. The project does not have the approval of the Weerakatiya Pradeshiya Sabha also, the FCID informed court, filing a report yesterday.
It was revealed that the Navy had provided manpower for the construction on the verbal instructions of former Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and on the written instructions of then Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (LRDC) Chairman, Harshana de Silva.
The FCID informed court that no legal agreement had been entered into by the LRDC and project officials. The Weerakatiya Pradeshiya Sabha development officer had informed FCID that approval had not been obtained for this Museum.
The LRDC told FCID that Cabinet approval had not been obtained and the Corporation has violated financial regulations in payments made for the project. Chairman Harshana de Silva had inspected the premises with engineer Eshana Ranawake and former Speaker Chamal Rajapakse, who had come to inspect construction work. The BOQ was done on September 13, 2013 on the instructions of LRDC Chairman Harshan de Silva. LRDC legal officers acknowledged the fact that they had not monitored the project properly, since no one responsible from the project came for supervision.
