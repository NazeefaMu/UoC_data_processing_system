Devotees at Sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya to mark Vesak

The entire country was enveloped in spiritual fervour as the nation celebrated yet another Vesak Full Moon Poya Day marking the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha. Religious activities, including meditation programmes, took pride of place at all temples and Buddhist monasteries islandwide.
