50 Greatest Players in World Cup History :
#37 David Villa

During the summer of 2009 when Real Madrid broke the transfer record twice, former Spain coach Vicente del Bosque was asked who he would prefer in his lineup - Kaka or Ronaldo.
“David Villa,” was his terse response.
It’s not easy to step into the boots of a legend such as Raul but that is exactly what David Villa did when he first broke into the Spanish national team. A veteran who has played and scored in three different editions of the FIFA World Cup, Villa eventually replaced Raul in the side just prior to an era of unprecedented success.
El Guaje (The Kid), as he was known since he used to play football with kids much older than him, did not have it easy growing up. Real Oviedo had rejected him because he was too small. A few years later, he tore them apart as a teenager finding his feet.
A serious injury in his childhood actually proved to be a blessing in disguise. A broken femur saw his leg in a plaster for weeks but it didn’t stop him from having a kickabout with his father. It was how he perfected his touch on his weaker foot.
Once he became a star at Valencia, it was only a matter of time before he donned the shirt for La Furia Roja. And luckily for him, his rise coincided with Raul’s decline.
Villa’s first World Cup was 2006 where he struck up a partnership with another young striker, Fernando Torres. The pair scored three goals each and Villa himself could have scored more had then-coach Luis Aragonés not substituted him before the 60-minute mark.
It was what led him to improve his fitness so he could stay on the pitch longer. “I make an effort to be ready, fit and alert in the last 15 minutes. That is when most goals are scored.”
What made Villa a deadly assassin in the box was his intuitive ability to make the right runs - in behind the defence, diagonal runs, veering away to create space - he had it all.
Gifted with a sublime first touch and brilliant decision-making ability, Villa could easily shake off anyone marking him to get on the end of passes and score.
Scoring 59 international goals in 98 appearances is no joke. Spain’s leading goalscorer before him was Raul but he scored 44 in 102 games.
Most strikers have big egos; a necessity in players who score goals by the dozen. But Villa is still a team player who will pass if there is a better opportunity for his teammate to score.
If there is a one-two on offer, he will go for it because he really did have an eye for a pass. It is what made him the complete attacker.
2010 was easily his best World Cup. He scored 5 goals for Spain - a tournament-high, tied with Thomas Muller, Diego Forlan, and Wesley Sneijder. Although the Golden Boot went to Muller (because had more assists), Villa didn’t care - he went home with the big one!
A brace against Honduras was standard but it was his goal against Chile that really lit a spark in the Spain squad. It was the final group game and, if results didn’t go their way, they could have been eliminated because of their loss to Switzerland in the opening fixture.
Chile were no pushovers either. They also played an attractive brand of football and almost had Spain by the scruff of their necks early on. Right until Villa produced his moment of magic.
When goalkeeper Claudio Bravo came sprinting out of his box to prevent Torres from getting the ball, little did he know that his tackle would see the ball fall to Villa who took his shot first time from more than 40 yards out to curl it in with his “weaker” left foot.
Villa would then score against Portugal in a 1-0 win in the Round of 16 to end their Iberian neighbours’ hopes. He would also score in the quarter-final against Paraguay - again a 1-0 win. He would then keep Manuel Neuer busy on a set-piece in the semi-final so Carles Puyol could score the only goal in another 1-0 win against Germany.
All of Villa’s goals were crucial in Spain advancing to every round in that tournament. Most goalscorers in World Cups pad their numbers with goals against weaker opposition in predictable routs but Villa’s goals meant so much more.
Be it the Euros or the World Cup, Villa was one of La Roja’s most important players in a squad overflowing with talent. So people did scratch their heads when he was benched in favour of Diego Costa for the 2014 edition - a player that did not suit really Spain’s style of play at the time.
By the time Villa got his opportunity, Spain were already out. He still managed to score against Australia in the final group game - his ninth goal in World Cups.
One would say it was his final goal for Spain but the veteran is yet to hang up his boots. In fact, he even made an appearance in a friendly match this season for Spain. Whether he really gets picked for the World Cup by coach Julen Lopetegui or not is debatable, but he did score the 400th goal of his career last week.
However, he will go down in history as one of Europe’s greatest strikers and a true Spanish legend. It is why he is on our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk
