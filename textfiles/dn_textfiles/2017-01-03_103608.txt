Sad  sojourn  in the  Promised Land

Professional negligence is a bane to the society. Lack of proper care and attention and careless behaviour of the professionals of a country can cause calamitous situations. The electronic and print media are heavily laden with news of such situations almost on daily basis. Medical negligence tops them all. Drivers seem to have become street monsters. The inferior building materials entrap the engineers and other workers in the worksite hazards. The victims have to seek help at the court at great expense with the help of a legal eagle. The clerical system of the country keeps the innocent public in never-ending queues. The health workers are no exception. The road workers are also added to this list of culprits. The nurses sometimes are made scapegoats for physicians’ negligence. The general public has to bear the brunt.
The writer’s concern here is not any category of the public servants in the aforementioned list, but the noble profession of teaching. In the case of negligence, teaching is a silent killer. It all started when the government service succumbed to political meddling. The old generation of genuine politicians died a natural death and all kinds of miscreants took the reins of public administration. Almost all the departments and public institutions came under the direct political influence and the deterioration of the public service began. The worst types of miscreants crept into the yet noble profession of teaching and the pristine glory faded away. The half-baked politicians had a free hand of giving teaching appointments to their henchmen without having an iota of foresight and the profession destined to be doomed.
It seems a Herculean task for the incumbent minister of education to take the profession out of the treacherous bog of deterioration due to miscellaneous obstacles and bureaucratic blunders of the hierarchy. To make the situation worse, professional negligence of the teachers is raising its ugly head again in an unprecedented manner.
Lukewarm attitude of present generation
This gloomy situation could be attributed to the lukewarm attitude of the present generation to the profession. Most of the teachers seem to have forgotten the noble parametres in which they have to perform their duties. The good image of the teacher that was maintained by the teacher of the yesteryear has been eroded irreparably by the unbecoming miscreants into the professions. The constantly volatile situation of the country in every sphere of public life make the circumstances worse for the teacher to perform his divine duty to the nation. The teacher is said to have been burdened with a heavy workload that he finds it difficult to shoulder. The routine bungling of some teachers invites a bad name to the whole lot. Arrears of their salaries, long distance travelling, family burdens, social obligations,
Career advancement difficulties, political pressure at the grass root –level, and heterogeneous factors contribute to the frustration of the teachers. Thus the teacher’s emotional wellbeing is unbalanced. The writer’s experience in the Maldives as a teacher compels him to mention here our counterparts there enjoy better working conditions and are in good spirits. The system there does not allow the teacher to neglect their duty. In juxtaposition, our teachers suffer a lot here, very poignantly indeed. It is the teacher who is duty-bound to mould the character of the tender child. Yet the character of some teachers is not worthy to be followed by children. Once the writer listened to a Buddhist sermon over the radio and learned a few lines that could be emulated by our teachers for the good of both teachers and students alike. They are as follows:
‘Wealth is lost, nothing is lost
Health is lost, something is lost
Character is lost, everything is lost.’
The writer earnestly hopes that these lines would bring some insight to the teacher if they would read them. Very ironically, today’s teacher is not in the habit of reading the newspaper, but wasting most of the time in gossiping and the male teachers having a fag at the school canteen and arguing on unworthy political matters to show off their wisdom to others like ZIMRIS. The vigilant child with a vacant mind observes all these behaviour patterns of the teachers very keenly, lo and behold! This ongoing situation in the sacred precincts of the school is the ugliest in the school system. The professional negligence of not being a role model teacher is very hazardous to the whole country as a whole in the long run.
Teacher’s wrong behaviour
This risk has to be arrested at the earliest before this noble profession further being eroded.
The evaluation procedure of the school system has to be necessarily redesigned and come under strict supervision for further improvement. The writer has many a time witnessed very wrong allocation of marks to the students on favouritism posing a direct challenge to the gifted child. It is an indelible scar in the school system passing down from generation to generation. Negligence on the part of the teacher in this regard would earn the wrath and curse of both the student community and the parent. Another matter of great importance is that some teachers are not up to the required standard to teach the subjects that are assigned to them.
Teaching English literature in schools deserves the attention of the authorities. Most of the teachers seem to not having the knowledge of the subject matter. Some teachers do grave crimes against the writers by interpreting their lines in poetry very wrongly. They not knowledgeable enough to expand on the hard titles anthologized in their syllabus and make laughable mistakes ruining the interest of the students. They fail at the examinations and the best part is that educational authority finds fault with the teachers without guiding them on the correct track. Due to lack of wide reading and experience in handling classical literature, the student suffers at the receiving end. Some of the veteran teachers even do not know the use of ‘toward/towards’ ‘specially/especially’ ‘many/many a’ thus the students are penalised. In some cases, the students are far ahead of the teachers as the ‘proverbial ‘The schoolmaster is abroad’ tells us. Teachers, beware the writer repeats the same in capital letters in order to put you on a good pedestal to do a better job this year. Your negligence in this regard would further erode the good name you have established in the mind of the learner.
Professionalism in teaching ought to be at the helm. In this light, even the slightest blunder a teacher would do would be followed by the learner to the letter. There is a strong possibility that a child is irreparably wrecked owing to the drastic effects of a teacher’s wrong behaviour.
Ruin dignity of the learners
The diction used by some teachers in anger is quite inappropriate and has to be condemned in toto. They often use the names of animals to address the children. They take up the lineage of the children and ruin the dignity of the learners. A doctor’s negligence would kill a man, yet the gravity of the situation regarding that of the teacher is, this is killing in silence.
“Wounds by words cannot be healed”
It is expected at the school level, a punishment ought to be a deterrent. Yet, most of the members of the teaching fraternity take it as a privilege. In some teachers, it is a satisfaction of a sadistic desire. Miss Havisham comes to my mind. In Charles Dickens’ gallery of immortal characters, there is a woman by that name who kept a beautiful girl by the name Estella to break the hearts of the boys in order to revenge from men. In the tapestry of English literature, she is the most sadistic woman character for us to cite an example. In my forty–four-year teaching career here and abroad I have observed some Havishams in angelic resemblance. The writer is in a strong view that severe punishment should come to a dead halt, yet a well-planned corrective method at the national level seems indispensable. Development of the affective domain with the cognitive skills of the child would minimise student violence, thus professional negligence in teaching would fade away to a certain extent.
There is so much to ponder on
“Spare the rod and spoil the child”.
Ultra active intelligence of the learners could be exploited to arrest their casual heartlessness. Ultimately their childhood pranks would be lesser. It would be a soothing balm to the school system and professionalism of the teacher would remain positive.
Luke warm attitude of the teacher towards professional ethics seems to be another stumbling block to arrest the downward trend of professional erosion in teaching. The teacher is a prominent agent of social change. The teacher is duty bound to envelop the child in a spiritual enclosure until he or she is under his or her guardianship.
It is an unavoidable professional obligation. To minimise professional negligence, a teacher should essentially adhere to it. When the child puts the best foot forward to school this year, the school should become his second home; the feeling of a home away from could be a good maxim. Annihilation of professional negligence in the sphere of teaching could propel the island nation towards the Promised Land.
