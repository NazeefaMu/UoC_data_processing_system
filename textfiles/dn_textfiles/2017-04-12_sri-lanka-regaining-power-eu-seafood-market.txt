Sri Lanka regaining power in EU seafood market

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the government is set on a path of pursuing its former position in the EU fish market.
“We had the power of being able to determine fish prices in the EU market, which we have lost to Maldives on account of the EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports,” the minister said.
The European Commission imposed a ban on Sri Lankan seafood exports in 2014 stating for failing to make credible progress towards fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The ban lasted for 15 months until EU lifted it in June 2016 following intervention by the leadership of the present government. Amaraweera said, the ban now being lifted, they are determined to take back its former place in the EU. Sri Lanka was the second biggest fish exporter to the European Union.
“We are going to regain the power we once had over pricing of fish in the EU market from Maldives within the next two to three years,” Amaraweera said.
