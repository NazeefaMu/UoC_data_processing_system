Parachuters injured during air show

Several parachuters from the Army, including a woman, were injured and hospitalized after landing onto trees due to strong winds, during an air show at the Mahaweli Sports Festival in Embilipitiya, recently.
According to the police, the soldiers were admitted to the Embilipitiya District Hospital and the female parachuter was transferred to the Ampara Hospital due to her condition.
It was reported that the parachuters had jumped out of a plane when it was flying nearly 12,000 feet above the ground. Due to powerful winds, some parachuters, including the woman, had landed in Kadurugasara in Moraketiya, which was several hundred yards away from their destination.
Other parachuters in the group had been able to land properly.
