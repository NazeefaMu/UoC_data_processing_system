Director of film on Sri Lankan journalist moves High Court

A Bangalore-based film director has moved the Madras High Court, challenging the order of Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, refusing certification to ‘Porkalathil Oru Poo’, a Tamil film based on the life of LTTE journalist Isaipriya.

Director K. Ganeshan submitted that he directed the film based on the telecast made by London-based Channel – 4 on the war between the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE.
“I came to know about the Tamil News Reader Isaipriya through the telecast and I thought I could direct a Tamil film based on her real life,” Mr. Ganesan said. “I completed the production of the film in May 2015. By that time, the Tamil Nadu government adopted a resolution for an impartial, international and independent probe into the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, the petitioner added.

“The resolution was moved by Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa. Since it reflected the stand of the State government on the Sri Lankan issue, I wanted to include the video of passing of the resolution by the Chief Minister in my film,” Mr. Ganesan said.

On May 6, the petitioner applied to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Chennai, for certification, which was rejected on the ground that the film is against friendly relation with a foreign State, contending that it carried scenes degrading women. (The Hindu)
