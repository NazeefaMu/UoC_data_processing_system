Attempt to abduct child thwarted

Residents in the Kurunegala area had foiled an attempt to abduct a pre-school child returning home with her grandmother after school. The 3 ½ year old child is living under the custody of her father, in the Wilgodawatte area in Kurunegala.
According to CCTV footage recorded on a nearby camera, the child was returning home with her grandmother when an unidentified man had tried to grab the child, but as he had tripped, bystanders were able to rescue the child.
According to the father of the child, although a complaint had been lodged with the police regarding the abduction, he claims no action had been taken to arrest the suspects, despite CCTV footage.
It is believed that the abduction is based on a family dispute. The police media unit said investigations are being conducted by the Police Crimes Division and those responsible were asked to surrender or face arrest.
