Congratulating the finalists, Chief Guest Chief Operating Officer of MAS HQ Shirendra Lawrence said that, “Mastering the English language is of utmost importance to be able to communicate effectively and meaningfully be it at the work place or with the world at large. Whilst we are now comfortably moving into the digital era to cater to the change in trends, the next generation is fast becoming more reliant on social media as a convenient form of communication versus the conventional form better known to us as unaided cognitive thinking, and expressing one’s self effectively.”
The Chairman of the Panel of Judges Attorney-at-law Mohamed Adamally who said, “With the spread of technology and the emergence of “short messages”, unfortunately we see a growing culture of abbreviation, a perversion of grammar and a breakdown of phrasing, which is now, sometimes subconsciously, beginning to pervade oral communications as well.”
The panel of judges comprised Founder and Chief Trustee of the Foundation of Goodness Kushil Gunasekera, Head of Sustainable Development, Communication and External Affairs of Siam City Cement Farzana Khan, Communications and Media Consultant Savithri Rodrigo and Head of Marketing and Communications of HSBC Tharanga Gunasekara.
