TUs praise Ports Minister

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe is the only minister who had been attentive to the demands of the port employees, aside from former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali, Suhada Port Workers’ Union Chairman Lal Bangamuwage said.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that Ports and Shipping Minister had already presented solutions to the issues of the ports employees, including extending the retirement age of the employees up to 60 years.
Bangamuwage added that the minister had taken a decision not to privatise the eastern terminal of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), while the recruiting procedure of the employees to the port authority would be amended, as it was required by the ports employees.
He said, the measures would be taken to reactivate the ‘Piya Puthu Foundation’ in recruitments to the SLPA.
The Chairman further said, there is a shortage of over 300 trained labourers at SLPA and the minister had been notified about it. “The parties who contributed to the sale of the Hambantota Port complain the Government for selling it, while the Government at least acquired 30 percent of the ownership of the Hambantota Port,” Bangamuwage added.
All Ceylon Harbour and Dock Trade Union Secretary D. A. B. Ajith also participated.
