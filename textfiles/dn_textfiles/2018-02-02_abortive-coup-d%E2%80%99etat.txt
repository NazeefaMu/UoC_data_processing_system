Abortive Coup d’etat

Many perceived the botched attempt as a last ditch effort by the military elite to safeguard their eroding position. Rapid Sinhalisation of all facets of the government and paying scant respect to the aspirations of other ethnic groups also contributed to the campaign led by N.Q. Dias, the Defence Secretary, who championed the ‘Sinhala-Buddhist’ cause and Minister, Felix Dias Bandaranaike’s speech in support of an authoritarian system of government.
It was exactly 56 years ago that a conspiracy by military and police high-ups along with a senior civil servant, propelled by an overriding feeling of loss of power and the status that they enjoyed planned to take over the administration from a democratically elected government saying that the politicians were ruining the country through maladministration. The coup, code named, ‘Operation Holdfast’ was expected to be accomplished within a few hours.
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who continued her slain husband’s language and socialist policies they thought as inexperienced, weak, and unfit to govern, and therefore should be replaced. According to strategy, she was to be arrested on her return from Kataragama on the night of 27th.
As per blueprint, at 10 p.m. senior DIG, C.C. Dissanayake was to issue a “Take post” order. Seizure of Colombo city and cordoning it off was deemed important to resist a potential counter-strike. Ex- DIG, Sydney de Zoysa co-ordinating Army and Police operations from field force HQs, Col. Maurice de Mel at Army headquarters; Col. F.C. de Saram was to position himself at “Temple Trees” with Dissanayake at “Queen’s House.” ASP Johnpillai will clear strategically important highways, all main roads of traffic, while Douglas Liyanage, played a silent role. Officials, N.Q. Dias, DIG- S.A. Dissanayake (Jingle) who was twin brother of C.C. Dissanayake (Jungle), Senior ministers including Felix Dias Bandaranaike, acting Navy chief and the SP- John Attygalle were to be arrested and dispatched to an underground bunker at the armoury. A junta of coup leaders was to run the show in the first phase and the second a council of ex-Prime Ministers coup leaders and the G-G and ‘back to democracy’ under a new constitution?
Telegraph Exchange and the CTO was to be shut down; Police headquarters, Lake House, Times, and the only electronic communication institute, “Radio Ceylon” were to be seized by 11 p.m.
Acting Navy commander Kadirgamar, Army commander Maj-Gen. Wijeykoon, Air Force chief, Barker and IGP Abeykoon were entirely in the dark about the conspiracy. On successful accomplishment of the coup the leaders would meet G-G and request for the suspension of the constitution and take direct authority. This original plan went awry with cancellation in Sirimavo’s itinerary. The conspirators feared that she had come to know of the coup. As a contingency Lt. Col Willie Abraham was moved into “Temple Trees”.
It was on January 27, during their regular morning walks on Galle Face that Dissanayake uncovered the idea to his subordinate, Stanley Senanayake SP, inviting him to join. However, Senanayake remained non-committal and that afternoon he declined the offer. Realizing that he had misapprehended Senanayake, he kept mulling over. There were reservations among the core members comprising the De Mel brothers, De Saram, De Zoysa and Dissanayake about the viability of going ahead as designed. Stanley Senanayake wrestling with his morals for hours told his wife Maya, daughter of P. de S. Kularatne, who was a Parliamentarian, about the intended conspiracy. She spoke to her father around 6 p.m. and Kularatne informed the IGP and Felix Dias Bandaranaike of the scheme, who immediately got into counter action.
The conspirators sensed Senanayake spilling the beans, had met around 9 p.m. and decided to give up the plan. By mid night, except for De Saram, the rest were apprehended. After a prolonged trial 11 out of 24 were found guilty, but later discharged by the Privy Council in UK, on a technical point.
Sir John Kotelawala and Dudley Senanayake 
In a statement to Parliament on February 13, Felix Dias Bandaranaike revealed that a police officer in his statement had said about the involvement of Sir John Kotelawala and Dudley Senanayake. Dudley promptly and vehemently denied any involvement and volunteered to face an inquiry. Not only UNPers, some government Parliamentarians too pooh-poohed it as a fabrication by Felix. Journalist H. Ludowyk, addressed a manuscript named ‘The story of a coup d’e-tat’ to J.R. Jayewardene (Mss –321 JRJ Centre) states that, ‘Felix himself an interested party,. . unethically using judicial powers, investigated suspects in secret. . . , wrongfully detained, and ill-treated to destroy their integrity and morale for the purpose of extorting confessions of guilt.’
The Criminal Law Special Provisions Act no. 1 of 1962 with Draconian provisions was passed with retrospective effect introducing a Trial-at-bar with three SC judges. It also made provisions for accepting a statement by a suspect as valid evidence against any of the suspects indicted. However, JR., responding to interviews by Professor K. M. de Silva, the author of his biography, stated, that at a meeting with Sir John on April 13, 1966, he learnt from the latter that both Sir John and Dudley had been involved in the planned attempt. He further says,
‘Yet we have uncovered very solid evidence of his involvement in the coup. Was he driven by a personal animosity against Sirimavo so deep-rooted that he would countenance any measures to bring down her government? Or was it that, in his view, the government incompetent in handling the country’s affairs. …. .damaged the economy, relations between Sinhalese and minorities, that he would encourage a coup once he came to know that it was being planned? Or did he believe that Felix Dias was planning a coup of his own in association of men like N. Q. Dias, and that he would look upon this military coup as a genuine counter-coup, a very necessary measure of preventive action? He carried this secret with him to the grave and so we will never know.’ --The JRJ biography (vol. ii- page 114):
JR Jayewardene’s role 
Sir Oliver’s reputation suffered with his removal from office as G-G a month later. JR told Esmond Wickremesinghe Lake House boss, [PM’s father] and JR’s political ally, who influenced Sir John to make a written statement on January 11, 1968. (Copy preserved at the J.R. Jayewardene Centre). The two professors, who interviewed Sir John on September 15, 1979, write (page 116, vol ii) ‘He explained how the coup leaders had met him . . . far from discouraging them, asked them to be extremely cautious in what they were doing. . . . and told them to get the support of Dudley and Sir Oliver,. . . he stated that the meeting to finalize the coup took place at Kitulwatta stores, an abandoned plumbago store house in Borella, owned by him and the next at his Kandawala residence, on January 26, both chaired by Dudley’.
The author professor, in 1979, spoke to coup leaders F. C. de Saram, D. Liyanage and Royce de Mel for interviews, who declined, but after Horowitz’s book, ‘Coup Theories and Officer Motives’, that included interviews by most of them, de Mel, [who was made Chairman of Shipping Corporation by JR] divulged his knowledge of Sir John’s and Dudley’s alleged roles. Explaining his meetings with both at the plumbago go-down in Borella and at Kandawala, he said, Dudley was billed to address the ‘Junta’ shortly after midnight on January 27, at the Independence Hall, Torrington Square, after the success of the coup. A smart, but pitiable mud-slinging attempt or a ‘conspiracy within a conspiracy’ instigated by Jayewardenes and Kotalawalas on Senanaykes.
