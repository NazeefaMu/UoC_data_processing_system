HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED

The Meteorology Department predicts heavy rain falls (about 150 mm) today at some places in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Western provinces and in the Anuradhapura, Puttalam, Galle and Matara districts.
The department issued a weather advisory for heavy rains until Wednesday due to the low level atmospheric disturbance forming in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
“Showers or thundershowers will occur over most provinces of the island after 2.00 p.m. Heavy falls (above 100 mm) can be expected at some places. The possibility of heavy falls is high in the central hills,” it stated. The National Building Research Organization issued a landslide early warning yesterday for Rathnapura District (Rathnapura DS - Durekkanda, Galaboda, Hapugasthenne, Amunuthenna, Bambarabotuwa and Alupola), Kandy District (Medadumbara, Udadumbara, Ganga Ihala Korale DS), Matale District (Yatawatta DS) and Nuwara Eliya District (Kothmale, Ambagamuwa DS).
The highest rainfall of 118.4 mm for the 24 hours ending at 12 noon yesterday was recorded from Guruluwana in Ratnapura.
