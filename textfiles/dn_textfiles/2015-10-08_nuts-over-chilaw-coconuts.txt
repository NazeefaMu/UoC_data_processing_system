Nuts over Chilaw Coconuts

The coconut is considered the heart of the Sri Lankan kitchen and to experience its many mystical and magical benefits head to Chilaw Adammana and Bolawatta coconut plantation estates, two places rich in traditions.
Wedding traditions
On the marriage day of Gail, a local coconut plantation daughter's wedding, a doorway was decorated of jasmine flowers. The coconut flowers are kept in a terracotta pot (kalaya) which is also called the punkalasa to symbolise prosperity and coconut palm leaves were used for the roofing. The symbolism been the husband enters through the doorway to take away the bride away known as Kandanyama. A coconut is broken with a manne (knife) and depending on how it splits will be an indicator of their future destiny together.
Gail and Kavinda's sliced perfectly in half splashing water in all directions as the coconut palms rustled in the wind and the holy water was poured over the couples fingers tied together with a string, binding them together in a future wheel of life to Bolawatta. Here, palm trees grow between 50 to 80 feet high, and tree houses are being created similar to the ones found in Africa. Interestingly this is where the humble palm came from in the first place.
Dragon Fruit Cook
Coconut is the islands lifeblood and the reason in Sri Lanka that everyone drinks coconut daily for its refreshing rehydrating water. Every bit of the coconut palm is used from its husk for coir rope to tropical style housing and even when only the shell is left they are burnt as charcoals to get rid of the mosquitoes. Here in the land of coconuts the dragon fruit cook Laura Judith teaches Plantation style Sri Lankan cooking with coconut and spices. This also includes grating the fresh flesh of the coconut for village style pol sambols and will tell you all as you cook the importance of drying the copra in the hot sun to yield the coconut oil.
After making a range of dishes you will get to feast on this magnificent homemade village banquet using local fish still wriggling as you buy it from the beach Karukkupane. Dragon fruits husband is a farmer over 40 years known fondly as Sarath, who will join the groups and talk about the many ways these trees with huge feather -shaped 18 foot leaves produce nuts the size of rugby balls that village kids will often use if there is nothing else around to play with.
On a walk around the estate with him, you will learn how coconut oil is used to make soaps, margarine and confectionary like pol toffee. The fibre or coir is woven into ropes and mats using the leaves twisting from one direction to the other by the local villagers, who also hand make brushes, furniture, stuffing, handmade coconut shell buttons and even beautifully carved jewellery from the polished shells. The branch wood has been used for over a century for building village ambalamas resting spots for the weary traveller, festival huts and quirky furniture. Even cattle yokes are made from this incredibly diverse and useful tree.

Sarath knows a lot about working with cattle having spent much of his working life as the Ambewela Dairy Farms manager. He is a visionary man with a dream to put farming and Chilaw on the traveller's map with his naughty goats, cows, chickens and ducks. To find out the secrets of the medicinal benefits of the coconut oils, you can combine doing a cooking class with going on a curated walk that will show you the grass roots other medicinal plants in the area that for centuries have made Sri Lanka the healthiest country in Asia.
Crazy brood
Sarath has finally persuaded his crazy brood that includes a DJ, IT expert daughter from Colombo, Marketing guru and film maker son-in-law to join him in an enterprise to give the coconut the same positioning as tea and cinnamon.


Tying the knot
This is a family full of stories and love of life, the very essence of a Sri Lankan family representing both its colonial Dutch past and its Singhalese Tamil re-unified future.
A family whose estate has passed down through a generations along with traditions such as on the wedding day coconuts are integral to the ceremonial part of the procedures. Something you will feel from the moment you enter this coconut plantation paradise.
