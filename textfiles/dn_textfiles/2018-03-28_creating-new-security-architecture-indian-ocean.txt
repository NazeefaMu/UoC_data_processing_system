Creating new security architecture for  Indian Ocean

Transportation systems play a key role in a country’s economic well-being, development and prosperity. As more and more countries develop to be middle income countries in South Asia and BIMSTEC regions, they will need to produce and trade more. Incidentally, the Indian Ocean is becoming the key ocean together with the Pacific Ocean in the 21st century, which is also referred to as ‘Asian Century’.
These views were expressed by Director of the Pathfinder Foundation’s Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives and Center for the Law of the Sea, Dr. Jayanath Colombage in India recently.
Following is an an extract from his presentation.
The unprecedented rise of economic power of China and rapid growth of India are two key factors impacting the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean now account for 70% oil, 50% containers and 35% bulk cargo of the world. This ocean is also called the ‘Energy super highway of the world. As the countries develop, their energy requirement also grows and these now become net-importers of energy. The Persian Gulf, a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean, is the world’s main oil producing region. Many developed and developing countries are deeply concerned about ‘energy security’ in the Indian Ocean.

The Bay of Bengal connects the Indian Ocean with the Western Pacific Ocean. This is relatively a peaceful ocean region with no maritime boundary disputes. Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are located in a vital triangle covering the entire Bay of Bengal region. Sri Lanka has the unique advantage as the connector to the Western Indian Ocean. Maritime commerce has been a cornerstone of the history of these three countries that are members of the BIMSTEC as well. People of these three countries have been seafarers and travelers since ancient times. They have also welcomed foreigners to trade, learn and explore. The three countries have been well-connected across the Bay of Bengal long before the arrival of colonial powers and colonized the region. They have traded in spices, Elephants, Jute products, Timber and there were plenty of raw materials available for building and repair of wooden hulled sailing ships.
The seaborne trade in the Indian Ocean underwent many changes with the advent of European colonial powers. The Portuguese in the 16th century, and subsequently the Dutch, to French and finally the British dominated seaborne commerce in the Indian Ocean.
Sustainable Transport
As per the United Nations high level advisory group on sustainable transport, sustainable Transport is defined as “provision of services and infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods advancing economic and social development to benefit today’s and future generations in a manner that is safe, affordable, accessible and efficient and resilient while minimizing carbon emissions and environmental impacts. Transport is a key development issue in many countries and a major driving force behind a growing demand for energy. Transport and mobility are vital for sustainable development. Without sustainable transport, there will be no lasting progress on climate action and hence Sustainable Development Goals.

Belt and Road Initiative, is a planned transport network of overland road and rail routes, oil and natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure projects that will stretch from Xian in central China, through central Asia, and ultimately reach Moscow, Rotterdam and Venice. BRI covers 63% of global population and 29% of the global economy. Hence, emphasis must be put on the sustainable use of transport in this initiative, which should include Equity, Efficiency, Safety and Climate responsiveness.
Shipping can be considered a least carbon emitting mode of mass transport. Ships are becoming more energy efficient and less polluting with better emission controls. We also witness that mega container lines merging and bigger and bigger ships entering the service. This will be the new trend in shipping and we need to be prepared for it.
Sri Lanka and Port of Colombo
The Port of Colombo has been a ‘must stop’ destination connecting the shippers of west and east. This port has become the South Asia’s main hub port. World’s top 20 shipping lines call on port of Colombo and play a huge role in Global trade taking as 87% of global shipping is handled by these. This is a huge advantage for the port of Colombo. As per the world shipping council ranking, amongst the top fifty ports in the world, Shanghai rank as number one whilst Singapore is at number two. Jabel Ali in Dubai is at number nine and Port Klang in Malaysia at number twelve. The Port of Colombo rank number twenty-eight and JNU, India is at thirty-four. This is a clear indication that the Port of Colombo is the life line of South Asia and part of BIMSTEC region. As these regions are developing fast, hub ports will have to play an increasingly important role. Some of the advantages for the port of Colombo are, the centralized location in the Indian Ocean; halfway in the Singapore-Rotterdam 10000 nautical miles trade route, Highly competitive logistic costs, strong and continuous air connectivity and reliable and efficient telecom and IT connectivity.
The Colombo port city or Colombo International Financial Center (CIFC), which is under construction on a 236 hectares land being reclaimed adjacent to the Port of Colombo to be a special zone along the line of Dubai’s’ International Financial Center. This is the biggest FDI project in Sri Lanka.
It was started at an initial cost of US$ 1.51 billion and will rise to US$ 8.29 billion when it is completed. Financial backing and development is provided by the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC) and China has asked India to participate in order to alleviate strategic concerns. This offshore project aims to attract more than US$12.8 billion from investors, banks, hotels and malls. This project too will benefit maritime connectivity across the Indian Ocean.
Two major components of the shipping industry are ships and cargo. Ports and Terminals and other maritime services come next. Shipping agency and freight forwarding are minor component of shipping industry but are considered major components in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka neither has a large shipping fleet nor a large volume of local import and export cargo to boost a shipping industry by any standard. Sri Lanka, however, has a sizable maritime industry with ports and terminals as the primary part of the maritime industry. This currently thrive on transshipment cargo.
Hence, re-structing of the shipping industry is necessary to promote ease of doing business, to remove non-applicable regulations, and clear archaic regulations with current industry needs. Further liberalization of the shipping industry is needed with a view to attract large ships owners or operators to set office here like in Hongkong or Singapore. Sri Lankan ship registry must be made attractive for such ships to register under the flag of convenience or flag of opportunity. Port of Colombo presently handle about 70% of transshipment containers from India.
Port of Trincomalee, which is a huge deep natural harbour in the region, should be developed to cater to enhancing connectivity in the Bay of Bengal region. The coastal trade between ports in eastern coast of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar should be enhanced to improve trade connectivity.
Trincomalee can also be used as a sea port for land locked Nepal. Trincomalee can be the petro-chemical hub of the region with the availability of 98 large tanks built by the British and largely unused since their departure. Ports of Trincomalee and northern parts can be linked to the Sagarmala project of India to enhance maritime trade connectivity.
The Port of Hambanthota, which is now run by a joint venture between Sri Lanka ports Authority and China Merchant Port Holding Company, can play a crucial role in the BRI or AAGC.
Lanka and Bangladesh Maritime Connectivity
Exports of textiles and garments will be the principal source of foreign exchange earnings for Bangladesh. To be competitive in the apparel industry, Bangladesh will have to look for more cost effective and time efficient transportation methods. Transshipment efficiency and flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea would be vital to remaining competitive in this dynamic industry.
Colombo and Hambantota would be preferred transshipment ports for Bangladesh exporters due to a few factors.
As the Apparel Industry relies on speed-to-market, savings in transit time will have a significant impact on the supply chain. For example, shipping cargo westbound from Bangladesh via Singapore would involve at least four days of sailing from Bangladesh to Singapore and a further four days of sailing from Singapore to cross Sri Lanka.
However, shipping the same cargo via Colombo would instantaneously reduce four days of sailing time since it only takes four days to get to Colombo from Bangladesh. This would also reduce the carbon footprint which can appeal to eco-friendly customers in the west. Both Colombo and Hambantota can provide flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea due to the proximity of the airport to the seaport. Bangladesh exporters will also have the opportunity of consolidating cargo in the South Asian region which will provide consolidation benefits to both the shipper and the consignee.
Myanmar and Bay of Bengal Connectivity
Myanmar’s’ economy is growing. Growth is supported by investor optimism following policy reforms, the reinstatement of Myanmar in the EU Generalized System of Preference (GSP) for duty free and quota free market access, and gradual easing of restrictions on financial institutions. Myanmar is changing from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented system.
The IMP predicts that Myanmar’s GDP would quadruple by 2030. Country’s urban population is expected to double in the same period.
China and Singapore have invested heavily in Myanmar. China constructed a deep-sea port in Kyaukphyu and a pipeline from Kyaukphyu to Kunming in the Yunnan province. This pipeline can transfer roughly 400,000 barrels of oil per day. China has drilled seven gas blocks since 2007 and is building a rail line to connect the two countries. Singapore’s investment was aimed at bringing Myanmar closer to the level of ASEAN countries.
China has all along maintained warm economic links with Myanmar, even allowing Myanmar’s government to overcome western economic sanctions. India too, keeping in mind geopolitical realities, has close political and international links with the Myanmar government to gain maritime access to its land locked north-eastern states and to fight against terrorism.
India developed a port in Sittwe, situated at the mouth of Kaladan river to accommodate ships with displacement of up to 20,000 tons to dock.
This project was handed over to Mynamar and expected to be fully operational by 2019 with inland waterway links to Peletwa in Myanmar’s Chin state and Mizoram in India.
In the process of Sri Lanka’s enhancing economic engagement with Asian neighbours, Myanmar can play an important role. The two countries have an added advantage being majority Buddhist countries. Imports and exports between the two countries have great potential to improve for the sake of mutual benefit. Sri Lanka needs to identify what to import and what to export.
The two countries can even think of a FTA. Myanmar can be a big source of cheap staple food such as rice and onions. Bangladesh and India import these commodities from Myanmar.It will be a very economic proposition. Myanmar is a member of ASEAN and AFTA and that could be exploited to then benefit of Sri Lanka. Both are members of the BIMSTEC as well.
Conclusion
South Asia was overshadowed by the rapid growth of world trade integration of national economies. Strategic competition among the major powers in the Indian ocean region is hampering the economic progress of countries in the region. Maritime security due to state rivalry and presence of non-state actors is a great vulnerability in the region. There is a risk of Cyber-attacks against ports and facilities as well.
There is a need for a new regional security architecture or a Code of Conduct to ensure that collaborative efforts are taken by the states in the region and outside players. A rule based maritime order and a peaceful environment are essential for the region to flourish. Trade and investment, transport, energy, tourism are some of the key areas in which collaboration is possible. In a highly competitive world economy, transport cost is a significant determinant of competitiveness.
An integrated and efficient environment is an essential element for economic integration at any level. Countries should work together to address the issues of tariff barriers, customs regulations, out dated and restrictive and discriminatory shipping laws and documentation process to ensure that maritime trade continues freely and efficiently.
