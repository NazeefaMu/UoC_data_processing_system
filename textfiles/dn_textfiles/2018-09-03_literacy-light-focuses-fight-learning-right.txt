Literacy light focuses on fight for learning right!

International Literacy Day (ILD) will be celebrated on Saturday week, September 8 around the world . Its theme this year reads ‘Literacy and skills development’. Despite progress made, literacy challenges persist and at the same time the demands for skills required for work, evolve rapidly.
Literacy is probably the single-most important part of education. Without literacy, all other learning is impossible. Literacy involves using reading, writing, speaking, listening, and viewing to gain more knowledge.
Without the ability to learn any of these skills, there is absolutely no way to acquire more knowledge. Literacy is essential for learning. It is crucial that language arts teachers are not the only ones in the school stressing the importance of literacy. While the language arts teachers may be the only ones truly teaching literacy, it is the job of all educators to facilitate literacy learning. Literacy must come before any other learning can occur, and we cannot grow as a society without literacy.
This year, ILD explores and highlights integrated approaches that simultaneously can support the development of literacy and skills, to ultimately improve people’s life and work and contribute to equitable and sustainable societies.
The purpose of this observational day is not only to combat illiteracy but also to promote literacy as a tool that could empower individuals as well as whole communities. It is from these humble beginnings that International Literacy Day has bloomed into a tool that could help millions of people around the globe.
International Literacy Day serves to recognize the importance of literacy and acknowledge the need to create a globally literate community. Literacy refers to a person's ability to read or write, an ability that connects and empowers people, allowing them to communicate and interact with the world, and one that the United Nations considers to be a basic human right.
Today, approximately 16 percent of the world's population, two-thirds of which is female, is unable to read or write at a basic level in their native languages. Illiteracy in nearly all parts of the world has been linked to socio-economic issues such as poverty and demographic factors such as gender. As of 2016, about 775 million adults lack even the most basic, minimum literacy skills all over the world. Today one in five adults lack minimum literacy skills, with two-thirds of them being women. Some 67.4 million children throughout the world are not enrolled in school and miss out on basic fundamentals of education.
However, thanks to the efforts of UNESCO and World Literacy Day, more and more people are becoming literate and about 4 billion people are currently literate, as of now.
UNESCO states the importance of literacy on their website: “Literacy is a human right, a tool of personal empowerment and a means for social and human development. Educational opportunities depend on literacy. Literacy is at the heart of basic education for all, and essential for eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender equality and ensuring sustainable development, peace and democracy. “A good quality basic education equips pupils with literacy skills for life and further learning; literate parents are more likely to send their children to school. Also literate people are better able to access continuing educational opportunities and literate societies are better geared to meet pressing development .”
Literacy is the light that guides us all. In the simplest terms literacy can be defined as the ability of an individual to read and write in any language. It is extremely important for an individual to be literate in order to carry out a smooth livelihood and considering this in order to spread awareness about importance of education as well as literacy.
On this day every country prepares and carries out different kinds of expeditions and indulges in different kinds of international literacy day activities. The main motive of the world literacy day is to draw the attention of the individuals of different societies and communities of the world towards the importance of the literacy. The day mainly emphasizes the importance of literacy as well as the adult education to the people all over the globe. A lot of people today can’t read or write their name and the reason behind this is illiteracy. Most of the countries of the world have an extremely low literacy rate despite the fact that world international literacy day has been commemorated every year.
Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen in a way that lets us communicate effectively and make sense of the world. Lacking vital literacy skills holds a person back at every stage of their life. As a child they won't be able to succeed at school, as a young adult they will be locked out of the job market and as a parent they won't be able to support their own child's learning. This intergenerational cycle makes social mobility and a fairer society more difficult.
People with low literacy skills may not be able to read a book or newspaper, understand road signs or price labels, make sense of a bus or train timetable, fill out a form, read instructions on medicines or use the internet.
There is no doubt that literacy is a fundamental tool to achieve success and further career opportunities and on a whole improve the quality of life individual and communities they live in. Having the skills to communicate, read, and write is vital for social and economic development. It allows individuals to expand their knowledge and understanding of society. It also assists people to adjust to their environment.
Literacy is not simply the ability to read and write, but rather the ability to use these skills and communicate effectively. In modern society and our globalised world, literacy is far more diverse that simply reading a book and understanding what we have read.
Having a population with high literacy skills also helps a country as a whole and improves the ability of a nation to tackle different social challenges it faces. Countries with strong literacy skills generally have a better standard of health and outcomes for individuals. Highly literate populations and communities are in a far better position to deal governance in a highly diverse society.
Literacy is a fundamental human right and the basis for any individual’s ability to learn. It is essential for social and human development and provides an individual the skills and empowers them to transform their lives, in turn, an improved standard of health and ability to earn a higher income.
