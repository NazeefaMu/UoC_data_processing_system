Significant history and friends that matter....our code in the middle

History will record and proudly document another fabulous step up for our game in this standout year for rugby in Sri paradise.
Our intrepid journey to the Commonwealth Games, a stark and unforgettable reminder of the world’s best and where we are in this exclusive club. New Zealand blew the magical Fiji power out of the water and claimed the gold with clinical efficiency.
The Blacks denied Fiji good ball and intimidating defence that tested their spontaneous running skills max in the final.
The Olympic champions unable to express themselves freely and rely on those islanders skills that make them untouchable at times.
Survival against South Africa in the extra time semi ...was probably the energy sap that they didn’t need.
Cecil Africa scoring a hat trick of mesmerizing tries that gasped at defending their title.....but not quite enough for the big world final.
The IRB must be grinning from ear to ear, in their big Corp armchairs, as they watch the lucrative numbers for TV viewers bubble up.
Little doubts and mighty compliments to the international Olympic committee for their faith in 7s and grand dimension for this remarkable skill set.
The game is in very good hands and needs islanders like Sri Lanka to really profile up. This is the magical story that has spurred Kenya to stride the world with driving uncontainable power...that makes them top 5 in our world.
What pride for the African continent and a lesson to all who ...like us in Sri ...worship the future with jealous adulation!
Our future is in firm good rugby hands ...but demand that Sri Lanka go wide with the net for natural resources that will make us a force to be counted.
In case the pundits and experts are recoiling in surprise and concern....Sri Lanka used to beat Kenya and Uruguay in 7s ....a testament to islanders natural born talent ...that needs to be genetically re-engineered and circuit linked with max efficiency.
The future for us is not discus and imagine...but to step up and invest big time.
Dreaming beyond our imagination is a grand pathway for us islanders to progress and stimulate that hallowed new dimension.
The future has to be pace strength skill endurance and relentless power.
School rugby is justifiably the most popular sport on this ocean bound island...and not likely to step down anytime soon.
Grab your senses and appreciate the impossible odds that separate the Bradby and places it on that mount of Olympus.
More significant this 2018 is the work ethic and simple efficiency that make Royal such a balanced force in the Singer league.
Trinity need re-thinking and heart to confront the boys in Kandy ...the 1st leg was all Royal and how patient they were for their points.
Opportunities for Trinity were not made easier...by their level of simple mistakes that dominated play for the entire Colombo leg.
For the sake of all fans that embrace this magnificent series that unite Sri Lankan islanders around the world ...we need an aggressive lion at home and silk skills that test Royal and push them in the middle...despite the odds and level of form?
Big hand to Royal coaching format and team led by diligent Lewke. Grand indeed to chalk up their new history and raise that performance bar.
Mesmerizing for Peters, Patana, Joe’s to consider how to match up and raise their skill levels in the middle to challenge the Reid Avenue marauding machine.
Royal have firmly placed one strong hand on that league trophy ...and the Bradby.
Mighty indeed the challenger that contemplates their quest and plans to scale that summit.
All in all ...more magic, more pride and more heart to captivate us to the hilt ...it’s absolutely everything to look forward to and breathing those performance weekends, will raise our mortal consciousness to the best place possible.
All hail island rugby and max respect for our young gladiators to thrill beyond our adoring imaginations.
Bula bula Sri api!
