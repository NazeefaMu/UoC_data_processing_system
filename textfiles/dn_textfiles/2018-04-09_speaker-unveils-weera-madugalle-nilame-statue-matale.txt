Speaker unveils Weera Madugalle Nilame Statue in Matale

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya unveiled the new Weera Madugalle Nilame statue opposite the Matale Library and launched the Madugalle website at the 199th death anniversary commemoration of Weera Madugalle Nilame in Matale recently.
National Heroes including Madugalle Nilame who led the Uva Wellassa Rebellion in 1817 and 1818 were earlier named traitors by the British Colonial regime. President Maithripala Sirisena was instrumental in clearing their names from that stigma and naming them national heroes recently.
The commemorative lecture was delivered by Viraj Balasuriya, Lecturer, Fine Arts University.
In the past, there was a group of citizens with greed for power who betryed the nation for monetary and other gains. It was a pity to see certain sections in the present day society too inclined to betray the nation for political and other petty gains.
It was to dispel such anti-national feelings that the government was speaking about national unity and working towards achieving that, he said.
Jayasuriya said he highly appreciated the steps taken by the President to clear the names of members of the national liberation struggle from the stigma attached by British imperial rulers and name them as national heroes.
He said he also wished to thank the Weera Madugalle National Foundation for organising the fitting commemoration ceremony.
Plantation Industries Deputy Minister Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Matale Mayor Diljith Aluvihare, Provincial Council Member Rohana Bandaranayake, former Minister Nandimithra Ekanayake, Weera Madugalle Foundation President Bernard Madugalle and Secretary M.W. Somaratne were present.
