The Japanese connection

[Book Review]
Title: Iasthura
Translator: Daya Ananda Ranasinghe
The book is a translation to Sinhala of an English Novel Ironwood Tree by Paul Pieris. It gives the picture of the folk in rural area during the time of foreign invaders. It carries the story of Japanese Bombing Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and how Colombo families dwell in country for security and feeling the difference of comfortable nature than concrete walls surrounded.
A very readable book, Ironwood Tree describes real events in Sri Lanka during World War II, with the use of fictional characters. It has elements of a spy novel and a love story – plus, brimming with humorous situations! Set during the Colonial Period when Sri-Lanka was under the yoke of the British Empire rule. Paul Pieris subtly explains how the British rule was challenged by the Japanese attempt to conquer Asia.
It shows life as it was over 60 years ago in this country, showing the impact the war had on the general population.
One noticeable impact being the master-servant relationship - both the ruling English with the native population and also the master and man/woman servant at home. The novel beautifully describes this period in Sri-Lankan history, with anecdotes and even little mini stories from the country's past.
Read this novel, and you will be taken aback by the poetic use of language, full of feeling and understanding. The novel's undercurrent is the fear of an impending invasion by the Japanese, culminating with the Japanese bombing of Colombo, the capital city - incidentally, by the same fleet that nearly destroyed the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour in Dec. 1941. The translator, Daya Ananda, now domiciled in England, was attached to Lake House in 1970s. He has also worked with Titus Thotawatte and Lester James Peiris.
His write-ups were highly commended at the OCIC Cinema Festival and in 1982 he was commended by the Germany, Manheim International Cinema Festival. He was the Editor of the Lanka Vitti in England for over ten years published in favour of the Sri Lankans living there.
