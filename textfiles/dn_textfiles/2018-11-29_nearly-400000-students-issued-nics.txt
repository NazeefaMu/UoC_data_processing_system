G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination:
Nearly 400,000 students issued NICs

Commissioner General of the Department of Registration of Persons Viyani Gunathilake, in a circular, has informed all school heads that about 395,000 school candidates sitting for the G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination in December have been issued NICs.
Schoolchildren who have completed 15 years can apply for NICs through their school heads.
“Our department will not be holding mobile programmes to issue NICs to students this year. We have made arrangements for students to obtain their NICs at our head office under a one-day service these days, Gunathilake said.
“We request parents, school principals and students to get their NICs without further delay as the G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination will commence on December 3, the Commissioner General stated.
