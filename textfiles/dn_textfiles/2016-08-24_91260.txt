Injuries have forced the national rugby selection committee headed by Michael Jayasekera to make three changes to the Sri Lanka team for the final leg of the Under 18 Asian Schools’ Rugby Sevens Championship to be worked off in Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) on August 27 and 28.
Three players who took part in the first leg in Hong Kong namely vice-captain cum centre Sumudhu Rankothge of Isipathana College, Diyath Fernando of St. Peter’s College and Christian de Lile of S.

The team will be led once again by S. Thomas’ College wing three quarter Henakankanamge Naveen.
Sri Lanka Under 18 team head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq told the Daily News, “With the coaching staff headed by Director coaching Inthisham Marikar we have made every effort and changed the mindset of the players to face their tough opponents and go for victory.

Six teams are expected to take part in the second leg - Sri Lanka, Singapore, Philippines, China, UAE and hosts Chinese Taipei who will battle each other in a round robin format. The teams finishing in the top four will lock horns against each other in the Cup semi-finals.
