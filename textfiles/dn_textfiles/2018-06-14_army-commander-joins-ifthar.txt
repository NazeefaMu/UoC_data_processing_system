Army Commander joins Ifthar

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, showing his solidarity and friendship with Muslim members of the Army, joined the Ifthar ritual, the breaking of Ramadan fast, at a ceremony organised at Laya Beach Hotel, Wadduwa.
Signalling the gesture of respect and high regard for religious rites and rituals in Islam, Lieutenant General Senanayake, together with officers and other ranks sat together at dusk in the ceremony organised by the Army Muslims' Association.
Minneriya Infantry Training Centre (ITC) Commandant and Army Muslims' Association Chairman Major General Suraj Bansajaya took the lead in organising the annual ceremony.
A gathering of more than 250 Army personnel, both officers and other rankers together with the Army Commander, soon after the prayers, partook of some refreshments and symbolised the ritual.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, towards the end of the event, made a symbolic contribution to the Chief Moulavi, as a token of support for religious programmes. In return, the Moulavi presented Sinhala copies of the Holy Quran to Lieutenant General Senanayake and three other senior officers.
Hundreds of wives, family members of Army officers and other rankers also joined the occasion, in accordance with Islamic traditions.
