GAME OF THRONES

While the government was preparing for the Local Government election, seven Provincial Chief Ministers – stalwarts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) – held a discussion with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday, at the latter’s residence in Colombo 07.
The objective of the meeting was to ensure party unity before the announcement of the Local Government election.
The Chief Ministers first held a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena and informed him that they intended to meet former President Rajapaksa to discuss measures to strengthen the party unity. The President said he had no objection to any such meeting. This laid the foundation for the meeting between the former President and the Chief Ministers.
The Chief Ministers represented the moderate bloc of the SLFP which believe the former President should work under the SLFP umbrella, accepting the leadership of President Sirisena. They are of the view that such an arrangement will prevent a split in the party and give the SLFP camp an edge at the Local Government election.
All the Chief Ministers representing the SLFP, except North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, attended the discussion. Jayaratne left the Rajapaksa camp before the last Presidential election and became an ardent supporter of President Sirisena.
Former Ministers Gamini Lokuge, Bandula Guanwardena and Prof. G.L. Peiris attended the discussion representing Rajapaksa’s group.
“We joined the discussion as intermediaries. We will convey the matters discussed at the meeting to the party leadership and the Central Committee. We were not here to make final decisions on contentious matters,” Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva told reporters after the meeting.
“The meeting ended inconclusively. But, we still believe there is some opening for a meaningful dialogue,” he added.
Outcome of the meeting
Chief Ministers meeting with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said there were certain arguments during the meeting.
“Despite the arguments and counter-arguments, the meeting was friendly.”
Although there were positive sentiments from the Chief Ministers, the former President’s group seemed displeased with the outcome of the meeting.
“The main problem was that the Chief Ministers who came to meet the former President did not have decision making powers in the party. Without decision-making powers, they can’t offer solutions to critical issues. That’s why these discussions do not go anywhere,” UPFA MP and Rajapaksa group stalwart Gamini Lokuge said.
He said he was uncertain whether the two groups would meet again.
The former President’s position remained unchanged during the meeting. He said he would not support the national unity government in which the UNP is a main stakeholder.
He said he was ready to work with anyone who is against the UNP and its political agenda.
But, the majority of Chief Ministers defended the SLFP’s move to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UNP to form a unity government. They said an arrangement of that nature was needed to ensure political reforms and national policies. This was the key policy difference between the two groups attending the meeting.
The Rajapaksa group is also adamant that the former President should be given key decision-making responsibilities in the party before the Local Government election. They constantly threaten to form a separate political front - a breakaway party – if the President turns down their demands.
This pound-of-flesh policy also stands in the way of SLFP’s unity, at the moment.
While working hard to resolve the power struggle within the party, the SLFP also has to battle with the UNP and other stakeholders of the ‘yahapalanaya’ government over its position on the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
General Secretary of SLFP and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake 
The SLFP has made a policy decision to back the Executive Presidency, taking a 180 degree turn from the principles of good governance upon which the present government was formed two years ago.
President Sirisena, however, is yet to make his opinion public on the matter.
The SLFP’s position on the Executive Presidency has irked sections of the UNP and other stakeholders of the government who campaigned for President Sirisena at the last Presidential election.
They firmly believed that President Sirisena’s rise to power would bring an end to the Executive Presidency – a “constitutional demon” in the eyes of some.
Many who opposed the Executive Presidency backed President Sirisena’s election campaign in January, 2015 as comprehensive constitutional reforms were a top priority of the rainbow coalition’s political agenda.
They are now confused with the SLFP’s reluctance to abolish the Executive Presidency, a key element in the constitutional reform process.
The UNP, as a policy, supports the total abolition of the Executive Presidency. As a result, the two main stakeholders of the government find themselves at the opposite ends of the debate.
UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera, speaking to the media in Kandy, a few days ago, said his party was determined to abolish the Executive Presidency.
He said the leaders of the government had no ethical right to continue with the Executive Presidency.
Meanwhile, a section of the SLFP and the members of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) have also stressed the need for the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
Among them is former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a Patron of the SLFP and a member of its Central Committee.
Kumaratunga, addressing a public event recently, said the Central Committee, the supreme decision making body of the party, had not made a decision to retain the Executive Presidency. It shows that the key figures of the SLFP are still not on the same page about the matter.
Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne, a member of the UNFGG, also expressed similar views when he addressed the Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department two weeks ago.
Revealing President Sirisena’s position on the matter, Senaratne said the President wanted to abolish the Executive Presidency.
“A section of the SLFP has made a request to retain the Executive Presidency; but the President has still not agreed,” he said.
“Since 1994, all Presidents had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and used that very promised to get into power, but due to various practical or personal constraints, failed to fulfill the promises.”
“Either they didn’t have two thirds majority or didn’t want to do it. And given the war, there were practical issues of whether it was a wise decision to make. But after 2010, there has been no excuse to keep it. On January 8, we promised to abolish it. That is the mandate upon which is the government was formed,” the Minister explained.
It is against this backdrop that the civil society activists who were involved in President Sirisena’s election campaign in 2015 met several representatives of the government to discuss the progress of constitutional reforms.
Ministers Dr Rajitha Senaratne, Mangala Samaraweera, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Duminda Dissanayake, Mano Ganesan, Deputy Ministers Dr Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Constitutional Lawyer MP Dr Jayampathi Wickremaratne attended the meeting representing the government.
The civil society was represented by Prof Sarath Wijesuriya, Gamini Viyangoda, Saman Rathnapriya and Ven Dambara Amila thera.
The meeting lasted for about two and half hours took place at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla, on Sunday evening.
The civil society representatives, addressing the meeting, stressed the need for a referendum on the proposed Constitutional reforms.
Speaking to the Daily News on Sunday, ‘Puravesi Balaya’ Co-convenor Gamini Viyangoda said there was a general agreement that the executive presidency should be abolished.
He said the civil society forwarded a road map to the Government on how to approach the people on the new Constitution and devolution of power.
“We believe if all political parties, the SLFP, UNP, JVP, TNA and SLMC come together we can win the referendum with no difficulty” Viyangoda said.
Interestingly, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, who attended the meeting, did not explicitly voice his opinion at the meeting.
“He did not say that they were against the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He spoke about certain difficulties they have faced in that regard in the party. He did not say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to it. However, we decided to continue this dialogue with the political leaders and civil society even in the future” Minister of National Dialogue Mano Ganesan told the Daily News on Sunday.
The minister said he brought out the concerns of the minority parties on the electoral reforms during the meeting.
However, it is now clear that the SLFP’s take on the Executive Presidency and the Presidential candidacy in 2020 will make life hard for those involved in the formulation of a new constitution.
They are aware that without the SLFP’s support the government cannot proceed with the constitutional reform process promised before the last Presidential election.
This calls for an agreement between the President and the Prime Ministers – the leaders of the two main parties in the government – on the ruling alliance’s future course of action on constitutional reforms.
India - China
The Sri Lankan government is now on the threshold of a crucial agreement with China on the Hambanthota port development project.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama has told media that the final agreement in this regard will be signed before the end of January. However, the government is still in the process of finalizing some clauses in the agreement which has caused ripples across the political circles.
At the same time, China is likely to be given a long-term lease on 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota for an industrial zone worth $1.4 billion. Despite some politically motivated resistance from villagers in the area, the Sri Lankan government is ready to move forward with the comprehensive development plan.
This is aside from the Colombo Port City, built by the Chinese with their own money, at the heart of the Colombo city. It seemed like China was consolidating its position in Sri Lanka – especially on the investment front – under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration. It was against this backdrop that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, a Cabinet Minister, revealed that the Sri Lankan government would offer the Trincomalee harbour to India, for development purposes.
The plan is to develop Trincomalee harbour into a major deep sea port in a region that is currently in need of them, and a 175 square kilometre luxury tourism zone - for which Sri Lanka needs financial support from overseas.
On the surface, it looked as if the Sri Lankan government was trying to counterbalance its activities with China by offering the Trincomalee harbour to India.
The New Indian Express, a Chennai based newspaper. reported last week that India was not inclined to proceed with the deal as it is not going to yield an income for a long time. According to the report, India does not see it as a commercially viable venture. However, the Indian government is yet to make an official comment in this regard.
“India’s only interest is in seeing that any foreign presence in Sri Lanka is not a security threat to India, sources said. It does have a fear that the current deal with the Chinese company on Hambatota port could at some point be a security threat to India as the port will be in de-facto if not de-jure control of the Chinese government for the next 99 years,” the New Indian Express report said.
This indicates that Sri Lanka’s successful relations with India relies on Colombo’s ability to convince the Indian government that the Chinese economic activities in Sri Lanka do not pose a threat to India’s security interests in the region. India’s main concern – in the context of Sri Lanka - is her security interests, more than anything else.
As long as the Sri Lankan government manages to effectively communicate to the Indian government that Sri Lanka’s decisions will not jeopardize India’s security interests, New Delhi – Colombo relations will remain intact, irrespective of economic partnerships between Sri Lanka and China.
