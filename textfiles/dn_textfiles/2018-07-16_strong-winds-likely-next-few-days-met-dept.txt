Strong winds likely in next few days: Met Dept.

Strong gusty winds up to 50-60 kmph are likely over the island, the Meteorology Department yesterday said.
The possibility for increasing wind speed is still high over the Island and surrounding sea areas.
It will continue further in next few days and also a slight enhance in the showery condition is likely in the South-western part of the island in next few days until July 17.
Showers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. Fairly heavy rainfalls above 50 mm can be expected at some places. Several spells of showers will occur in the North-western Province, the Department said.
