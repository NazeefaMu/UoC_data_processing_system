Galle MC receives waste collection trucks from Japan

Five Japanese waste collection trucks were handed over to the Galle Municipal Council by Koji Yagi, Deputy Head of Mission of Embassy of Japan, on September 8 in the presence of Wasana P. Gunarathna, Municipal Commissioner of Galle Municipal Council and Kyoko Terada, General Director of the Society for Promotion of Japanese Diplomacy (SPJD).
The trucks were donated by Okayama city in Japan. Refurbishment of the vehicle, transfer to Sri Lanka and dispatch of Japanese experts to Galle for training on the maintenance of the vehicles were conducted by SPJD under the Japanese Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP) assistance amounting US$ 103,487 (approx. Rs. 15 million).
Three years ago, the Galle Municipal Council received five compacters from Okayama City.
Recent urbanization and development of commercial activities resulted in the sharp increase of solid waste in the nunicipality, and further enhancing the capacity for waste management was an issue.
The Government of Japan responded to the request and decided to donate another five trucks from Okayama city to the Municipal Council.
