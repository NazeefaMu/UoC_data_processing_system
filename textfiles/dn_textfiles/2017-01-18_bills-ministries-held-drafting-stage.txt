Bills by ministries held up at drafting stage

Twenty one Bills sent by ministries to the Legal Draftsman’s Department are held up at the drafting stage due to want of further instructions from the ministries which had not been forthcoming, said Legal Draftsman Deepani Kumarajeewa.
It was not due to any lapse on her part of her department that the Bills are being delayed.
Kumarajeewa said several other Bills are going through the drafting stage with the concurrence of departments and ministries.
