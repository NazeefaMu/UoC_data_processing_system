DSI, Nirogi Lanka ink deal to promote special shoes for diabetic patients

A leading footwear and apparel brand, DSI recently joined hands once again with Nirogi Lanka of the Sri Lanka Medical Association on a campaign to promote the use of safe shoes for those suffering of diabetes.
The primary objective of the partnership is the creation of awareness about the importance of providing proper foot-care for diabetic patients with special emphasis upon the use of precisely designed footwear to protect the feet of patients withpoor sensation and circulation caused by long standing high blood sugar.
Given that a significant percentage of the country’s population is diabetic, DSI’s CSR initiative also serves as a practical and valuable means of raising awareness about diabetic foot itself. Nirogi shoes are available in six special designs for men and women at affordable prices. These special shoes are available in over 100 DSI showrooms islandwide.
DSI and Nirogi Lanka signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Office in Colombo 7.
Thusitha Rajapaksa, Managing Director of D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd, represented the company at the signing of the memorandum, which was also signed by Professor Chandrika Wijeratne and Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa, the President-Elect of the Sri Lanka Medical Association.
As the main marketing and distributing sector of the DSI Samson Group, D. Samson & Sons, is one of the largest retail networks in the country that provides footwear, accessories and apparel to the local customer.
