JHU’s Athuraliye Rathana Thera renounces party affiliation

 
Jathika Hela Urumaya MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera renounced party affiliation today, and said he would function as an independent MP.
Athuraliye Rathana Thera said he had no differences with the JHU and was not intending to join the Opposition, but had given up party affiliation because he was keen to set up a national council of intellectuals.
“I invite all intellectuals to come forward to form a broader national moment that can make an impact in the case of national crisis,” the Thera said – “this would be an alternate government.”
