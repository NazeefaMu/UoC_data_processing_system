SLIC selects MTI Consulting  to develop strategic plan

Sri Lanka’s pioneer insurance provider– Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) has selected MTI Consulting to develop SLIC’s three-year strategic plan that is to be aligned with fast-tracked branch expansions and modernization of its operations.
The internationally acclaimed MTI’s 8S Model® will be utilized to develop the strategic direction for SLIC to focus on long term strategic implications and to be future-proof in an industry that has become ripe for disruption.
Since its establishment in 1962, SLIC is the largest state-owned insurance company in Sri Lanka. SLIC has been living up to its motto “Like a father, Like a mother” providing both General Insurance as well as Life Insurance. The company is also the first and only local insurer to secure Fitch Ratings AA+ (lka) rating for its long-term financial stability and strong capital position.
“The insurance industry in both the global and local context has become challenging, making it tough for market leaders to maintain their position due to disruptions to the industry brought in from conventional as well as emerging players with the advancements in technology. Therefore in order to survive, we need to re-think our insurance offerings and develop strategic responses for such disruptions”, said SLIC’s CEO, Chandana L Aluthgama on the development of the strategic plan.
Chairman of SLIC, Hemaka Amarasuriya said, “Having a well-structured strategic plan will provide a clear direction for the future of our business and its successful long range implementation for diverse opportunities while managing a dynamic growth phase in the history of the senior insurance Institution in Sri Lanka.”
“With the use of MTI’s 8S Model® which is customized according to the insurance industry and offerings of SLIC, we expect to develop a strategic plan that will enable the organization to achieve its full potential along with the ability to be better equipped internally to face change, challenges and seize opportunities that will place SLIC as the Insurance Leader in Sri Lanka,” said MTI’s CEO, Hilmy Cader.
