Main focus of budget should be to alleviate poverty

 The budget for the next year is scheduled to be presented to the parliament in next month.
A budget that estimates income and expenses of the economy says economic direction of the country, as it decides on financial ups and downs in different industries which create employments for the nation.
The budget 2018 is very crucial, by all accounts, because the budgets that the good governance government, since its inception, has presented before the parliament, has been criticized constructively as well as maliciously.
Hence, the government is expected at this time to address problems arising from the neglected areas and thereby main focus should be to alleviate poverty in the country.
Poverty alleviation has to be the top priority for any government, as the voters that elected the government suffer from the poverty, without any ability to claim for a good living standard.
Whatever said or done, the final outcome must be to alleviate poverty. Be it export development, reducing imports, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attraction, private sector encouragement, tax imposition or reduction, embarking new development projects and finally any kind of economic policy, they are directly or indirectly connected with poverty alleviation strategies, creating cash inflows to the country, building infrastructure facilities and creating employments which ultimately increase people’s purchasing power and mitigate poverty.
Poverty
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) refers to poverty as a deprivation of essential assets and opportunities to which every human being is entitled. Furthermore, the Copenhagen declaration at the world summit on social development described poverty as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information.
The same situation in rural areas can be called rural poverty. According to Head Count Index 2012/2013, urban poverty was 2.4%, rural poverty was 7.5% and estate poverty was 6.2%.
Many people considered poor, belong to the rural parts of the country. Basic statistics 2017 issued by Asian Development Bank says that 6.7% of the population live below the poverty line in Sri Lanka.
Investment
Even if it is true that investments pave the way for employments and economic development, there have to be savings to be turned into capital. That’s why; Sri Lanka, as a country, is always keen on attracting foreign investments.
The government is expected to make necessary proposals to attract foreign investors, while encouraging local investors, as that is one of the best options to accelerate economic growth by increasing production and exports.
Consequently, employment opportunities in the private sector go up in comparison to those in public sector which of course have become a huge burden which every citizen has to shoulder, especially irrespective of where they are employed. More investments mean more business expansion causing more employments.
Tax
Tax is a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions. How taxes are imposed and what are going to be done with tax money is of the significance, as it has a serious impact on personal wealth, business operations and the economy at large. It is needless to say that higher taxes decrease purchasing power, resulting in low consumer demand which then means low profit for companies. It is with low profits and higher levies that companies are likely to decide on reducing cost and postponing business expansion. The smooth cycle of the economy can be obviously broken by imposition of higher taxes, putting people into poverty.
When it comes to government revenue, non-tax revenue comes first. Hence, government must focus their attention to further increase non-tax revenue by restructuring State-owned enterprises (SOEs), in order that government enterprises can make a significant contribution to the economy, while tax revenue can also be increased by bridging the gap between direct and indirect taxes via new Inland Revenue act.
These are directly related to poverty alleviation, since higher government revenue can be allocated for building infrastructure facilities which enable people, particularly in rural areas to transport their goods to the market and industrialists to set up their factories in remote areas where cheap labor is available.
Expectations
This budget has to be prepared giving priority to economics, not to politics. The cultural fault is that people are used to expecting budgetary reliefs rather than seeking sound economic proposals to boost economic development.
An election seems to be held next year. Accordingly, it is up to the government to draft the budget without being politically motivated.
What could be observed for past few decades was that rulers prioritized politics more than economics, as they aimed at elections, not at development. This time, the government is expected to present an economically sound budget, not popular budget, as it brings only cost. In conclusion, main focus of the budget should be to alleviate poverty.
