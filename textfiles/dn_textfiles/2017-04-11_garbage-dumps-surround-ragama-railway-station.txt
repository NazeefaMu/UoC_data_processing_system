Garbage dumps surround Ragama railway station

Residents of the Siriwardena Mawatha near the Ragama railway station complain that the garbage dumped in the area has caused them a serious health hazard. The garbage dumped all over the area permeates unbearable foul smell, they said.
Environmental pollution resulted by garbage dumped recklessly has a direct link with the high number of reported dengue patients in the area, they said.
Several dengue deaths including that of a 7-year-old girl were reported recently.
The residents urge authorities to take immediate action to prevent people from dumping garbage since it would lead to dengue epidemic situation in the area in the near future.
