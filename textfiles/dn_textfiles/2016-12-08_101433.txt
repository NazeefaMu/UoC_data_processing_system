Cabinet approval to restructure Hambantota Port

The proposal to enter into a Public-Private Partnership with China Merchants Port Holdings to restructure the Hambantota Port received Cabinet approval on Tuesday, said Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday at the weekly cabinet briefing.
The second phase of the Hambantota Port has been scheduled to commence on January 7, in time for President Maithripala’s second year in office.
The Proposal was submitted as a joint Cabinet memorandum by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama.
The framework agreement with the Chinese investor would be based upon the final decision made by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM).
They also decided to cancel the Key Terms Agreement signed between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Chinese investor in 2014. According to the decisions made by the CCEM, an Independent Port Regulator would be appointed to oversee activities and collect revenue owed to the government, until it is appointed, the SLPA would oversee such duties.
An oversight committee to handle national security at the port would also be formed.
The Sri Lanka Navy, Police and SLPA would be part of it while internal security within the port will be handled by the company. The agreement also explained that, “The joint venture would acquire or lease as the case may be, all operational assets and common user facilities of Hambantota Port which shall include but not limited to container terminals, multipurpose terminals and oil terminals with fuel storage and supply facilities”.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka last month announced that Sri Lanka would lease an 80 percent stake in the Hambantota Port to China for USD 1 billion.
The Chinese investors, said the Central Bank Governor had agreed to invest in the Hambantota Port. The first payment of USD 108 million was expected in January while USD 300 million was expected in March.
Meanwhile, workers at the Hambantota Port went on strike yesterday against the move to lease out the Port to the Chinese.
They alleged that they would lose their jobs to Chinese workers when they take over.
