Malwatte Chapter does not oppose  new constitution - Anunayake thera

The Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Malwatte Chapter had not decided to oppose a new constitution or bringing amendments to the present Constitution of the country, the Anunayaka of the Malwatte Chapter Ven.Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Thera said yesterday. Refuting media reports that Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of both Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters had decided to oppose a new constitution, Wimaladhamma Thera said that a few members of the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of both chapters had met on Wednesday to discuss constitutional reforms and the Malwatte chapter had not taken any decision to oppose the formation of a new constitution.
The Thera also said that the Mahanayake Theras of both the Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters had not taken part in the meeting.
The Thera said that he had represented the Malwatte chapter during the talks and the Asigiriya chapter was represented by Ven.Tibbotuwawe Medhankara Thera.
Ven.Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Thera said that the Malwatte chapter will only take a decision on the new constitution after briefing the Chief Incumbent of the Malwatte chapter about what transpired during the meeting.
He said that the Malwatte Chapter will not arrive at any decision without the consent of the Mahanayaka Thera. The Thera said that the Mahanayake Thera’s of both the Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters will further study the proposed constitutional reforms before arriving at a final decision.
Wimaladhamma Thera said that the comments he made on Wednesday were his personal opinion and not a collective decision taken by the Karaka Sabha of the Malwatte chapter.
He went on to say that the Mahanayake of the Malwatte chapter was currently overseas and matters related to the constitution will be discussed when he returns.
