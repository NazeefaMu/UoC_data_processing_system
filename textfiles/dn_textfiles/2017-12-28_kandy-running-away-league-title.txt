Kandy running away with league title?

Aloha rugby fans and partisan followers of our beloved code in Sri paradise.
What a fabulous festive spell in and around the city clubs etc. all dressed up and plenty eggnog to warm the parts and nourish our rugby warriors enjoying the cheer.
Time off.. to reflect on the Dialog league and the quality of performance that shaped results in round 1.
All issues rugby pretty much sorted and your critical combinations also settled ...or certainly should be, come round 2 and the title at stake. Front rows, 3rd row hunters, the no. 8 and 9 link, the fly half and scrum half familiarity, fittest full back in attack and defence...forming the last line of defence, with the two wingers on duty for the full 80mins.
If coach Sean for Kandy, Nilufer Ibrahim with Army, Fijian Ferry CR, Lagga for CH, Martis with Havies, Jayatilaka guiding Navy etc...have thoughts collectively ..it’s certainly is about how they might run their best and fittest, stamp some class and shape their survival in the middle. Coaches will dread the thought of injuries to their key players ..physios working triple hard to get a full squad for mid week training.
Now it’s the warrior and big match ups..the confrontation of the islands more skilled and gifted, in a one on one battle...to determine the champions.
Dialog can’t be much happier with the league status and determination of the top 4 sides pushing for honours in 2018. Kandy sitting fairly pretty, Navy and Havelocks very keen to give their rank a solid drive up, with greater ambitions ahead.
All said and despite the popular hype..it’s still the best thing for miles around.
The fans getting more determined and mighty keen to see their team challenging the best at every inch of loose play...and consistent squads, defence to grind results out. This is the heart of Dialog rugby and defiantly, the statement of impact sport in Sri Lanka.
My greatest fear is the distinct lack of big performances, and poor commitment at national level..for tours.
The fix should be a high performance future for our elite, all year round, and professional administrators to maintain the balance annually.
Sri Lanka travel to the Hong Kong 7s on merit with a chance of qualifying for the rugby World 7s series from the Asian nomination. What a stupendous achievement that would be for all of us fans, if Sri Tuskers 7 beat the likes of Kenya, Canada, Jamaica, Nigeria, and USA...make new history and a joyous way to welcome the new year.
It’s all down to conditioning and how much our determination shines bright. It’s the stark reality of our position in Asian rugby ...and what our future holds..
We must contemplate the stature of international rugby and accept to develop step by step ..questions about player insurance and safety, professional contracts, proper medical support across all formats etc ...our biggest hurdles to-date.
Change is the way forward...soak in stats and sheer magic from Japan, especially their union policy and determination to push for a spot in the top 12 world ranking...become a force and fly 1st class with the RWC 2019.
National policy matches and support rugby policy from top to the ball for kick off every weekend.
Their wisdom in hiring Eddie Jones as coach, reflects the enhanced stature in thinking and their singular ambition to be a force in the rugby world.
Our islanders rugby will revolve around personalities and their vision to ape Japan’s remarkable journey over the last 3 seasons...the transformation too dramatic to imagine ...and deliciously possible realities for the rest of Asia.
If we start to get it right ...then our days of flying 1st class, not too far away and seemingly unattainable.
Round 2 is all about injury management and how good the quality of finishing for our marauding warriors.
Teams to watch will definitely be an inspired CH, with the likes of Keegle, Weerakoon, Samuel, Herath..hopefully fully fit and itching to run ..plus Saranga, Satya, Yoshita, Sasanka, stepping it up from their opener in Welisera vs Navy.
There will be no love lost and Gertha Perera, desperately seeking revenge for that earlier loss...its going to be a cracker.
CR, Havelocks and Army will be licking their lips at the chance of taking a bite from Kandy and their blind ambition to fight for that league title..impossible though it may seem on paper?
Enjoy the rugby, marvel at the warrior class and their conditioning..see their skills in glorious sunshine..all matches are 4pm kickoffs, except the Havies stadium 6.30 pm floodlight matches, that glam our local rugby to the max.
Wishes to all rugby hearts and our resident experts for season 2018.
Bigger, better, faster and more intense is our new year’s resolution. May that reality stun and thrill us to the gills.
Cheers islanders..see you in January.
Bula bula Sri island Rugby!
