Govt will not be allowed to take over SAITM: Bahu

Nawa Sama Samaja Party leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said they would not give any opportunity to the government to take over SAITM.
Addressing a media briefing at the party headquarters yesterday, he said SAITM should be abolished and the administration of SAITM should take steps to award compensation to the students.
“If the law of this country permits, a private degree institution like SAITM that does not follow the proper procedure, should be closed down. A serious question had arisen about the standards of SAITM. Even Professor Carlo Fonseka had alleged that SAITM had not developed its standards quantitatively and qualitatively. Therefore this garbage dump should be buried without being taken over by the government," Dr. Karunaratne said.
“The same mistake was done in the past when the government took over the Ragama Medical College disregarding the free education received by the medical students. If the government takes over SAITM, it will pave the way for other fake degree offering private institutions to get official recognition despite the struggles by students and other parties for free education,” he said.
