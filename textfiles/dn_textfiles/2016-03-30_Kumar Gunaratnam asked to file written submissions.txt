Kumar Gunaratnam asked to file written submissions

The Court of Appeal yesterday permitted Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Central Committee member Premakumar Gunaratnam to file written submissions in connection with the writ petition filed by him, seeking an order that he be given Sri Lankan citizenship in accordance with the Citizenship Act.
The petition was re-fixed for support on May 24 by Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena.
The petitioner stated that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is yet to consider his application submitted to obtain the citizenship of Sri Lanka, without any reasonable ground.
The petitioner stated that he is being denied dual citizenship.
Through his writ petition, Gunaratnam had cited Internal Affairs Minister S.B.Navinna, the Controller of Immigration and Emigration and Attorney General as respondents.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with Counsel Sudath Caldera appearing for the petitioner moved Court that a Writ of Mandamus order be issued on the Minister of Internal Affairs to consider his client’s application for resumption of citizenship.
Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the petition cannot be maintained since there is no reasonable ground to issue such an order.
The DGS further submitted to Court that the petitioner has violated the provision of the Immigration and Emigration Act after over staying in the country through a fake passport.
Kumar Gunaratnam is presently under remand at the Kegalle remand prison. He is an Australian citizen and arrived in Sri Lanka on January 1, 2015.
