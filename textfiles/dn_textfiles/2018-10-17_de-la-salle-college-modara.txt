Growing up with a strong will
De La Salle College, Modara

His maxim is that the deserving should be rewarded. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of De La Salle College Modara, Sivakumar Rukshan who strongly feels that merit comes through untiring effort.
For Rukshan, hard work is the determinant to one’s social and spiritual development. You have to work hard to create your personality.
“I feel that this drug addiction is really a big problem when it comes to young people. We need to nip this in the bud. From school itself, young people need to be dissuaded from using drugs. That will help in creating a society that is free from drugs. This must be started at home as well. Parents should know about what is taking place in the lives of their children. If they do their duty well, the child will be protected. Even teachers need to take responsibility as the student spends nearly six hours at school. A student’s life needs to be monitored consistently,” said Rukshan.
There is much temptation in society. Here again, you have to work very hard at resisting.
Strong will
“Today we cannot do without the internet. It is here to stay and it has now become a part of life. There is good and malign side to the internet. Pornography is rampant on the internet. The sexual content entices the young minds. Here young people must be strong-willed and use the internet for knowledge that will help in their education and stop there. They can then achieve their goals. But the problems is some of the youth go astray,” explained Rukshan.
Fear leads to wisdom and if the teachers and parents do their duty, the child will become a model citizen. That will create a healthy society. Rukshan feels that a child should fear to do wrong. And that fear needs to be instilled in the child. He also stresses that a person should be rewarded according to his/her abilities and not according to where he/she comes from or the social status of his/her school or family. If there is a poor person who is talented, he or she must be promoted.
Rukshan also pointed out that if you take the society we live in young people are conditioned in such a way, that they only focus on the classroom work and the subjects taught in the classroom.
“Even though this is the excellent knowledge that will help a young person in life, I also feel that in many cases today, the young person’s capabilities are elsewhere. He or she may have certain talents, possess unique qualities and characteristics, display creativity and originality that may not be directly linked to what is taught in the classroom – the subject matter. If you are good at what you do then you will succeed at what you do. If you do what you like, then you will succeed at it,” stated Rukshan.
Leadership qualities
Rukshan is a talented basketball player. The sport of basketball has instilled in him certain qualities that have helped develop his leadership qualities. His brothers have also been prefects at De La Salle who have become role models to him. The unwavering support of his Principal and the teachers of De La Salle College have been a great strength to him.
Rukshan feels that constructive criticism is always formulated by those who have in mind the best interests of the society he or she lives in.
“I always follow instruction from my teachers. I believe in being honest and forthright. I am a straightforward guy. I always appreciate constructive criticism. I am always willing to correct any fault of mine. I say what I have to say and believe in straight talking. This I feel has enabled people to have faith in me,” pointed out Rukshan.
Rukshan looks up to those who are closest to him. The greatest advice he has received is that if he puts his mind to the task at hand he can always accomplish it successfully.
“I normally look up to people who are directly involved with my life and those who have helped me. They have taught me that my mind can take me wherever I want to go. I have done two professional software engineering courses (Advanced Technology and Research Institute certified Professional Software Engineer.) I am now a professional software engineer. On the side of basketball, I have gone on to international selection. I am also interested in the music field. I have also tried my hand at art. I am doing commerce for my A/Ls and want to go to the management or banking side,” said Rukshan.
Start young
Lazing is normally the result of a misinformed mind that does not fully appreciate reality.
“My advice to any young person is to start young and form your goals in life. Do not idle. Also never forget your parents and what they have done for you. Be a good citizen. Don’t spoil your life doing drugs. Don’t delay and procrastinate and always associate with the good company,” explained Rukshan.
He points out that the first step to solving a problem is correctly identifying the nature of the problem and its causes. You should never give up in the face of adversity. If the problem is too complex, you should seek the counsel of a teacher or senior.
“When facing pressure in life I always have with me my close friends my confidantes. For me, if I am under pressure I go to my Basketball Master in Charge or speak to my father, who I enjoy a close relationship with,” summed up Rukshan.
