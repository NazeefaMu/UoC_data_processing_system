Matters of mutual importance discussed

Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faiszer Musthapha, who was on an official visit to India, met the Indian Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi, recently, in New Delhi.
The two Ministers discussed matters of mutual importance including the latest political developments. Minister Musthapha made reference to Minister Gandhi’s special interest in animal welfare, in the context of ongoing initiatives in Sri Lanka aimed at resolving issues pertaining to animal cruelty, and in addressing animal-borne diseases, particularly rabies, and related developments.
Minister Gandhi shared the Indian experience extensively with details of the proposed national action plan for rabies eradication and stranded dog population management. Minister Gandhi also shared Indian endeavours aimed at preventing animal cruelty.
Minister Gandhi said that India would welcome a team of experts from Sri Lanka to hold discussions with their Indian counterparts, and visit the Centres established to address these issues. She also offered short training courses for Sri Lankan officials in India.
Minister Musthapha invited Minister Gandhi to visit Sri Lanka, and Minister Gandhi accepted. It was agreed that the two sides could decide on mutually convenient dates through formal channels.
