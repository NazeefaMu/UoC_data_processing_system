Wave of whales!

The first blue whale on the east coast has been spotted and the season of the ultimate marine mammal excursion has kicked off. Trinco Blu by Cinnamon invites guests to witness an annual marvel - the emergence of the gentle giants of the sea.

“Harnessing the services of the expert naturalists at Cinnamon Nature Trails (CNT) all guests visiting Trinco Blu by Cinnamon are welcome to explore the annual whale phenomenon,” states Cinnamon Grand in a press release.
Guests visiting this resort shall enjoy the cool sandy beaches of Trinco and even catch a glimpse of a great blue whale whilst soaking up the sun. The resort offers the perfect base to set out for a whale watching excursion, as visitors do not have to travel more than 6km into the sea to witness a considerable number of sperm whales and of course the most anticipated blue whales. During this season, Trinco is the whale watching hot spot and CNT will ensure that guests will have as many whale sightings as the weather and tide allows. Further guaranteeing this promise, the CNT team has been GPS tracking the locations of all the eastern whales for the past 6 years.
Escorted by experts from CNT, guests will gain the added bonus of witnessing off-shore birds whilst scouring the sea for the great and playful mammals of the ocean - the whales and the dolphins. Cruising towards the middle of the sea, guests will find themselves surrounded by the beauty of nature. With luck riding onboard, guests just might be entertained by the mega pod of sperm whales. This is a miraculous and rare spectacle, but nonetheless possible, given there are perfect conditions. It is this exhilarating anticipation that a guest of Trinco Blu by Cinnamon is invited to take a chance on.
CNT Field Operations Manager and Wild Life Biologist, Vimukthi Weeratunga states; “Whale and Dolphin watching at Trincomalee is a unique experience, as its waters are home to the deepest sea canyon in the country which meets the nutrient rich waters of the Mahaweli River, creating the ideal conditions required for a thriving congregation of marine mammals.”
The Indian Ocean was declared as a whale sanctuary in 1981, which in turn had the BBC filming sperm whales in Trinco in 1982, the first recordings of the mega pod in Sri Lanka’s eastern waters. It is the Cinnamon Nature Trails team with the support of Sri Lanka Navy that initiated the search for whales in the eastern waters at the dawn of peace in 2010 and found that the whale population discovered decades ago were still very much in existence.
Taking it one step further, the CNT team has also developed a unique relationship with the fisher community, teaming up with them as operational partners. The fisher community are now provided with sophisticated engines for their whaler boats to help with the whale watching excursions.
