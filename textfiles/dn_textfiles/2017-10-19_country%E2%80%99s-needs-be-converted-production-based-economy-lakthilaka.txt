Country’s needs to be converted to a production based economy - Lakthilaka

It has been planned to increase the entrepreneurship rate to 10 per cent from 3 per cent within the next five years through the Gramashakthi People’s Movement, President's Coordinating Secretary Shiral Lakthilaka said.
He said that country’s economy should be converted to a production based economy. Accordingly, it is needed to promote entrepreneurship to bend towards a production based economy.
He added that the novel technology of the world should also be utilised to achieve economic prosperity. Information technology (IT) can also be well utilised.
“It has been planned to train 100 youth representing all districts of the country to play in the IT sector by the pilot project. With the outcome of the pilot project, more youth will be trained” he said.
He added that only 3 per cent of the population is entrepreneurs. It is badly in need of increasing this number at least to 10 per cent within the next five year period to strengthen the country’s economy, he said.
Lakthilaka said that Gramashakthi People’s Movement project is carried out with a vision of “Strengthened, empowered and formally organised Sri Lankan community active in path to progress overcoming poverty”. The mission of the programme is to provide facilitation to people living in 5,000 Grama Niladhari divisions to fullfil the basic needs and the growing needs individually and collectively by providing information, decision making power and resources by 2020 and contributing to reach the national sustainable development goal of eradicating extreme poverty and halving all forms of poverty by 2030.
