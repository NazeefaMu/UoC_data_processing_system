Standard Chartered’s Regional CEO visits Colombo

Standard Chartered’s Regional Chief Executive Officer for ASEAN and South Asia, and CEO of Standard Chartered's Commercial and Private Banking business globally, Anna Marrs, is on an official visit to the Colombo office. In April this year the branch office was honoured to have welcomed Andy Halford, Group CFO to the country, and Anna’s visit marks yet another significant high point of the Bank’s presence in Sri Lanka.
Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, speaking of the visit, said: “I am delighted to welcome Anna to Sri Lanka and showcase Standard Chartered’s achievements and its potential to her. This visit reiterates the significance Standard Chartered Group places on the operation here, and we have benefitted greatly from opportunities recently to meet and interact with members of the Bank’s top leadership such as Anna, Bill Winters and Andy Halford. We have a full agenda of meetings for her as she will meet with not only government and business leaders but our employees and clients.”
Anna Marrs joined Standard Chartered as Group Head of Strategy and Corporate Development in January 2012. Prior to joining Standard Chartered, she was a partner at McKinsey & Company’s Banking Practice. Before joining McKinsey in 2003, Anna was the CEO of a financial information and technology company based in London. She started her career at D.E. Shaw, a New-York-based investment firm. Anna holds an MBA from London Business School and an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in Chicago.
