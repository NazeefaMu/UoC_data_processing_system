PIM conducts annual student research day

The Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), the Nation’s Management Mentor conducted its 5th Annual Student Research Day on October 30, at its premises.
MBA students of the PIM presented their research work. The day also provided an excellent opportunity for a meaningful intellectual interaction among research students and leading academics. The aim of the research day is to strengthen management research, which will make the PIM a center of management excellence in South Asia. Furthermore, the research day showcased the efforts taken by the PIM Research Center to create a vibrant research culture at the Institute in particular, and in the country at large.
Another noteworthy event at this occasion was the launch of the monograph on employee engagement titled “Measuring the Engagement Level of Employees in Sri Lankan Industries – A Sri Lankan Perspective with Special Emphasis on FMCG, Polymer, Banking, Insurance and Finance Sectors”. This monograph is, in fact, a unique contribution to the existing literature on employee engagement. Its findingshave been based on an exhaustive survey conducted with a sample size of 12000.
Prof. Lester C. Massignham, a leading Management Consultant and Researcher was the chief guest. He expressed his delight at seeing the PIM’s vital role in promoting management research, and highlighted the importance of research for higher education institutes while identifying several critical aspects of research with respect to impact and relevance.
Prof. Ajantha S. Dharmasiri, Director, PIM, emphasized the importance of research in the PIM’s deliberations as it is one of the key pillars of the institute’s edifice of excellence. Prof. J.A.S.K. Jayakody, Head of the PIM Research Centre, thanked all paper-presenters for their hard work, and said that the conduct of the 5th research day amply proved the PIMs ability to sustain its commitments.
