Breastfeeding makes nation wealthy and healthy

Dr. Dhammica Rowel (MBBS, MA (Health Promotion), MSc. MD (Com. Med) is a Consultant Community Physician attached to the Intra-natal and Newborn Care (NPM) Unit of the Family Health Bureau (FHB) of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry. Today she speaks about the importance and essential requirement of breastfeeding which gives priceless benefits for both mother and her infant.
Q: What are the benefits that should be given to employed breastfeeding mothers by the state and private institutions?
A - The laws governing maternity leave in Sri Lanka for the private sector are the Shop and Office Employees Act No 19 of 1954 and the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No 32 of 1939.
The Establishment code of Sri Lanka is the law applicable to state sector employees. According to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance a pregnant employee is entitled to 12 weeks (2 weeks before and 10 weeks after confinement) inclusive of holidays for the first two births and 6 weeks or 42 days for subsequent birth if she has two children living. Women employees governed by the Shop and Office Employees act of 1954 are entitled to 84 working days leave for the first and second child. Any birth which occurs when the woman has two children living at the time of confinement will only entitles the mother to 42 working days.
Female officers to whom the Establishment Code applies are entitled to 84 working days leave with full pay, another 84 calendar days with half pay ‘to look after the child’ and another 84 calendar days no pay leave ‘only if it is required for the purpose of looking after the child’. All maternity leave entitlements are available for each birth irrespective of the number of births as no limitation are placed on them as in the case of the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and Shop and Office Employees Act.

There it is obvious that there are differences between the three laws. In addition to leave, another important provision is nursing intervals. According to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance nursing mothers are entitled to two, one hour nursing intervals per day until the child is one year old.
The time period may be reduced to half an hour each if the employer provides crèche facilities at the workplace.
The Shop and Office Employees Act does not provide mothers with nursing breaks after returning to work. Women in the state sector receive two half hour breaks per day after returning to work until the child is six months old.
Q: Do present day employed breastfeeding mothers enjoy their rights?
A - The employed women should be aware of their right for maternity benefits and maternity leave. The mothers are educated on their rights in the antenatal clinics. Most of the organizations provide maternity leave as they are stipulated by law.
Q: What are the changes that need to be done when it comes to the current law and availability of facilities for employed breast feeding mothers?
A- The National Breastfeeding Policy is to exclusively breastfeed for complete six months and continues to breastfeeding up to two years or beyond. There are some sharp contrasts in the laws governing different groups of workers in our country. Women working in the government sector enjoy the benefits for any number of children, which is not for the women working in the private sector. Work is in progress to revise the Shop and Office Employees Act to extend the benefit to any number of children.
Also as described earlier there are differences in the number of days leave available to each category of women. Only working days are considered in the calculating the number of days leave granted to women covered by the Shop and Office Employees Act and Establishment Codes. Holidays are included in the calculation for women covered by the Maternity Benefits Ordinance. Therefore the latter women are getting lesser total number of days that the former. The other differences that need attention are; non availability of nursing breaks for mothers under the Shop and Office Employees Act, lack of provisions for half pay and no pay leave for women working in the private sector, absence of paternity leave other than three days for state sector employees.
Other differences that should be addressed are; requirement to provide crèche facilities other than under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, define laws to provide benefits to casual workers under the maternity Benefits Ordinance, non-availability of legislation for women in the non-formal sector.
Q : What the employed breastfeeding mothers can do to ensure that their infants get adequate breast milk?
A- Even after returning to work, the working mothers can breastfeed. Every mother should ensure that they continue breastfeeding. Infants should be exclusively breastfed up to 6 months and mothers should continue to breastfeed babies up to two years or even beyond with adequate complementary feeding. How can she do that? When the mother has to return to work after 84 days, she should start getting ready from 42 days onwards. If she has to return to work at 42 days, she would have to start getting ready from about 14 days. She has to learn the correct techniques of expressing breast milk, storing breast milk, prepare stored breast milk to feed baby, cup feeding the baby. She should start initially with one cup feed, and gradually increase according to the number of feeds she will have to give the baby in her absence. The care giver should be trained to cup feed the baby.
Expressed breast milk can be kept in the room temperature for 6 hours, in the lower compartment of the refrigerator for 24 hrs and in the deep freezer for one month. Small cups with lids can be used to store breast milk. Before storing the cup should be labeled with the date and time of collection. A wide mouthed cup can be easily cleansed with soap and water. Stored breast milk should thaw in a pot of warm water before feeding the baby. Always have a backup storage in the deep freezer, to be used in an emergency for example if the mother is getting later than usual from work.
In order to maintain her lactation, breastfeeding mothers should put the baby to the breast when ever she is with the baby and night feeds should be continued. While she is at work at least every 3 hours mother should express breast milk.
Q: How the husband, in-laws and other family members can help an employed breastfeeding mother?
A- All mothers, fathers and family should remember that taking trouble to breastfeed is an investment for the future of the child, the mother, the family and society. Working mothers need lot of support to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. She will have to spend time with the baby, feeding the baby and expressing breast milk for the next day.
She should be encouraged to do so by the family and she should be supported with the routine house work so that she will have adequate time to spend with the time and for breastfeeding. Every one in the family should remember that it is an investment for the family.
Q: How is a work place benefited by supporting women to breastfeed?
A –Evidence show that employers benefit by supporting breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers have been found to be happy mothers as opposed to mothers who are formula feeding their babies, hence productivity of breastfeeding mothers are higher than formula feeding mothers.
Also it is shown that there is less absenteeism, better retention of workers, less health care costs for breastfeeding mothers.
And when companies support breastfeeding they will be recognized as family friendly organizations. Work places need to provide facilities such as a room with privacy to express breast milk while at work.
