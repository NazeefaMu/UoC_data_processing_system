Professional obligation for legal stability

The keynote address delivered by K. Kanag Isvaran, President’s Counsel at the Bar Association of Sri Lanka National Law conference 2017 themed as ‘A contemplation of the Law and the way forward’
I am greatly honoured, nevertheless, to have been invited to deliver the keynote address at this momentous conference. Momentous, because the principal theme – the keynote – of this Conference, from the concept note sent to me, is “Con-tem-pla-tio”
- it is Greek – I mean the language is!
Translated it means a thoughtful introspection, a profound thinking.
Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years.
The philosopher Plato, asked, circa 349 BC, and I quote
“... why should we not calmly and patiently recover our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?”
The topics carefully chosen for the Conference's six sessions would seem to reflect Plato's rhetoric to “... see what these appearances in us really are?”.
“appearances” - what things look like or seem to be rather than what they actually are! The selected themes forcefully underscore the concerns and persuasions that drove the organisers of the Conference to embark on an introspective agenda for the Conference. A contemplative examination by a body politic involved in the delivery of justice to the citizens is novel in Sri Lanka – if it is not the first time ever that it is being undertaken.
Legal practitioners and judicial officers
Soul searching does not come easy. It comes in the wake of a catasclamic event or in the wake of continuous flow of events which have tended to outrage one's morals, one's sensibilities, causing disillusionment, a sense of betrayal, urging one to stand up and question the current state of things and begin to question whether things ought not to be something different, something better. Whether things ought not be changed. The perennial question of what “is” and what “ought” to be.
Has a Sri Lankan spring arrived?
May be a response to the slow realisation that human entitlements which human dignity demands have not been given a due place, or a place of pride, or a place of pride, or respected or implemented sensitively and meaningfully by governments and the justice system. May be a realization that political morality and judicial morality are not what they ought to be.
Talking to the Junior members of the Bar at their Junior Bar Conference, a few months ago, last year, I was left with the a distinct impression of their frustration and disillusionment with the pace of development and direction of the legal landscape in the country, legal reform, the lack of competency of legal practitioners and judicial officers, a lack of meaningful mechanisms for delivery of justice, insensitiveness of the politicians to the rule of law, and the resultant political instability and the stagnation of economic growth.
Practitioners of the law are in constant interface with the society, their needs, their expectations, their demands which is in an ever-changing state of flux.
Buffeted by winds of change from all directions – globalisation, technological developments, un-precedented state interference with the affairs of commerce, industry, finance, environment and the like, it becomes imperative for the legal profession not only to be learned in the law, but to tune their antennae to receive and assimilate these assaults and give leadership and direction for the way forward.
In this background the concerns expressed by the younger members of the profession have much validity. We need to pay heed. We need to understand and examine it.
One may legitimately ask what has the legal profession to do with economic growth and political stability?
What indeed, will be the first impression!
But if one looks broadly at the legal profession as including not only the black coated fraternity, but also the academics, those in employment in the private sector, the public sector and in the Attorney General's department and the judiciary – one cannot fail to see that they are all involved in the provision of services directed towards achieving access to justice and justice itself. Which in turn is fundamental to achieving political stability and economic growth by providing a level playing field to all competing interests.
Political stability
Any meaningful and acceptable rule of law and delivery of justice to the public at large must necessarily require men and women of proven competence, of independence, having integrity and high standards of intellect and character. They cannot get there by rote.
William Pitt, ‘the Elder’ 18th Earl of Chatham, English politician and orator, said,
“Where laws end, tyranny begins”.
Avoidance of tyranny is our first obligation. By tyranny is meant the use of cruelty, injustice, oppression and the like to enforce authority or power by governments or groups of people.
Some call it majoritarianism.
Advocacy of conformity with the law, (Legalitarianism) and the promotion of the principle that all human beings are equal and should enjoy the same rights, (Legal Egalitarianism) should be the primary, moral and professional obligation of the legal profession. It is a sine qua non for the promotion of political stability, without which there cannot be economic growth.
It is imperative that the profession “ought” therefore recognise as one of its core concerns, not only the standards and values inherent in his or her own professional work, but also its wider political and quasi political responsibilities, so as to ensure stability and growth. This is well reflected in the theme of this conference - “A contemplation of the law and the way forward”.
This responsibility increases in the present day because politicians have become men of flux. You cannot pin them down – they have nothing settled or steady either in their own minds or in of their discourses.
The pretensions of the politicians, of course is that they are in a singularly superior position to undertake a so-called objective and well informed responsible decisions concerning the citizens.
The Bar must surely recognise that there is something inherent in the nature of politics and politicians in our country that is not conducive to achieving stability. What is it?
I see it as the lack of responsibility, in the sense of ‘liability to be made to account’ – I.e., accountability.
Many will argue that this has been so since dawn of independence in 1948 – 69 years ago, should we let it stand?
Elemer Hankiss, the Hungarian sociologist, in his essay on ‘The Loss of Responsibility’ says that responsibility presupposes the motivation, and the ability and the possibility to choose between alternatives. It also presupposes predictability and accountability.
By motivation is meant the creation of stimuli to motivate the people to act in a responsible way. Do we see that?
By ability, is meant the inner capacity of an individual to act in a responsible way – a strong and mature personality, in attitudes, values, inclinations and willpower. Don't we miss it?
Predictability means the ability to calculate the consequences of one's acts with a relatively high probability. Do we see that? By accountability is meant that people act according to a certain set of norms and consider themselves accountable to a ‘tribunal’ representing these norms I.e., to their conscience, to a group of people, to society, to the Almighty, or to any other real or symbolic tribunal. On this the less said the better!
I would add another, sensitivity. In a pluralistic society, such as ours one should be sensitive to every group's socio-economic, cultural, ethnic and gender concerns. No comment!
But we must surely need to accept these as the precepts for the delivery of justice, political stability and economic growth.
Necessity's sharp pinch ought to remind us that in the “Contemplation of the Law and the way forward”, in moving things in the way they “ought” to be from what “it” is, we need responsible, honest and competent governance, and a competent and independent legal profession which will restore public confidence in all institutions of governance, institutions which provide access to justice and the delivery of justice, to name but a few.
The new reformist firebrands, young and old, who have been casting rhetorical stones, must deliver, without harking back to the ills and wrongs of yesteryears.
It is well to remember that some days you may be the pigeon, but other days the statue.
It is imperative therefore that we must evolve a sound and sustainable legal, political and economic environment. Or else we will become wreckers – not reformers.
