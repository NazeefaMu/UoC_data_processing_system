Two lowest  points in  Deepika’s  life

Deepika Padukone, who recently completed 10 years in Bollywood, has been at the receiving end of controversies surrounding her upcoming film ‘Padmavati’. The quintessential actress has kept her cool and expressed her concern over the grave state of affairs the film’s team has to deal with.
In a recent interview with Filmfare, the ‘XXX: Return of Xander Cage’ opened up about the lowest points in her life. She was quoted saying, “A broken relationship and depression. Those were the two very low points of my life.”
Deepika even revealed how her family and friends helped her stay grounded and deal with her issues. “Well, time and a lot of work on myself helped me overcome it. It came with an amazing support system, my friends and family. My friends and family keep me grounded.
They keep me rooted. They anchor me. Also, today my work is everything. My work is me. I have created it. I am responsible for my success and failure. No one else can take that away from me. That’s on what I have focussed all my energies and efforts. It’s my baby.”
Now that was surely an inspirational message from the actress who will soon be seen essaying the character of Rani Padmini in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavati’ which also stars Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh. TNN
