Public funds misappropriation case against Johnston:
Account statement was altered - Former CWE DGM

Former Minister Johnston Fernando appeared for the case against him over alleged misappropriation of Rs.5.2 million of public funds at the Kurunegala High Court yesterday (27).
Former CWE Deputy General Manager (Purchasing) Anjana Prabath Nissanka gave evidence for the complainants and said that the computerised account statement submitted to the High Court has been clearly altered by someone.
“Therefore, it can not be accepted as genuine,” he told.
Counsel Kalinga Indratissa appeared for former minister Johnston Fernando and former CWE Deputy General Manager Anjana Prabath Nissanka told that he would never accept that statement as genuine. Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysooriya appeared for the complainant questioned the witness why he refused to accept the statement.
The witness told the statement should have the name of the person who prepared and issued it.
The statement does not have the name of that person, he said. Nissanka told the statement should contain all the details of credit accounts and the names of those who purchased goods on credit from 2014 to 2015.
The High Court Judge ordered the Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysooriya to forward a complete Accounts statement and permitted the lawyers of the accused party to cross-examine the witness.
