Programme to find biological parents

A programme is launched to assist Sri Lankan children adopted by foreign parents to find their biological parents, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne provided information of the programme during an interview with a television channel in the Netherlands, recently.
Minister Senaratne had stated that there are around 4,000 Sri Lankan children seeking their biological, Sri Lankan parents.
Minister Senaratne said a database of all 4,000 children will be set up and DNA tests will be conducted with the assistance of the Medical Faculty of the Colombo University.
After the interview was telecast in the Netherlands, a database of Sri Lankan children living in Netherlands was set up and two of them had visited Sri Lanka, recently. About 50 Sri Lankan mothers had responded to the newspaper advertisement published by them, he said.
Netherlands Ambassador Joanne Doornewaard extended her support towards the programme when she met Minister Senaratne recently, he added.
