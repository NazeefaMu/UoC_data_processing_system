Hambantota port employees on seventh day satyagraha

 
Hambantota port employees have embarked on their seventh day of satyagraha at the main entrance to the port.
They say they will not discontinue the satyagraha even if they are faced with death.
They are asking to be made permanent employees at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Prelates at temples in close proximity to the Hambantota port have chanted seth pirith to bless those engaged in the seventh day of satyagraha.
