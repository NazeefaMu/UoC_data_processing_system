Sports Minister requests report from Sri Lanka Cricket

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has requested for a report from the Sri Lanka Cricket on the state of cricket and on the policies and guidelines for the selection process.
Addressing the media at the Information Department yesterday, Minister Jayasekara said he intends to meet cricket players after the ODI series.
“There are shortcomings that need to be dealt with, but I think there is no better team than the present team to play the test series. We will look into their psychological and physical issues if there is any," he said.
He said the cricketers would become stronger again and added, "we should not discourage them, but extend our support".
When asked whether there are administrative issues, the minister said if the cricket administration has to be changed, it has to be done at the next election. “For eight years, the administration was under interim committees. No body questioned it," Minister Jayasekara said.
