117th Battle of the Blues, St. Servatius vs St. Thomas' Matara:
An exciting finish is expected if spectators and the weather don’t hamper the 117th big match between St Servatius College and St Thomas College which will be played at the Uyanwatta stadium from the 24th to the 26th of March.
It is most likely that a decision would be reached as in most probability the wicket would favour the batsmen at the early stages of the three day encounter, but it is certain that the spinners would have their say at the final stages of the game.
St. Servatius who play in the elite division one of the schools cricket tournament did not perform up to expectation this season to end in sixth place in their group with 85.64 points with a solitary win over Mari Stella College, Negombo while St. Thomas who play in division II of the schools tournament topped their group with 107.360 points with four outright wins over St Johns’ College - Jaffna, Debarawewa National School, Vidyartha College - Kandy and Carey College to boast about. The Thomians are just one win away from qualifying to join St Servatius in the elite division one schools cricket tournament next season.
Of the 16 games the Servatians played they have won three games while the Thomians have won nine of the 17 outings this season.
The Servatians are led by second year coloursman Isuru Udayanga who has Sandaru Nethmina as his deputy. The team is strengthened by Sri Lanka under 19 cap Thilan Prashan while the final XI will be selected from Shasika Dulshan, Pushpitha Dilshan, Dineth Nethsara, Dilshan Maduranga, Ruvinda Rochana, Keshara Nuwantha, Supun Kavinda, Muditha hashan, Pasindu Manupriya, Chalana Anuradha, – Kaavindu Dulakshitha, Imanka Madushan, Hirun Anjana, Dilakshana Kavinda, Shanaka Didulantha, Nethum Sahasra, Navin Sahith, Dinura Dilmin and Ashen Dinuththara.
The Servatian’s are coached by Priyantha Abeysekera who is assisted by Rasika Lakshantha. While Nayanananda de Silva is the master in charge of the team.
Wicket keeper and opening batsman Nipun Achalanka leads the Thomian XI to the 117th Battle of the Blues. He has Hashin Dilman as his deputy. The final XI will be selected from Praveen Madushan, Akila Thiwanka, Hasitha Suneth, Ishan Jayawardena, Hirantha Lakshan, Mihisal Amoda, Lahiru Gimhan, Lahiru Dilshan, Raminda Pravinath, Maleesha de Seram, Sandun Chaminda, Kavindu Ridmal, Gisanthika Jayaweera, Avindu Nimantha, Nimanthaka Bhashana, Shanjaya Maduranga, Sanchitha Gimhan, J P Harindu, Hirusha Jeewadith, Voshitha Amarasinghe, Sineth Dissanayaka, Sac hira Rashmika and Nipun Ruchira.
The Thomian team is coached by Charith Palliyage with the assistance of Dumindu Hewapathirana and Dinusha Jayashanaka. W M A D Lakmal is in charge of the Thomians this season.
Thilan Prashan’s pace and accuracy would be the Servatian’s trump card while the Thomians can boast of left hand batsman Raminda Pravinath who has two double centuries against his name this season and passed the 1000 run mark. Right arm off spinner Hashin Dilman and left arm spinner Pravin Madushan who have captured over 80 wickets each are capable in turning the game in favour of the Thomians.
The big match in Matara is the third oldest in the island and is said to have been played continuously since 1900. It is also been known as the Battle of Ruhuna and Battle of Nilwala. St Thomas’ have a five match lead in the series with 32 wins with Tharaka Dushantha leading them to victory in 2007 while the Servatians have won 27 games and have been winless for the past 46 years since Nimal Munaweera led them to victory in 1971.
