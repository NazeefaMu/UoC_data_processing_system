Mythology demystified

A critic is not a superior being over a true creative writer. He is only an interpreter of the text he is reviewing. It is better if he or she is also creative artiste.
He can then understand better the creative process of the writer and writing. He cannot question the content of the creative writer because the latter has his or her viewpoint. Perhaps a scholar who might have a wider knowledge and sensibility could offer some criticism to the writer in a constructive manner so that the writer can improve the text. Usually writers accept valid criticism. Invariably it is a matter of Taste that matters.
I was fascinated reading some of the poems, which the writer Sanna Uppal calls merely “Muted Verses”. Muted is unusual for a title of a book of 54 long and short poems. Most of them are pregnant with deeper layers of meaning. If one is spiritually inclined one could strike an immediate connection with the subject concerned.
The bookcover shows a temple bell tied with strong and knotty chain against a backdrop of greenery, implying Nature that is identified with the Almighty. Muted-tied down with restraints that the writer cannot express her voice totally.
The book priced at $12, 95 is distributed by Litterateur Imprints housed at1st Floor, Valluvacheri Building, Netaji Nagar Kochi, India.
The dedication itself sounds mystical. Sanna Uppal says: To all those who wish to embrace and heal their truth in the fluorescent memory of the deep silence within and without. To my liquid consciousness.
The poet has a Master’s Degree in Philosophy. That speaks for her understanding the sublime thoughts in religious philosophy.
At a Literary Festival held at Udaipur in Rajasthan, India in the latter part of last year, I was fortunate in meeting some outstanding poets there. Some of them were women and one of them was Sanna Uppal. She is from Amritsar in Punjab and an unassuming young lady.
Speaking about the author, the publishers say the following which sums up her vision:
“Love is the only shade that colors our very existence and shapes our entire being, everything eventually falls under one vibrant roof called LOVE. In a poem, a word must be both as deep and as immense like an ocean, the most productive challenge, we are blessed in life’s mystery and inscrutability. Face it and embrace it: unleashing the creativity in you she proclaims”
Instead of commenting on the content of her poems which are evidently of superior quality of deeper spiritual nature, I shall single out at random some of her lines which I appreciated for your enjoyment as well.
From Dr Susana Roberts’ (Foreword Writer) quoted poems first. These lines I liked:
“Muteness as grey words is the chant that ancient temples chant / Grey are the lips that are sealed hard / not aqua blue, not emerald green / Grey is the colour of the cemented sea / the only god that rules is /the grey god”. I think Sanna the poet means Lord Vishnu who lie on the ocean. May be the Grecian God of the Seas.
Dry Robert quoted another poem. From that what I liked: “Silences speaking through words/ much is air to discard. /
Defeated sometimes/ like a drama collapsed.
The faded essence of her words/ the reality she created/ the golden mind”
Now, from Sanna’s Prologue, I liked:
“Nothing on this earth comes to you on its own/ everything is reverberating/ Resonating your cause/In consonance with your beats”
“Life is a journey/a journey of the self/a journey through the self/ a journey towards the self”
“The search for love is endless/But when it ends/if ever it ends/ it ends up at the feet of eternity”
Let me now show you some of the other line in Sanna Uppal’s well written poems of depth and facile writing:
‘I will embrace you/in the primordial mud of insanity/gaining virtuous surrenders”
