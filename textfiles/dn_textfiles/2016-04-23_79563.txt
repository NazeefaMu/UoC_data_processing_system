Gayle raises eyebrows with ‘Blush’ baby name

NEW DELHI : West Indian batsman Chris Gayle has raised eyebrows by saying he named his baby daughter “Blush”, a nod to an infamous sexism scandal which engulfed him in January.
The self-proclaimed “Universe Boss” left many people wondering whether the name was genuine after his partner Natasha Berridge gave birth this week.
Gayle was pilloried over his remark, “Don't blush, baby” when he asked an irate Australian TV presenter for a date live on air during the Big Bash League.
The 36-year-old was fined $10,000 by his club Melbourne Renegades and later made an apology of sorts, describing his comments as “a simple joke”.
But on Thursday he posted on Instagram: “We would like to welcome the arrival of our beautiful daughter ‘Blush’ to this world 2 hours ago”. He later said on Twitter: “Thank you all for the sweet and kind messages. Blush won't Blush, my baby.”
The destructive left-handed batsman received a number of congratulatory messages from fans and the cricketing fraternity. AFP
