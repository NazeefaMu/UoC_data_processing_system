Commission to investigate alleged financial fraud at Mihin Lanka

Co-Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday a Presidential Commission will be appointed to investigate alleged financial fraud and irregularities that had taken place at Mihin Lanka during the former regime. He said that Mihin Lanka, has been running at a loss ever since commencing operations more than nine years ago. It was revealed that the airline had owed Rs.4,860 million to the People’s Bank and Rs.1,700 million to SriLankan Airlines respectively.
Mihin was a bad political decision taken during the previous regime.
It was hurriedly launched badly managed and the losses stampeded. The Director Board was also highly politicised representing the former President, former Defence Secretary and former External Affairs Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vas Gunawardene. Air craft were also leased to the airline without following the tender procedures. These reasons have led to the loss.
“We are exploring possibilities to sell the airline’s license to a third party for operational purposes. The issue has been discussed during the President’s recent visit to Qatar and further discussion will be held in coming weeks,” Minister Senaratne said.
