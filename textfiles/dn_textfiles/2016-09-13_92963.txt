The lost kids, perhaps, become the best performers

Sidharth Malhotra on his new film ‘Baar Baar Dekho’, learning to maintain work-life balance and being the outsider who dreamed of making it big.
Q: You started the year with ‘Kapoor and Sons’. What kind of impact has it had on your career?
A: The feedback for this film has been very positive. The audience appreciated its craft — the performances, the world its characters inhabit and the emotions and relationships it explores. I have received the maximum love for this film. It is not a very big film and we kept it performance-oriented. There weren’t big sets, extravagant costumes or elaborate song sequences. The set-up was very basic. Director Shakun Batra wanted to keep the sur (tune) very real. My character, Arjun, doesn’t go through any significant transition nor does he have any big revelation to offer in the end, barring his changing equation with his mother. To make that interesting and engaging was a challenge, but it was a fulfilling process.
Q: In the upcoming film, ‘Baar Baar Dekho’, you play a man at different stages of his life…
A: All my films are very different. This role is more challenging as I am playing a professor who travels into the future. I had no idea about how a 46-year-old man or a father behaves. To create those emotions and to age on screen were exciting for me. It has been, emotionally, the most difficult role to play. The film is about how the present generation prioritises career and materialistic goals over family and loved ones. It is about appreciating smaller things in life. When my character takes a peek into his future, he undergoes a transformation.
In a way, I have been in that position too. I was not from the film industry and my dream was far-fetched. When I came to Mumbai, which is a very different world from my own, I focussed only on my career and let go of some friendships. I could relate to this character. Today, however, I realise that balance is required.
Q: How did you approach the role?
A: Nitya Mehra is a first-time director, but a very meticulous one. We read out different scenes, motivations, phases of my character’s life. Since it is Jai’s journey that the audience will be following, we had to keep him endearing in spite of his flaws. So ensuring audience empathy was a struggle which Nitya and the team worked on. Another challenge for me, as I just mentioned, was to adopt the body language of a 46-year-old. I started observing my father for this. I studied his voice and reflexes. I had to bring in nuances like moving less swiftly.
Q: What is it about the film industry that attracts so many youngsters?
A: I can speak for myself. As I child, I was not focussed on anything. I never realised that I could become an actor and tried my hands at different things. I was not sure if I wanted to play sport or do an MBA. I hated math and accounting was ruled out. All the lost kids, perhaps, become the best performers in a way because they are not satisfied with themselves and they want to play other people.
Q: ‘Student of the Year 2’ is going on floors soon. How do you feel about it?
A: We are all excited about it. I know Tiger Shroff is in it and Punit Malhotra will be directing it. I am very eager to see how Punit tells the story.
Q: Though you call yourself a single man, you are currently being linked to Alia Bhatt. Is there any truth to it?
A: That’s part and parcel of our profession. I took a while to get used to it. We can’t help but be talked out. My relationship with Alia Bhatt is old news, it’s been circulating since Kapoor & Sons.
I am still enjoying my bachelorhood. We are friends and have worked together. There is nothing more to it.
