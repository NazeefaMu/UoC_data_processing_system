Dottin ton, Matthews four lead Windis series sweep

Deandra Dottin’s second T20I century - the most by an women’s cricketer in the format - and a four-for from allrounder Hayley Matthews helped West Indies women complete a 3-0 series sweep over Sri Lanka women, with a 31-run victory in the third T20I in Antigua on Sunday.
En route to her 67-ball 112 - the same score as her maiden hundred in 2010 - Dottin clobbered nine fours and five sixes, taking 18 runs off Chamari Atapattu in the 16th over.
Following an early wicket, Dottin and opener Matthews added 121 runs for the second wicket, with Matthews contributing a 40-ball 34. Having taken West Indies past 150, Dottin fell with two balls left in the innings, but West Indies lost wickets off both those deliveries and closed their innings at 159 for 6.
Sri Lanka’s pursuit was wobbly as Matthews struck twice in the fourth over to dismiss Yasoda Mendis and Chamari Atapattu with the score on 14. With the side tottering at 42 for 3 in the ninth over, Shashikala Siriwardene and wicketkeeper-batsman Rebeca Vandort steadied the innings with a partnership of 84 runs.
The duo struck identical scores of 50 each, before Matthews dealt another double-strike in the 20th over to consign the opposition to their sixth straight defeat on the tour.
Offspin accounted for all five Sri Lanka wickets, with Matthews taking 4 for 18 and Stafanie Taylor taking one wicket. Shakera Selman, who had suffered an injury while fielding in the second T20I on Saturday, did not play this game and was replaced by Shamilia Connell.
Dottin finished the series with a tally of 154 runs from the three games and was adjudged Player of the Match and the Series.
Windies Women 159/6 in 20 overs (D Dottin 112, H Matthews 34, A Kanchana 2/24, S Weerakkody 1/21).
Sri Lanka Women 128/5 in 20 overs (Rebecca Vandort 50, Shashikala Siriwardene 50, H Matthews 4/18, S Taylor 1/22)
