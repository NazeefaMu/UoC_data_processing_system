Answering O/L maths paper using smart phone
Investigations commence

Police have started investigations into a student in Anuradhapura who answered the GCE Ordinary level maths paper using a smart phone.
Police sources yesterday confirmed that they received a complaint about a student who had allegedly answered the O/L maths paper by using Viber and Imo. The student has allegedly sent an image of the question paper to his friend via Viber.
His friend has returned the answers in the same way and the Officer in Charge of the examination hall caught the student answering the questions using a mobile phone.
