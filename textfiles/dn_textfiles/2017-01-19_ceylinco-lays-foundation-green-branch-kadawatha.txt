Ceylinco lays foundation for green branch in Kadawatha

Life insurance leader Ceylinco Life celebrated its 29th anniversary on January 14 laying the foundation stone for a new eco-friendly branch building on company-owned land at Kadawatha.
Located at 15A Jaya Mawatha Kadawatha, the new branch building will on completion have two-floors offering 5,870 square feet of space, with provision to expand upwards to four storeys, the company said.
The new building is designed for optimal use of natural light and will be entirely solar powered. It will also be equipped with the latest energy efficient lighting and air conditioning systems, will have a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park with space for 10 vehicles at a time.
The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO Mr R. Renganathan accompanied by several fellow directors and senior management.
Ceylinco Life recently opened similarly designed eco-friendly branch buildings in Horana and Panadura as part of the company’s steadily-progressing plan to convert as many branches as possible to sustainable energy. Among the other Ceylinco Life’s branch buildings designed to the new environment-friendly model are those at Wennappuwa and Bandarawela. The company also owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincolmalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, and many of them have already been converted to solar energy.
Ceylinco Life’s head office building at Havelock Road, Colombo 5 has also broken new ground in the sphere of eco-friendly operations with the installation of the biggest solar electricity system in the city of Colombo to date, with an investment of Rs 13.7 million to generate 63.18kW.
The company operates the largest network of 250 branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island’s 25 districts.
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
