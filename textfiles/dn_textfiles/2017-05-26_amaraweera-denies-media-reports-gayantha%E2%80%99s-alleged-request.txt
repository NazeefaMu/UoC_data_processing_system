Amaraweera denies media reports on Gayantha’s alleged request

UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday denied the media reports claimed that newly appointed Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to assign three institutions to the Land and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry.
Addressing the media at the Office of the Chief Government Whip, Minister Amaraweera said certain media reported that Minister Karunathilaka requested the President to assign three institutions: the Government Printing Department, State Printing Corporation and the National Film Corporation, that earlier came under his purview as the Mass Media Minister, to the Land and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry.
Minister Amaraweera said Minister Karunathilaka never made such a request. The institutions that should come under the ministries would be decided by the President after discussing with the Prime Minister and will be gazetted soon.
Minister Karunathilaka said he couldn’t even talk a single word with the President after he was appointed as the Land Minister.
“I created a background for journalists to find information without any disturbance. No journalist was killed or kidnapped during my period. I never forced media institutions to publish anything. Media institutions should be more responsible when publishing such reports, Minister Karunathilaka said.
