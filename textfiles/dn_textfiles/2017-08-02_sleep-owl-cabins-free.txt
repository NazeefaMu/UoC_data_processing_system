Sleep in Owl Cabins for free!

An adorable cabin built to resemble three forest owls is now ready for campers in the Bordeaux region of Southwestern France, and it costs absolutely nothing to stay the night. It’s part of an initiative encouraging city dwellers to get off the grid and experience nature.
The plywood shelter contains three floors, circular white beds, and an adjoined boardwalk overlooking nearby wetlands. Dubbed Les Guetteurs (“the watchers”), the timber strigidae were designed and constructed by contemporary art producer Zébra3, a project commissioned by artist-architect collective Bruit de Frigo as part of their Refuges périurbains (“peri-urban shelters”) campaign.
If you’re planning a trip to Bordeaux in the near future, you can book your free stay in Les Guetteurs – or one of the many other unique camping structures in the area – here. Honestly, who wouldn’t want to give up electricity for a few days to live inside a wooden trio of owls?
