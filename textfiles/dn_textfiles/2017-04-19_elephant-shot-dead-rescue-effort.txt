Elephant shot dead in rescue effort

Residents of Kombukwithakulam, Omantha, Vavuniya who found a herd of four elephants including two calves fallen into a farm well in the area on April 16, summoned the Omantha police and managed to rescue
the two baby elephants with their assistance.
As rescuing the other two elephants was difficult, they sought the assistance of the Vavuniya Wildlife Office in this regard.
Wildlife officers arrived on
April 17 morning deployed a backhoe machine to rescue the two elephants.
As one of the elephants was lifted up to the edge of the well, it came charging towards the backhoe machine driver, and a wildlife officer was forced to open fire at the elephant as a defensive measure killing it on the spot.
