Voting Argentines want big change for their dollars

ARGENTINA: “Change! Cambio, cambiooo!” chants a rhythmic voice on Calle Florida, a busy pedestrian shopping street in central Buenos Aires. “Dollars!”
It is the day before a presidential election in Argentina, but this is not a cry for political reform. It is the daily call of a key need for locals: the illegal money-changers.
Some businesses and workers rely on the unofficial “blue dollar” exchange rate to boost their income in the face of foreign currency restrictions imposed by the outgoing government.
Money-changers on the street pay up to 15 pesos for a dollar, 50 percent more than the official fixed rate.
But now the blue could die out when a new leader takes charge in the pink-brick presidential palace near Florida Street -- either pro-business right-winger Mauricio Macri or center-leftist Daniel Scioli.
Both agree the dollar restrictions must be lifted to draw in more foreign money and boost the economy. The question is how quickly. “I hope Macri does everything he has to do to improve the country,” said one money-changer working furtively on Florida Street. “The most important thing is the dollar. It is very high,” said the man, who asked to be identified only as Cesar, because what he does is illegal.
“I want that to change, so there is just one dollar rate and it is lower,” rather than the five or so different rates currently used, he added.
Along the road stood Carlos Quinteros, who supports his wife and six children by selling handmade leather bags and purses.
He fears Macri would abruptly devalue the peso by immediately scrapping the fixed rate.
“That is bad for workers’ pockets,” he said.
