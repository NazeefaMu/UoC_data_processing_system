Hubpoint to expand to four new locations

Hubpoint, a company that provides co working spaces in the heart of Colombo has launched ‘Grade A’ office spaces with additional facilities offering a corporate environment with state of the art modern amenities.
Sri Lanka and the world at large is seeing a massive increase in the demand for co working spaces with a fast growing start up culture in Sri Lanka. Hubpoint seeks to cater to this rising demand.
Hubpoint was founded by Thusith Muthumala, said that today there are many startup companies and they do not have capital to invest on modern facilities. “Hence they take office spaces from us and we have also observed that some even take spaces for 24 hours. This is to have meeting with buyers and also to host their international partners.”
“Hubpoint’s growth coincides with the rising demand for co working spaces and grades A office spaces in Colombo. “Also being close to the WTC and the upcoming Ritz Carlton in Colombo, Hubpoint is at a strategic location.”
Due to increasing demand, Hubpoint looks to add four new locations in Colombo by the end of 2018.
Members who use Hubpoint enjoy features such as free high speed internet services, 24/7 air conditioning, 24/7 security and coffee machines. It will also feature a corporate conference room and a 1,100 sq ft balcony for events. The glass cubicles with their own air conditioners also provide added privacy from the rest of the office.
Thusith Muthumala,Talal Rafi and Thasim Rafi are the three Co-founders of the concept having gained similar experience from UK.
