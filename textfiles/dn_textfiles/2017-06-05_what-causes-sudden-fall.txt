What causes sudden fall

National Training Officer, Accident Ward of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Pushpa Ramyani De Zoysa speaks about the reasons behind sudden falls. A fall can be either fainting or a more serious condition such as a heart attack or a stroke.
What can lead to a fall ?
A. Just fainting, a heart attack, a coma or a stroke can lead to a fall. These are the most common reasons for falls - getting fainted and being in a state of shock.
How can we identify the reason that leads to a fall ?
A. For an example a male or female person at the age of 40 or 50 can suddenly fall from the chair or while standing. It can be due to a sudden heart attack.
But a person may fall for the following specific reasons too.
* If a person does not take regular food and beverages,
* If he has been mentally suffering for a while,
* A recent head injury
* Being pregnant
Persons who suffer from Diabetes can fall due to a coma when the blood sugar level goes extremely high without his/her knowledge.
When should one immediate medical treatment ?
A. If the fall is due to a heart attack, we need to seek immediate medical treatment from a hospital. The patient needs to be transported to the hospital by a vehicle in the Prop Up position. If the patient was taking a drug such as TNT, it should be given to him/her (placed under the tongue). We should assure the patient that he/she will be all right and there is no reason to panic. No food or beverages should be given to the patient.
The patient should be monitored continuously while being brought to the hospital. We need to be vigilant on his/her breathing, pulse, etc and should be given artificial respiration or at least cardiac compression in order to prevent brain cells dying.
The patient should be immediately taken to the General Out <U+200B> Patient Department (OPD) of the hospital and NOT to the Accident Ward / Unit. This saves time.
How can we identify a stroke ?
A. If a person falls unconscious, if he/she looks not normal it can be a stroke. If a person's appearance is not normal, the best option is seeking medical treatment immediately. If he/she cannot speak words / sentences clearly, complains about felling lifeless in one hand / leg etc, has a severe headache, the face or a side of the body shifted to one side, it can be a stroke and should seek immediate medical treatment. The symptoms differ depending on the affected area of the body. Therefore appearance of one or more symptoms needs seeking immediate medical treatment.
What is the general advice that can be given to the public ?
A. All the people should undergo regular medical check-ups and find out whether they suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure or have high cholesterol level in their blood etc if they have reached middle age - may be even 30 or 40 years of age.All facilities are available free of charge at all Healthy Life Style Centres located at state hospitals island- wide to undergo screening for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, high blood Pressure etc.
