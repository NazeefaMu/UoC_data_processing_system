JVP leader asks why protest for summoning Shiranthi, Yoshitha

Siriliya Saviya jeep found left abandoned in Habarana:
Jantha Vikmukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake speaking at a rally, asked what the rationale was behind protesting the summoning of Shiranthi and Yoshitha Rajapaksa on suspicion of the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
"This jeep was donated by the Red Cross Society to the Disaster Management Ministry. Thereafter the Jeep was gifted to the Siriliya Foundation led by Shiranthi Rajapaksa.
The jeep was found abandoned in Habarana by the CID, after which investigations commenced" he said.
Dissanayake said that the CCTV footage showed a Defender Jeep following the vehicle of Thajudeen.
"Thajudeen stopped to get some water and after he got into the vehilce there is evidence that a Defender Jeep followed him similar to the one that was given to the Siriliya Foundation" he said.
He said that once the jeep was handed over to the Siriliya Foundation by the then Minister Felix Perera, the jeep was taken over by Yoshitha Rajapaksa.
" Yoshitha Rajapaksa was the one who used it.The colour of the jeep had been changed thrice and after the occurrence of the death, the jeep was left abandoned in Habarana" he said. He questioned as to if suspicion would not arise, given the circumstances.
"What is wrong with summoning them to the CID?. If they have an explanation as to why the jeep was left abandoned all they need to do is provide that" he said.
