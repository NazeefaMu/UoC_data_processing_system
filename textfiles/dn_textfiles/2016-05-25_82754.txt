SLC reacts to ‘unprofessional administration’

 
Sri Lanka Cricket has reacted to the article carried in the sports page of the Daily News of May 23 and we publish below their right of reply.
RIGHT OF REPLY:
Article titled ‘UNPROFESSIONAL administration leaves our cricketers in the cold’.
Sri Lanka Cricket is disappointed to note the deliberately misleading and malicious article of above caption published in the Daily News of 23’d May 20!6, written by Sports Editor Sa’adi Thawfeeq.
The Headline in itself is malicious and defamatory, and seeks to undermine the credibility and hard work of the elected administration of Sri Lanka Cricket, that has held office for a mere 4 months.
Please note the following facts that are pertinent to the vein and tone of your article.
+Sri Lanka Cricket, as with all other member boards, is bound by the FTP or Future Tours Programme of the lnternational Cricket Council, which scheduled this particular tour for May 2016. The FTP is fixed and finalized up to the year 2020 as at the current time.
+Sri Lanka cricket, as with all other member boards, is bound by the Mou’s that specify that all tour itineraries be finalized a minimum of 9 months prior to the tour.
+The itinerary for the current tour of England was finalized in June 2015, by the then lnterim Committee headed by Sidath Wettimuny.
+The lnterim Committee had also approved the A Team and Under 19 tours of England to be held subsequent to the National team tour, contrary to the usual practice of being held prior to National team tours.
+Alternate proposals - bearing in mind the weather during the current months, and the suitability of the venues, should have been made by the then administration prior to finalizing the tour itinerary.
The current elected body has no possibility of making any changes or change requests, as the itinerary was finalized in June 2015 - a full 6 months prior to their taking office.
+Notwithstanding the above, the current elected Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, made arrangements for an official to travel to the venues in England in order to ascertain suitability of facilities, security and logistical matters (as is a practice with all other touring countries as well.)
+The official travelling for the above purpose, was however not in a position to request any changes to the itinerary, due to the above facts, and due to the fact that the ECB had already finalized logistics, and tickets were on sale.
We reiterate the view of Sri Lanka cricket that based on the above, your article is misleading, and maliciously so, as you being a veteran cricket journalist are well aware of the above facts, and have chosen to deliberately disregard their verity in order to sensationalize your news piece.
Group Sports Editor’s note:
This article was not written with any malice towards Sri Lanka Cricket or its present administration. It was written to spotlight the shortcomings of the administration responsible for agreeing on an itinerary of this nature and failing to give what is best for our national team. The CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket has confessed in his letter that the itinerary was agreed by the then interim committee as far back as June 2015. It is therefore no indictment on the current elected administration.
However it is sad to note that the Sri Lanka team was exposed during the early spring under such weather conditions and pitches which are not conducive to us,
Apart from playing the first two Tests in the coldest region in England the itinerary also glaring exposes the fact that our cricketers don’t have any cricket for eight days between the second and third Test matches (June 1-8) where with a more common sense approach another match could have been fitted into the itinerary.
To quote the CAO: “The itinerary for the current tour of England was finalized in June 2015, by the then lnterim Committee headed by Sidath Wettimuny.
“Alternate proposals - bearing in mind the weather during the current months, and the suitability of the venues, should have been made by the then administration prior to finalizing the tour itinerary.”
I can’t see any reason why the present administration should react in the manner they have when the responsibility does not lie with them since the itinerary has been agreed by the previous administration.
