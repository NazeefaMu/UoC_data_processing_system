Point of view
Markets reversed course this week as positive news about the potential return of State-owned pension fund (EPF) to the equity market revived sentiment and helped the Index recover from its 17-month low of 6010.23 points.
Equities have been on a consistent downtrend over the last five weeks amid i) lackluster corporate earnings over the June’18 quarter, ii) a Moody’s report highlighting Sri Lanka’s higher-than-peer vulnerability to USD appreciation due to tighter external refinancing conditions in the next five years and, iii) price pressure on corporate heavy-weights in the banking and telecom sectors amid media reports of proposed levies on these two sectors.
News of the potential return of the EPF (which was a key institutional player in the domestic equity market and which has been absent from markets since 2015) amid more “sufficient safeguards to improve transparency and accountability in trading guidelines” therefore boosted sentiment significantly, causing the broad-share ASPI to gain 70 points following the news.
The gains on the Index helped offset the 42 point loss at the start of the week, and helped the Index close up 28 points (0.46%) higher while average daily turnover levels over the week improved marginally from that of last week (Rs.0.55Bn cf. Rs0.48Bn last week) .
The ASPI lost 1.1% (67 index points) over the month of August, adding on to the 0.8% lost over the month of July, and increasing the YTD loss on the Index to 5.2% from the 3.4% YTD loss recorded in H2’18.
The foreign equity sell-off on the Colombo bourse meanwhile eased somewhat over August, with the net foreign outflows over August falling to Rs. 0.59Bn from net foreign outflows of Rs. 1.20Bn over July. In the absence of any negative news related to taxes, markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Domestic and global pressures push LKR down 5%
Sri Lanka’s trade deficit widened to $795Mn over Jun’18 (cf. $554Mn in Jun’17) leading to a narrowing of the country’s cumulative Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) surplus upto Jun’18. The B-o-P surplus between Jan-Jun’18 fell to $1.1Bn from $1.6Bn during Jan-Jun’17 amid a widening trade deficit and slower external sector financial flows.
Higher import expenses on fuel, vehicles, transport equipment (particularly fuel imports which rose notably due to higher price and volume of crude oil/refined petroleum) outpaced the increase in export earnings from textiles and garments, bunker and aviation fuel and commodities (rubber).

In terms of service account inflows meanwhile higher earnings from tourism were offset by lower workers’ remittances. Meanwhile, although the financial account of the B-o-P was buttressed by the IMF’s 5th EFF tranche and 3rd tranche from the Hambantota Port sales proceeds, continued portfolio outflows from the Government securities market and CSE added some pressure on the B-o-P. Despite the country’s gross official reserves remaining at $9.3Bn, the LKR depreciated 3.4% against the USD by June 2018 and by 5.0% YTD reflecting not just the above developments in domestic markets but also developments in global FX markets.
The appreciating USD has impacted nearly all emerging/frontier market currencies as the USD has strengthened sharply this year amid tightening monetary policy in the U.S. and the intensifying trade dispute with China.
However, Moody’s noted last week that Sri Lanka remains among the countries most vulnerable to USD appreciation as its i) external debt repayment requirements increase materially in 2019-22 and ii) 46% of the GoSL’s gross borrowing requirement (18.5% of GDP) is foreign currency denominated.
