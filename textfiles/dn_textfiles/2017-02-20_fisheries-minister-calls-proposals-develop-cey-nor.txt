Fisheries Minister calls for proposals to develop Cey-Nor

 
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed officials to bring forward proposals and projects to further develop Cey-Nor as a profit earning public entity.
The Minister made the request at a progress review meeting regarding the resturant, Cey-Nor, situated in Colombo.
At the meeting the Minister said that in the past five years, Cey-Nor has lost a significant amount of profit due to management shortcomings.
The Cey-Nor storage complex and the boat yard in Mattakkuliya was leased to a private company under a low monthly rent of Rs 100,000.
This incurred a huge loss to the institute and therefore it was agreed to lease Cey-Nor to another company which agreed to pay Rs 1,000,000 per month, earning a huge annual profit.
Cey-Nor was previously leased to a private company five years ago for a monthly rent of Rs 150,000.
However, its higher management told the Minister that another company is willing to pay a monthly rent of Rs 1.6 million for this restaurant.
