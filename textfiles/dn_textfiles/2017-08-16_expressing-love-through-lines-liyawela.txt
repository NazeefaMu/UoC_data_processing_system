Expressing love through lines of liyawela

Jayasiri Semage discards the brush and pallet:
Painters all over the world use vivid colours and different media in expressing their beautiful thoughts. For instance, Leonardo Davinci painted Mona Lisa on canvas using oil paints while Michal Angelo and Pablo Picasso adopted the same technique in their time-honoured works.
Those who painted the walls of Ajanta, Karle and Ellora have found walls as their ‘canvases’ and used colours of their choice to communicate aesthetically rich imaginations.
“While so much emphasis is made on colours, I wonder why the line was not given that much prominence?” asks Kalasuri Dr Jayasiri Semage, Sri Lanka’s international art ambassador. “Lines can be equally expressive even standing alone. In fact, the earliest experiments in drawing-art were made with lines. Colours, of course, add value to lines yet the use of colour has made many artists to underestimate the significant eloquence of line which is the basic tool of art.” He adds: “The use of line has been practically reduced to cartoons and illustrative drawings.”
Arguing thus for the powerful aesthetic and communicative value of the line, Kalasuri Dr Jayasiri Semage has made it a practical challenge for himself. He was, so far, known for his effective mastery of brush with balanced use of colour. As a matter of fact, the use of appropriate colour had been his greatest asset. His media had been canvas and other surfaces including walls. His paintings depicting love, peace, innocence, lust and religious themes are well known both in Sri Lanka and abroad. Now he is preparing to show us how he has revolutionized his own technique in creating beautiful sentiments in our minds at his next exhibition. “No brush, no colours, simple lines. As a matter of fact, I have chosen liyavela as my language in this series of paintings,” says Semage. However, his usual themes like love, lust, compassion and joy have not being forgotten. They have found equal emphasis even in this simple application of black, yet poetical lines with a bit of added shades occasionally.
Nevertheless, one should not misunderstand that Semage is reducing his paintings to simple line sketches. For instance, a couple embracing each other and kissing passionately could be drawn as a line sketch. That is what, in fact, most artists do before they fill their works with colour. One can detect such outlines in almost every eastern painting. We can notice even in Semage’s paintings very clear and bold line drawing he has made before adding appropriate colours. Those are just sketches. What Semage is going show case in his next exhibition is not a collection of such simple line sketches. They are perfectly finished works of the different genre. The pictures he has drawn are effective aesthetic expressions generated with a high command of lines that almost always converge into traditional decorative liyavela motifs. The stylized flowers, leaves, buds, animals, and basic motifs like galbindu, liyapota, arimbu and palapethi found in traditional liyavelas are incorporated into beautiful depictions of human and animal life. His rhythmic ascending lines depicting various life forms culminate beautifully into such traditional motifs. In this new technique, Semage, evidently, has had the close influence of stylistic liyavela designs found in paintings of ancient Buddhist temple walls. His intimacy with traditional Buddhist paintings both in Sri Lanka and India has definitely enriched his vision to a great extent.
When closely observed almost all line drawings he has made for the exhibition appears to begin as simple lines but develop into rhythmic, creeper-like curves that become beautiful creatures full of life and ascend to a climax of converging either to a leaf or a flower. Such visualization, as a matter of fact, is rare achievement only possible to arise in meditatively trained methodical and insightful mind. The mind must follow the path of developmental line in a continuous, unbroken and confident way. Driven by concentrated and confluent mind the lines will form into beautiful curves impregnated with sweet and romantic feelings. Lines so formed will take shape of love, compassion and joy.
This, of course, is a rediscovery of the rich potential of line. Traditional art in the East shows that the artists who painted frescoes and murals had strong faith and trust in mastering lines. Before venturing into serious commitments of creating expressive, communicative and aesthetically enjoyable art, the students of art had to obtain perfect mastery of line. Anyone can notice this in Ajanta and Sigiri paintings. However, this fact is more or less forgotten or overlooked by many young artists today. They do not seem to have sufficient mastery in line, and therefore, they depend on the excessive use of colours and heavy use of brushes. According to Semage’s opinion, any aspiring artist has to begin with drawing liyavela and liyapota. Then he or she has to continue his practice drawing increasingly difficult motifs systematically until he is capable of tiringitalaya. Then he will be comfortable in mastering and apply any style of painting creatively.
It is natural for any artist, who can draw well, to get more attracted to sentimentally pleasant romantic visualizations. Even the poets tend to prefer romantic depiction of beauty. A good example is Selalihini Sandesaya by Venerable Sri Rahula. He has described in beautiful and even suggestive language the beauty of city girls and village damsels. Even the author of Guttilaya found occasion to depict physical beauty in describing the occasion of celestial apsaras descended to earth to dance to the music of Guttila. An artist who wishes to translate the imagery of these poets into paintings of hypnotic beauties has to visualize angel-like perfect physical images and has to meet the challenging task of bringing such beauties into ‘life’, doing justice to their romantic curves, laughing eyes, dancing lips and all sweetness. This is exactly what Jayasiri Semage has achieved even after leaving aside his brush and pallet (temporarily, of course!). He not only depicts physical beauty but also paints their sweet love, affection and joy as well. As a matter of fact, his revolutionary and restrictive technique of translating his imaginations to liyavela lines has made the task complicated and difficult, yet being a maestro of lines he has reached salutary heights.
About 200 paintings of dancing liyavela lines made without brush or paints will be on display at his forthcoming exhibition will be held at the Semage Gallery, No. 3, Lillian Mawatha, Mount Lavinia from Aug 8 to 31.
