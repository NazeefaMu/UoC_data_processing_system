Bee-keeping promoted in Addalaichenai

The Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre has taken steps to promote bee-keeping in the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat Division, recently.
According to Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre Agriculture Instructor and Officer-in-Charge A.H.A. Mubarak, bee-keeping development programmes had already been initiated at a Grama Niladari division-level.
The projects, carried out in the Addalaichenai DS division, have made significant progress at the moment. Most low-income families are engaged in the projects. Measures have been taken to provide them with training and technical know-how with regard to bee-keeping, sources said.
Bee-keepers receive a considerable income, Mubarak said, adding that more low-income families were expected to engage in the profession.
Under this programme, the Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre conducted a workshop on bee-keeping at the Addalaichenai District Agricultural Training Centre, recently.
