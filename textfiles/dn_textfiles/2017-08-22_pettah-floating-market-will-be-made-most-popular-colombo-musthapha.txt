Pettah floating market will be made most popular in Colombo: Musthapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said steps would be taken to make the Floating Market in Pettah the most popular tourist destinations in Colombo.
He was addressing a meeting of tourist industry entrepreneurs and Pettah Business Association members recently.
The minister said an open area was essential for tourists to buy Sri Lankan food items, handicrafts and to enjoy environment in the Colombo city.
“I believe, the Colombo floating market can be upgraded to that level. I will take necessary action through my ministry to coordinate the process and make the dream come true.”
The meeting was called to seek views of stakeholders to make the floating market a better place for tourists.
“Sri Lanka has exceeded around 1.2 million tourist arrivals during the last seven months. Tourism is one of the highest foreign exchange earners. The Colombo city will be made the best and the most popular tourism destination in South Asia and for that a favourable environment for tourists should be established in Colombo,” he said.
As a part of the plans, a food fiesta will be held on August 24 and 25 at the market.
The minister said more local food stalls, sanitary facilities would be established in the market.
He said several foreign investors were willing to invest in the project.
Musthapha said local investors would be given priority in developing the area.
