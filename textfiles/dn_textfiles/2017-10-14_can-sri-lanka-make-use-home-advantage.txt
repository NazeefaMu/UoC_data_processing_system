Can Sri Lanka make use of home advantage?

Sri Lankan Tuskers are ready to make the maximum use of home advantage that has not always worked in their favour in the final round of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series that gets underway at the Race course International Stadium, Reid Avenue today.
A pathetic run in to two consecutive plate championships in the first two legs in Hong Kong and South Korea to be placed in an awful fifth place in the standings has made the side low in confidence and that they will be out to make amends with a much better display today. Sri Lanka has gone down miserably since last year being relegated from second place to fifth this year.
There is plenty for Sri Lanka sevens rugby outfit that went through intense training for the past two weeks at Race course International rugby stadium in Colombo, with the winner of the three-round Asian Seven’s series booking a spot in the main draw of next year’s Singapore Sevens tournament and Hong Kong Sevens.

They are bound to give off their best but for the Sri Lankan Tuskers to qualify for these two tournaments are out of their reach even if they win the final hurdle in the third leg in Colombo.
Furthermore, the two top teams in the overall standings will secure their place in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series qualifier in Hong Kong next year and a good start to the series this weekend is a key factor.
Chairman of selectors Michael Jayasekara speaking exclusively to the Daily News said, “We have got a well-balanced young side with a blend of youth, experience and natural talent, hence I personally believe that we can definitely look at finishing among the top three in Colombo, concluded Jayasekara.”
What really happened this time around in the two legs is that Sri Lanka sort of had a bit of a look at their game through lot of young players coming in to the side, and although they hadn’t done much wrong they still finished overall fifth in Asia, Sri Lanka had to get a better team on the day to play the match physically and mentally.
Head trainer Nick Groube, who was a vastly experienced and well respected trainer in New Zealand, came in and put it right last year where Sri Lanka managed to learn some lessons and put them in to play to finish overall second in Asia just behind winners Hong Kong. It is a lot about the training and hard work they do purely under Groube to condition the players mentally and physically to be able to handle pressure. Sometimes the players totally get it a bit wrong like we did in the first two legs in Hong Kong and South Korea this time , but it’s about how you respond and Groube is definitely the man to take Sri Lankan rugby forward internationally with his international exposure.
A win or a top-two finish in Colombo will probably see Sri Lanka in the box seat to secure at least the overall third place this weekend, but playing in home soil will be tough competition, therefore we have to wait and see whether their power pack display they use to carry out in the past will be enough for them to seal an unpredictable victory in the end.
Sri Lanka will be drawn in pool “A” along with South Korea, China and Chinese Taipei , while the pool “B” will comprise 2nd leg runner-up Japan along with Hong Kong, Malaysia and Philippines.
Tuskers will play their pool matches against 2nd leg winners South Korea at 11:14am followed by China at 2:32pm and their final pool match will be against eighth placed Chinese Taipei at 5:28pm.
