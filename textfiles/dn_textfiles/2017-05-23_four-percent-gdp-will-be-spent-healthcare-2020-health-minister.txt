Four percent of GDP will be spent on healthcare by 2020: Health Minister

 "The government spends 1.6 percent of the GDP on health and it will be increased to 4 percent by 2020. This is a big challenge for a country that is rebuilding after a 30-year long war," Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the Commonwealth Health Ministers' Meeting being held in Geneva, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that the steps taken by the government helped the country bring down the maternal mortality from 1,694 per 100,000 live births in 1947 to just 34 in 2015.
"Infant mortality rate was 8.6 per 1,000 live births in 2014. Multiple interventions, both health and non-health, have contributed to this notable achievement. Recent WHO endorsement of malaria and filariasis free status is another positive development in the health sector," the Minister had stated.
"Sri Lanka had achieved much in healthcare by using resources efficiently and coordinating primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and placing well-qualified medical administrators to lead the sector," the Minister had pointed out,
Dr. Senaratne had stated that about 136,000 employees are serving in the health sector - including 17,000 doctors and 32,000 nurses. "Overall staffing per bed in secondary and tertiary hospitals is relatively low compared to many other countries, with a ratio of 1:4, indicating efficient use of available staff without compromising the quality of health care delivered," he had stated. "We are facing a demographic transition with a gradual increase in life expectancy of the population. We are witnessing a rise in non communicable diseases. To address this situation we provide free NCD screening to all at over 940 healthy lifestyle centres in the country, with accessibility to such centres within a radius of three km. I am to improve the quality and coverage of screening through government funding at little or no cost to the patients,” the Minister had stated.
The Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting were attended by Ministers and Senior Officials from nearly 40 Commonwealth countries. Minister Dr. Senaratne made the presentation on behalf of the Asian region on "Sustainable Financing of Universal Health Coverage as an essential Component for Global Security including the reduction of all forms of Violence".
