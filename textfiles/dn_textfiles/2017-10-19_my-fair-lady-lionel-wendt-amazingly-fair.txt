My Fair Lady at Lionel Wendt: Amazingly Fair

A tour de force at the Wendt, My Fair Lady met, and indeed exceeded Colombo’s expectations, playing from October 6-15, with two matinee performances thrown in for good measure.

There were weeks, if not months of anticipation, from theatre-hungry city folk, from the time the Workshop Players announced in May, the celebration of their 25th year with this time-tested Broadway musical. For six decades, the songs from Lerner and Loewe’s adaptation of Shaw’s Pygmalion have been favourites with children and adults alike.
Not the least why the musical was much looked forward to - and didn’t disappoint - particularly on account of its strong lead actors - Jerome L. De Silva (Colonel Pickering), Kanishka Herat (Professor Higgins), Amarsha Tissera (Eliza Doolittle) and Sulakshana Dias Amaratunga (Alfred P. Doolittle). With very professional sets and costumes that matched the original, not to mention their able supporting cast, they transported lovers of England and of all things English to a heavenly three-and-a-half hours in Edwardian London.
Young Herat was impressive in that he took on the role of an older man with aplomb, his acting a perfect foil for his excellent singing. His youthful good looks made him a better Professor Higgins than Rex Harrison, it seemed.
A seasoned actor in his company, he tackled the role of confirmed bachelor and eccentric phonetician superbly, displaying a maturity beyond his years. Pretty young Tissera with her elfin figure, sharp features, skillful management of the Cockney and husky voice rendered an evocative performance as Eliza. Unlike the other lead actors, she's debuting on the professional stage and Cockney Covent Garden apart, her 'I Could Have Danced All Night' lent the romance the moment called for, while she skillfully played a winsome Eliza in the post-ball scenes.
Herat and Tissera were evenly matched, played out especially in their waltzing in 'The Rain in Spain' and the scenes leading up to the finale.
Of the maestro, De Silva, need anything be said except that he continued to excel? His dancing in ‘The Rain in Spain’ was simply splendid.
Engaging indeed was Amaratunga as the portly Alfred P. Doolittle, who did justice to his role as 'the most original moralist in England', the only fault perhaps being that he looked rather youthful for the part. His two rapscallion henchmen complemented his role very well. Dinushka Jayawickreme as Mrs. Pearce was the most matronly of all housekeepers, while Harin Amirthanathan as the lovelorn Freddy Eynsford Hill rendered a very good 'I've Often Walked Down This Street Before'.
Surein De S Wijeyeratne's skilful directing showed how much more exciting a stage play and a live production is than a movie.
The attention to detail paid to costumes enhanced the quality of the production - shawls, straw baskets and posies adding to the charm at Covent Garden. Group dances, particularly those at Covent Garden, were feisty with much clicking of heels and a rustle of skirts. Minute attention had been paid to the sets – Covent Garden with a place to warm cold hands, the narrow London streets with their old fashioned flats, Higgins’ study replete with gramophone and period furniture that included a comfortable armchair where Pickering ate strawberry tarts in the afternoon, all of which lent the Edwardian London feel. Kudos again to De S Wijeyeratne and his team.
One was forewarned of the three-and-a-half hours but time just sped when it was wished it would stand still and it was with regret that one stepped outside the theatre doors. Judging by the enthusiastic applause throughout, which ended in a well deserved standing ovation at curtain call, it seemed the rest of the audience felt the same. Like Oliver Twist, may we ask for more?
