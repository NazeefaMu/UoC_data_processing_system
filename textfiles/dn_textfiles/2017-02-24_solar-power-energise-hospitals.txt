Solar power to energise hospitals

The Health Ministry will introduce solar power electricity to state hospitals. The monthly electricity bill of a state hospital is around Rs. 3 million. It will cost billions of rupees annually, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had expressed these views during a recent visit to the Tangalle hospital. The Health Ministry spends around another Rs. one million to repair electricity systems in state hospitals annually. The ministry will add all state hospitals to a solar power electricity generating system by providing solar panels to them. It will save billions of rupees to the government, the sources said.
Measures will be taken to commence a courier service to transport drugs to Provincial Hospitals according to a concept of Minister Dr. Senaratne. The minister had noticed that transporting drugs using trucks has become an issue because it is essential to maintain the cold chain when transporting certain drugs such as some injections, the sources said.
