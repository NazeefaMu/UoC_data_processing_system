First Sri Lankan  to engineer and produce Grammy Award winning recordings here

The Sooriya Village will host Kavichandran Alexander from March 5 to April 4. Kavichandran Alexander (Kavi) is the first Sri Lankan to engineer and produce multiple Grammy award winning recordings.
Kavi has recorded many top international artists including Padmabushan Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhat, V.G. Jog (Guru of Pandit Amaradeva) and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (son of the guru of Pandit Ravi Shankar) and the first Asian to both produce and record major symphony orchestras, such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic, The Saint Petersburg Symphony and the Hungarian National Philharmonic.
Music recorded by Kavi’s label have been featured in six Hollywood films including Dead Man Walking (Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon), Angel Eyes (Jennifer Lopez), Meet the Fockers (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) and the Bon Jovi documentary ‘The Circle’.
As his association with music and musicians around the world reflect, Kavi is truly a connoisseur of global classical music and most certainly the only Sri Lankan of this stature with the ability to speak fluently in Tamil, Singhala and English. Kavi is making it back home since he left Ceylon almost 50 years ago.
He will be conducting multiple meet and greet sessions and workshops, at The Sooriya Village and in selected cities away from Colombo from March 7.
At the meet and greet sessions, he will share knowledge, expertise and skills gained from his experiences working with world renowned artists, interspersed with interesting life stories and anecdotes.
By attending Kavi’s workshops, participants will gain substantial knowledge on purist microphone techniques, microphone control, microphone anatomy and his own unique microphone placement methods aimed specifically at capturing un-amplified, acoustic music.
