Premier to open Swimming Pool Complex of Prince Of Wales College on August 1

Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe will open the swimming pool complex of the Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa on August 1. A proposal to construct a swimming pool complex for the school was first mooted by former Principal of the College L B Gomes in 1996. The construction came to a halt later after he received a transfer to another school.
Former Principal J. P. Wijesinghe gave the green light to proceed the project. Again it was halted when he was transferred to another school. His successor J. W. Siriwardena obtained Rs. 44 million from then Colombo District Parliamentarian Jeewan Kumaratunga to make the project a success.
The Prince and Princess Colleges of Moratuwa founded in 1876 was a gift of philanthropist the late Charles Henry De Soysa.
To commemorate the arrival of the Prince of Wales , the eldest son of Queen Victoria and the Princess of Wales on December 1, 1875, the late Charles Henry Soysa decided to name the two colleges he was building in Moratuwa as Prince and Princess of Colleges of Moratuwa on a land of 16 acres. The foundation stone for the two colleges were laid by then Governor of Ceylon Sir William Gregory and Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. R. S Copleston along with philanthropist Charles Henry Soysa. Sir Charles Henry Soysa had his preliminary education at the Palliyagodella Vicar of the Presbyterian Church, Dehiwala and was a border at St Thomas College, Mutwal. His family had strong belief in indigenous medicine.
Charles Henry De Soysa gained indepth knowledge in Pali, Sanskrit and Sinhala languages from the Palliyagodella Purna Rajamaha Viharaya.
During the reign of 1896 to 1917, a Cricket Society was formed at the school. The debating team, cadet corps, library, laboratory, commerce section, tennis and succor teams, a children park were added to the college during this era.
The college has excelled in many fields including sports and produced famous cricketers and experts in many areas. The Old Boys' Association has been a formidable strength to the college since its inception. It has supported the school to develop the students' sports and academic activities. The two colleges mark their 141 anniversary this year. Over the years, the Prince of Wales College has produced thousands of men with great calbre representing many fields. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera will be present at the opening on August 1.
