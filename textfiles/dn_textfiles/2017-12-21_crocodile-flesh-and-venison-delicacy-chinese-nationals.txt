Crocodile flesh and venison a delicacy for Chinese nationals

Deer and crocodile flesh have now become delicacies of Chinese nationals who engage themselves in various projects in Hambantota.
To earn a fast buck, unruly elements now engage in hunting deer and crocodiles. Among the other delicacies of Chinese nationals are tortoises and other creatures, the wildlife officials in Hambantota say.
They claim a Chinese restaurant owner was fined several times after being produced in front of the court for possessing such animals.
