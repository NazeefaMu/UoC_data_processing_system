Bungling good humour

Ceylon Theatres once again reminds its movie-goers and re-iterates its commitment to bringing movies of a different caliber to the wide screen, thus providing variety in entertainment.
Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a private investigator and Russel Crowe is Jackson Healy, a hired gun with no patience for March’s fooling around. Directed by Shane Black who made his fortune two decades ago churning out hardcore action scripts for ‘Lethal Weapon’, ‘The Last Boy Scout’ and ‘The Long Kiss Goodnight’.
The two stars are the main attraction and they mix it up with bungling good humour. The footloose and fancy-free attitude looks good on Gosling and together with Crowe of ‘Gladiator’ fame, who relaxes into his role with the pleasurable nonchalance of an acting giant on a holiday. The plot keeps rearing its incoherent head in the form of Amelia’s mother. She’s Judith Kuttner, the chief of the California Department of Justice, and she’s played with an arsenal of hidden agendas by Kim Basinger who memorably teamed up with Crowe in 1997’s L.A.
Confidential, the modern gold standard in film noir. Basinger won an Oscar for that film. Settle in and get ready for some random lunacy dished out by experts, dig right in.
More suitable for Adults, ‘The Nice Guys’ is screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.45 / 1.45 / 4.45 /7.30 Fri/Sat 10.30 pm and at Empire Cineplex - Independence Arcade Square at 10.30 / 1.30 /4.30 7.30 Fri/Sat 10.30 pm
