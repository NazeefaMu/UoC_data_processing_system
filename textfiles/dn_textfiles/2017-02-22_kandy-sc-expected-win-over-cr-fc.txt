Kandy SC expected to win over CR & FC

CR & FC will face their stiffest test today when they meet defending champions Kandy Sports Club in the first semi-final of the oldest rugby tournament in the country, the Clifford Cup knock-out competition at Nittawela commencing 4.15 p.m.
This is the third time that these two clubs are meeting for the season with Kandy S.C. having won both the two previous matches of the league.
Will it be another cake walk for Kandy? Although, Kandy are firm favorites to retain the Cup, CR & FC have the potential to rise to the occasion so the clash is certain to draw a large crowd in anticipation of a grim battle for supremacy.
Both teams are famed for their fast open rugby with forwards and backs joining in the movements. In their last game though the Red shirts won after a hard fought battle they had more solidity in them, but when it comes down to basics, there is still nobody who can compete with Kandy.
Kandy beat the CH & FC in the quarterfinal with a cricket score have the advantage of playing at home. They play good quality run and pass rugby. They have triumphed over every side they’ve met this season at this venue. Another advantage they possess is that the climatic conditions in Kandy are ideal for them.
CR & FC one time champions, who last won the in 2006 beat Air Force SC in the quarterfinals and in the past few days, have been through a kind of training that is ideal to produce terrific excitement.
Kandy coach Sean Wijesinghe is planning to play a strong winning combination that would have no difficulty in overcoming CR & FC.
CR on the other hand blessed with some talented players is capable of harassing the defending champions and they talk highly of their back division that has played well in their last two games.
