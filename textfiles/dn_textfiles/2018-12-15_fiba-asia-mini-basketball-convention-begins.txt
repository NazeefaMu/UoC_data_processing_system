Sri Lanka Basketball Federation (SLBF) and Sri Lanka Basketball School Association have organised the FIBA event which commenced yesterday (14) and today (15) at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. According to the Vice President of SLBF Chandana Liyanage , FIBA Asia mini basketball convention aims promoting and simulating playful grassroots basketball for 5-12-year-old of both genders. In collaboration with the FIBA international, FIBA Asia regional office and international basketball Foundation it is combined with a kid’s event (age 8-12) and an international symposium with experts from region as an exchange of best practice in mini basketball coaching and training. We hope to simulate the interest of kids and coaches within national federation and school association and promote the game at grassroots level.
In addition we have introduced a “Basketball for good” initiative to engage children with pressing issues in their communities. Dr. Himan de Silva an Olympic Physician will make a presentation to kids on “How keeping environment clean and playing basketball lead to a healthy and organized life”.

"We wanted to popularise this sport from the school level and this good opportunity for the beginners", said Vice President of the SLBF Chandana Liyanage. We are grateful to FIBA Asia for giving their support to make this programme a success.
