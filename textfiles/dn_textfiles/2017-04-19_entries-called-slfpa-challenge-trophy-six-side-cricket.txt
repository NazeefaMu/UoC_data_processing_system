Arrangements have been made to conduct the annual six-a-side softball cricket tournament for the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association (SLFPA) Challenge Trophy on May 27 and the entries will be closed on April 28.
The matches will be played on a league basis and the winning teams will advance to the play offs. Trophies for the Best Team, Man of the Series, Woman of the Series and Best Decorated Tent will be on offer.
The event is organized for the Food and Beverage, other related industries and for members of the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association, so that staff members of all organizations can come together to network and socialize.
Organizers assure a fun filled day for all participants, supporters and spectators.
The entire food processing fraternity will take part in the tournament and organizers hope to make this the most popular annual outdoor event among them.
