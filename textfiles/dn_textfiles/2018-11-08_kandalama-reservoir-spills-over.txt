Kandalama reservoir spills over

The Kandalama Reservoir was seen to be spilling over yesterday as Mahaweli engineers recorded an increase of 10 inches in water and a spillover of 600 cubic meters of water per second. Heavy rains in the area have resulted in both spill gates at the Reservoir being open.
Mahaweli officers note that having the gates open twice this year is of special significance for a Reservoir which did not receive water for the last couple of years. Pictures by Kanchana Ariyadasa, Sigiriya correspondent.
