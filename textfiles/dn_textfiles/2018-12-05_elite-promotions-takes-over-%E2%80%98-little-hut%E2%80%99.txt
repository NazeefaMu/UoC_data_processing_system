The Sunset Bar will open at 5.30 pm for the ideal setting after a hard day at the office with the hard to beat natural ambience of the mount skies and horizon,” said Chairman, Elite Promotions & Events (Private) Ltd Richard De Zoysa.
The Elite Promotions management will also promote the entire Mount Lavinia Hotel as the most prestigious and sought after venue for corporate functions with the best prescription for music, food and beverage and innovative entertainment”.
