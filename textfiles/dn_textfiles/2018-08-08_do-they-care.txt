Do they care?

The chairman of the four-member committee appointed to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Monday’s train accident at Pannaliya, off Polgahawela, Operating Superintendent of Railways, V.S Polwattage yesterday told the Daily News that investigations of the site have been completed and the next step of recording statements from relevant officials will begin today.
“We will be able to submit the final report in the next two or three weeks,” Polwattage said.
The Rambukkana-bound train struck the Colombo – Kandy train which had halted at Pannaliya near Polgahawela due to a technical fault, on Monday evening. Several passengers were criticaly injured.
Polwattage, along with other committee members - Deputy Chief Engineer (Way and Works), Deputy Chief Engineer (Motive Power) and Deputy Chief Engineer (Signal and Communication), is tasked with producing a comprehensive report on the collision between two trains in Panaliya, between Rambukkana and Polgahawela, on the Upcountry Railway Line.
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry said that four railway workers, including the engine driver, assistant driver, guard and assistant guard of the Rambukkana-bound train involved in Monday’s accident have been interdicted, pending investigations.
Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has directed the Railways General Manager (GM) to interdict the officials, pending an inquiry.
The minister has instructed the GM to take disciplinary action against the responsible persons, irrespective of their positions.
“It is unfortunate that public confidence in the train services is lost due to the actions of irresponsible train drivers of this sort,” he added.
Sri Lanka Railways Additional General Manager (Operations) Wijaya Samarasinghe said that at least 36 passengers were injured due to the accident and 29 had been admitted to Polgahawela Hospital, Kegalle Hospital, Rambukkana Hospital and Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.
Eight of the injured have been warded at Kurunegala Teaching Hospital and one person is receiving treatment at Polgahawela Hospital, while 16 others have been warded at Kegalle Hospital. Four other are receiving treatment at Rambukkana Hospital.
The accident also disrupted train services on the Upcountry Railway Line. Some trains including the night mail train which was to travel from Colombo to Badulla last night were cancelled.
Polwattage said that as of now, train services can operate along one track on the Upcountry Railway Line and immediate measures have been taken to restore upcountry train services to their usual schedule.
Railways General Manager (GMR) S.M. Abeywickrama said that this is the first train accident reported with a number of injured persons, after he assumed duties as the GMR.
The Railway service has been in the news in the recent past over a number of derailments, accidents and commuter deaths.
An eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous said that as a person who has travelled daily to Colombo by train for the last 15 years, he has experienced several train accidents. “These types of accidents should not happen in the modern world. The safety of passengers should be the number one priority of the Railways,” he said.
“How can a train running on the same track approach another train? Why is there no signal to stop the train behind, when the train in front has been stalled? If there is no such signal, the question is whether the Railway operations centre has informed the driver of the train that follows about the stalled train in front. Who is looking after the safety of passengers?” the eye witness asked.
Another eyewitness, Anjali Ramanayake, who was on board the Kandy-bound train which had stalled at Panaliya in Polgahawela due to a technical fault, said that several passengers who were on the footboard were thrown out and passengers in the last two compartments of the Kandy train and the two front compartments of the Ranbukkana-bound train were injured.
“My head and leg are still paining and my father who travelled with me cannot even stand as he struck his leg badly,” she said.
