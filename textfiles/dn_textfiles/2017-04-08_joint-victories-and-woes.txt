Joint victories and woes

Several Government members have expressed their disappointment that the economic assistance anticipated from Western countries has not materialized. They argue that the Yahapalana has done enough to win special treatment from global powers that ‘stand’ for democracy. Under very difficult conditions government has attended to the HR proposals and cleaned up the state machinery. In addition, they have shown loyalty to western democracy by rejecting the feelers from the East.
At the beginning, the new government even went to the extent of stopping all Chinese funded economic projects, on the grounds that they were expensive and been negotiated with the former government in a non-transparent manner which gave rise to allegations of corrupt practices. In taking this decisive action the government may have been anticipating compensatory, and cheaper, inflows of resources from Western countries. The memory of JR days; how the UK government funded the lead development project of the 1980s, the Mahaweli river diversion scheme, created such dreams.
Middle income country
However of all the developed countries, it is only Japan that has maintained its economic assistance programme on a large scale for Lanka. Sri Lanka being categorized as a middle income country, much better off than many other countries in Asia, has led them to believe to be more deserving of concession attached Western assistance. The government has now renegotiated most of the existing Chinese projects. There is the possibility of a leap forward in cooperation if the Hambantota port project goes through, though at the political cost of a continued Chinese presence that has deep political implications for Lanka’s relations with India and other SAARC countries. The government is attempting to balance this out by having Indian investments and also by entering into the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India, while also having free trade agreements with China and Pakistan.
New Constitution
On the other hand the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) confirmed that they would guarantee a significant contribution from the Tamil Diaspora in terms of investments in the country’s economy, if the new Constitution solved the Tamil national problem and restored confidence in Lanka. TNA MP, M.A. Sumanthiran made these statements in an interview given to media. Meanwhile, on the question of the sale of national assets, Sumanthiran further noted that it had to be resorted as there was no other conceivable way around addressing the issue of the country’s economy. He indicated that economics is not their issue; as a true liberal bourgeoisie he added that the Hambantota port deal had to take place because of the heavy debt left by the previous regime.
“The economy must make a turn-around. It is not an envious position to be in given the state of the economy. We have to come out of this. The sale of State assets is thus necessary. If the new Constitution is made and confidence is restored, the Diaspora will make a significant contribution including investing in the country’s economy. The Diaspora is keen to do so. We guarantee that they will in fact do so. They are only waiting until the aforementioned aspects are done, in relation to the Tamil national problem,” he further explained.
While these agreements are spelled out by the Yahapalana camp there is a civil war declared by the GMOA backed by the Mahinda group. GMOA General Secretary Dr. Navin de Soysa said, the government had ignored the concerns raised by the GMOA regarding the existence of SAITM and the fraudulent manner it deceives the public! According to Dr. de Soysa, simultaneous to the strike, the members of the GMOA will keep away from private practice. He pointed out that the GMOA demands include firstly gazetting the minimum standards for medical education in Sri Lanka, secondly, the Health Minister accepting the SLMC Report on SAITM and informing the Higher Education Ministry that the SAITM was not in compliance with the SLMC standards, finally stop recruitments to SAITM and nationalize SAITM.
Political struggle against state
"We have provided timelines to the respective ministers with our demands. However, the government did not respond to our demands. Hence, we had to go for the last resort of taking strike action. It should be noted that it is not only the GMOA that will be engaged in trade union action. The trade union action will halt the entire country," he added. Many other trade unions, including the National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) are also likely to join the strike as it develops. About 150 trade unions and associations have joined hands with them to protest against the SAITM.
Inter University students Federation, National Trade Union Center, Association of Medical Faculty’s Lectures, All Island Nurses’ Union and Ceylon Teachers Union were also among the associations which would protest against the SAITM. The joint opposition announced that they would support the Government Medical Officers’ Association’s (GMOA) decision to engage in a country-wide strike. Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena speaking at a media briefing said the government had continuously postponed its decision on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) despite being held responsible to provide a solution. If all these true, an attempt to over throw the government is inevitable. Marx said continuous general strike is a political struggle against the state.
No wonder why, Mahinda has dreams to come to power in one year’s time. He is not bragging; if the country is confined to the southern Sinhala petite bourgeoisie, what he predicts may come true! However we have to admit that in the public perception, the government is lethargic in all fronts. President Maithripala Sirisena has tried certain Bonapartist interventions, attempting to overcome this sense of drift by political impulses. He has been having public programmes that enhance his image and improve his local and international network. In the SLFP Youth Convention where he invited UNP leaders too; expressed his intentions of holding the much delayed local government elections this year.
The most important promises made by Yahapalanaya were to remove dictatorial presidency; to eliminate corruption from the governance; finally the improvement of devolution and giving democratic solution to the Tamil national problem. But now there is a widespread public perception that corruption is no longer on the decline, but is now rising with a vengeance, while little or nothing is being done to put a stop to it. In relation to the minority rights presidents’ interventions have brought negative effects as pointed out by his loyal friend Azath Salley.
The public foolishly expect that a Cabinet reshuffle would reverse this negative trend. The real problem is that main leaders do not come to a common agreement in relation to the burning problems. But it is surprising those Tamil and Muslim leaders, those who played an indispensable role in bringing the government to power, are not yet prepared to leave the internal struggle they conduct within Yahapalanaya. On the other hand the MoU between the UNP and SLFP is only for two years. There is little reason to doubt that the partnership between the two parties will continue. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reject any agreement with the fascistic Mahinda group.
However more seriously, they should look into sabotage activities going on. The Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa continuing to hold together, for wrong reasons.
They think fascistic policy could bring them to victory and then they could save all benefits under threat today.
They believe that the popularity of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa remaining high, the government has no option but to continue to work together as a national unity government to ensure political stability. Hence they expect all who breakaway from the unity government to rally around them in near future!
