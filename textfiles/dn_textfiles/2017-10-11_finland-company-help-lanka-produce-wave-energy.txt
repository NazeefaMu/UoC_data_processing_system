Liljelund made this observation when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the AW Energy facility during his official visit to Helsinki, Finland on Monday (9).It was highlighted that eventhough waves are not used to produce energy in many parts of the world, there are higher possiblities for it to be used as one of the main sources to produce energy in future. According to the research conducted so far, the Indian Ocean has been identified as a region to produce wave energy. It would be used to produce environment friendly wave energy, electricity, clean the sea water and pump water.
The project was explained to the Sri Lanka delegates by the Chief Executive Officer John Lilielund while Chief Technical Officer Christopher Ridgwell, Business Development Officer Tomas Mucha and Chief Engineer Sami Pasanen were present. Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Norway Jayantha Palipana, Prime Minister’s Additional Secretary Saman Athaudahetti, Special Assistant Sandra Perera, South Asian Ambassador to Finland Rauli Suikkanen, Sri Lanka’s Consul to Finland Ashraff Omar and Finland - Sri Lanka Business Council Chairman Jayantha Samarakkoon also participated.
