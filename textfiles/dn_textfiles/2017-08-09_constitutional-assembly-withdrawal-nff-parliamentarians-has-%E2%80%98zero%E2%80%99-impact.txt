Constitutional Assembly: Withdrawal of NFF parliamentarians has ‘zero’ impact

 
The withdrawal of five National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarians led by MP Wimal Weerawansa has zero impact on the legality and proceedings of the Constitutional Assembly (CA), Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in Parliament today. 
MP Weerawansa asked the Speaker’s position over the letter submitted to the latter late last month informing the withdrawal of NFF from the Assembly.
“In our letter, we stated that the CA would no longer be valid with our withdrawal, because the resolution adopted in Parliament states that the CA consists of all 225 members. We would like to hear the Speaker’s opinion on this matter,” Weerawansa said.
The Speaker observed the NFF pulling out of CA has not given rise to any problem. “I obtained legal advice before coming in to this conclusion,” he added.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella observed that all 225 MPs need not necessarily take part in CA sittings. “If there is quorum, the CA can go ahead with its work,” Kiriella said.   
The CA was formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year to formulate a new Constitution. It has so far conducted four sittings.
