The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) 65th Convention will be held on a grand scale tomorrow in Kurunegala, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena showcasing the party’s strength and unity. This will be the biggest ever Convention in the SLFP’s history and moreover the Convention is expected to receive the biggest ever turnout of party supporters, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera told the Daily News.
“Tomorrow’s Convention is to be held at Maligapitiya grounds, Kurunegala with the participation of thousands of party supporters representing every district of the country,” he said.
He said all Parliamentarians and other persons who hold key positions in the party will be invited including party advisors.
