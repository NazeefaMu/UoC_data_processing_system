Perfect paut

Lipsticks have been a woman’s companion for ages. Adding a dash of colour to the visage or trendily coupled with your accessories, the product offers as many options as the brands coming in. Finding the right lipstick for your skin tone is easier than you think. Read on to find out more.
Lip colours and skin shades
Everyone’s skin has undertones of either yellow or pink. Yellow is warmer. Pink is cooler. Knowing your undertone is enormously helpful when you’re trying to figure out which lipsticks look best on you.
A quick way to identify your skin’s undertone is to look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, and you also tend to gravitate towards wearing blues, whites, and grays, you’ve got pink undertones. If your veins appear more green, you have a warmer yellow undertone. If they appear to be both blue and green, you are the lucky owner of a neutral skin tone (meaning equal pink and yellow tones), and you can wear any colour.
Still unsure? Hold a piece of gold jewelry and a piece of silver jewelry up to your face. Ignoring your personal preference, assess which looks better with your skin - cooler (pink) tones go better with silver jewelry, whereas warm (yellow) skin tones work better with gold.
To simplify the process, you can also stick to shades that typically suit olive, fair and darker skin tones.
Olive skin tones are generally neutral, so it’s hard for you to go wrong. Most nude, pink, orange, and red shades are going to look good on you.
The great thing about really fair skin is that bold reds and deep s can be worn. Avoid anything too light or with too much of a yellow undertone so you don’t look washed out. Dark skin tones deep plum, berry red look fantastic. Avoid anything too light or pale on the lips. Deeper shades look more naturally flattering.
Lip balm before applying lipstick
It can be confusing to determine whether you should apply lip balm over or under lipstick. You have to apply a balm beneath the lipstick before application because lip balm protects your lips while moisturizing it.
Yellow teeth due to lipstick
Frosty pinky shades, corals, and matte formulas are the biggest culprits when it comes to dulling and even yellowing your smile. Yellow-based shades like coral are popular, but play up plaque on your teeth. Matte shades are equally trendy, but that dullness translates to your smile as well.
Choosing a red lipstick
From the silver screen to the catwalks of London Fashion Week, there is one beauty look that is always on trend: red lips! Worn by actresses including Helen Mirren, 71, and Susan Sarandon, 69, time and time again red lipstick is the trend of choice for the A-list on the red carpet. The main thing is to choose a shade that suits the shape of your lips. Many women are put off by bold lip colours because of the risk of colour bleeding around their mouth. This is especially the case for older women, when fine lines and wrinkles around the lip area are more common. You should use a clear lip liner to avoid this from happening. The trick to wearing red lip stick is with confidence without feeling clowny.
Avoid getting lipstick on one’s teeth
Use this trick to ensure that your lipstick doesn’t transfer to your smile. Form an “O” with your lips, put your index finger through the “O,” and slowly pull it out. Voilà - all that pesky lip colour that was waiting to get on your teeth is now on your finger. Give your teeth a quick once-over so you know for sure that they’re smear-free.
Fading lipstick
Before you go over the first step, apply a little bit of foundation over your lips. Outline your lip first and then make sure to fill in your lips. Your end goal is to have lips that are totally covered in lip liner. Then you need to fill your lips with your lip stick.
Feathering lipstick
While outlining your lips is important when you want to prevent feathering, it’s not going to do anything to make your lipstick last longer. If you want a ruby red lip that will stick around for a few hours, you absolutely must cover your lips in lip liner first. That’s all there is to it. Simply grab a pencil and cover your lips with it.
Fuller lips
Use concealer to make your lips look fuller. This will make your lipstick go on closer to the colour in the tube, and make your lips look larger.Dab lip gloss in the middle of your lips.Using clear lip gloss or a shade close to your lipstick colour, apply a dab of gloss onto the middle of both of your lips. The shimmery product picks up light, making your pout look fuller.
Use a lip liner that matches your lipstick, and trace just slightly outside your natural lip line. Fill your lips in with lipstick, or just use the liner for your whole pout.Avoid dark lipstick. Rocking a nude or pale pink pout isn’t just trendy. It will make your lips look naturally larger. Dark s flatten the appearance of your mouth.Invest in a lip-plumping product. Lip-plumping products come in many forms: glosses, balms, sticks, gels, and pots. Applying these to your lips can temporarily make your lips look fuller.
The plumping effect will only last for a couple of hours, but you can renew it by reapplying the product to your lips.
Dry lips
Replenish moisture in your lips. The most immediate way to bring relief is to apply a lip balm with ingredients that lock in moisture, like petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Other hydrating ingredients include beeswax and Shea butter. Avoid heavy matte lipsticks as these can dry out your lips.Exfoliate your lips. Stay hydrated. You can keep your lips plump and moisturized by drinking 8 to12 glasses of water a day.Protect your lips from the sun. Your lip balm or ointment should also include at least an SPF 30. Be sure to especially protect your bottom lip because it tends to be a little more exposed than your upper lip.
Brush your lips lightly with a toothbrush in a circular motion. This can remove dry flakes and improve circulation, which gives your lips a small boost and rosy .
