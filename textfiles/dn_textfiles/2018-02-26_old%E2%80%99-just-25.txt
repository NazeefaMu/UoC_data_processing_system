`Old’ at just 25?

The human brain becomes ‘old’ at just 25, new research suggests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is found in the brain and spinal cord, changes its speed of movement in people older than mid-20s, a study found.
These movements are linked to breathing and heart rates, with CSF changes previously being associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure. Study author Professor Aneta Stefanovska from Lancaster University said: ‘Preliminary results showed evidence of a decline in participants over the age of 25, indicating that brain ageing may begin earlier than expected.
‘Future studies could provide further insights into various neurodegenerative and ageing-related diseases.’
It is unclear if these CSF changes are associated with brain disorders that typically affect the elderly, such as dementia. Previous research suggests the volume and weight of the brain begins to decline by around five per cent per decade when a person reaches 40 years old.
Findings may improve diagnoses
On the back of these findings, Professor Stefanovska added further research ‘may open up new frontiers in the understanding and diagnosis of various neurodegenerative and ageing-related diseases to improve diagnostic procedures and patient prognosis.’
The discovery came to light during the development of a new method of investigating brain function, which has revealed the stage in life when the brain starts to deteriorate. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Previous research carried out by Imperial College London suggests brains’ grey matter, which enables the organ to function, shrinks during middle age and is related to cell death. White matter, which enables communication between nerve clusters, also appears to decline at around 40. This is also when the deterioration of myelin sheath occurs. Myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve cells and ensures proper function of the nervous system. These changes are thought to occur due to a reduction in the hormones dopamine and serotonin.
Brain surgery could ‘spread’ Alzheimer’s disease
This comes after research released earlier this month suggested brain surgery may ‘spread’ Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid proteins, which have previously been associated with the condition, may be transmitted on poorly cleaned surgical instruments used during such procedures, a study implies.
After analysing four people aged 30-to-57 with brain bleeds caused by the build-up of amyloid plaques, researchers discovered they all underwent brain surgery when they were younger.
This may explain why the amyloid protein, which normally only affects people over 65, accumulated in the younger patients, the scientists add. Previous studies suggest tiny amounts of amyloid proteins can ‘stick’ to steel wires and be transmitted into animals’ brains.
Past findings also show abnormal proteins responsible for the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted between patients during certain medical procedures.
The researchers add, however, the build-up of amyloid proteins does not necessarily indicate Alzheimer’s disease, with none of the study’s participants showing signs of early-onset dementia.
