Climate change causing problems for Kitul tappers

The number of Kitul jaggery producers in the Kuruwita DS division has decreased to a great extent due to frequent change of climate in the Sabaragamuwa Province for the past few months.
Hundreds of jaggery producing families in Batatota, Mahawattakanda, Parathalakanda, Lassakanda, Sudagala, and Paladeniya face serious financial difficulties at present due to lack of production.
An experienced Kitul tapper told the Daily News that strong winds experienced in the area from time to time stop the 'Kandula' or the sweet toddy ('the lijja') stream of the Kitul flowers. As such, the tapper said, many Kitul tappers have given up Kitul tapping and few newcomers are entering this field.
At present, the quality Kitul jaggery scarcity is prevailing in the market and the price of Kitul-based products has gone up as never before. Accordingly, a kilo of Kitul jaggery is now sold at Rs.800 while a bottle of Kitul treacle is now sold at Rs.750.
