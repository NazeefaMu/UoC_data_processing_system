Seylan Home Loan re-launched with enhanced service

Marking three decades of service led banking excellence, Seylan Bank has strengthened its retail banking propositions.
As a part of this initiative the bank has re-introduced its Home Loan Facility with special advisory services and a multitude of benefits to offer Sri Lankan home buyers a hassle free and faster option of owning their own house, apartment, or land.
Seylan Bank’s Deputy General Manager of Retail Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera and Chief Manager of Personal Banking, Eugene Seneviratne elaborates on the customer centric approach the bank adopted to remodel its Home Loan Facilities.
“Today, we see public infrastructure, transportation and facilities improving in most urban areas in the country,” said Deputy General Manager Retail Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera. “With this urbanization, more Sri Lankans are moving to these areas and we see a growing demand for affordable housing solutions.”
Explaining Seylan’s focus on customer needs, Wijeyesekera explained that the ‘Seylan Home Loan Open Day’, is another important initiative under the bank’s revamped Home Loan Service. “It is an island-wide initiative we launched recently, to understand the pain points of Sri Lankans when aspiring to own a home. The first Open Day was held at Battaramulla branch and was received very well by customers.”
At Seylan we believe in providing our customers with sustainable financial stability and therefore we offer some of the most competitive fixed rates in the market which spans up to ten years.
Seylan Bank’s Chief Manager for Personal Banking, Eugene Seneviratne commenting in details on the internal re-haul of the home loan facility said, “We have redesigned our internal documentation processes to obtain the crucial information from the customer who will help process the loan application within a short period of time. Our ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) form helps us identify the maximum loan amount possible, in line with a customer’s financial eligibility - faster.”
Seneviratne notes that once a customer obtains the Home Loan facility, they also gain access to the entire banking portfolio of the bank, such as the Seylan Sure reward scheme and the Seylan Income saver and access to special offers by Seylan Credit and Debit Cards.
A Home Loan customer will also receive a pre-approved credit card to the value of 10% of the approved loanamount,with a maximum credit limit of Rs. 1 million.”
Seylan Home Loans can be obtained with hassle free documentation and is processed within 48 hours. With a repayment plan that reaches up to 25 years, customers can obtain solo or joint loans ranging from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 100,000,000.
