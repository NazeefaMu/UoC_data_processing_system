IPO Director commends Sri Lanka's efforts

Sri Lanka’s efforts to draft a national policy on Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions were commended by Director General of the Geneva based World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Dr. Francis Gurry
He said the WIPO supported twin national and cross-regional workshops on the theme to be held in Colombo in April will lead to legislation that will protect and give value to the intellectual property rights associated with Traditional Knowledge (TK), and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs) unique to Sri Lanka.
He said Sri Lanka enhances the national capacities in several spheres of intellectual property in the country in the recent years and continues cooperation and active engagement with the WIPO.
The Director General made these observations when he met Secretary to the Industry and Commerce Ministry Chinthaka S. Lokuhetti in Geneva on March 30 on the sidelines of the 37th Session of the Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Industrial Designs and Geographical Indications (SCT) held from March 27-30 in Geneva.
Earlier in his address to the Standing Committee Meeting, Secretary Lokuhetti, said the Cabinet had approved amendments to the Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003, which aims to facilitate registration of “Geographical Indications” in Sri Lanka and safeguard the interests of the producers and exports of Ceylon Tea and Ceylon Cinnamon.
The proposed amendment as an interim measure to protect Geographical Indications (GIs) has now been gazetted, and will be tabled in Parliament shortly and National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka (NIPO) is making preparations to issue GI registration certificates accordingly, he said.
Secretary Lokuhetti also met with WIPO Assistant Director General (Global Issues Sector) Minelik Getahun, who was invited by the Government of Sri Lanka to participate in the national workshop and G-15 member States workshop on Traditional Knowledge, and Sri Lanka’s celebration of ‘World IP Day’ to be held in the week of April 24 in Colombo.
The visit of Getahun will be the most high-level official visit from the WIPO since the visit of DG Gurry’s to Sri Lanka in November 2013, when a 10 Point GoSL-WIPO Intellectual Property Action Plan was initiated, and under which significant progress has been made in all spheres of cooperation.
The Secretary also met WIPO Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific Director Andrew Michael Ong, where the support of WIPO was sought to formulate the national IP policy for Sri Lanka, accession to Madrid Protocol, develop P Hubs within Sri Lanka and strengthen the capacity of the National IP office (NIPO), in terms of structure, human resources and skills, including the development of middle level management.
It was agreed that relevant officials from Sri Lanka undertake a study visit to the Republic of Korea in June 2017 to learn from the best practices in establishing a coherent IP strategy.
Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ambassador R.D.S. Kumararatne, Director General of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka (NIPO) Geethanjali Ranawaka, Second Secretary of the Geneva Mission Dilini Gunasekera, and Gihan Indraguptha, Head of the G-15 Secretariat were participated.
