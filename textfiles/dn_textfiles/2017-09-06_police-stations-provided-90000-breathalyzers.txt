Police stations provided with 90,000 breathalyzers

The Police Headquarters yesterday distributed 90,000 breathalyzers to police stations island-wide to nab drunk drivers.
The Police media spokesman’s office said operations to nab those driving under the influence of alcohol would receive a major boost with the distribution of the breathalyzer equipment which could estimate blood alcohol content from a breath sample. With the new equipment, the Police will intensify operations to nab drunk drivers and they will be charged in courts.
The Police will also request from Courts to impose a driving ban for those found guilty.
Drunk driving is a main reason for road fatalities in Sri Lanka, according to the Police.
