Unite to develop the country, says President

All must get together to develop the country and not compete with each other for political gains, President Maithripala Sirisena said. The President made these comments at the inauguration ceremony of the proposed Kumbukkan Oya Water Project in Kumbukkana, Moneragala on Saturday.

"No one can topple this government until 2020," he said. The President said 2017 is acclaimed as the year of alleviating poverty and bringing sustainable development throughout the country in the fields of agriculture, irrigation, health, education and infrastructure.
