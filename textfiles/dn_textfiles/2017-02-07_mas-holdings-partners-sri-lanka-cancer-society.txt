The premier garment manufacturer, MAS Holdings has tied up with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) to conduct a seminar on Cervical Cancer and Breast Cancer for middle aged women on February 7 (today) at SLCS Auditorium, Bullers Lane, Colombo 7, commencing at 9.30 am.
The objective of holding the seminar, sponsored by MAS Holdings in collaboration with the SLAC is to create the awareness of country's young and middle aged women, especially mothers about the dangerous situation of breast and cervical cancers and measures that should be taken to detect them early and how to get rid of them.
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina).
It is reported that over 12, 000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year.
SLCS, Public Education Committee ,Chairperson Merle Weerasinghe said that Cervical cancer can often be found early and sometimes even prevented entirely by having regular Pap tests if detected early.
She said Breast and Cervical cancers are reported from various parts of the country every year and conducting such seminars for women is the best solution to prevent such cancers.
Chairperson Weerasinghe requested all young and middle aged women to attend the seminar which is conducted free of charge.
She said the seminar will focus on the testing, diagnosis and treatment of cervical and breast cancer.
SLCS, Public Education officer, D.W.S. Jayaratna said information about cervical and breast cancer treatment, prevention, causes, screening, clinical trials, research and statistics could be obtained from the National Cancer Institute.
He thanked the management of MAS Holdings for their co-operation extended to conduct the seminar for the benefit of women in the country.
