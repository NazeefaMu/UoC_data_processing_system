The return of the King

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, is a 2017 3D Fantasy film from Warner Bros. Pictures/Village Roadshow. Directed by Guy Ritchie and written by Ritchie, Joby Harold and Lionel Wigram. Based on Arthurian legends, the film stars Charlie Hunnam as the title character, with Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen, Jude Law and Eric Bana in supporting roles.
The young Arthur runs the back streets of Londinium with his crew, unaware of his royal lineage until he draws the sword Excalibur from the stone. Instantly confronted by the sword’s influence, Arthur is forced to decide when to become involved with his power. Throwing in with the Resistance and an enigmatic young woman named Guinevere, he must learn to master the sword, face down his demons, unite the people to defeat the tyrant Vortigern — who murdered his parents and stole his crown and become king. And what more, it’s an adventure including giant elephants, dragons and exciting swordplay.
