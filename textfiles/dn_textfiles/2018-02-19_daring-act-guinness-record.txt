Daring act for Guinness record

R. M. Tharindu Ishara Metikumbura, a 23-year-old youth of Polgolla, Gokarella laid claim to a Guinness world record by performing a daredevil act of riding a motorcycle standing on its seat without any prop along a 100 km distance from Anuradhapura to Kurunegala on February 16. He performed the feat by locking the handle, gear and the accelerator at a speed of 50 to 60 mph and by balancing on the seat. Starting off from near the 2nd km post in Anuradhapura at 10.26 a.m., he finished off near the Saragama wewa in Kurunegala. (Picture by Amila Prabath Wanasinghe, Anuradhapura Central Group)
