MATHS CRACKING MANTRA!

Numbers strike fear for many. Mathematics reminds us of a giant monster with uncountable symbols and formulas floating around our head all the time. However when it comes to the Mathematical Olympiad, the monster tends to grow bigger.
For Neathan Fernando doing maths is a passion rather than a penance. The year nine student of the British School in Colombo cracked some profound maths problems and managed to rank as number one among the Upper Primary awardees in the South East Asia Maths Olympiad (SEAMO). Neathan won a Gold medal at the event which was held in November 2017. Students from around 10 countries: USA, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mongolia, India and Sri Lanka took part in the event.
“I got the opportunity to take part in the event through my school. This was the first time that a school from Sri Lanka took part in SEAMO. Around 50 of us from the British School in Colombo and Elizabeth Moir School were chosen to take part in SEAMO 2017. We were picked after assessing our grades from our report cards. The students with the best grades made it to the competition,” Neathan said. 
Incepted in 2016, SEAMO is aimed at promoting interest in mathematics and logical reasoning among primary and secondary school students by assessing their practical knowledge. The SEAMO syllabus is developed based on the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad curriculum. It is a comprehensive syllabus which exposes students to in-depth, stimulating and interesting mathematical problems. They are requested to solve 25 mathematical problems in 90 minutes. It gives them the opportunity to identify their mathematical talents through creative challenges.
The competition was held at the British School in Colombo’s examination hall. Neathan says that around 15 Sri Lankan students sat for the exam in the Upper Primary category.
“The exam consisted twisted mathematical questions in multiple choice format. Students are given space to assess their talent and improve their mathematical skills,” Neathan explained.
He says that though their exact score was not revealed they were informed about the their output.
The first problems are the easiest, and the problems get progressively more difficult until the end. The SEAMO examination comprises of six papers for Lower Primary, Middle Primary, Upper Primary, Junior, Intermediate and Senior sections.
“The last part of the exam paper was the toughest bit. Some of the word problems were tricky to solve,” noted the enthusiastic, innovative and committed young learner.
He says that what he enjoys most about maths is the kick you get when you solve a problem.
“This is especially true when it is something you have been thinking of as impossible for a long time, and it suddenly becomes obvious. That ‘a-ha’ moment – it’s fun,” he enthused.

Since the question paper is the same one which is distributed in all the countries which took part in the competition, the level of difficulty of the exam is the same. Thus the Olympiad sets a clear benchmark for Sri Lankan students about their performance as compared to international students.
“Mr. Bala, Ms. Chandini, and Mr. Jose helped me prepare for the Olympiad. I am also grateful to Richard Hester for setting the foundation for the subject. I started to love maths because of the way he taught me in the primary school. The British School in Colombo guided and motivated me on my success,” he said.
Neathan’s father is the well known film producer and scholar Dr. Arosha Fernando. His mother, Dr Madhu Fernando, is a leading project management scholar. He has two younger sisters Neve and Nikol who are also studying at the British School.
Neathan’s ambition is to become a software engineer. He says that he chose that profession because IT will have a bigger role to play in the world in the future.
Apart from being a maths prodigy, Neathan is also into world history. Greek and Roman history has a special place in his heart and he was inspired by the Olympians and the Greek war heroes in writing his first novel ‘Apollo and the Return of Ouranos’. The book was published in September 2016. He is currently penning his second book, a detective novel. It will be launched soon.
“My debut novel deals with a story which brings Greek mythology to the modern world. Though Greek and Roman history is not exactly a part of our school syllabus I have a special interest towards the subject. Greek and Roman myths intrigue me and I am a fan of movies like the ‘Percy Jackson’ series,” Neathan said adding that he has always scored an A plus for history.
He is also an ardent reader and loves spending whatever free time he has with a book he loves.

Neathan says that SEAMO is a unique platform which provides resources for students of various levels to hone their problem-solving skills and to prepare for more challenging mathematical competitions in the future such as the International Math Olympiad. He encourages more students to try their hand at taking part in the SEAMO competition.
“Do not be afraid to take on challenges. Do not hesitate to take part in events of such caliber and prove your worth,” he concluded with a smile.
