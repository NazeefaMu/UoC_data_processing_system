Chandrika hails consensual politics in Maldives

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga yesterday hailed the agreement arrived at by the political parties of two former Presidents of the Maldives, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Mohamed Nasheed and two other Opposition Parties.
She said the agreement will help ensure democratic governance and guarantee civil and political rights to the citizens of the Maldives. “Sri Lanka and the Maldives have enjoyed an abiding and close relationship for many centuries,” she said.
“I believe that our countries, afflicted by conflicts, need to build a united front of Political and Civil Society groups in our struggle against poverty and ignorance and for a just and equitable society and honest and fair governance,” she said.
Former President Kumaratunga said: “We have confidence that President Abdulla Yameen and the Maldivian Government will extend their fullest support to the enterprise of strengthening democracy, democratic institutions and fundamental freedoms in the Maldives.”
