Fusion of myths, legends and art

Martin Russell writing his monograph on the art of George Keyt has said, “They represent a powerful and self confident development of the Indian tradition.” The contemporaries as his David Paynter, Justin Deraniyagala and Harry Pieris received their art education in Europe and they introduced the art traditions and techniques of the European artists into Sri Lanka.
George Keyt was the son of Henry Keyt and Constance Sproule born in Ampitiya close to Kandy on April 17, 1901 and he passed away in a private hospital in Colombo at the age of 92 on July 31, 1993. George Keyt on the other hand relied on the art tradition of India which he skilfully evolved into a distinctive style of painting and drawings spanning over seven decades of his chequered career as an artist of Sri Lanka.
At first Keyt attended St.Helen’s Gilrl School in Kalutara, and later he received his secondary education at Trinity College Kandy. As a student at Trinity College he developed a keen interest in art and poetry. When riots broke out in Kandy in 1915, he sketched some scenes of the riots for his principal Gordon Fraser and won his admiration for his skill in capturing the incidents. He had the distinction of selling his first Biblical picture he painted to Mrs. Dias thereby displayed his early prospects of an artist in the making. In 1918 when he was 18 years old he left school for employment in Colombo at Studio Plate the then the leading firm of photographers where he learnt the art of improving the negatives with his brush. His interest in art made him study the elements of art from George de Niese the well known artist in the art circles in Colombo.
The Buddhist revival movement in the 1920s, gave Keyt the opportunity to write poetry, stories and articles on Buddhist themes which were was illustrated within drawings and they were published in W.B. Bastian’s Buddhist annuals. Keyt’s early painting Women Bathing exhibited for one night at the Purcell Room in Colombo was painted in water colours or gouche showed a woman wearing a cloth for bathing. This figure appeared similar to a stone carving of Buddhist or Hindu figure but not statuesque, on the contrary the figure suggested movement. The figure appeared to remain in that position for not more than a fraction of a second. Her left arm rests on her thigh and the rest of her figure showed torque and movement.
Pablo Neruda the Chilean poet then living in Colombo impressed upon him to draw from life. This resulted in painting Govindamma the temple dancer showing her voluptuous figure. Later Keyt was the son of Henry Keyt and Constance Sproule born in Ampitiya close to Kandy on April 17, 1901 and lie passed away in a private hospital in Colombo at the age of 92 on July 31, 1993. was influenced by the art of Rabindranath Tagore and Abhindranath Tagore and the Bengali school of art. The work of Cezanne and the French art helped him to change his style of painting. Justin Deraniyagala had a full control of colour and composition in painting his figures. Keyt on the other hand painted thinly outlining his figures with a thick line using bright colours mixed with either petrol or turpentine on canvas or jute. The formation of the ’43 Group through the initiative of Lionel Wendt who was well known for his photography and also as a pianist, gave the opportunity to artists to exhibit their work in Sri Lanka and abroad. The translation of the Sanskrit poems of Shri Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda by Keyt with the help of Harold Peiris who was a scholar form Oxford was published in 1940, when Keyt was living in Bombay. The central theme in Gita Govinda , was the sublime love of Radha and Krishna gave Keyt a poignant theme to paint. He painted Krishna’s body in blue and Radha’s in golden yellow.
Keyt in painting another work Jalaja named after a South Indian dancer portrayed her figure in a captivating manner. When he painted Woman and Bird he aroused a sense of curiosity in the mind of the viewer. The appearance of the falling blue of her garment with the foliage and the bird painted with a low note give this feeling. His favourite themes centred around Sita, Parvati and Damayanti portrayed moods and feelings. The portrayal of the Indian heroes and heroines described in art and poetry Nayika, conveyed his style of painting portraits. The Indian epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha formed a wide range of themes for him to express himself in a series of paintings which won the admiration of Rasikas. It is apparent that he derived his influence from the art and sculpture of India especially Ajanta, Bagh, Khajuravo, Konak and also Vatsyana’s Kamasutra – the Hindu treatise of intimacy between man and woman. According to Keyt the intimacy or love between man and woman forms sensuous aspect of love which he described as Sachitananda – the inner happiness and not carnal desire.

He also painted on the Shiva theme and his notable paintings included Sringara Rasa, the Lord’s Departure, Shri Krishna and the Gopis, Varsha, Vihara, Ragas, Raganis, Sita and Parvati. His large scale work was Gotatmi Vihara Murals in Borella in which he depicted some selected episodes from the life story of the Buddha based on the description given in the Classical Sinhala text Pujavaliya. In painting the Gotami murals he painted life-size figures following the style of Hindu and Buddhist art in India and Sri Lanka. But he deviated from the traditional art of the sittaras of the Kandyan period. He drew his figures imaginatively showing the dresses and jewellery worn by the Sakyas. When he painted the murals he never made any preliminary sketches as such. Instead the images were drawn straight away on the walls and his style evolved naturally.
The Buddha was depicted throughout as the Great Compassionate One and His figure dominated in a heroic scale. The most striking episode in the murals is the Mara Yuddhaya, the conquest of the forces of Mara and this scene has some resemblance to Pablo Picaso’s famous painting Guernica the destruction of the small town by the same name in Spain, by bombing during the Spanish civil war. The forces of Mara have been shown disturbing the calm and serene mind of the Buddha. This was shown with the weird looking masks worn by the dancers when they perform Thovil in the deep south of Sri Lanka. Keyt used them in painting Mara Yuddhaya, the evil forces of Mara.
Keyt once explained how he painted, “I spent several years in India. The Ajanta frescoes, Rajasthan murals and Jain miniatures inspired me. He also added “each work has about four stages.” When he started painting he used to stop after each stage and review his work and made the necessary modifications. He painted using varied styles on still life, landscape portraiture and village life which he did after he moved away from urban life and went to live in Harispattuwa at first, before he moved to live among the Kandyan peasantry in Sirimalwatte. He had the penchant to use bright colours. The simplicity of his designing gave strength to his figures which he combined both with ancient and modern styles. Keyt had understood the Bhakti cult of the Vaishnavites and possessed perceptiveness in employing the Indian mythology and legend and created poetic metaphors when he painted his figures. He was pre-occupied while he painted mountains and their slopes, expanse of water, parks, trees and buildings. A change was made in painting when he gave up naturalistic style and then relied on calligraphic line. He drew figures showing full face of women and men or their profile, three quarter face all in one, limbs and garments which he displayed using bright colours. His paintings were exhibited with others in Colombo. The notable exhibition was held with Justin Deraniyagala at the National Art Gallery in Colombo, sponsored by the Ceylon Society of Arts. Some of his selected paintings are on display at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, Birla Museum of Modern Art in Calcutta, the Modern Museum of Art in Bombay and also at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Keyt is undoubtedly the painter of our time who interpreted for us subjects from Hindu mythology and legend giving them a contemporary meaning.
