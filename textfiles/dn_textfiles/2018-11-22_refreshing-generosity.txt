Refreshing generosity

The 25th Scholarship Award Ceremony sponsored by the Foundation was held at the BMICH recently. The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation was graced by a delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.
The Agonshu sect was founded in 1978 by Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera. Born on January 5, 1921, the Thera was in a difficult phase of life due to illness. Although he decided to join armed forces during the World War II, his health condition did not let him fulfill that aspiration. The doctors predicted that he cannot live more than 25 years. The Thera, still a layman then, was largely affected by this medical prediction. He was on the verge of committing suicide.
After becoming a Mahayana monk, Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera was engaged in extensive research on the Buddha’s teachings.
He travelled to a number of countries to pass on the Buddha’s teachings. He combined the traditions of Theravada, Mahayana and Tibet Buddhism and founded the Agonshu sect. Within a short span of time, the Agonshu sect became an instrumental tradition of Buddhist teachings across the globe. Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera became an iconic figure among the Buddhists who took up Agonshu tradition.
The scholarship programme has produced doctors, engineers, university lecturers and other scholars. The scholarship, which includes three uniforms, shoes and socks, and exercise books in addition to Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary, feeds its holder till they pass A-Ls. Medical College students will get a coupon.
Every province, except for North, has been benefited by the scholarship programme. The programme is coordinated by Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation under the supervision of its Director General Somasiri Addarapthirana.
