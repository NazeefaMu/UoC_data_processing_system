Flu like illness reported from several parts - Chief Epidemiologist

There is no reason to panic about the flu like illness reported from some parts of the country now, Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige told the Daily News last night. It is a normal phenomena that takes place during this time of the year, he said.
According to Dr. Ginige, nine patients had died due to pneumonia (acute respiratory infection) in Mullaitivu last month. Two of them were patients transferred to Mullaitivu from another area. Seven patients are now receiving in-house treatment.
A special team had been sent to investigate the incident.
Dr. Ginige pointed out that the samples of the patients have already brought to Colombo and have been tested negative for Influenza B. "But it is impossible to rule out the possibility of Influenza hundred percent. Maybe it is Influenza B. But no abnormal number of patients have been reported from any part of the country so far and the surveillance will continue as usual.
"The Rajarata University students did not have any complications and they just had flu like symptoms. This is the usual flu circulating in the country during this season every year," he added.
