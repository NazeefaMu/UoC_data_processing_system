SRK’s and Imtiaz Ali’s film gets  a tentative title - The Ring!

 
Shah Rukh Khan and Imtiaz Ali’s first collaboration is being looked upto with great enthusiasm by fans. It seems the working title of Shah Rukh Khan’s next is Production No. 52. The Imtiaz Ali-helmed project is Red Chillies Entertainment’s 52nd project, hence the title. But we’ve come to learn that the film also has a tentative title: The Ring. That’s what a trade source told us on condition of anonymity. The story behind the title? Still unknown.
The film, which sees SRK opposite Anushka Sharma, is a love story but as the superstar revealed recently, “Imtiaz has a different language of love. I told him I wanted to do a happy love story. And this is one, but keeping my age in mind, it’s not an upbeat, young love story. But, Imtiaz has a nice take on it. And hopefully, people will like it.”
Anushka and SRK fly to Budapest later this month to begin filming for the romantic flick. Shah Rukh will start filming with Anushka Sharma in Budapest, Hungary. The director has wanted to work with the superstar since a long time. King Khan also revealed in an interview that Imtiaz has always discussed films with him even though he was not a part of those flicks. The coming year is an action-packed one for the actor. The release of Rahul Dholakia’s Raees will be early in the year and he also has Aanand L Rai’s next. The actor will also be seen as a psychiatrist in Gauri Shinde’s film with Alia Bhatt.
