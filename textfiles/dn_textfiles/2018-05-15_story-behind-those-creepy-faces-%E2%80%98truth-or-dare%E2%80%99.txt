Story behind those creepy faces  in the ‘Truth or Dare’

The movie “Truth or Dare” follows a group of college students forced to play the game after a curse follows them home from spring break.
But if you’ve seen trailers for the thriller starring Lucy Hale, you may know the movie for the wide-eyed, creepy smiling faces seen in every teaser.
In the movie, the faces are the result of a demon who makes the players hallucinate and see altered versions of friends and strangers. They’re extremely creepy to look at and the actors themselves didn’t even know just how creepy they were until after filming was complete.
“You know, when we were filming, I think, Jeff, our director, had an idea of what he wanted the face to look like, but the actors didn’t really know [what it would be],” Lucy Hale told Insider of the demonic faces. “We were just told to smile really big and put our chin down and they were going to do the rest in effects and CGI later.”
There’s a line in the movie where Hale’s character, Olivia, actually refers to look as messed up Snapchat filters. Hale says that line was added later as a result of the stars’ reactions to the faces in real time. Insider
