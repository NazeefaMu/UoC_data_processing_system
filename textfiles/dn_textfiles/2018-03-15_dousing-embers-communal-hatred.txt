Dousing the embers of communal hatred

Peace is slowly returning to the troubled Central province after a week of communal discord that saw the loss of two lives and the destruction of property- and the imposition of a countrywide State of Emergency as well as a ban on several social media platforms.
The events highlighted in no uncertain terms that, despite the bitter experiences of a thirty year war in the North and East of the country, communal hatred is still alive and well. It also confirmed that there are organisations posing as patriotic groups who are willing to exploit these sentiments to achieve their own objectives.
Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Central Province in the aftermath of the clashes. President Sirisena met with officials to direct measures to curb the violence while Premier Wickremesinghe visited the affected areas to inspect first-hand the destruction caused by the riots.
Investigations are now underway to determine how the clashes gathered momentum and spread in such a short time. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that it was organised rather than spontaneous. Investigators point out that the road rage incident which triggered the violence in Digana occurred weeks before the rioting. Clashes did not erupt even when the victim died in hospital a week after the incident. They began only at the funeral of the victim.
Nevertheless, the government came in for harsh criticism from several quarters for the events first in Ampara and then in Digana and Teldeniya. It has been criticised for not being sufficiently prepared for the snowballing chain of events. The Police Department has been taken to task for not acting decisively enough to quell the violence when it first emerged.
National conflict
While some of these criticisms do raise valid concerns, the government did eventually enact measures that prevented the violence from escalating into a full blown national conflict that would have had disastrous consequences locally and internationally.
Authorities in government point out that on the one hand the government is accused of inaction and inefficiency while on the other hand it is also criticised for imposing a countrywide State of Emergency (instead of it being confined to either the Kandy district or the Central Province) and for restricting freedom of expression through the ban on social media platforms.
They point out that while these measures may be seen as draconian and excessive by some, had they not been imposed and had the violence spread to other regions, the government would have then been equally faulted for not taking steps that were stringent enough. The events of the past few weeks did also have its political implications. As is to be expected, there was polarisation along political affiliations in the reaction of political parties to the crisis. The main opposition grouping, the Joint Opposition (JO) in Parliament was quick to lay the blame at the feet of the government.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the de-facto leader of the JO seized the opportunity to criticise the government. The government should be held responsible for the events that take place in the country, Rajapaksa said. “This shows the Government’s inability. It has failed to control the riots,” he said, claiming that during his tenure proper systems were in place which prevented incidents from spiralling out of control. Rajapaksa also visited Kandy and met with religious dignitaries there.
Even as the JO accused the government of inaction and inefficiency, the government has been quick to point out that it is the JO- and its offshoot Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) - which has been using communal sentiments to seek votes during election time.
Neither the JO nor the SLPP has been shy to play the communal card at the polls, frequently accusing the government of pandering to the minority communities. When such sentiments are constantly espoused, it takes only a minor skirmish to ignite communal clashes, they point out.
Among the other developments that emerged during the unrest was the appointment of Ranjith Madduma Bandara as Minister for Law and Order. This appointment came in the context of widespread calls for the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to this portfolio, after it was taken away from former Minister Sagala Ratnayaka. Minster Ratnayaka had been often blamed- rightly or wrongly- for the inefficiency in prosecuting offenders of the previous regime for alleged acts of corruption.
Parliamentarians of the United National Party (UNP) felt strongly that this failure played a significant role in the party’s lacklustre performance at the recent local government elections. Hence the request to appoint Fonseka to the post.
With his military background, his proven credentials as an achiever and his ruthless efficiency in implementing an action plan, they felt Fonseka would be the ideal choice for the job, though they all respected Madduma Bandara as a loyal and senior party member.
In the week following the local government polls however, the political climate had undergone drastic changes. It is no secret that President Sirisena- whose mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) faction emerged a very distant third in the elections- was keen on reuniting the party for which the key was an amicable rapprochement with the JO, the SLPP and, most importantly, the Rajapaksas.
Law and Order portfolio
The appointment of Fonseka as Minister of Law and Order would directly conflict with such an objective because there is little love lost between the Field Marshal and the Rajapaksas during whose tenure the decorated war hero had to languish in jail. Thus, the majority of SLFPers vehemently opposed Fonseka’s appointment to the portfolio.
With violence in the Central Province escalating the Law and Order portfolio- which had been ‘temporarily’ assigned to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe- required permanent allocation. After several requests from the UNP to appoint Fonseka were declined, President Sirisena eventually appointed Ranjith Madduma Bandara to the ministry.
If the JO and the SLPP were upbeat following their performance at the local council elections, their image took a beating following two separate incidents this week. In the first, Southern Provincial Councillor M. K. Kasun and his wife Tharaka Perera were arrested and remanded for assaulting a private bus driver at Battaramulla. A video of Perera brandishing a pistol and brutally assaulting the driver went viral on social media. Kasun is a Rajapaksa loyalist.
In the second incident, Ramith Rambukwella, the cricketer son of another Rajapaksa loyalist, Keheliya Rambukwella, was also arrested for alleged drunk driving and assaulting two undergraduate students. He has now been released on bail. Rambukwella has a dubious track record of disciplinary indiscretions from the time he was a cricketer at Royal College to when he was representing Sri Lanka.
These two incidents gave rise to much debate in the media where critics were quick to hark back to the Rajapaksa era where law and order was at a low ebb and a favoured few behaved with impunity with callous disregard to the dignity of others. If these incidents occur when the JO is out of office, what would be the consequences if they are re-elected, these critics ask.
As the dust settles on the communal unrest in the Central Province, political parties will begin to take stock and evaluate their options once more. The moves by the JO to oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe- temporarily shelved, ostensibly due to this crisis but more likely because the JO did not have the required numbers- is likely to begin again. Sooner rather than later, it will be ‘politics as usual’ as all parties look ahead to national elections in early and mid-2020.
