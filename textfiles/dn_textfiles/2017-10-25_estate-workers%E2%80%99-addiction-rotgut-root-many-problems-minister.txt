Estate workers’ addiction to rotgut, root of many problems: Minister

A large number of men and women in the estate sector are addicted to illicit liquor or rotgut and spend their hard earned money to buy it, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, there is no use in conducting medical camps and health clinics for them because they fall sick due to their addiction to illicit liquor. Their health gradually deteriorates. Illicit liquor causes a lot of diseases, he said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at a mobile service held in Kuruvita, recently.
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that this addiction of the estate sector people was revealed during the recent District Development Committee meeting. Special attention was paid towards the issue. The estate sector people should get rid of their addiction to illicit liquor to achieve a better living standard, he said.
A large number of people living in the Ratnapura district received various services offered by the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry and all state institutions come under the purview of the Ministry during the mobile service.
The people were able to save their money and time without traveling to Colombo to obtain the services.
