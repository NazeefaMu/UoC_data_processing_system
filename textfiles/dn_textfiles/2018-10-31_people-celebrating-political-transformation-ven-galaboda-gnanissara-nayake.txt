People celebrating political transformation  - Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Nayake Thera

The public is celebrating the political transformation which took place in the country with pride and joy, Hunupitiya Gangaramadhipathi Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Nayake Thera said.
He made this observation delivering an anusasana when the new Education and Higher Education Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe called on him at his temple and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha before assuming duties at his new Ministry yesterday.
Ven Gnanissara Thera said the fact that there was no upheaval among the people regarding this transformation proved that they happily accepted it.
Ven Gnanissara Thera said a majority of people elected a President by casting their votes in his favour. A government in partnership with the UNP existed for nearly three-and-a-half years.
There was no uproar among the people who elected a government with UNP partnership against the recent political transformation.
No one among the public criticised or wept when President Sirisena took this decision.
His observation was that the people had been burdened with a multitude of problems and lived in fear during the last three-and-a-half years.
People who ruled the country during the last three-and-a-half years should rethink whether they had looked into the problems and difficulties people encountered and resolved them.
Education and Higher Education Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said they removed Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne who had 162 votes in Parliament and appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe who had only 41 votes even without officially intimating D. M. Jayaratne of his removal. That letter is still lying in the President’s files. A lot of things harmful to the country had happened during the last three-and-a-half years. The responsibility of correcting that wrong had now devolved on them.
The programme of work undertaken by the former government had been harmful to the country. They could not allow the continuation of that programme according to their conscience.
