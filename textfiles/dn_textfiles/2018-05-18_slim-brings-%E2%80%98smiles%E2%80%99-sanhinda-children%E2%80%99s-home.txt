The SLIM staff carried out the ‘Smiles’ project to bring a smile to the little faces of those who have lost the privilege of spending the season with their dear ones.
The day was well spent by our staff with the children celebrating the joy of the New Year, which demonstrated the success of the ‘Smiles’ project. As the National body for Marketing we will continue our national responsibility through various CSR initiatives in the future as well.”
