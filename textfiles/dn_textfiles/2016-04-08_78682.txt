Sri Lanka to sign the Paris Agreement

 
 
 
Sri Lanka is to sign the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on April 22 at the UN headquarters, New York.
 
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha is to sign the agreement on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The Cabinet approval was granted last Wednesday for the ratification of this Agreement and to assign Minister Premajayantha to participate in the high level signature ceremony on April 22 as of a proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
 
During this visit the Minister will also attend the UN General Assembly on the World Drug Problem and the High Level Thematic Debate on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
The Paris Agreement is a historic move to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. The main aim of it is to keep a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius in this century and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 
 
The agreement also aims to strengthen the ability to deal with the impacts of climate change by putting in place appropriate financial flows. It was an outcome at the 21st session of the UNFCCC held in Paris from November 30-December 11 last year.
