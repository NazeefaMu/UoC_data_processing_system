Fire engulfs 12 estate houses

Twelve estate houses in the Balmoral Estate in Agarapatane were destroyed in a fire which erupted yesterday morning.
Estate workers had rallied round to quell the fire before it spread to other line rooms, Agarapatana Police OIC Inspector Anandasiri said. He said 14 people who were inmates of the burnt houses have been displaced and 13 children were among them.
Steps had been taken to accommodate them elsewhere and provide meals and other requirements.
