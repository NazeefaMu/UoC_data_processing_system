Malinga ruled out of T20 World Cup

BANGALORE: For fast bowler Lasith Malinga the ICC World T20 has ended. Malinga was flown back to Colombo from Kolkata yesterday after failing a fitness test on his injured left knee.
Malinga underwent the test during the team's practice session ahead of their opening World T20 fixture against Afghanistan which Sri Lanka won by six wickets on Thursday.
Although Sri Lanka won that tie against an associate-member country without the services of Malinga they would certainly require his experience and match-winning skills for the rest of the tournament when they front up with West Indies (Sunday), England (March 27) and South Africa (March 28).
A replacement for Malinga is expected to be picked from Colombo where Sri Lanka Cricket has arranged two T20 matches between two sides for players to be in readiness for a national call-up if required.
The name of the selected replacement will have to be sent to the ICC technical committee for approval before he can join the team.
Malinga's loss is a big blow to Sri Lanka's chances of defending the T20 World Cup which they won in 2014 under his captaincy.
From the outset Malinga had questioned his selection and had said that it was a waste of time sending him to India for the World T20 because he was not fully recovered from the injury. However the selection committee headed by former cricketer Aravinda de Silva knew the impact Malinga had on the team as well as the opposition and opted to include him in the 15 hoping that he would recover from the injury.
As it has turned out to be the gamble has failed and Sri Lanka are left to defend the title without him.
There is likelihood that either fast bowler Kasun Rajith or spinner Ajantha Mendis may be sent to fill Malinga's vacancy.
Tillakaratne Dilshan, Man of the match in the game against Afghanistan on Thursday said he expects the spinners to have a huge impact in the T20 World Cup.
