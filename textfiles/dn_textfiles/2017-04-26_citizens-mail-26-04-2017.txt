GMOA doomed forevermore
I fully endorse the recent statement of the Health Minister Rajitha Senarathna that doctors affiliated to the GMOA do not have any sort of discipline and their only objective is to topple the Government. I would like to go a little further and say that these doctors do not have hearts. If not they will never penalize the poor patients by striking, who go to the hospitals for treatment.
I think they have struck work many days citing the ‘SAITM’ issue as a cause, causing tremendous hardships to the patients. But on striking days they never miss private practice after 4 pm visiting private hospitals/ clinics to earn. There too they cannot do their duty perfectly because they cannot examine a patient in 5 or 10 minutes but they do since they lack time for the waiting queue to attend. This is the worst quandary the patients of Sri Lanka face. As patients, their human and fundamental rights are being violated. They cannot access easily to a doctor in a Government hospital too because they have to wait long hours in a queue.
It is a commiseration in Sri Lanka that doctors are considered as an elite and dominant class whereas the patients are treated as miserable and hapless. Although the doctors clamour for their dignity, prestige and lordliness they should never forget their entire education has been funded by the poor man’s wallet. At this juncture I request the Minister of Health to bring in legislation in parliament to protect the fundamental rights of the patients ensuring their rights to medical treatment when they visit a hospital.
The unethical and despicable behaviour of the GMOA of staging protests and agitations against the Government and the Judiciary clearly indicates that they are under the influence of a powerful political party which motivates them to cause chaos in the country to destabilize the Government.
As learned intellectuals the GMOA should think and understand the Government has come to power with the ballot, the people’s consent which is endowed for five years. Before the completion of five years a Government cannot be toppled undemocratically, holding protests or strikes or agitations by the GMOA or any of the trade unions found in Sri Lanka.
Thus, it is advisable for the GMOA to stop all this nonsense without being cursed by the poor patients.
