SLT invests Rs 2.4 bn for data centre

Sri Lanka Telecom’s data centre infrastructure has been undergoing a major transformation with state-of-the-art Tier 3 Data Centre constructed in Pitipana inter-connecting multiple data centres located in SLT headquarters and welikada.
Investment for phase 1 of the data centre project is Rs 2.4 billion.
With this new development, SLT is able to offer broader portfolio of robust co-location and Data hosting facilities at very competitive price packages.
Even in the midst of the industry’s shift, SLT continued to strengthen the data centres as integral components of its overall IT infrastructure strategy and data centres are already accommodating user expectations with advanced IT systems and service level uptime or availability coupled with new service offering opportunities for their valued Enterprise & SME customers.
The Company expect to facilitate more CEOs, CIOs, CTOs and IT experts who are looking to fulfill the IT anytime, anywhere model by delivering the necessary performance, uptime and level of fault tolerance with redundancy. The new data Centre of SLT located in newly proposed Tech city area will have a capacity of - 500 racks with a provision to increase the capacity. Customers will be able to hire racks as and when they are required to manage their CAPEX and OPEX effectively. The rental payment expected from the customers will be far less in comparison to the amount they will be required to spend in order to have their own data centres. SLT intends to provide expert knowledge and bear all costs associated with space, protection, disaster management etc.
