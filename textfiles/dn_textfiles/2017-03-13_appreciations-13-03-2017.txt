[APPRECIATIONS - (13-03-2017)]

Ranjith Mulleriyawa
Adroit altruist
It was a bright Monday morning in the latter part of 2013; a smart gentleman with a white beard on his face who dressed in a pair of denim trousers and a T-shirt was very enthusiastically searching for something along the corridors of the Department of Pharmacology.
I found the gentleman was leading to the weekly meeting room situated in the Centre for Education, Research and Training on Kidney Diseases (CERTKiD), at the very corner of Department of Pharmacology in the Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya. He was very pleasant, well-read personality who was expressing his interest very clearly to find a solution for dry zone's killer disease Chronic Kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu).
Ranjith Mulleriyawa, a graduate of University of the Philippines, with a diploma in agriculture from School of Agriculture, Kundasale, turned out to be the first graduate farmer in Mahiyanganaya who farmed on his own plot of land by the side of the Mahaweli river basin for more than a decade.
We were blessed to accompany such a jolly, good fellow on our field trips; he kept us awake throughout the journey by unfolding his wonderful memories. He could read the dry zone farmer better than any other scientist. He wanted to salvage the dry zone farmer as soon as possible from CKDu, and used his pen to get the attention of responsible authorities towards the battered dry zone farmer.
Ranjith Mulleriyawa was so brave enough to express his views that he once said, “Too much talk and too little work on combatting CKDu would not bring much results." He had set an example to the younger generation at his late seventies by helping the dry zone farmer at their door step, instead of talking about CKDu in the five-star facility. With the available scientific evidence, he was convinced that providing good quality water to all farmers would take the CKDu away from the dry zone. He had written many articles on this issue.
He believed that rainwater harvesting was the cheapest and most sustainable source of drinking water for the dry zone's scattered dwellings. A pilot project was launched at Ginnoruwa Grama Niladhari division at Giradurukotte to provide safe water through rainwater harvesting. Initial expenditure was borne by friends and relatives to start off the rainwater harvesting pilot project in early 2016. The project was supported by Commercial Bank’s CSR project. CERTKiD and International Water Management Institute helped the investigations.
Mulleriyawa initiated the work with two ‘highly committed’ women in the village. He spent many days with the villagers, and mapped out the village. He discovered the concept of “CKDu hot spot,” where the CKDu prevalence was very high. Further, he had found that there were high and low prevalent CKDu affected regions situated side-by-side in similar climatic conditions. The rationale to disprove the agro-chemical hypothesis for the etiology of CKDu was pointed out by him.
I would like to quote a little from his work. The percentages of households affected with CKDu were Sarabhoomi, 2%; Serupitiya, 3%; Ginnoruwa, 7%; Badulupura 25%. In Sarabhoomi, there was only one positively diagnosed CKDU patient, he too had lived for 10 years in Badulupura.
Farmers in both Badulupura and Sarabhoomi had their paddy fields located in the same tract of flat land. They used the same fertilizer and pesticides. Therefore, agro-chemicals applied to the paddy fields could not be the cause of CKDu. The likely cause could've been some other environmental factor in the homesteads of Badulupura.
He did not stop mapping the villages; he wanted to explore the hydro-geological conditions of the villages. He was untiring to consult the geologist Prof. Chandrajith and getting down the water samples for analysis at Peradeniya. Further, he sat with Dr. Tilak Abeysekera, learnt medicine gradually, and published a few basic health advice articles. He helped the villagers by organizing screening programs and referring the suspected cases to the health authorities.
It was a great shock to hear that Ranjith Mulleriyawa, a graduate farmer, a researcher, a media and a social service personnel, left us forever on September 10, 2016. CERTKiD lost a valuable member, the family lost a caring husband and loving father.
He was an honourable servant of Sri Lanka; a great man who left valuable footprints to follow.

Dr. M. H. A. Rasheed
Jewel of a person
I came to know Dr. Rasheed when I joined the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1994.
He was one of the finest people I had ever met. I cannot forget the concern and interest he showed when my wife fell ill in Dhahran. Dr. Rasheed was very concerned, and got the KFUPM medical center to conduct numerous medical tests that contributed to my wife's recovery.
During his recent illness, his wife, Nilufer; son, Dr. Rifeth, and daughter, Sifara, took great pains to bring him back to active life. Unfortunately, this was not to be, and he departed for eternal rest.
Dr. Rasheed had his early education at Royal College and Thurstan College, Colombo. Subsequently, he entered the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar, Pakistan, to study medicine. After qualifying as a medical doctor, he proceeded to USA to do his post-graduate studies. After his post graduate studies, he became a fellow of the American Academy of Paediatrics in Toledo, Ohio.
Since then, he has been working as a Pediatrician in a number of countries including his mother country, Sri Lanka. He was the Chief Paediatrician attached to the medical center of KFUPM for 23 years. The services he rendered to the children of the KFUPM community during this period are invaluable. He was always available whenever a child needed the attention of a doctor, irrespective of whether it was daytime or middle of the night. After his return to Sri Lanka, a few years ago, he worked at the Sulaiman's Hospital, Colombo, as a Paediatrician.
His recent departure is a great loss to his patients, relatives, and friends.
May his soul rest in Peace!
Dr. G. M. Swinton de Silva
