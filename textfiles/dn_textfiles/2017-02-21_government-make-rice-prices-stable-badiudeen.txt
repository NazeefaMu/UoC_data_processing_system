Government to make rice prices stable: Badiudeen

The government will contain rice prices, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen said yesterday.
The ministry’s Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) conducted more than 3000 raids over a month and has instituted legal action against 1,200 errant traders, among them millers, stockholders and retailers who sold rice to consumers at exorbitant rates overriding prices set by the government.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Government Information Department.
He said: “There are enough rice stocks in the market. Stockholders in Pettah are selling rice at reasonable prices. There is no need for the retailers to sell rice at exorbitant costs to consumers in violation of rice prices set by the government.”
“Besides,” he said,” the investigators of the Consumer Affairs Authority are at the ready to nab errant traders who sell rice to the public overriding prices laid down by the government.”
“I request the public to inform the CAA of places where they may be selling rice at exorbitant rates. Phone the Authority on 1977 and lodge your complaint with it. The line will be open from 7 am to 10 pm throughout the week,” he said. “People are welcome to inform us of places where stockholders or rice millers have hidden their stocks. Rice is an essential commodity,” he said.
He said price displaying too is a matter of concern. All retailers must display unit prices of their rice varieties, he said.
The maximum retail price of a kilo of imported Nadu has been set at Rs. 72, a kilo of local Nadu at Rs. 80, imported Kekulu at Rs. 70, Local Kekulu at Rs. 78, imported Samba at Rs. 80 and a kilo of Local Samba rice has been set at Rs. 90, the minister said.
The public can purchase rice at these rates from Lanka Sathosa outlets and supermarkets without restrictions, he said.
Maximum retail prices for local rice varieties have been gazetted with the consent of rice millers, stockholders and farmers on Friday. The retail price caps were decided by a cabinet Sub-committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The committee comprised Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen, Minister Malik Samarawickrema and Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama among other ministers.
“We reduced the tax on imported rice to Rs. five to give relief to the public. Rice millers and importers agreed that they can sell rice to retailers so that the latter can sell them at rates set by us,” Minister Badiudeen said.
