South Africa 2023 World Cup bid in jeopardy

Johannesburg, Monday: South Africa sports minister Fikile Mbalula on Monday barred the national rugby union from bidding for international events because they failed to meet racial transformation targets.
If he keeps his word - something he has regularly not done in the past -- it would dash South African hopes of hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
South Africa, France, Ireland and Italy have officially bid to follow 2019 hosts Japan as organisers of the quadrennial rugby union showpiece.
Mbalula said in a statement he was barring the national rugby, cricket, athletics and netball bodies from bidding for international events because racial goals had not been met.
"I have resolved to revoke the privilege of Athletics South Africa, Cricket South Africa, Netball South Africa and South African Rugby to host and bid for major and mega international tournaments in South Africa as a consequence of the aforementioned federations not meeting their own transformation targets with immediate effect," Mbalula said.
