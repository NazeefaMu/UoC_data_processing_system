SAITM Chairman pleased with GMOA decision

South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando issuing a statement responding to the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said he was pleased with their decision to accept the Government's solution on the SAITM.
“I am pleased that the GMOA has accepted the solution of the Government on the issues pertaining to the SAITM even with some reservations. I urge the GMOA to get the children of state medical faculties to continue their lectures and clinical training enabling them to qualify, obtain post graduate training and become consultants as it is the vision of every medical student," he said.
“I have forgotten the last few years and hope that the GMOA would reciprocate. I will remain content on achieving and establishing the right to freedom of education in Sri Lanka,” Dr. Fernando said.
