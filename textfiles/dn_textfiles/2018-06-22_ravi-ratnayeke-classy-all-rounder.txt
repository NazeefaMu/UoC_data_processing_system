RAVI RATNAYEKE - a classy all rounder

Long before Sri Lanka gained admission to the portals of the highly prestigious of Test cricket playing arena, Trinity College produced some cricketers of class in Philip Buultjens, G.P. ’Bobby’ Schoormen, Eustace Rulach, Nimal Maralande, Malsiri Kurukulasuriya, Harinda Dunuwille, Himmendra Ranaweera, Glen Vanlangenberg and many others who could have made headlines in International cricket.
In the post Test era the best ever cricketer to come out of that prestigious school from the hill capital of Kandy is that stylish and elegant batsman- wicket keeper who went on to captain the country and set up records in batting and wicket keeping in all forms of cricket and who is without doubt Kumar Sangakkara.
Classy all-rounder
Before Sangakkara came along JOSEPH RAVINDRA ‘RAVI’ RATNAYEKE who was a classy all rounder from Trinity College. He was a rare cricketer who bowled right arm and batted left hand. As a fielder he was not brilliant, but one could describe him as adequate.
The burly cricketer standing over 6 feet, he started batting in the middle and as his career progressed he faced the new ball and did a pleasing job. He ran in like former England right arm fast bowler Brian Statham and delivered some quick deliveries which included the in swing and out swing an also packed a devastating Yorker. Batsmen had to be extremely careful when facing RATNAYEKE.
His wielded the willow as a stylish left hand batsman with clever use of feet, admirable timing and he had strokes all round the wicket in his armoury. He seldom played a rash stroke and presented his wicket and guarded it as if his life depended on it. In addition he was a fine team man and his captains admired his contributions.
Nain scoring strokes
RATNAYEKE had the ability to play any stroke in the book. But his main scoring strokes were the drives on the ‘V’. He was also a good cutter and had a defence that was rock solid. He was an indispensable all rounder to any team.
As a fielder he was slow footed and that could be excused for because being bury, he could not move quickly to stop the ball, but was a sure catches when the batsmen lofted the ball, rarely dropping any vital or costly catches.
Before going on to detail his performances for the country, I would like to describe the Father of this great son YASA RATNAYEKE. A stylish left hand opening batsmen in the early 1950s for St. Joseph’s College, Darley Road. As a tender cricketer I still remember the swashbuckling near hundred he made against my old school St.BENEDICT’S College, on the Kotahena mat.
Champion Joes team
YASA played in a Josephian champion team under that diminutive opening batsman Reinzie Perera which team included some outstanding crickets of the calibre of Mahinda de Silva ( Elder brother of Raja, who was a fine leg spinning all rounder who also captained the school), Ralph Brohier, Chrisantha Fernando, Tony Buhar, Talath Ismail and Malcom Berenger to name a few.
YASA had a rare record which still stands and that is that opening the innings in the 1953 big match against St. Peter’s College he remained unbeaten making 70 odd. In that era the score book would pencil it as COB (carried on batting) now it goes as not out.
Nine wickets in an innings
RAVI RATNAYEKE played for Trinity from 1997 to 1980 capturing 81 wickets with 9 wickets in an innings against Dharmaraja. He was sweating it out to capture the last wicket and make it 10 in an innings, but the last batsman was run out.
From father to son. RAVI started his school career at St.Anthony’s College, Kandy before ending up at Trinity College. After showing his prowess at Trinity, he made his entry into first class cricket playing in the under- 25 game against Tamil Nadu in 1980/’91. His opening bowling partner was Asantha de Mel.
Sri Lankan selectors watching the young man in action where he bowled with great promise taking three wickets were impressed and the selectors who picked him for a tour of England in 1981.
Playing six games
On that tour playing in six games he took nine wickets, with a bag of five wickets against Sussex. After Sri Lanka gained Test status a year later it was a pity that he could not make it to the country’s team against England led by Keith Fletcher in the Inaugural Test at the Colombo Oval..
However he was rewarded being picked to tour Pakistan in the country’s inaugural tour to Pakistan in 1982 and made his debut in the Final Test in Lahore taking three wickets. He bagged the prized wicket of Pakistan’s leading batsman Zaheer Abbas in the Second ODI.
Coming down to Colombo he sported Nondescripts CC colours from which club he made it to the Sri Lanka team. It is on record that in one Test against Pakistan in Sialkot he took 8 for 83 which was his best.
Man of the match award
In a Benson and Hedges game one day international against the West Indies he scored 50 and captured five wickets and although being on the losing side won the man of the match award and received a gold medal.
RATNAYEKE who is now domiciled in Melbourne, and once on holiday here related this bitter experience to our late Kandy Correspondent JIFFREY ABDEEN who had done yeoman service for the ‘DAILY NEWS’ and ‘SUNDAY OBSERVER’ for well over three decades.
He said that his house was burgled and among the items lost was his wife’s jewellery and a gold medal; which he treasured that he won when he was adjudged man of the match for capturing five wickets and making a 50 against the West Indies in Benson and Hedges limited over international.
He lodged complaint with the police, but the robber was evading arrest. However the police investigator who was handling this complaint was a friend of his who had played cricket with him.
Walking on the road
One day while walking on the road, the policeman had noticed a man sporting an uncommon medal and a closer look at it saw the words RAVI RATNAYAKE inscribed on it. The robber was immediately arrested and he spilled the beans.
RATNAYEKE born on May 2 1960 and played 22 Tests and 78 ODI’S from 1982 to 1990. He scored 807 runs in Tests and 824 runs in ODI’S with a top score of 93 in Tests and a fifty in ODI’S. He took 56 Test wickets and 85 ODI wickets. He had four five wickets.
Made his Test debut
He made his Test debut in on March 5th 1982 against Pakistan and played his final Test on December 16, 1989 against Australia. ODI debut March 12, 1982 versus Pakistan and played his last ODI against Australia on May 2, 1990. He migrated to Australia in 1990 and played for Preston CC in Melbourne.
All round cricketers of the likes of JOSEPH RAVINDRAN RATNAYEKE are what Sri Lanka cricket needs today
