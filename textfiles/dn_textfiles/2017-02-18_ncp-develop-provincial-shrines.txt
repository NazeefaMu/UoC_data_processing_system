NCP to develop provincial shrines

The North Central Province (NCP) launched a programme to provide financial aid to religious centers in the province. Rs. 1,000,000 was donated to 10 Hindu kovils in the Dimbulagala Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the Polonnaruwa District.The CM said the NCP was following President Maithripala Sirisena's footsteps, who works hard to uplift shrines of all religions without any discrimination.
"We are not going to stop just by granting funds to religious places. We have planned to develop their surrounding areas as well. I have undertaken to solve housing and drinking water problems in Soriwila and a new school will be opened there as well," he said.
