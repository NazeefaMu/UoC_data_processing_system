Art on the ends of strings

Indian puppetry was considered as one of the important art forms in the Indian theatre. Several centuries ago puppetry originated in India as an entertainment art form. However, due to the arrival of the modern multimedia entertainments, it has lost its vitality today.
All over the world puppetry is quite popular. It is considered one of the most important entertainment art. Puppetry reflects the country’s culture, traditions and customs. Even some of the contemporary issues are enacted through puppetry. Names of these puppet shows vary from region to region and from place to place. Several years ago puppetry originated in India as an entertainment art form. It derives its theme from various religious epics.
It imparts and cultivates various religious values and religious philosophy. In earlier times the puppeteers move from place to place to earn their livelihood. Yet it is considered as a folk art. Mostly these puppets are manipulated by strings, shadow, rod and glove. On these bases the puppets are categorized into four varieties namely, String puppets, Shadow puppets, Rod puppets and Glove puppets. Normally in the string-puppet shows, the strings are tied to various limbs of the puppets. Commonly the strings are used to manipulate the puppets even today.
Popularity
Earlier, puppetry was started for entertainment purposes only and later it gained more popularity and recognition among the common masses. Originally, the puppets were made out of leather, that’s why it was called Tholpavai Attam or Bommalattam. Tholpavai means dolls made out of leather. In Andhra Pradesh, it is called Tholu Bommalattam. Later the puppets were made out of various other materials such as cloth, light wood and paper pulp. But today some of the puppets are made with heavy plastic or rubber. The movements of the puppets are always accompanied by dialogue, narration, appropriate vocal and instrumental music. Different Indian states named the puppetry differently.
Puppet making is an exceptional art. They must bring out the characters with appropriate figure and facial expressions. Even proper costumes and ornaments are adapted to adorn the puppets. In addition, external voice support and appropriate music are given to the puppets to reveal the theme of the story. Earlier, the puppeteers travelled to various places to earn their livelihood. However, it was considered a folk art.
Recognition
In Tamil Nadu, puppetry was originally performed in the royal courts in Tanjore of Tamil Nadu. This art form was very popular in the Tanjore district and it originated during the period of the Tanjore regime. Originally, mere platforms were used to display the art, but now, covered stages are used and manipulators stand close to the stage to manipulate the puppets.
The names and nature of the puppet shows vary from region to region. For instance, earlier in Andhra Pradesh puppets were made out of leather. Mostly these puppets were manipulated with sticks. Another branch of development in the Indian puppetry is shadow puppet show.
Andhra Pradesh is very popular for this shadow puppetry and yet it is persevered by certain communities. Similarly, another shadow puppet show was performed in the modern Kerala state, called Pavai Koothu of Malabar. And later the puppets were made out of various other materials such as cloth, wood, and paper pulp. Sometimes the shadows of the puppets are allowed to fall on the back curtain. In Tamil Nadu, this type of puppetry is called Nillal Attam (shadow puppet show). Still, puppetry shows are very popular among the rural public. Usually, puppet shows take place in the night.
Origins
In Rajasthan, puppetry was called Kathputali. They also believed that their ancestors were responsible for the origin and development of Indian puppetry. Later they migrated to different states and wherever they migrated, they introduced this art form. Beautiful puppets are made with an aesthetic touch. Earlier the rational theme of the story was the life history of a ruler named King Amar Singh who ruled some hundred years ago. Later numerous techniques were adopted and introduced to keep the interest of the audience alive.
In Orissa, the Odissi puppetry was based on Radha and Krishna themes and based on Vaishnava cult. Sometimes folklore or popular legends are also selected for puppet shows. The size, shape and even the figure of the puppets differ from state to state.
In Bengal, it is strictly dedicated to goddess Kali and performed during the special religious functions and festivals of the temples. Some of the puppetry was vested in the hands of a few classes or certain communities. A few puppet shows have gained popularity within a particular regional level alone, due to various factors such as linguistic and cultural differences.
Technology
To activate the puppets, mostly the strings are used. Besides this, modern technology is also added to some extent by giving different sound and colour light effects. Due to the arrival of modern technological innovations such as television, video and home video systems, this traditional puppetry art form has lost its vitality among the masses. Yet at the village level, it has some entertainment value.
To a certain extent, puppet shows have again gained popularity through the visual media. Now various sociopolitical themes and contemporary subjects are selected for television puppet shows to impart and spread certain ideas among the viewers.
By seeing the television puppet shows, the younger generation has got an opportunity to gather some ideas about this traditional folk art. At present, in some puppetry shows, the puppets are activated by remote control equipment.
Like some other Indian art forms, the Indian puppetry is also established its own domination in the South East Asian cultural scene, mainly in Java and Bali. Wayang Golek is one of the popular puppet shows of this region. The ancient popular Indian epics, such as Ramayana and Mahabharata are the main selective themes for this puppet show.
