Cabinet approves Bill on Protection of Human Dignity and Social Harmony

A Bill titled ‘Protection of Human Dignity and Social Harmony’ put forward to control online harassment and hate speech was approved by the Cabinet this week.
Minister of Justice Thalatha Athukorale, submitting a Cabinet memorandum on the Bill, pointed out that “immediate measures needed to be taken to stem the tide of unfair use of social and other electronic media.”
The Bill which comes in the wake of the communal unrest in Kandy earlier this month, would also touch on, “Surreptitious efforts to create social unrest and religious and communal disharmony among the people.”
However, the delicate balance between freedom of speech and expression and freedom from harassment, have to be enunciated precisely, added the Cabinet memorandum. The proposed Bill would make it an offence where incidents relating to violation of the privacy of individuals and the causing of religious, racial or communal disharmony among people, a person who intentionally or knowingly captures, exhibits, displays, distributes, publish or transmit an intimate image of a private nature of a person without the written consent of such a person; commits the above act to transmit a sexual image of a person with the intention of causing that person distress is also caught up, as is a person who commits the above acts and transmits the image of a person in a manner which no reasonable person would consent and a person who causes religious, social or communal disharmony through social or any other electronic media.
