Mobitel achieves No.1  status in 4G LTE  mobile broadband

Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka’s national mobile network operator enhanced its 4G LTE network coverage by innovatively deploying its existing 900MHz spectrum.
This initiative is Sri Lanka’s first such deployment, significantly enhancing Sri Lanka’s LTE coverage and making Mobitel the No.1 network for LTE broadband in Sri Lanka.
Mobitel Chairman P.G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena stated that he was proud that the dream of affordable broadband was finally available to the wider population of Sri Lanka bringing the government machinery and economic mainstream particularly to those in the rural areas of the country.
He further went on to praise the strategic guidance of the Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), Shamal Jayatilake for his vision to bridge the digital divide between the urban and rural areas of Sri Lanka through the existing regulatory framework.
Mobitel Chief Executive Officer Nalin Perera said that Mobitel constantly lived up to its ‘We Care. Always’ brand promise, and the roll-out of LTE in a low frequency spectrum band ensures that cutting edge technology such as 4G LTE is available to all citizens at affordable prices.
He thanked the Director General of the TRCSL and his staff in implementing a progressive regulatory framework of Sri Lanka and noted that such regulation encourages further investment from the telecom operators towards Sri Lanka’s digital transformation. He further stressed that commercial deployments of this nature highlights Mobitel as a pioneer in providing techno-economically feasible solutions, which lead to true progress of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans and furthering government’s vision for a digital economy for Sri Lanka.
