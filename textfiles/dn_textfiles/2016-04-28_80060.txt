Celebrating island rugby and its mesmerizing traditions!

 
Greetings rugby fans one and all, especially those who are part of those glorious traditions that make us all, one big family.
The passions and traditions run deep, way beyond normal contemplation and quite above all other considerations, even the business of government
Island rugby has its own glamour and qualities...that stand it apart from all other sport in sunny Sri Lanka. The rugby heart at school and club level, very distinct and easily identifiable from quite a distance ...am or pm
I will run some basic details of team form and squad stats: for the Bradby encounter 2016.
Sri Lanka will be coached by Johann Taylor, the former South African born, Kandy coach, who directed the upcountry club to many titles ...created a professional platform and changed the thinking of how Kandy rugby, and how it should progress. The rest as they say is history and splendid teams that performed consistently for well over a decade.
Rugby has grown rapidly and as we speak ...is looking the part, especially if you were to catch one of the Singer schools league 1st round matches. The passion and fervour inspiring…team support quite amazing, and tantalizing research for sociologists ...looking for answers on cultural traditions and development.
The national team will play in the Asian 5-nation division1...to target a top 3 slot in Asia and join Japan Hong Kong and Korea as the elite unions on the ARFU platform.
The meaning of life for us, after a massive long season, is to win division 1 and challenge the top tier… Sri Lanka needs to invest big and create the professional platform, to compete with the biggest rugby unions. If there is an element of doubt ...consider our fellow island brothers, across the big pond in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga ...proud island warriors with amazing hearts and unions that believe. The Rugby World Cup 2015 clearly showing the incredible potential for island rugby ...not forgetting which amazing islanders are current back to back World champions of our code!
We need research and careful study, to learn and implement, such a blueprint for Sri Lanka rugby, in the next 5 years.
Let's focus on the big glamorous schools fixtures and pure passion ...just typical island rugby hearts that defy description and shift the minds ability to understand sport and its greater appeal
Here is my attempt to share some thought about this year’s Bradby and what a cracker weekend in Colombo Facts: it’s the 1st leg ...it’s also a league match for the 2016 school season.
Royal are the defending champions ...both league and Bradby.
Royal have coach Martis and Lewke his pack coach. Trinity has head coach Eric Miller, Sean Wijeysinghe, Saliya Kumara.
A heavy duty coaching department that leaves very little to chance from glucose. protein…to ground conditions and ice bath recovery. The boys eat, sleep, talk, drink and live rugby ...fully supported by the old boys structured rugby corporations.
The season has lined the match quite neatly ...Trinity dropping their guard against S Thomas’ in Pallekelle…and Royal pretty much a similar result against Thomas' two weeks ago. Last Saturday Royal drew and Trinity lost their unbeaten status ...which means it’s all down to form on the day.
Royal will rely on their forwards...their powerhouse and will need their backs to step up..become more efficient and finish better. Coach Martis very conscious of these factors will be planning slowing it down…the trademark rolling maul..and lots of territory on Saturday. If that draw against Joes affects them is left to be seen. Royal as a team ...at home, Bradby Shield holders and defending league champions are a handful, only if they believe it fully.
Trinity are retaining many players from last year ...missing their skipper serving a one match suspension for dangerous play ...but they are well drilled and faster as a unit ...with the hunger to get that Bradby back. On paper the backs have enjoyed good ball but will have to feed on whatever they get against Royal. Experts will be dissecting the stats and speculation rife ...!
Channel Eye will broadcast the whole experience live to proud old boys globally on the live stream www.channeleye.lk and locally on Channel Eye islandwide. The Rupavahini app also on download. Thank you Singer Sri Lanka for their investment in belief and our traditions...it’s the true spirit of sport, and the essence of our lives.
We are all given to limits and acceptable standards…but the big games need exceptions, need players who simply step up and command respect in the middle.
The mind is the key as we know ...the ability to defy every set principle..to fight when all is lost ..to revive the mind with that last gasp and find some reserve to shock and stun your opposition. Only a few have that special untouchable kryptonite core..to virtually singlehandedly transform for hopeless to magical, on one breath of sheer courage and pace. ...it’s how big the heart and how much the ability to believe in yourself and rise up to finish If this is so ...the mind…. miles stronger. Bula bula Bradby.
Cheers islanders.
