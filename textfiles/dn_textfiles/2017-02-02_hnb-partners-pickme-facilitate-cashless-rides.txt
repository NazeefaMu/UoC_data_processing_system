HNB partners PickMe to facilitate cashless rides

For the first time PickMe has cashless payments with the assistance with Hatton National
Sri Lanka’s most popular mobile app for transportation has picked the country’s largest private sector bank, HNB as their payment solutions provider for Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.
As Sri Lanka’s largest acquirer of Visa and MasterCard, having 44% market share, HNB is now also the first and only bank in Sri Lanka to facilitate an in-app (mobile) payment gateway which allows Visa or Master credit and debit card holders to pay for their taxi rides within a mobile application.
“During the year, HNB intends to launch many such consumer focused solutions in engagement with Fintech companies and this is the first step in that journey. HNB’s digital vision goes beyond its own customer base and is focused on leveraging on the available electronic payment and transacting platforms of the country,” commented Sidath Wijeratne, HNB’s Chief Digital Officer.
Going forward commuters could avail themselves of this facility by doing a one-time registration.
The new service was designed utilizing the most up-to-date security protocols and is PCI DSS compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) thus ensuring that any user’s personal information pertaining to the cards stays safely encrypted at all times.
"The advantages are obvious," explained Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive of PickMe. "Thanks to this new integration not only can our patrons enjoy the luxury of hailing a cab at their fingertips and receiving taxis at their doorstep within minutes, they now don’t have to worry about having cash in hand. A PickMe ride is now seamless. You simply get in and get out.
Ajit Gunewardene Chairman of Pick Me added that he sees technology as the future of business and is not surprised that the concept was accepted by the market as rapidly and as successfully as it did. “Efficiency is the key” he said.
“We have a list of blue chips and business savvy investors who have supported the company in the multiple rounds of fund raising. We would have a 4th round once we have achieved our key performance indicators,” he added.
Jonathan Alles, Managing Director and Chief Executive of HNB said the Bank is thrilled to partner with PickMe in facilitating hassle free mobility. “Through this alliance with our Country’s most preferred mobility platform, we are proud to bring increased convenience to citizens of Sri Lanka.
Our effort and support in the drive to cashless transactions is very much a part of our commitment towards digitalization, technology enhancement and accessibility” he stated.
The bank on their part has pioneered the digital drive by introducing the innovative Momo point of sale device which is portable and can accept debit and credit card payments.
