Magazine on a wagon

Have you read The Wagon Magazine- a literary International magazine published from Chennai edited by bilingual Prasad Krishna? Beginning from last April it is continuing to be published. Many writers from India and other parts of the world are contributing to it. It’s neither a highbrow academic journal nor a cheap popular magazine. Printed in glossy paper with suitable photographs. A better world through literature is its motto and to contact the KGE Team and to subscribe and contribute, their email address is:[email protected].
There are short stories, flash fiction, poems, plays and non-fiction incorporating a variety of themes. I found except for Aiyathurai Saanthan and Dr Noel Nadesan no Lankans are represented in the first seven issues of the journal. Budding and serious writers can contribute their writing and stand to gain an exposure to readers and writers in the international arena.
Some of the names of writers writing to TWM are: Jeff Coleman, Veronica Aldous, Terry Sanville, Karuki Wanyanu, Gene Hines, Richard King Perkins 11, Paul Beckman, Valentina Cano, Robbie Growth et al.
Indian writers include C S Lakshmi, Indra Parthaarathy, Era Murukan, Kalyanee Rajan, Deepalakshmi and others. They are all contemporary writers.
I first read and enjoyed the non-fiction in- depth articles. I particularly liked the articles by Dr C S Lakshmi as she has referred to Lanka. In the first issue, she has reviewed the book by a former Lankan woman militant, Thamilni, The book was originally written in Thamil and then translated into Sinhala and English. The English version has the title “In the Shadow of a Sharp Sword.”
The concluding paragraph of her review is thus:
“Thamiini’s book is not the story of her life. It is the story of a failed armed struggle that turned against its own people. It is a historical document pleading for peace. Knowing the history of the world, one knows wars are not difficult; it is peace that is difficult. Wars need only weapons of destruction. But peace needs unflinching eyes that would look steadily into that of others and speak the truth – the truth about the need to live for a land rather than die for it. What is land after all if not something bound within national borders or must one say notional borders?” I concur with the statement of the reviewer.
Another creative play I liked in the form of an Epic Poem by Dr Sadiqullah Khan titled “Aristotle and Sappho”. It is a dialogue among Aristotle, Homer and Sappho based on Poetics of Aristotle. Ambai’s (Dr C S Lakshmi’s) another informative article is “Burnt Books and Identifies”
“Towards Feminist Theatre: an endless dialogue “by C Raveendran is another interesting piece of writing.
“Did Achebe invent African literature?” by Ainehi Edoro questions the claim that Achebe was the father of African Literature.
Yonason Goldson’s personal account of his visit to Colombo is recounted under the title “A Stranger Amongst Us” with tag line Proverbs & Providence.
There are many interesting matters in the various issues of this journal. And the Editor’s columns indicate that he is a widely read man. His writing is also interesting.
I am yet to read the creative writing in this journal. They sound innovative,.
I wish that our own writers like Tissa Jayatileke, Dr. Lakshmi de Silva, Prof Yasmine Gooneratne, J B Disanayake, Walter Perera, fiction writers and many more younger writers pursue in writing to a foreign journal.
