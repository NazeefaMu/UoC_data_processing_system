President brought in reconciliation: SP Governor

The former President and his team could not bring reconciliation, but President Maithripala Sirisena did it, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara yesterday said.
The governor said he salutes the former President, the former Defence Secretary, and the armed forces for ending 32-year-long terrorism and President Sirisena for bringing in reconciliation.
"The former President should have asked the people living in North and East what type of development they required and provided it building brotherhood. As an adviser to the former President at that time, I advised him and the former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa in this regard," he said. .
Nanayakkara said the President started the reconciliation process from the very first day he assumed the presidency. He started it with the Prime Minister. The reconciliation is not the ripping off the rights of the Sinhala Buddhists. It is not trampling Sinhala Buddhists living in their motherland with a historical culture of over 5,000 years old.
"Even after murdering hundreds of Sinhala Buddhist devotees at the Jaya Shri Maha Bodhi, bombing Shri Dalada Maligawa, and massacring 33 Buddhist Bhikkus at Aranthalawa, Sinhala Buddhists did not take arms against the LTTE. All ethnicities want reconciliation,", he said.
