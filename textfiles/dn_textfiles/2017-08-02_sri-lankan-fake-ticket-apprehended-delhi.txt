Sri Lankan with fake ticket apprehended at Delhi

 
A Sri Lankan national was apprehended at the Delhi airport for entering a terminal allegedly using a fake ticket, officials said yesterday.
The man was apprehended on Monday evening when a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, deployed for the airport's security, found him roaming suspiciously inside the terminal-III building, a senior official in airport security said.
The man was identified as Nuwan U Fernando, a Sri Lankan national, he said.
He told the CISF personnel that he had come to see off his mother, who was travelling to Colombo from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), the official said. The man has told officials that he used a cancelled ticket to enter the airport terminal.
He was then handed over to the police who filed an FIR against him under various sections of IPC, he said.
