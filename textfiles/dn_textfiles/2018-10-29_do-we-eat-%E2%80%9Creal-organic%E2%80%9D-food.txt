Do we eat “real organic” food?

“Organic Agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic Agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved.”
Organic Farming
Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. How the food is grown or raised can have a major impact on persons’ mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than conventionally-grown foods.
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on and in the food we eat. Organic food is often fresher because it doesn’t contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is often produced on smaller farms near where it is sold. Organic farming is better for the environment. Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms. Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.
Rich in nutrient
Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients. Natural vitamins, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions. Also animals are reared in a happy environment. Organically grown foods have more nutrients vitamins (27%), minerals (21.1% more iron, 29.3% more magnesium; 13.6% more phosphorus), enzymes, and micronutrients than commercially grown foods because the soil is managed and nourished with sustainable practices by responsible standards.
Organic food is GMO-free. GMOs or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide. Some animal studies have indicated that consuming GMOs may cause internal organ damage, slowed brain growth, and thickening of the digestive tract. GMOs have been linked to increased food allergens and gastro-intestinal problems in humans and altering the DNA of a plant or animal can increase the risk of cancer. Organic food is pesticide-free. As mentioned above, one of the primary benefits of eating organic is lower levels of pesticides. However, organic farms do use pesticides. The difference is that they only use naturally-derived pesticides, rather than the synthetic pesticides used on conventional commercial farms.
Better taste
Organic food gives better taste. Organically grown foods generally taste better because nourished, well balanced soil produces healthy, strong plants varieties, which are cultivated for taste over appearance. Organic farming preserves agricultural diversity. It is estimated that 75% of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops has been lost in the last century. Crop rotation is a simple and effective technique used in organic agriculture to reduce the need for pesticides and improve soil fertility. Many organic farms grow and assorted range of food, taking natural elements and time-tested tradition into account. Organic food purchase allows us to support farming directly. Spending in the organic sector by buying organic food is a direct vote for a sustainable future for the many generations to come
Bit of History
Traditional farming was the original type of agriculture, and has been practiced for thousands of years. All traditional farming is now considered to be “organic farming” although at the time there were no known inorganic methods eventually an organic movement began in the 1940s.
Principles of organic agriculture
There are four principles of organic agriculture called as health, ecology, fairness and care are the roots from which Organic Agriculture grows and develops.
Health is the wholeness and integrity of living systems. It is not simply the absence of illness, but the maintenance of physical, mental, social and ecological well-being. Ecology is the principle roots Organic Agriculture within living ecological systems. Fairness is characterized by equity, respect, justice and stewardship of the shared world, both among people and in their relations to other living beings. The principle care states that precaution and responsibility are the key concerns in management, development and technology choices in Organic Agriculture.
Supply to Organic farming demand
The rise of organic farming was driven by small, independent producers and by consumers. In recent years, explosive organic market growth has encouraged the participation of agribusiness interests. As the volume and variety of “organic” products increases, the viability of the small-scale organic farm is at risk, and the meaning of organic farming as an agricultural method is ever more easily confused with the related but separate areas of organic food and organic certification. There is a huge demand from the consumers for food which is unable to supply by organic farming as the yield is less than conventional farming. But when the food wastage from harvest to consumption is reduced, the supply to demand will not be a problem by organic farming.
