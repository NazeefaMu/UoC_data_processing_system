President directs Mahaweli officials

President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed Mahaweli authorities to step up an extended programme to promote auxiliary crop cultivation side by side with paddy cultivation in Mahaweli zones during the next Yala season.
He said auxiliary crop cultivation including chilli cultivation in the Mahaweli zones has been destroyed in the present day and such products have to be imported at a very high cost.
Therefore, the President has instructed officials to implement new agricultural programmes to empower Mahaweli areas to provide a vibrant contribution to the country’s national food production process.
The president instructed Mahaweli Authority officials at the President’s Office yesterday at a ceremony held to present internal promotions.
He stated that cultivating food crops that could be cultivated internally thereby limiting imports can save foreign exchange which could be used for agriculture. It is very important to strengthen the country’s economy, the President said.
He also instructed the officials that the agricultural projects throughout the country should be implemented with a fresh inspiration and a new strength at a time where rains have begun after a drought that lasted for a long period.
They were also instructed to expedite the granting of the deeds for Mahaweli settlers. Providing a solution for a long-awaited issue with Mahaweli settlers, granting of the land deeds for all commenced in 2016 under the direction of the President. Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayaka and Mahaweli DG Dr. D.M.S. Dissanayake were present.
