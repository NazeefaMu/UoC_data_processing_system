Writ petition re-fixed for support

Welikada Prison riot in 2012 :
The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for support for September 12 a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 that resulted in the death of 27 prisoners.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, counsel appeared on behalf of the petitioner sought a further date to support the petition.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva, who was in remand custody at the time of the alleged incidents took place, had filed the writ petition citing the Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, Inspector General of Police, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that he was wishing to bring to the attention of Court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm, the petitioner and other prisoners at the Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and the STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that there was an argument between the prison officials and a contingent of TID, STF waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation.
The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time, 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
The petitioner stated that although four years has lapsed since the brutal killings of the prisoners, no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct the investigation and prosecute the offenders.
The petition was filed through Senior Counsel K.S. Ratnavale and Counsel Senaka Perera.
