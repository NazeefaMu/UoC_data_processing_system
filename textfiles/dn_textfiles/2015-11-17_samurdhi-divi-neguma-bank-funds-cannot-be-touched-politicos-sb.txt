Samurdhi, Divi Neguma bank funds cannot be touched by politicos - SB

Politicians cannot spend funds in Samurdhi and Divi Neguma banks. These funds belong to the public, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said.
The minister made these observations at a ceremony held at the Matale Hotel School Complex to distribute cheques among Samurdhi lottery winners.
He said the Samurdhi Movement was started on a solid foundation.
"Anyone attempting to change this movement will face a lot of issues," Dissanayake said.
He said around Rs.1,000 million is remaining in bank funds.
"It should be utilised to promote the living conditions of the public. The Samurdhi Movement was commenced in accordance with the report of the World Health Organisation. During that period, the country's poverty rate was 26 percent. Now it is six percent. However, three percent of the population in the country do not have electricity," he said
"These people can obtain loans from Samurdhi banks to get electricity connections for their houses," the minister said.
Plantation Industry Deputy Minister Lakshman Wasantha Perera, parliamentarian Rohini Kavirathna, district secretary Neil de Alwis and Divi Neguma director of the district K.D.Wickramsuriya also spoke.
