‘You Look Lovely’

I confess I frequently talk to my plants. “Wow, you look lovely today,” I compliment the pink shoe flowers. “Did you miss me?” I ask my marigolds when I return home after a visit to my publisher. “You look pale, did the bugs attack you last night,” I sigh, when I see the holes on the leaves of the begonias.
Do you think I’m weird? Well, Prince Charles too, talks to his plants. Yes, it would have been lovely if it was Ben Affleck or George Clooney who said they talk to their plants, but as they remain mum on the subject, I have only this one quote from the future monarch of Great Britain to support my theory – I’m not weird. Here’s what Prince Charles said, “I just come and talk to the plants, really. Very important to talk to them; they respond.”
And, he could be right. The idea, it seems, is a popular one after all. The theory that plants benefit from human conversation goes way back to 1848, when German professor Gustav Fechner published the book Nanna (Soul-life of Plants). The book paved the way for more books and even an album—recorded in 1970 by an enterprising dentist—titled “Music to Grow Plants By.” But will crooning compliments to your roses really have any effect on their growth?
Familiar to humans
Some plant scientists insist it does — since plants can sense, learn, remember and even react in ways that would be familiar to humans. According to Michael Pollan, author of such books as “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” and “The Botany of Desire,” for a long time, even mentioning the idea that plants could be intelligent was a quick way to being labeled “a whacko.” But not anymore. (This is surely comforting for people like me, who have long talked to their plants or played music for them). The new research, he says, is in a field called plant neurobiology — which is something of a misnomer, because even scientists in the field don’t argue that plants have neurons or brains. “They have analogous structures,” Pollan explains. “They have ways of taking all the sensory data they gather in their everyday lives ... integrate it and then behave in an appropriate way in response. And they do this without brains, which, in a way, is what’s incredible about it, because we automatically assume you need a brain to process information.” And we assume you need ears to hear. But researchers, says Pollan, have played a recording of a caterpillar munching on a leaf to plants — and the plants react. They begin to secrete defensive chemicals — even though the plant isn’t really threatened, Pollan says.”It is somehow hearing what is, to it, a terrifying sound of a caterpillar munching on its leaves.”
Kind words
Does this mean plants react positively to positive sounds only? To see whether kind words could really yield fertile results, the skeptical group of scientists called Myth Busters procured 60 pea plants and divided them into three greenhouse groups. Then, they recorded two soundtracks — one of loving praise and one of cruel insults — and played them on repeat in two separate greenhouses. A third greenhouse remained mum as an experimental control.
To give the myth a fighting chance of flourishing, the team charted the plants’ growth over 60 days. Afterward, the MythBusters determined the winning greenhouse by comparing plant masses from the three groups. To their surprise, the silent greenhouse performed poorest, producing lower biomass and smaller pea pods than the other two. Although there was no difference in plant quality between the nice greenhouse and the mean greenhouse, the soundtracks seemed to produce a positive effect in both. Based on the plausible myth, those of us who talk to plants can now do it more often, without worrying if what we have to say is friendly or not.
Provided you are a woman, that is. According to the Royal Horticultural Society talking to plants make them grow, especially if you are a woman. In an experiment run over a month, they found that tomato plants grew up to two inches taller if they were serenaded by the dulcet tones of a female rather than a male. The findings vindicate comments made by Prince Charles that he talks to his plants although they suggest that for maximum results he would be better off recruiting the Duchess of Cornwall.
Great fun
Not surprisingly, the most effective talk came from Sarah Darwin, whose great-great grandfather was legendary botanist Charles Darwin. She read a passage from the ‘On the Origin of Species’ and helped her plant grow nearly two inches taller. “I’m not sure if it’s my dulcet tones or the text that I read from ‘On the Origin of Species’ that made the plant sit up and listen, but either way I think it is great fun,” said Sarah. The bottom line? If you have always thought that showering seedlings with sunlight, water and healthy soil isn’t enough - to really make their roots sing, you have to talk your plants into growing better, you might have been right all along.
So, if you feel like whispering sweet nothings to your begonias this morning, go ahead.

Tips on Talking with Plants
1. Observe plants. It doesn’t matter if it’s one plant or dozens, whether it’s outdoors or indoors. If you’re a beginner, start with one plant. Take a few moments and stand or sit near it and begin to familiarize yourself with its shape, texture, color, leaves. Each day when you observe, notice if it has changed at all from the day before.
2. After a week of doing this, even if you feel that this entire concept is a bit ‘woo woo’, say a few words to the plant, either silently or out loud. It can be as simple as: ‘Hey, good morning, how are you today?’ or ‘You’re looking like you’re having a tough time…are you OK?’ or ‘Aren’t you a little beauty?” Do this at least once a day. When it comes to talking to your plants, my philosophy is: ‘more is better.’
3. Touch the plant. Have you ever cradled rose petals in the palm of your hands? Or shaken a poppy or dill flower to get seeds from them? There’s something sensual about touching plants. We gardeners do it when dead-heading, cutting down plants, checking for bad insects, etc. Often, even while working at a clipped pace, I slow down, pause, and take a few minutes to touch the plants I’m working with in a gentle way. It’s not a big deal, really. It may feel funny at first: but like anything, when you practice, it becomes natural.
4. Think about how you’re helping the plant grow when you talk to it. There has been a lot of research done in this area: It’s stacking up to show the positive effects our talking and connecting
5. Give thanks to the plant for nurturing you. As most pet owners will share with you, their pets are part of the family: it’s a loving relationship. You can have a loving relationship with your plant, if you’re open to the possibility. These living works of art that bring beauty, optimism, and a sense of well-being into our lives. 6. Try It Out: What better way to test out the hypothesis presented today, than testing it for yourself? You will need two plants that are the same type and size. Put them in different areas, but make sure that they get the same amount of water and light. Only talk to one of the plants on a daily basis. Keep track of how the plants grow over the course of a few weeks. What differences do you notice? What conclusions do you draw?
