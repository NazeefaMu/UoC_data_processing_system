Old Boys’ Union of the Wesley College, Colombo under the leadership of the president and members of their Executive Committee 2017/18 recently relaunched the OBU website – www.wesleyobu.lk - at the Old Wesleyites Sports Club.
The website was officially relaunched by the President of OBU Wilhelm VanDort in the presence of a distinguished gathering.The Wesley College, situated on Karlshrue hill, brings together students from all races, cultures, and religions in Sri Lanka. It goes on record as being the only boys’ school that remains under the management and administration of the Methodist Church in Sri Lanka today. The Double Blue legacy which is built on rich values and traditions handed down by the founders of the College has been the beacon of light which has guided past principals, old boys, teachers and students along its 143-year journey.
Reminiscing through the history of Wesley College, the OBU of Colombo proudly notes that many distinguished educationists and scholars, artists, musicians, sportsmen, and eminent citizens from all segments of the Sri Lankan society, have passed through the hallowed portals of the great institution.
