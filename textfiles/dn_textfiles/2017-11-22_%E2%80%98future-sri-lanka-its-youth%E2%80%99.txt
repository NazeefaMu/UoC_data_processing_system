‘Future of Sri Lanka is its youth’

“The future of Sri Lanka is its youth, and that future depends on access to a quality education in a safe and nurturing environment, said United States Embassy, Chief of Mission Robert Hilton at the opening of a US funded refurbishment of a school in Batticaloa.
Originally built in 1976, this all-girls school was selected by the US Pacific Command (PACOM) for upgrades on recommendations from the Sri Lankan Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Centre. The U.S. Government and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education have invested 95 million rupees (approx. $624,750) to build this three-story addition to the school. This addition means that another 480 students will have the opportunity to pursue their education.
“The new addition offers a safe environment for students to explore new concepts and challenge old notions. The windows provide students a view of different landscapes of ideas, while the doors open to new opportunities. This is what a school represents: a chance for Sri Lanka’s youth to learn, to examine, to challenge. It is especially important to offer these opportunities to young women and girls.
The education of women has historically been overlooked in many societies, including my own. I’m pleased we can provide this assistance to the future female leaders of Sri Lanka,” Hilton said.
“We are standing in a densely populated area that is unfortunately vulnerable to natural disasters. Because of this, we have worked with the Disaster Management Center to construct a building that can serve as an emergency shelter for the local population in times of need. The kitchen can prepare 500 meals a day and the new 35,000-liter water catchment system and 2,000 and 500 liter water tanks will ensure safe drinking water for anyone who shelters here”.
Over the past four years, PACOM and the Embassy have worked closely with the Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Center on the school.
“I would like to thank them for their support and cooperation throughout this project, and also thank the school principal, H.M. Mansour, and our partners at Magbool Engineering Consultants and Hairu Engineering Consultancy (Pvt.) Limited.I also want to recognise the U.S Army Corps of Engineers for their essential contributions and thank Richard Stanlee and the Pacific Command/US Embassy Civil Military Support Element. They made it all possible,” he said.
