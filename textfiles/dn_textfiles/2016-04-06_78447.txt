'JVP strives for Socialist country'

 
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Secretary Tilvyn Silva yesterday said the party which fought against capitalism will strive to establish a socialist country.
"The JVP will play a leading role in creating a socialist country," he said
He said the time has come to end the capitalist system of administration which has become an utter failure.
Silva was speaking at the commemoration of April martyrs of the party at Panadura town hall yesterday
"We are committed to establish the socialist nation expected by our fallen heroes," he said
He said Sri Lanka was able to break the shackles of the British rule due to 1971 insurrection and the commitment of fallen heroes.
The JVP is the only party which hinges on policies, he said.
