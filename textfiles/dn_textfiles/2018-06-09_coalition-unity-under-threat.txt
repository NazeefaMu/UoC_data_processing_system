Coalition of unity under threat?

Unity in diversity is a situation that many would seek, to achieve progress in society. What we see today is political disunity in the structure of government, with calls for unity on one side, countered with demands for separation by the other. This is certainly no easy task, for the two leaders of the ‘Coalition of Unity’ is in governance today, to keep its government going till the time for elections come and the sovereignty of the people is again made known.
President Sirisena’s recent criticisms of the very core of the Yahapalanaya strategies, at the birthday memorial of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, are resonating in the arena of politics; with wider demonstrations of the divisions within the SLFP – the smaller party of the ruling coalition, while being the party of the Government’s leader and Head of State.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attempted to prevent a public dispute on the issue of coalition unity with a call for silence from UNPers in government. But, criticism of the 100-Day Programme by President Sirisena, and public statements that he did not know of its origins, required answering, which members of the UNP Working Committee have done.
Election of the Deputy Speaker of Parliament brought into focus the issue of disunity within the government, and aspects of disunity among the SLFP and Joint Opposition (JO). While the former Deputy Speaker, Thilanga Sumathipala was from the SLFP, the candidate from the SLFP for the vacancy after his resignation could not be elected. Dr. Sundarshani Fernandopulle of the SLFP, who now sits in the Opposition benches with the 16 cross-overs from the government, was defeated by UNP backbencher Ananda Kumarasiri, who poled 97 with Dr. Fernandopulle receiving 53 votes, in the secret ballot.
This election brought into focus other divisions in government and the opposition, with the TNA’s Mr. Sampanthan clearly stating his party thought the office of Deputy Speaker should go to the SLFP as earlier agreed, and that he supported Dr. Fernandopulle. The TNA members did not participate in the vote. There were further divisions seen in the SLFP - with several members in the JO walking away from the election, without supporting the SLFP candidate. Interestingly, the JO-SLPP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa was also not present for the vote.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe did give a political explanation as to why the UNP proposed a candidate for Deputy Speaker, when the bi-party, UNP – SLFP agreement - had been for it to be an SLFP office. As he explained, there were no SLFP backbenchers in government anymore, who could be nominated for the position. There is already an agreement that the office of Deputy Chairman of Committees would be for the Opposition. The unstated reality was that the crossover 16 of the SLFP, who now sit in the Opposition, could not be considered part of government – although they followed the leadership of President Sirisena. The Wickremesinghe explanation did have more than an echo of the voting in the No Confidence Motion on the Prime Minister!
This also raises another issue of the stuff of democracy and the parliamentary system. While parliament comprises members of rival parties sitting in Government and Opposition benches, the values of democracy require that parliamentary office should not be distributed strictly on party lines. What is best, is for the most experienced and competent MPs to be chosen for important parliamentary offices such as Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees. The majority should vote for the best, not necessarily for the party. A government having a majority would most often have the Speaker, if the most deserving from its ranks is nominated. This should be so for the Opposition, too. It is necessary to think of transcending party rivalries, in selecting those who manage the process of parliament, for true democracy to prevail.
The Money Tree
President Sirisena has good cause to be constantly critical of the UNP on the Bond Scam issue. While the manipulation of the scam certainly had strong UNP links with the presence of Arjuna Mahendran, and his failure to prevent conflicts of interest with his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius, leading to so much of crooked dealings. But the emerging talk of Perpetual-Aloysius Money thrown around as political gifts, payoffs or kickbacks, certainly points to cross party involvement in crooked enrichment.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara’s delayed admission of receiving a million rupee donation for election work, and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka’s one lakh Aloysian benefit, speaks volumes on corruption in the electoral process, with a perpetual dominance of electoral subversion. There is clearly a UNP and SLFP link in this dirt heap. The JO must also be worried.
The Dayasiri takeaway for election expenses, as we are told, has also led to him being considered one of exception for revealing the payoff. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was among those who praised Dayasiri’s gesture of goodness and courage, in an interview in the “Observer” last Sunday. It was indeed surprising to see the close comrade of one time left leaders such as Dr. N. M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R de Silva and other outstanding leftists, speak so well of Dayasiri’s display of courageous declaration. But the facts are very much different from what is narrated today.
Dayasiri Jayasekara did not reveal the load of cash when he received it, or even shortly after. It was a revelation in a Perpetual related case in the courts that broke the story of how an employee of Dayasiri had cashed the related cheque. That is when the former Sports Minister began his loudly vocal play, and asked for the names of all others who had received such cash. It is good to think of judging honesty and courage from the facts as they are revealed. It was back in November 2017, when the Dayasiri Jayasekara’s connection to Perpetual Aloysius was first revealed, at the Bond Commission sitting. It related to the many phone calls that Arjun Aloysius had with MPs - some COPE members. Dayasiri Jayasekara is known to have had 18 phone calls to and from Aloysius. There was no talk of the million rupee election donation at that time.
As reported in the Daily Mirror of November 22, 2017, “Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara admitted there was a “major issue” in the fact that members of the COPE Committee had conversations with Arjun Aloysius. “Yes of course there is an issue. We will all be able to see the outcomes of this once action is filed,” he said, in response to questions by journalists at the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday.
However, Jayasekara defended the two calls and meeting he had with Aloysius, and said that he found no need to declare meeting Aloysius at any point.
“Yes I met with him once and we spoke on the phone twice. But I don’t think it was needed to declare to anyone that I met him,” he said. Jayasekara, while admitting that there were more than two conversations with Aloysius went on to say that he knew Aloysius previously.”
It is certainly a mockery of the public to show Dayasiri Jayasekara as a heroic politician for his much delayed admission of receiving so much cash from Arjun Aloysius, even though he may have known him earlier, and even as an election cost donation. What he did was to admit what was exposed. The donation to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, much smaller, also for elections, shows this to be part of wider electoral corruption. We now have the Attorney General’s Department informing court that W. M. Mendis & Co (an associate company of Perpetual Treasuries) gave two cheques of Rs One Million each to an unnamed Minister of State. How many more of active politicians, elected or nominated, would have received such crooked bonanzas? One must not forget that several nominated MPs did contest the polls in 2015 and lost.
A Parliament Motion
It is unlikely that the Presidential Commission report would have names of MPs and others who received such money. The probe did not go in that direction. Whether such a report comes out or not, it is the duty of our politicians, if they are not crooked, to take their own action to expose the dirty, within politics and without.
This money tree is certainly the most crooked aspect of political reality in this country. Whether there are 116 such recipients or 180 of them from whatever profession or lifestyle, it seems time for those in Parliament, elected and nominated, to adopt a motion, calling for all those who definitely did not obtain any such money to make a public declaration, recorded in Hansard: and call for investigations into the cash and electoral expenses of those who remain silent. That is one way to clean up our politics, moving on to major changes in the laws governing electoral organisation and expenditure.
Members of Parliament from every party must have the courage to take such a step to clean their own images among the people.
