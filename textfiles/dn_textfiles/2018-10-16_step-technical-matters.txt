In step with technical matters

Technical College, Kalutara, held ‘Open Day’, an exhibition aimed at educating students, teachers, parents and the general public about the job connected with the technical field and how machinery functions. It also gave an insight to the diverse technical training courses that the college has to offer.
“Many school leavers, especially those in the rural areas, and their parents or guardians want them to get Government jobs. They do not wish to engage in professions related to the technical or construction field. This is because they possess a negative attitude towards the professions related the technical field,” The Principal of Technical College, Kalutara, S Hemachandra said.
“We have technical courses of NVQ Levels up to four and a student who is interested in following a technical course can go up to the NVQ Level seven which is at the degree level at Ratmalana College of Technology. Such students who excel in the field are able to earn nearly two or three lakhs in Sri Lanka or three or four folds of that salary in a foreign country,” he added.
He said that a university degree holder has to demand a job because he or she is not given vocational training at the university. A technically skilled student knows how to find a job either in Sri Lanka or abroad. He noted that ‘Open Day’ will unveils the value of a technical related profession to students.
“Many are unaware that there are an abundance of technical related jobs in Sri Lanka. We do not get sufficient applications or students for the jobs available in the market. Therefore a student who has obtained his or her NVQ Level certificate will not have time to idle around. He or she is able to find a job easily,” he said.
Over 4000 students from various schools in the Kalutara district visited the exhibition. Various machinery such as Gas and Arc Welding Work, Electronic Work, Electrical Work, plumbing etc were on exhibit. College trainees demonstrated them to all those who visited the exhibition. Over 200 students who have completed various technical and language courses received their certificates from the Chief Guest Technical Education and Training Department Director General Pushpa Malalasekara.
