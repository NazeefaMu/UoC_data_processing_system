Seylan Lifestyle Fair attracts shoppers ahead of season

Seylan Lifestyle Fair was held at the BMICH last week ahead of the upcoming Sinhala Tamil New Year festivities.
The fair featured fabulous offers and discounts and was an all-encompassing shopping experience, giving busy shoppers easy access to abundant clothing vendors, electronic brands, lifestyle products and household items all under one roof.
Seylan Bank partnered for the third consecutive year with Asia Exhibitions and Conventions (Pvt) Ltd to bring in Seylan Lifestyle Fair 2017.
The fair provided an exclusive platform for established businesses, upcoming entrepreneurs to gain exposure and forge potential business partnerships.
It was also a much-needed venue for families to fulfil all their shopping needs just ahead of the Avurudu season, making seasonal shopping an enjoyable and memorable experience for the entire family.
Seylan Bank, being the principle sponsor and official banker, was also on hand at the fair to provide exclusive discounts for its cardholders and provide information about banking solutions to interested shoppers.
