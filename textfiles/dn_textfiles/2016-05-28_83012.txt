Sangakkara hails impact of England coaches Bayliss and Farbrace

Kumar Sangakkara has lauded the impact Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace have had on the England team over the past year, suggesting their contrasting coaching styles have made them an ideal combination to take the side forward.
Legendary wicketkeeper-batsman Sangakkara, 38, captained Sri Lanka in all formats during Bayliss and Farbrace’s time as head and assistant coach respectively.
It was a tenure which saw them complete Test series victories over England, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and New Zealand, and finish runners-up in two World Cups and the World Twenty20.
The 134-Test veteran, who averages 61 for newly-promoted Surrey in the County Championship this season after retiring from international cricket last year, has been impressed with England’s upturn in form with Bayliss and Farbrace at the helm and points to their complementary coaching methods as a contributing factor.
“They were an outstanding combination for Sri Lanka, and have been an outstanding combination for England,” Sangakkara told Sportsmail.
“They are different and complement each other. Trevor is very to the point, very direct. He’s very honest and communicates very well with players, and stays in the background and only steps in when it’s absolutely necessary. Whereas Farby is all about being organised and covering all bases, making sure that every little detail is taken care of.”
England appear to have a relatively straightforward summer schedule, with a three-match Test series against Sri Lanka preceding four home Tests against Pakistan in July and August.
Winning five of these matches would see them leapfrog Pakistan and India to second in the ICC Test rankings – narrowly behind world No 1 Australia.
England were a lowly fifth when Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015, and an ascent to second place over a year would be some achievement for the Bayliss-Farbrace administration. But this would come as no surprise to Sangakkara.
“They’re an ideal combination and they’re both wonderful people, which makes them even better coaches – it is no shock to see them doing so well now,” the Sri Lankan continued.
“They’ve done an amazing job for England so far and, believe me, it’s only going to get better.” DAILY MAIL
