Shrine of sacredness

Before the origins of major religions of Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity the primitive people across the Globe believed on superstitions and cult practices sometimes of bizarre nature of human sacrifices which even extended in feasting on the hearts of the sacrificial victims.
For the primitive people the forces of nature created numerous challenges for their survival and in order to overcome these forces they believed that they had to appease the evil forces and the deities.
Natha God, God Kataragama ( Skanda Kumara) who came to Sri Lanka from India and having two wives known as Walli Amma and Tavani, God Upulwan (Vishnu), God Sumana Saman, God Dadimunda, God Siddha Suniyam, God Ganesha, God Iswari, God Mahasena, God Wibisana, God Rawana, Goddess Sarasawathie, Goddess Lakshmi, Goddess Uma, Goddess Pattini and God Devol are the prominent powerful Gods and Goddesses according to the ever increasing number of devotees and shamen in the present day Sri Lanka.
The historical origins of both Goddess Pattini and God Devol are intermingled with mythology and legendary folktales which proved to be timeless and last for ever which is a characteristic of folktales and legends. Mythology is not just a collection of tales but a universal language symbolically conveying a deeper message to humanity. The parentage of Prince Devol had baffled the anthropologists and historians due to the prevalence of numerous versions of folklore and the divergent opinions which had not been properly established.
Prince Devol was believed to be one of the seven sons of a mythical king known as Sri Raman hailed from the Kingdom of Malala in India. Folklore revealed that the king Raman had seven consorts known as ‘Thedapathi, Gunapathi, Amithapathi’, Siripathi, Mihipathi, Yasapathi and Agnipathi’.
King Raman’s seven consorts had given birth to seven sons known as Devol, Hiruras, Sandaras, Agniras, Maharas, Kudaras and Samiras.
Folklore traditions
Prince Devol was also identified as one of the three sons of Queen Thrivakkali of Solirata.
In addition to the prevailing folklore traditions relevant to the parentage of Prince Devol, a king known as Swarna Ramasinghe had also been identified as his father.
Andun Kudumbara, Sandurun Kudumbara, Erdi Kudumbara, Mal Kudumbara, Dala Kudumbara, and Vadige Kudumbara were the six other names given to Prince Devol.
Opinions of scholars widely differ on the existence of Goddess Pattini and God Devol and numerous other interpretations had also been given to the events that unfolded in the long narration of the legend since the day of deportation of Prince Devol and his six other brothers. Some believe the Shrine of Goddess of Pattini was in existence at Seenigama long before the arrival of Prince Vijaya and his retinue of Aryans in SriLanka.
Goddess Pattini was believed to have held sway all over the whole country while residing in Seenigama shrine. The era of her reign had coincided with that of the Lord Buddha’s lifetime when the country was inhabited by the prehistoric tribes of Yakka and Naga.
A hymn usually recited during the ritual dances performed in Devol festival comprised of a description of the existence of a shrine consecrated to Goddess Pattini at the ancient Port of Seenigama till the invasion of the abode by the Prince Devol.
In the annual Devol and Pattini ritual celebrations held in the shrines across Sri Lanka the ritual dances are performed for one whole night till the dawn of the following day by a troupe of experienced shamen (kapuralas).
The verse renditions or hymns recited to the tune of the beating of several drums are highly rhythmic and easy to understand due to the colloquial language generally used in composing them.
Magnificently decorated
Prince Devol and his six brothers were in the habit of killing animals and elderly people in the kingdom of their father King Sri Raman. The citizens of the Kingdom Malala made complaints to the king about the terror unleashed by his seven sons led by Prince Devol. In order to resolve the crisis, by his seven sons, the king got seven ships made to deport them out of the kingdom. They set sail in the seven ships which were made out of wood and magnificently decorated and full of silk clothing material.
Some scholars are of the opinion of the existence of a busy trading port at Seenigama. According to prevailing legends, it was believed during the era of ‘Kakusanda Buddha’ a king known as Swarna Kuduppu Ramasinghe had seven consorts. The seven sons during their previous births had offered a robe to Kakusanda Buddha. As a result of this meritorious act Prince Devol became God Devol.
One of the consorts of King Raman had given birth to a daughter known as ‘ Padmini ’ who had offered a sweet mango to the Kakusanda Budha to become the Goddess Pattini.
During the course of time Padmini died and was reborn as Goddess Pattini and took refuge in the abode of Seenigama Shrine in Sri Lanka.
Seven brothers of Padmini (Goddess Pattini) had to undergo numerous hardships during their hazardous sea voyage in search of a land to embark and finally all seven wooden ships were wrecked and the victims Prince Devol and his six other brothers were struggling with the powerful waves and ship wrecks posed great dangers to the lives of the seven princes.
When they were drifting in the mid - sea for seven days Prince Devol prayed to God Sakra about their plight. God Sakra intervened and rescued them and created a stone rafter to help them continue their mission.
All the deities reigned in various parts of Sri Lanka reached the consensus not to allow Prince Devol and his retinue to disembark on any of the ancient sea ports of Sri Lanka.
Prince Manawamma prevented disembarking of Prince Devol at Yapa Patuna (Jaffna ), Kandakumara objected their entering Samankula at Panadura, God Upulwan objected Prince Devol’s entering at Dondra Point. God Dadimunda intervened when Prince Devol tried to enter thecountry from Lanumodara, God Deva Rajjuru objected Prince Devol and his retinue entering from Unawatuna. In addition to these ancient sea ports, Prince Devol had tried to reach ashore from Kosgoda, Beruwala, and Ambalangoda.
Failing all these attempts of reaching ashore, Prince Devol and his six other brothers had tried to disembark at Seenigama where his sister Padmini from a previous birth was residing at the coastal shrine as Goddess Pattini. All the deities including Goddess Pattini conspired in advance against the arrival of Prince Devol at Seenigama.
Goddess Pattini created seven mounds of fire on the beach stretch behind the ancient Shrine of Goddess Pattini which was built on a rocky crop of land now found several metres away in the sea as a result of massive sea erosion taken place as far back as 1921.
Proving the divine powers, Prince Devol and his six brothers crossed over the flames and destroyed the seven mounds of fire. Reminiscing that they were born as brother and sister they reached an amicable settlement. Fire walking in Sri Lanka is believed to have originated at Seenigama and Prince Devol known as Devolsamy was groomed how to conduct rituals by his sister Goddess Pattini.
Permanent abode
Goddess Pattini had handed over the throne to his brother God Devol, ceded her reign and for Nawagamuwa identified by her as her permanent abode where the ancient shrine consecrated to Goddess Pattini is located.
Prince Devol after establishing as God Devol was in the habit of exploring the hinterland in disguise and he settled down at a suburban village known as Weragoda where Devol found his mistress.
Nobody in the village was aware neither Devol’s magic powers nor his divine connections as he was a total stranger to the area. Even though Devolsamy was unemployed he was in the habit of bringing home rice,sugar, fish, coconut and other essential foodstuff. Devol’s wife gave birth to a son and when he grew up to be a young boy at Weragoda, one day Devol’s wife explained to her son about the suspicious behavior of his father. On the instructions of his mother, the boy followed his father Devol and revealed how he collected rice, coconut and other foodstuffs.
He discovered that his father shake wayside coconut trees and plucked coconuts and obtained sea sand which turned to rice. The next day the miracles did not work and he suspected his son for secretly watching his performances of magic and killed his son. Some believe he killed both his wife and the son. The Seenigama shrine consecrated to God Devol has become a sought after shrine by the devotees seeking divine assistance in resolving numerous problems.
Whenever medical treatments found ineffective for sterility failure of legal procedures for examination success obtain promotions and winning elections and numerous other services devotees seek the divine assistance of God Devol. Originally the people sought the assistance of God Devol to take revenge against their enemies. Now it has become a trend of the Politicians of the Opposition to dash coconuts before the shrine of God Devol thinking God Devol would help them to topple the government in power.
