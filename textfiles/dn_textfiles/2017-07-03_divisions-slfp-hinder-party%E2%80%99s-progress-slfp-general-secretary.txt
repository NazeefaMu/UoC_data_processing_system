Divisions in SLFP hinder party’s progress: SLFP General Secretary

Divisions in the SLFP will only hinder the progress of the party, Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said.
“Under the terms of the 19th amendment to the Constitution, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot aspire to become President again. When a person who had reached the highest echelon in office returns to the political fold again, it will hinder the prospects of others in the party aspiring for leadership,” he said. Dissanayake was addressing a meeting after unveiling a new anicut built at Thimoduwa, Thirappane recently. He said the SLFP was in a coalitiopn government earlier and this time it was in colaition with the UNP because evelopment could not be brought to the village if they continued the political hatred which existed between the two major parties.
He said they were performign a duty by the people of this country by joining hands to take the country forward without resorting to divisive hate politics.
Minister Dissanayake said they had no personal enimity towards former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as they honoured and respected him for the leadership given in winning the war.
Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka should also be honoured for his contribution towards spearheading the war effort as Army Commander, he said.
Provincial Ministers Sarath Ilangasinghe, Susil Gunaratne and several other former local government representatives attended.
