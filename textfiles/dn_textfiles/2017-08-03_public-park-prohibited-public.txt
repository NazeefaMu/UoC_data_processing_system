Public park prohibited for public

The Akkaraipattu public park had been closed for some time and the public urge authorities to open it for public use immediately.
The park falls under the purview of the Akkaraipattu Municipal Council.
The park is without proper maintenance although the people are interested in visiting the park in the evenings. The open hall in the middle of the park is filled with bird faeces.
Therefore, people cannot enter the hall to rest. A part of the roof is hanging and is on the verge of collapse.
Officer-in-charge and other minor staffers of the Municipal Council are not seen in the vicinity. Some parts of the park are infested with weeds. The shady trees and ornamental plants are withered without care.
The park was ceremonially opened by former MP and Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister A. L. M. Athaullah having spent a large sum of money.
