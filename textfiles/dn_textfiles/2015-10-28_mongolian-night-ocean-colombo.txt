Food and Beverage Manager Gerard C. Cruize and Senior Execuitive Chef Ranjith Meegastenne have planned a mouth watering Mongolian menu to offer the hotel's foreign and Sri Lankan guests - a treat of lifetime.
The menu includes a stunning combination of fresh preserved meat, seafood, Basmathi rice and noodles with Mongolian sauce, herbs and spices.
A special feature of the Mongolian Night is that the cooking will be done at a 'Show kitchen' in the presence of guests, Executive Chef Ranjith Meegastenne added.
