Estate bungalows built by British to be renovated

 
The estate bungalows built by the British during the colonial era will be renovated and available to local and foreign guests at affordable rates, State Plantation Corporation (SPC) Chairman Tilak Mahanama said.
Estate bungalows in Galpihilla, Kotaganga and Kelabokka in Kandy owned by the SPC which were in a dilapidated condition for the last 15 years have already been renovated.
Another 10 more bungalows are to be renovated in the future. The bungalows constructed by the British are in a dilapidated state and had only crumbling walls.
These bungalows will be fully renovated to attract local and foreign guests, Mahanama said.
