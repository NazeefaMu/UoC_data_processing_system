What is Zika virus and what dangers does it pose?

With the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro now just a matter of weeks away, athletes from all over the world are making their final preparations for the trip to Brazil.
But with the Zika virus casting a cloud hanging over the Games, several athletes have opted out with many more raising concerns and taking precautions.
So, just what is the Zika virus and what dangers does it pose?
Sportsmail answers the key questions...
What is it? Zika is a virus that has spread predominantly through Latin America and the Caribbean.
How is it spread?
It is predominantly spread by mosquitoes but can also be sexually transmitted. Investigation is ongoing to determine if it could be spread by blood transfusion.
Does it cause you to be unwell?
Those who have suffered Zika have said it caused severe flu-like symptoms and vomiting for between two and seven days.
What are the long-term dangers of catching Zika?
The main danger is to pregnant women or women who intend to be pregnant in the months, or even years. It has been shown to cause microcephaly, an abnormal smallness of the head, in unborn children and also eye defects, hearing loss, and impaired growth.
Does it affect adults, too?
In adults, there is evidence to suggest it can cause Guillain-Barre, an autoimmune disorder that causes temporary paralysis and can result in permanent nerve damage and even death.
Have any athletes caught Zika in Rio so far?
There have been 17,000 international athletes, volunteers and staff involved in test events in the Brazillian capital and so far none has contracted Zika. The Jamaican sprinter Kemar Bailey-Cole caught the Zika virus, but it’s thought he contracted it at home.
What are the International Olympic Committee doing to protect athletes?
Mosquito nets will be provided over the beds in the athletes’ village and all the venues will be made as mosquito-proof as possible. They are also advising frequent use of mosquito repellent.
