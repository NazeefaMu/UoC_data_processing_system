Sri Lanka’s No.1 bank, the Bank of Ceylon has yet again reaffirmed its position among the Top 1000 Banks in the world with the country rank No.1 according to the “The Banker” U.K. Magazine July 2017 issue. Being the only bank to continuously top the list among Sri Lankan banks, BOC without any doubt can boast of its financial and operational strength which is considered to have accounted for this achievement.
With the pledge to commit itself as “Banker’s to the Nation” since its inception the BOC brand has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide financial assistance they require. The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs.25.3 Billion for 2015 and PBT 31.6 Billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking.
“Continuing our quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking, we keep continuing to reach special milestones in the journey, with a steadfast growth. The Bank moved towards modern state-of-the-art banking and exhibiting exceptional financial performance.
Keeping our momentum of growth in every possible way we have moved up the list and yet again confirm as the country’s No.1within the Top 1000 Bank ranking.” Chairman of Bank of Ceylon, President’s Counsel, Ronald C. Perera said.
“We have been always driven by the motive of bringing the best out through every task we carry out as the leading bank in the country. It is my duty to thank my committed staff for all their hard work that was put in to get achievements such as this,” stated the General Manager, D.M. Gunasekera.
