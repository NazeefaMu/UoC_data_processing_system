Genetic technology based treatment proposed for cancer patients

Arrangements have been made to offer genetic technology based treatment for cancer patients in Sri Lanka under the direction of Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne, Health Ministry sources said.
A special discussion will be held next Tuesday on the subject.
The main objective of the discussion is setting up a separate unit for the treatment.
Minister Senaratne had stated that the gene therapy cancer treatment named Keytruda had been produced in US.
The treatment is being administered to the gene which produces the cancer.
Cancer has become the second Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) that kills people and it will become number one soon.
“Cancer patients can be cured since gene technology is being used in the US at present,” the Minister had stated.
