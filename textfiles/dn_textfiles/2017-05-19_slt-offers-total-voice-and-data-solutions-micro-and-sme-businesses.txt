SLT offers total voice and data solutions for micro and SME businesses

The Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCISL) with the concurrence of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will shortly introduce a nationwide programme to bring all micro, small and medium scale businesses to a mainstream platform with the objective of lending support and guidance for a productive and improved overall performance by this sector.
“We will support those engaged in any formal or informal business or trading that provides a service to the community and contributes towards strengthening of this sector, ”said Sarath Kahapalarachchi, Chairman of the Federation.
“The FCCISL together with CH17 Loyalty have mapped out a programme that will identify micro and SMEs, formally recognise them, incorporate them to the national network and reward and recognise them for their service to the community,” said Jumar Preena, CEO, CH17 Loyalty and architect of the programme.
"We also have a very strong partnership with Commercial Bank and MasterCard who will also join this programme and chip in with their expertise, services and facilities exclusively for this sector. For the first time a SME branded Privilege MasterCard Debit/Credit Card will be issued to a registered member, Preena said.
CH17 Loyalty will play a vital role in facilitating privileges and benefits to registered SMEs from their own network of merchants and retailers of consumer products.All these facilities and services will be at very nominal cost and concessionary terms, Preena said.
Primary among them will be the concessions extended to the programme by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) whose services form the backbone of any commercial business. SLT has been very generous in offering up to 60% in discounts on a number of their products.
In addition, the Enterprise Solution Division of SLT will also assist in providing a combination of enterprise solutions at a concessionary rate.
“We want to extend our support to MSMEs to grow and develop their business, which in the long run will help the country to have a strong and robust GDP,” said Prabath Dahanayake, GM Product Development Management, SLT.
“Our unmatched technology and resources in the field of telecommunications and the strength of our superior and reliable services would be an added benefit to this sector. We have the most talented and dedicated team of professionals who can advise on any business solutions whether they are large or small projects," Sanjeewa Jayamaha, DGM Product Development and Management, SLT, said.
Secretary General of FCCISL Ajith Perera said the Federation would welcome any individual or partnerships engaged in any regular business to register and avail themselves of the great benefits that are in store for them through this programme.
