Our record against spin is right up  there, says Joe Root

DAMBULLA, Friday – Don’t expect England to struggle against Sri Lanka’s spinners as they have done in the past for the present team as Test captain Joe Root described is an all-round side with plenty of options to work on which has made them the no. 1 ranked ODI team in the world today.
“I think we've certainly got it in us. There has been signs of that and as a team, our record against spin is right up there if not the best in the world over the last couple of years,” said Root at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
“This is another opportunity to show everyone how good we are against that and to perform well on these surfaces. To do that it's important to understand the rhythm of batting here is very different to back home. The way we structure setting a target or chasing one down might be very different to how we go about it at home,” he said.
“We've managed to do that very well in other places in the world where we've had success recently. It's just another opportunity to do that and to put some experience in the bank for the World Cup. Hopefully from tours like this we'll have had success in different conditions.”
Root described the present England ODI team as a ‘well rounded one with plenty of options’. “I think we are a very well rounded team with plenty of options in all departments, especially batting as deep as we do we give ourselves a good chance.
“With this group I don't think it's skill-based, I think it's about reading the game, reading the situation and adapting quickly. Whether its rain taking time out of the game or the surface changing drastically over the course of a day/nighter or throughout the day,” said Root.
“The way we approach cricket in ODIs is very different since the last time we toured. There is a very different balance and make-up to the team, and the way those guys naturally play will always put bowlers under pressure, whether that’s seam or spin. That can be challenging if you have guys that score in different areas it can be quite to control length.
“Through a lot of hard work over the last three of four years, we have come a long way, but we still have a lot of developing and improving to do to be No. 1 in the world for a long time and to challenge in the World Cup. This is an opportunity to prove that against spin. We’ve done it in the majority of places throughout the world, but can we do it here on spinning surfaces? Root queried.
DANANJAYA LIKE KULDEEP
Root described Akila Dananjaya similar to India’s Kuldeep Yadav. “Yeah, he's got a few skills. Definitely having faced the majority of the overs he bowled has helped with picking things up. He can turn the ball nicely both ways, I think he's got a googly as well so he's obviously a very talented bowler that looks to take wickets. You could tell that with the fields they set, they wanted to attack us and try to capitalise on the two early wickets.”
Root said that every bowler you’ve never faced before is a mystery, because you don’t know what you’re going to get.
“As a batter it’s very easy to build things up, to over-anticipate how things will go. Most importantly you have to play what’s in front of you. A lot of times in the past, playing against quick guys like Mitchell Johnson you can build it up and think it’ll be even quicker, and then you can get out there and it’s a little bit easier. You can get yourself out by talking yourself out. Most importantly you prepare, watch the footage, see how they operate and go and play accordingly.”
“It’s a talented attack, the Sri Lankan spin attack. They have some fine bowlers but we will have to play well against them to score big runs. It’s about worrying about your own game, being clear about each bowler within that attack,” Root said.
