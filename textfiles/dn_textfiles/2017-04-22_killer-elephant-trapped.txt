Killer elephant trapped

A killer wild elephant which terrorised the Meegaswewa area in Thanamalwila and killed three people on April 12 and 14 at Nikawewa, Kivulara and Neluwayaya was caught by a 21-member wildlife team led by Veterinary Surgeon W. A. Dharmakeerthi on the orders of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena. A ministry release said the elephant will be taken to the Horowpothana Elephant Transit home.
