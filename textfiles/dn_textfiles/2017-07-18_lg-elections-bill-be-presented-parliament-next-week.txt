LG Elections Bill to be presented in Parliament next week

The Bill on the Local Government(LG) Elections would be presented in Parliament next week since all the affairs by the government with regard to the election is completed, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
He also said that although various politicians and sections of the media level allegations that the government is not holding the elections, what really has happened is that the Bill which was drafted on the election of members to the Local Government institutions previously had many flaws.
President Sirisena made these observations at the national workshop held to educate the heads of Local Government institutions on garbage management and controlling the dengue epidemic.
The workshop was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI).
The President also stated that a long lasting mechanism on garbage management will be formulated within a few months following discussions with the secretaries to the Local Government institutions.
“But so far not a single government had implemented a proper garbage management mechanism,” President Sirisena said.
“All must work together solve the garbage and Dengue issues without levelling various accusations,”the President said.
The President also said that the Government hopes to solve these issues soon and will not burder the next Government with the same problems.
