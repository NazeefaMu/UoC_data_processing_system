Two-storey latrine complex for N’Eliya under WB funds

The City Planning and Water Supply Ministry will construct a two storeyed latrine network for the Nuwara Eliya city with World Bank assistance under the ministry’s ‘Wasip’ project.

The Nuwara Eliya latrine project, with modern facilities, will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 150 million, said Ministry Secretary D. G. M. V. Hapuarachchi.
