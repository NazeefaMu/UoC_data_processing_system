Foreign referee ensures that it’s a clean game

On Sunday evening the key Dialog ‘A’ division rugby game between Kandy SC and Navy SC at Nittawella proved beyond doubt that it is the right choice of referee that not only changed the game pattern but it was very efficiently handled. Rugby referees often have a difficult job on their hands. Unlike other sports, rugby laws can at times be very complicated and are subject to constant reviews and renewals.
Sam George Jones, an Englishmen born in South Hampshire and now a resident of Perth was brought down to referee the all-important game in Kandy. By some distance he has a promising career ahead of him if he can maintain his fitness and doesn’t get ahead of himself. This 19-year-old referee who migrated to Australia when he was seven years of age is sure to hit the top. He is a member of the Western Australian Rugby Union Referees Association and a student of the University of Western Australia. He arrived in Sri Lanka on Friday, and he was in the company of Imran from SLRFU and left on Tuesday.
Jones said that he enjoyed the game, and if invited once again he would be pleased to accept the offer. He said, as a young referee he may have been under-appreciated but he did the job in a positive manner, looking to keep the game flowing by being quick to penalize players who do not roll away or release, something that fans appreciated. Possessing a strong character Jones had the courage to take complete control of the game in front of a stadium almost house full. He seemed to have a good rapport with the players and his consistency was a benefit to the game. He uniquely became popular amongst the players and the spectators. There were no issues at all or referring to the Linesman, Commissioner or the TMO. This young referee has mostly blown in schools games and this was his first big game against a packed house.
Jones said both sides played a clean game without any cause to reprimand any player adversely and the spectator behavior was very good. The winning team forwards were in top form and due to their forwards good work they won the match and accumulated points. He said his club in Australia is packed with 30% each of Englishmen, New Zealanders and South Africans and with only 10% Australians. He said that in rugby teams should learn to play a clean game with no mistakes, it’s only then the game is enjoyed by the spectators and the players develop for their future.
He said the winning team played to their skill levels and that too in the style they wanted, but that was simply because the forwards were together won good ball and fed their three quarters to score. Today according to the Referees Society except for Kandy SC and CH & FC all other clubs have asked for foreign referees.
