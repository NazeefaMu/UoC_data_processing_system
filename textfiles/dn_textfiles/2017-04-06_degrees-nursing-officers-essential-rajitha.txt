Degrees for nursing officers essential: Rajitha

Cabinet approval was granted yesterday for the proposed nursing faculty and hostel, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, it is essential to create a degree for nursing officers in order to obtain a more dedicated service from them which will be worth more than rupees and cents.
Employment will be provided for nursing graduates. A separate salary scale will be created for them.
He was addressing the Annual General Meeting of the Government Nurses Association at the Maharagama Youth Centre auditorium yesterday.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that Cabinet approval was received for a nursing faculty and a hostel that can train and house 2,000 nurses.
The faculty is to be launched with the assistance of the Colombo University.
The 14 story hostel will include a swimming pool and a fully equipped gym.
In the past, foreign scholarships were given only for Health Ministry officials, but now it is made available to all positions and grades. Many people think like frogs in a well and suffer from the `island mentality’.
