First Aid comes to aid

A comprehensive First Aid Manual in Sinhala, Tamil and English developed by the St John Ambulance Sri Lanka was ceremonially launched at the Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) at BMICH on September 25.
The Chief Medical Adviser, St John Ambulance in England and the Islands, Dr Margaret Austin graced the occasion as a special guest.
The occasion was also graced by other distinguished guests including the St John Ambulance Association and Brigade in Sri Lanka’s Batticaloa district president Al Haj A L M Meerasahibo.
Dr Kaushila Thilakasiri, a young doctor who is the Director–Training and Development, St John Ambulance Association and Brigade in Sri Lanka has coordinated and co-authored the manual with Dr Margaret Austin with the assistance of the honorary expert review committee.
The manual is done by adhering to the current European and UK Resuscitation Council guidelines and Advanced Trauma Life Support Course guidelines.
The objective of this practical manual is to instruct people of basic first aid skills and provide them with the knowledge needed to make a positive difference in the life of any ill or injured person who receives aid.
The manual discusses measures to be taken for common, mild, serious, and life threatening situations people may face, in a step-by-step-manner, using illustrations and photographs to help them understand the problem at hand. Speaking at the event Dr Margaret Austin said, the term ‘First Treatment and National Aid’ has eventually become, First Aid.
“Either directly or indirectly, every citizen is affected by injury or illness at some point. Hence it is important for all of us to be able to recognize emergency medical events having the basic knowledge and skills necessary to summon appropriate help and to provide basic care until that help arrives. My mother used to apply butter on burn injuries which is not done now. Now we do first aid the scientific way”, she said.
Dr Margaret Austin currently is the chairman of the editorial board of the Tripartite Medical Committee developing the First Aid Manual which was awarded the Chairman’s Special Award at the British Medical Associations Book Competition Awards Ceremony in 2009. She continues to update the manual for the purpose of First Aid teaching. She has helped edit the St John Sri Lanka with this new First Aid manual which will be the basis of all First Aid training. The manual will be sold to the general public for First Aid advice particularly in remote areas having limited availability to immediate healthcare.
Dr Kaushila Thilakasiri said in her career she has come across many patients and diseased people who would have benefitted and would have lived if they had proper first aid.
“I hope that you will enjoy learning how to help those in need of emergency care and you will gain confidence in your knowledge and skills with the help of this manual. I recommend you to learn first aid and to refresh your skills on a regular basis. You can make a difference!” said Dr Kaushila.”
The first aid manual has been developed under the Social Enterprise Development Project of the St. John Ambulance.
International Division of the Order of St John provided the financial support for this publication. It is based on The Authorized Manual of St John Ambulance, St Andrew’s First Aid and the British Red Cross.
The First Aid Manual is designed and printed by M D Gunasena and Company.
