South Asia's largest Beach Sports Festival in Sri Lanka

South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) will sponsor the inaugural edition of 'Aqua Vida' scheduled to be held at Jetwing Beach, Negombo on November 14.
The event will bring together over 700 athletes in an exciting and fun-filled festival with live entertainment and activities. The beach sports festival will include a wide range of sports including - Beach Football, Beach Volleyball, Beach Waterpolo, Beach Handball, Beach Rugby and a Sea Swim.
Over 10 teams in each of the sporting disciplines will participate marking the first ever Beach Waterpolo and Handball games to be played in Sri Lanka.
Three-time Olympic champion and legendary Hungarian Water Polo player Dr. Gergely Kiss will be the Brand Ambassador for the event.
Awnee Razack the Chairman of the Organizing Committee said "we wanted to create a Beach sports festival in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is surrounded by beautiful sea and we must make use of this. We do not have teams which do well in Beach Sports or any kind of beach sports festival and we believe this will be a new beginning of a long journey".
In announcing the sponsorship the CEO of SAGT Erwin Haaze commented: "SAGT is pleased to partner with Aqua Vida to promote Beach Games and provide a platform for the youth of the country to further develop their skills and talents."
