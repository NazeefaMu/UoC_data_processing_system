The Christmas Market at the Courtyard

Come December 17, Cinnamon Grand’s Courtyard lobby area at the ground level will no longer just be the ultra-chic lounge of relaxation. Instead, it will be turned in to a Christmas Market, wrapped up entirely in festive spirit, embracing each patron walking in with aromas of chestnuts roasting, the homely whiff of freshly baked bread and the mouthwatering scent of roasts, stuffing and pie.
Debuting Cinnamon Grand’s own twist on the traditional Christmas festive fairs of the world, the Christmas Market will not only feature specialty food items from around the globe, but also creates a unique opportunity to revel in the season’s best.
On from December 17 to the 24 December from 10am to 10pm, the Christmas Market has been conceptualized by Cinnamon Grand Executive Chef German born Dirk Heinen.
Taking on a charming bazaar like atmosphere, the Market will feature over 80 seasonal fare that are popular around the globe; especially from Germany, Italy and England. German specialties will include Bavarian bread dumplings, ‘Spatzle’ traditional German pasta, German bratwurst, pickled herring, demie glace and more; Italy will be represented by homemade pastas and pesto and from England will be the traditional mutton mince pie, turkey and ham pies among others.

With the objective being to make festive feasting at home, a more exciting and an interesting one in a shorter time span, one will also find pre-made turkey stuffing, gravy & sauces, Christmas veggies, variety of freshly roasted nuts, Christmas bread stand with over 10 varieties of breads from around Europe made in-house by the talented chefs, a butcher shop of sorts presenting some 15 items inclusive of home-made hams, home smoked chicken, sausages and pate and more.
A separate counter for Christmas delights will also be set up here. Lebkuchenherzen or German hearts, sugar apples, mixed Christmas cookies, fruit preservatives, sticky puddings and traditional Christmas puddings are some of the festive treats that will be available for purchase.
No longer will one be in a rush on Christmas Eve or when inviting guests over. At the Christmas Market one will find everything that the best host dreams of laying out on the table to enhance the seasonal dining experience or entertainment, at highly affordable prices.
