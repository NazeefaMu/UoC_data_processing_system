SECRETS celebrates  11th Anniversary with expansions

SECRETS, which is both the brand and the name of the store is Sri Lanka’s specialist Lingerie retailer which fulfils the needs of the discerning lingerie shopper whether it be for a good fit, comfort, or style; in an atmosphere, an ambience that is comfortable, exciting and satisfying.
SECRETS also plans to expand its business with more lingerie stores for easy access in the near future with more avant-garde new fashion parallel to its 11th Anniversary celebrations.
The first SECRETS store opened 11 years ago on June 26, which has now grown to three. In a fitting celebration of their 10th Anniversary, SECRETS opened its 3rd Lingerie Store in Jaffna on the very day that they first opened their very first Lingerie Store at Liberty Plaza.
“SECRETS offer a unique shopping experience going beyond a mere quest of purchasing lingerie by customers. With our personalized, customer service - every customer gets one-to-one attention - creating a shopping environment, where customers enjoy the ‘ultimate lingerie experience’ with the widest array of choices in styles and sizes available to fulfil their needs.
This exceptional service provided to our customers during the past 11 years has contributed immensely to our success,” said SECRETS Chief Executive Officer Priya Gunawardane.
What you wear underneath your everyday garments really does matter - every great outfit starts with the underwear that you choose and getting this aspect right can make all the difference to how you look and feel.
In a world where external finery is emphasized and extolled, SECRETS by its unmatched collection of lingerie has proven that ‘Nothing shows but your confidence’.
If there is just one thing that SECRETS has contributed to society in its eleven years of consistent growth, it’s the virtue of confidence. Confidence has not so much to do with how you look. Instead, high self esteem comes from how you feel at any moment.
