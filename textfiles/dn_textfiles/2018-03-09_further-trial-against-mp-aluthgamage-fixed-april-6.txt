Further trial against MP Aluthgamage fixed for April 6

The Colombo High Court yesterday began recording evidence in a case filed against former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the second time.
This is for the alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs. 3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, an officer attached to the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) Parliament Branch gave evidence stating that Aluthgamage had opened a current account at his branch in 2010. Further trial fixed for April 6.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,000,000, misappropriated Rs. 1,900,000, and misappropriated another Rs. 1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October, 2012 and April 2013.
