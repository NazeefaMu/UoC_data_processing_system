Sri Lanka U19 lose warm-up to Australia

Australia, who have lifted the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup trophy three times put up a strong display on the second day of the warm-up matches defeating Sri Lanka by 53 runs at Hagley Oval on Tuesday.  
Australia had a good outing as most of their players came good with either bat or ball. They got runs through opener Jack Edwards (50) and Jonathan Merlo, who smashed four fours and four sixes during his knock of 78.  
The total of 251 for seven in 50 overs was easily defended as all-rounders Will Sutherland and Jason Rolston made good use of the seaming conditions to finish with three wickets each, while Austin Waugh, son of Steve Waugh, picked up two wickets as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 198 in 42.5 overs.  
Sri Lanka were 64 for six in the 17th over and it took an 84-run seventh-wicket partnership between Hasith Boyagoda (69) and Ashen Bandara (51) to lift the Asian side to a decent score.  
Scores:  Australia 251-7 in 50 overs (Jonathan Merlo 78, Jack Edwards 50, Nathan McSweeny 31; Praveen Jayawickrama 2/18, Nipun Malinga 2/41, Thisaru Rashmika 2/59)   Sri Lanka 198 in 42.5 overs (Hasitha Boyagoda 69, Ashen Bandara 51; Will Sutherland 3/25, Jason Ralston 3/36, Austin Waugh 2/27)
