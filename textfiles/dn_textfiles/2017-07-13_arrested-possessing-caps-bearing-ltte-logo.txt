Arrested for possessing caps bearing LTTE logo

Three suspects including a former Army Intelligence officer Subramaniam Nagulerasa alias Nagulan who were arrested over the seizure of several caps bearing the LTTE logo in Narahenpita, were yesterday ordered to be released from the case by Colombo Additional Magistrate Chandana Kalansuriya.
The Additional Magistrate made this order consequent to the Attorney General's advice that he was not expecting to institute legal action against the suspects.
Police seized several caps bearing the LTTE logo at Narahenpita when they were to be sent abroad through a courier service. The parcel was detected when the “from” address was found to be suspicious. The suspects were arrested after reviewing CCTV records near the Vavuniya Post office.
