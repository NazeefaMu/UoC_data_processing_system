Samsung launched the Galaxy A5 (2017) and Galaxy A7 (2017) smartphones in India. The company had first launched the smartphones in Russia ahead of CES 2017. Both smartphones will be available in Black Sky and Gold Sand colour variants in India.
Both models will go on sale in the country from March 15, while pre-booking of the smartphones has begun via the Samsung E-Store as well as offline retailers.
The highlight of Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) and the Galaxy A7 (2017) smartphones is their Galaxy S7-style design, their “enhanced” cameras (compared to their predecessors) with low-light optimisation, and a simplified camera UX with a Food Mode.
The new Samsung Galaxy A-series smartphones also come with an IP68-rating for dust and water resistance, which Samsung claims is a first for the price segment. The Galaxy A5 (2017) and the Galaxy A7 (2017) smartphones also come with 32GB of inbuilt storage that's expandable via microSD card (up to 256GB), a fingerprint scanner (placed on the home button), an Always on Display, a USB Type-C port coupled with a 3.5mm audio jack, Samsung Pay support, as well as the presence of features like Samsung Cloud and Secure Folder.
Samsung has launched the dual-SIM variants of the two Galaxy A (2017) series smartphones in the country, and they run Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.
