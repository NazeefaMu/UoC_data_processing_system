The Green Supply Chain: True sustainability or just one marketing stunt?

The supply chain encompasses all of those activities associated with moving goods from the raw-materials stage through to the end user, advocates for business process realized that significant productivity increases could only come from managing relationships, information, and material flow across enterprise borders. In other words SCM is the management that integrate physical flow of goods and related information, from procurement to final consumption, enhancing customer, and economic value.
Environmental management has become a topic of mutual concern for businesses, Governments and consumers due to increasing high levels of industrialization the growing concern in the global market for “green” issues and the scarcity of natural resources have forced executives to view supply chain strategies from an environmental perspective. High environmental risk industries, including chemical, plastic, automotive, and heavy engineering, have always considered improvements in environmental performance as one of the basic competitive priorities, alongside lower costs, manufacturing lead-time, and quality.
For instance, the countries passed the Restriction of Hazardous Substance and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations demanding compliance with the relevant regulatory laws of product recycling and prohibiting the use of hazardous substances in products for sale in the market. In this development, the supply chain manager plays an important role of selecting and developing appropriate green strategies with the objective of improving environmental, economic, and social performance as well as gaining a competitive advantage.
Background on Green
The term “green” is now widely used interchangeably on the more established “sustainability” concept, which points to a more holistic view of environmental, social and economic impact. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is an emerging field motivated by the need for environmental consciousness. Stranding out of the conventional supply chain view, GSCM was sparked by the “quality revolution” in the 1980s and the supply chain revolution in the 1990s. Over the years, GSCM has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners, focusing on reducing waste and preserving the quality of product-life and natural resources. Eco-efficiency, which seeks to minimize ecological damage while maximizing production efficiency, and remanufacturing, have become key assets to achieve best practices. Customer demands and governmental pressures continue to push businesses to be more and more sustainable. Consequently, governmental legislations and public mandates for environmental accountability have brought up these issues on the drawing board of many strategic planners, bringing several green concepts into place.
Following the green or ecological pressures from customers, stakeholders, and governments, a number of operational guidelines, standards and legislative frameworks have been put in place to minimize environmental impact. Motivated by the need for companies to move towards ecologically sustainable business practices, the ISO14000 series standard was designed with the following objectives;
a. Encouraging an internationally common approach to environmental management;
b. Strengthening companies’ abilities to measure and improve environmental performance, through continual system audits, and improving international trade and removing trade barriers.
In light of the above issues, it can be seen that GSCM is driven by the increased environmental deterioration such as depletion of raw materials, overflowing waste landfills, and pollution in general. Thus, GSCM primarily seeks to minimise the wastes within the industrial system, to prevent the dissipation of harmful materials into the environment, and to conserve energy resources. The objective, however, is not only about environmental friendliness, but also a good sense of business and higher profits. Business organisations have realised the need to upgrade their supply chain management from a purely functional role to a strategic role to comply with current environmental legislations and maintain an enduring competitive advantage, through technological innovation and improved eco-efficiency. Operations managers in earlier environmental management systems were involved only at arm’s length where individual organizational units managed environmental performance in product and process design, logistics, marketing, compliance regulations, and waste management. Though it has long been realised that green strategies should meet the required order winning criteria in the market place, the idea needs to be extended to the entire supply chain. Best practices call for collaborative integration of environmental and operational performance. There is a growing need for integrating environmentally sound choices into supply chain management practice and research.
Objectives
In view of the above issues, supply chain management has recently shifted its roles to refocus the supply chain in the following areas:
a. Natural environment.
b. Environmental performance.
c. Enhancing supply chain collaboration.
 
This paradigm shift has been influenced by local and international legislative changes, market pressure, and the increased use of environmental requirements from customers in the supply chain. This has generally encouraged fast acceptance of green principles world-wide. Currently, there is a substantial need for improvement on the best way to select the most appropriate green strategy in a particular industry context. Very few researchers have considered the issue of identifying taxonomies for conventional supply chain management. The taxonomy can provide the basis for developing theories. In addition, taxonomy also provides parsimonious categorical types without losing the main information or characteristics that exist within the type, and has been applied in strategic management and logistics studies.
GSCM focus
Four main areas of focus are environmental performance standards, eco-efficiency, green technology innovations, and collaborative supply chain with remanufacturing and recycling practices.
One important observation from these empirical activities is their remarkable focus on operations that influence environmental performance, as opposed to conventional supply chains which focus on customer satisfaction, service quality, responsiveness, and the supply chain cost. The central goals of the green supply chain are primarily centred on those process operations that influence environmental performance.
Thus, the end goals of GSCM are categorised as follows:
a. Waste (of all types): minimization of waste;
b. Energy usage: minimize energy consumption; and
c. Resource usage or material consumption: optimize resource usage.
The success of GSCM goals, that is, waste reduction, minimal energy usage and optimal resource consumption, are strongly dependent on the green operations or processes chosen. On the one hand, processes can be eco-efficient by focusing on operations-based efficient targets which provide secondary environmental benefits. On the other hand, processes can be more environmentally specific, with more product-life cycle considerations. Such processes tend to be more focused on green efficiency. It is important to note that the green process operations are directly related to the inherent product characteristics.
GSCM goals are influenced by the green product (process) chosen; a green product (or process) can either be innovative or functional, while a process operation can be cantered on eco-efficiency or green efficiency.
One other important observation in this is that the above empirical activities show that green supply chains tend to improve their performance by developing specific green capabilities and by building collaborative supply chain relationships. The supply chain improvement towards the green practices is enhanced through competitive pressure from the market or customers, regulatory certification schemes, incentives, and direct involvement. Supply chain relationships are often developed based on two different climates, namely, coercive climate, where contractual clauses are enforced between suppliers and customers and collaborative climate, which calls for increased mutual involvement for customers and suppliers. These climates act as determinants of the success of green strategies chosen. Because the coercive approach demands a prescribed minimal level of compliance to standards, it lacks capacity to encourage advanced performance management. On the other hand, collaboration encourages new knowledge, technologies and innovation. However, a higher level of inter-organisation involvement and collaboration is required, if green supply chain goals are to be achieved. In this regard, we draw on the influence of supply chain collaboration on the success of GSCM strategies to define a framework for selecting appropriate green strategies. But how does the nature of process or product influence the success of the green supply chain? GSCM goals are enhanced by two types of green supply chain relationships, that is, coercive or collaborative relationships. A common question arises as to what might be the most appropriate green supply chain strategy given a specific context, with a particular product, a specific process, and/or a particular supply chain relationship. What are the underlying GSCM dimensions upon which the right choice of green strategies can be made? In this, we draw on the critical issues of supply chain relationship, product and process types to establish a taxonomic methodology for the selection of appropriate green supply chain strategies. The next section identifies the relevant dimensions of GSCM strategies together with their specific gradations.
Dimensions of green
The relationship is a crucial dimension that must be taken into consideration when developing a taxonomic framework for the selection of appropriate green strategies. Findings in this study also identified product and process technology characteristics as key dimensions that influence the choice of green strategies. We suggest a three dimensional taxonomic scheme that is more appropriate for delineating GSCM strategies. The dimensions and their gradations are as follows:
a. Relationship (supply chain relationship) - is either coercive or collaborative;
b. Process - focuses on either eco-efficiency or green efficiency;
c. Product - is either functional or innovative.
A coercive supply chain relationship is characterised by enforced contractual clauses between suppliers and customers. This approach demands a minimal level of compliance to standards, with very low information sharing. Suppliers seek to meet predictable demand at the lowest possible costs. On the contrary, a collaborative supply chain calls for enhanced mutual involvement between customers and suppliers. In addition, supply chains tend to respond quickly to unpredictable demand due to their high agility and flexibility. Product life cycle costs and overall supply chain costs are the main objectives of the collaborative supply chain. This approach is conducive to innovation and dynamic technology evolution. In light of these issues, we provide a summary of our views on the characteristics of coercive and collaborative supply chain relationships.
Although characterising products as functional or innovative may be an oversimplification, it is a practical high-level classification. In our view, functional products tend to satisfy basic needs, which do not change much over time, e.g., staples. Consequently, such products have stable, predictable demand and long life cycles. It follows that their processes do not change much over time, and they focus on eco-efficiency through optimal resource usage and low waste in order to maximize economic performance. On the other hand, innovative products tend to satisfy fast-changing needs. As such, innovative products have unpredictable demand and short life cycles, e.g., hand phones. What makes a product innovative is the drive towards green efficiency through the application of specialised processes with the aim of keeping up-to-date with emerging environmental legislation. Hence, innovative products and green efficiency are highly related.
Strategies for GSCM
Risk-Based?Strategies, the simplest strategy of GSCM with regard to inter organizational investment resource development is one of the risk minimization. Firms adopting this strategy are proposed to do so in response ostensibly to stakeholder requirements. Such a strategy is ideal for the organization that retains minimal internal environmental management resources or has only recently begun to consider the introduction of a supply chain greening program.
Efficiency-Based?Strategies, a more complex and developing strategy in recent years has been the ‘eco-efficiency’ or ‘lean-and-green’ approach to GSCM. This type of strategy derives environmental performance benefit for the supply chain beyond mere regulatory compliance through the requirement for suppliers to meet operations-based efficiency targets
Close?Loop?Strategies,? the whole supply chain includes the reverse flow of products and materials for the purpose of material replacement, waste treatment, re-processing, remanufacturing, repairing and/or recycling. The complete logistics system must include two parts: Forward Logistics and Reverse Logistics. However, in the present scenario, managers are focused only forward logistics being ignorant towards reverse logistics. There are two types of reverse logistics ‘asset recovery’ and ‘green reverse logistics’ The challenges faced by India in reverse logistics are: meeting customer expectations, managing expenses, Infrastructure, unorganized retails, complicated rules and regulation
Compliance-based strategies, include establishment of international standard systems such as ISO 14001, use of performance standards, inclusion of purchasing contracts for suppliers to meet certain regulatory requirements. Similar to basic certification systems is the use of broad statements with purchasing principles or guidelines for suppliers. Most organisations such as Wal-Mart and Seventh Generation introduced procurement requirements for compliant purchasing.
The advantages offered by compliance-centred strategies are as follows:
 
a. Environmental performance benefits;
b. Use of globally recognised systems, and;
c. Third party management of performance.
 
These aspects in turn, improve recognition and acceptance not only by suppliers, but also by the market and stakeholders. Any ambiguity in regards to the desired performance is reduced significantly. The disadvantage of these strategies is that, because if their reactive approach, they offer limited competitive edge due to their lack of innovativeness, a lack of uniqueness, and ease of application by competing supply chains. Since these systems are managed in a low collaboration climate, they only guarantee compliance with regulatory requirements. As a result, additional benefits from innovation or economic efficiency are very unlikely.
Lean strategies, are a more recent group of green strategies whose focus is on eco-efficiency in which suppliers are required to satisfy certain operations-based efficiency targets. In addition, secondary environmental performance benefits may be obtained from some operations practices that provide green performance advantages. These strategies are ideal when the supply chain relationship is more collaborative and the process/product is still functional. A high level of inter-organisational collaboration, arising from the use of integrative inter-firm performance requirements, is necessary for situations with complex problems associated with waste reduction and recycling. The lean-based strategies link environmental performance with operational efficiency within the supply chain, allowing for the extension of performance requirements into the supply chain that maximises economic performance while enhancing environmental performance through waste reduction and optimized (minimal) resource usage. Wal-Mart introduced green strategies aimed at creating zero waste and selling of products that sustain Wal-Mart’s resources and the environment.
The advantages of lean-based strategies are: (i) they offer eco-efficiency to the entire supply chain and (ii) they readily lend themselves to existing organisation goals of optimisation and cost reduction. On the other hand, lean-based strategies do not give room for advanced environmental management initiatives such as green product design, innovation and material substitution. In so doing, the lean strategy is considered as technically weak.
Impact of green strategies on operations policies
The above study highlighted the fact that specific green strategies affect various aspects of supply chain operations, including the purchase of materials and energy, new process technologies, process control involving disposal operations as well as water and air pollution and the output of green and clean products. In retrospect, each strategy has specific impacts on purchasing, product technology, process technology, and logistics and transportation activities, as well as performance measurement systems. We outline the impact of these green strategies in the following sections.
Since the strategy calls for compliance with stakeholders’ requirements, organisations tend to react to changes to regulatory requirements. As a result, purchasing policies should be focus on avoiding the use of hazardous materials through development of appropriate material selection criteria. Often, ad hoc solutions are introduced on production processes in a bid to adapt to new environmental requirements, which may be costly in the long term. Not many changes are expected in logistics and transport operations. Basic environmental performance standards such as ISO14000 and OHSAS18000 series standards are adequate for this strategy.
Significant changes are highly expected regarding operations policies as the supply chain players seek to gain a competitive advantage. Procurement policies are supposed to be changed through collaborative relationships. Supply chain value partners have to collaborate in establishing research and development (R&D) projects that carry out product life-cycle analysis aimed at introducing new product and process technology innovations to contribute to the overall value creation. As far as production processes are concerned, organisations do not only seek to gain green efficiency from an ecological perspective, but also to take advantage of the green strategy to gain a competitive position. New green products that can be remanufactured or recycled are expected. As a result, management should pay attention to developing relationships between supply chain operations. As far as logistics is concerned, recycling and product take back initiatives are a priority. Therefore, logistics operations should be redesigned to suit such integrative relationships between players.
Green Supply Chain management is the field that incorporates majorly environmental and sustainable issues starting from the procurement till the customers’ shelf. Apparently in the present scenario the green supply chain practices focus on cost reduction and pollution prevention, due to which we are observing positive changes in organizations evolving and incorporating more proactive sustainable measures into their strategy and as everyday practice. However, organizations must also include the factor of corporate social responsibility into their kitty of strategies to build up credence about themselves in the view of customers, stakeholders, shareholders and employees; as the organizations are corporate citizens of the society at large.
