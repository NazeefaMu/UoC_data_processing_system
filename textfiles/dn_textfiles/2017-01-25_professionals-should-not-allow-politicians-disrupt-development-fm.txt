Professionals  should not allow  politicians to disrupt  development - FM

Professionals should not allow bureaucrats and inefficient politicians to disrupt ongoing development drive, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said. He said many public officials and even certain politicians keep silence in the face of such bureaucracy consequently suppressing the innocent people of this country. The minister expressed these views at the inaugural ceremony of the Diploma in Public Procumbent and Contract Administration Training Course held at the Miloda Financial Academy in Colombo this morning (January 23). A Procurement Specialist and Fraud Investigator Dr. Colin Cram of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in Britain delivered the keynote address.
Karunanayake said professionals today need not to fear to challenge bureaucrats and inefficient politicians.
 He pointed out that professionals should come forward to implement the development drive introduced by the current government.
The minister said that it is no point if it is unable to prove walk the talk. He said many public servants are reluctant to challenge inefficient politicians therefore they just keep silent and get accustomed to the entrapping system.
Karunanayake who explained how public funds are lost due to inefficiency and corruption in the procurement process pointed out that such large sums of money could be saved by improving efficiency in the part of public servants.
He said drastic changes need to be made in the Procurement Commission and in its Appeal Board; therefore the President and the Prime Minister have appointed a Special Cabinet Subcommittee intending to correct this situation.
He said the entire world is facing economic turbulences today and the reason for top world investors to eye on Sri Lanka is the disciplined and coherent economic foundation that we built in the country during the current regime.
The minister reiterated that the duty of all professionals is to forget the past and make commitments to enable this efficient government to reach its set goals and face impending global challenges.
