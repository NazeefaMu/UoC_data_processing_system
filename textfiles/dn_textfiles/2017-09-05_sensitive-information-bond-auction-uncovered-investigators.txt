Sensitive information on Bond auction uncovered by investigators

 
Investigators attached to the Treasury Bond Commission have unearthed highly sensitive information unveiling the backstage of the controversial Treasury bond issuance at the 27 February 2015 auction, a reliable source said.
The critical information has been derived from the telephone call recordings which were initially destroyed by the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
A telephone conversation between PTL Owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena has revealed the said vital information, which will be led as evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue tomorrow morning, the source confirmed.
Original backup of all the telephone conversations, including the destroyed ones, was handed over to the Treasury Bond Commission last yesterday, by PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado.  Evidence was led before the PCoI revealing that PTL CEO Kasun Palisena instructed the PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado to destroy more than 100 telephone conversations and to crash the voice logger computer of PTL’s telephone call recording system.
