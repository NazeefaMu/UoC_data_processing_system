WI legend Brian Lara to deliver Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s

Former West Indies batsman Brian Lara will deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s later this year.
Lara still holds the records for the highest individual scores in Test and first-class matches, and is one of only seven batsmen to have surpassed 10,000 runs in both Tests and one-day internationals.
The Trinidadian will become the second former Windies star to give the showpiece address, after Clive Lloyd did so in 2006, when he delivers his speech on September 4 - three days before the start of England’s third Test against West Indies at HQ.
MCC president Matthew Fleming said: ‘I know from personal, and painful, experience, that Brian Lara is quite simply one of the best cricketers to have ever picked up a bat. When he batted, he changed the landscape of the sport.
‘Now in retirement, he is demonstrating a perception and passion for the game which suggests he will continue to help shape the game into the future.
‘An incredibly popular and respected man throughout the cricketing world, I am thrilled that Brian has agreed to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture this year and everyone at the club looks forward to his thoughtful insights on the future of cricket.’ – Daily Mail
