Mountain Dew represented by Varun Beverages wins bronze at SLIM awards

Varun Beverages Lanka, which represents Mountain Dew as a franchise holder of Pepsico, won a Bronze Award at the 16th SLIM Brand Excellence Awards held recently in Colombo.
This significant win reflects excellence in brand performance and brand identity as a result of innovative strategies and best practices deployed by Varun Beverages Lanka in an effort to enhance the value proposition of the popular Mountain Dew brand.
 Commenting on their triumph, Dulanee Weerackody - General Manager and Key Accounts at Varun Beverages Lanka said, “We are proud to receive the Bronze Award at the 16th SLIM Brand Excellence Awards as it is a testimony to our untiring efforts to grow and expand Mountain dew brand in Sri Lanka. Our journey has been exciting thus far and being awarded recognition for our innovative brand excellence and strategic marketing is a culmination of a dedicated group effort by the entire team. Mountain Dew, a brand of Ole spring water, entered the market at a time when competition was intense in the local market.
What’s more, we had to contend with establishing the Mountain Dew brand in a market where most players had already built high equity over a period of time.” The company dared to adopt a bold strategy for the Mountain Dew in the local market, which stood out for its fearless attitude. Espousing powerful aspirational values, the brand was launched amidst unprecedented market visibility, experiential sampling, differentiated packaging and unique consumer proposition. 
Varun Beverages, is the one of the largest franchisees in the world (outside US) of Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) and Non-Carbonated Beverages (NCBs) sold under trademarks owned by PepsiCo. It produces and distributes a wide range of CSDs, as well as a large selection of NCBs, including packaged drinking water.
