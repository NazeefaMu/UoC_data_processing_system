JDR praised government for its prompt remedial measures

The Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Expert team, which presented a report to the President on the Meethotamulla garbage dump on Monday, has said that the Government authorities have been taking prompt action on disaster risk reduction and measures to stabilise the garbage mound following its collapse.
The Japanese Embassy in a statement on the JDR Expert Team findings yesterday noted that the team observed that the Government mobilised relevant stakeholders in disaster risk reduction and waste management jointly and took immediate measures for stability of the garbage mound.
The JDR Expert team presented their technical views for safety management and prevention of secondary disaster, to stabilise the site, and for future waste management plan. The team noted of the media reports on the dump site were not based on the data and findings observed by them at the site. They said they intend to present a more detailed report and hope that it will be effectively used by the Government.
The team thanked the Sri Lankan side for the support given.
The Japanese Embassy said the Government of Japan decided to dispatch the Japan Disaster Relief (JDR) Expert Team to Sri Lanka upon the request of the Sri Lanka Government, in response to the damage caused by the collapse of a garbage mound at the disposal site in Meethotamulla, Colombo.
The team stayed and conducted activities in Sri Lanka from April 20 to 24.
The team has reported their findings to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 24, the statement said.
