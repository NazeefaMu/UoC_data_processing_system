Silva from the favela gets Brazil’s first gold

Rio de Janeiro,Tuesday: A female athlete from the favelas won Brazil’s first gold medal of the Rio Games on Monday as Michael Phelps stepped up his campaign for yet more Olympic honours.
Rafaela Silva, who grew up in Rio’s notorious City of God slum, upset world number one Sumiya Dorjsuren to win the women’s under-57kg judo, sparking pandemonium among fans.
Silva sank to her knees in delight after a win that jump-starts Brazil’s Olympic campaign and secures only their second medal after Felipe Wu’s shooting silver.
“It’s great for kids who are watching judo now. Seeing someone like me who left the City of God, who started judo at five years of age as a joke,” said Silva.
“To be world champion and Olympic champion is something inexplicable.”
Earlier Phelps, who grabbed his 19th Olympic gold medal late on Sunday, was back in action as he eased into the semi-finals of his signature event, the 200m butterfly.
“I probably got to sleep at 3:00 am and was on an 11:00 am bus, so quick turn-arounds,” Phelps said. “But the good thing is we have a long time between the prelims and finals, so we are able to rest.” AFP
