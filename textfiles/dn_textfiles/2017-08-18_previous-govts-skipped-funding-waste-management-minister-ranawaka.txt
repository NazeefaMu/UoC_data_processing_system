Previous govts skipped funding for waste management: Minister Ranawaka

The garbage problem which reached a bursting point because past governments which gave priority to building expressways and reservoirs, failed to provide funds for waste management, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was speaking at a ceremony held at the Karadiyana waste yard to mark the launching of construction work on the third phase in a series of projects to generate electricity from waste yesterday. President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest.
The project to producing 10 megawatts of electricity daily from 500 metric tons of waste, would be supervised by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
Ranawaka said he fist received complaints about the dumping of waste at the Karadiyana environment system in 2007 when he was the Environment Minister. Environmental organisations said damage was being done to the environment due to the dumping of waste. When he visited the spot on an inspection tour, he realised that this happened due to the lack of a proper site for the dumping of waste. But instead of taking legal action, they decided to formulate a systematic programme for waste management. The result was the ‘Pilisaru’ project. Sine government funds were not available for the project, he suggested that money should be found by imposing a tax on plastics.
Nearly 70 out of 338 Local Councils launched the Pilisaru project in their areas of authority within two years. About 130 Councils are implementing the project, the minister said.
The Karadiyana project was awarded to Fairway Private Ltd. after calling for tenders through competitive bidding.
Minister Ranawaka said the Meetotamulla garbage mountain would be developed as an urban park within the next three years.
He said the area covered by the Bloemendhal waste dump would be developed in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Customs Department. A waste park was being developed in Kerawalapitiya by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said he had also been empowered to build the Port City project, which is the largest private sector investment project. Although environmentalists, the fishing community and social activists had cried to halt the project, it had been undertaken as an accelerated project by incorporating their views, ideas and suggestions after discussions, he said. They will sell the Carbonic fertiliser produced from waste by the end of this month, he said.
A special App had been created by the ministry through Dialog. Anyone can take pictures of unattended garbage heaps and send them to the ministry through the App, so that they could be referred to officials for action, the minister said.
