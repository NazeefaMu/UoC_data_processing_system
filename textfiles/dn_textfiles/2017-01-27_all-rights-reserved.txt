While millions turned out for women marches worldwide in support of women’s rights, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) rights and many more, Sri Lanka was also at a crucial juncture and had to decide on whether to accept or deny the rights of LGBTIQ, but the Sri Lankan Cabinet recently chose to reject the attempts made to decriminalise homosexuality.
While some, including those who identify themselves as LGBTIQ argue that this government is seeking to perpetuate violence and discrimination against individuals, many others, ministers included pointed out that it was against Sri Lankan ‘culture’.
Human Rights Commission, Chairperson Deepika Udagama 
Recently, a petition was created by the LGBTIQ community in Sri Lanka requesting the government to repeal laws that entrench discrimination and perpetuate violence.
They highlighted that key measures to reform and remove laws impacting LGBTIQ persons, particularly Section 365 and 365A of the Penal Code which criminalises same sex activity and continues to be used to harass and persecute LBTIQ persons, were taken out of the National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP) 2017-2021.
“We the undersigned strongly condemn and wish to express our outrage and concern that this government is seeking to perpetuate violence and discrimination against individuals who identify as LGBTIQ, instead of taking legislative and policy actions to address systemic violence and discrimination dating from the colonial era,” it stated.
However, Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (HRC) was in favour of decriminalising homosexuality. HRC Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said the attempts made to decriminalise homosexuality cannot be simply blocked on the grounds that it is culturally inappropriate. He added the country’s policies should be framed not on religious beliefs, but on common grounds.
Udagama highlighted that the HRC looks at the issue of decriminalising homosexuality from a scientific and human angle.
“While Sri Lanka is proud about its history, it also has a history of obstructing progressive legislation processes pointing out cultural implications as excuses. In 2005, when the Prevention of Domestic Violence Bill was presented in Parliament, the same argument on ‘culture’ came up during its debate.
In the same way, even now some say homosexuality is against our culture. However, if all segments of society are not incorporated or allowed to have their natural behaviour, that society has a serious problem,” she said.
The laws pertaining to criminalisation of same sex activity were imposed on Sri Lanka during British rule and similar provisions in British law have since been repealed in other countries. Furthermore, there is no evidence to indicate that homosexual conduct was criminalised prior to colonial rule in Sri Lanka.
The LGBT community requested the government to meet national and international obligations towards the citizens of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka by ensuring that efforts are made to address discrimination and violence against LGBTIQ persons through the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017 – 2021, and related review processes repealing Section 365A of the Penal Code, repealing the Vagrant’s Ordinance and eliminating discrimination against people on sexual orientation and gender identities though constitutional reform.
In Sri Lanka, the rights of the LGBTIQ have turned out to be a matter of culture. When Daily News spoke to public to get their views on it, many of them refuse to speak with a view that it is something bad to talk about in public. Even though, LGBTIQ community made several attempts to decriminalise homosexuality, today they see that all such efforts have been in vain.

The Sri Lankan government and all parliamentarians have a duty to create a country and a society that is accepting and tolerant of all people of our country. LGBTIQ equality and decriminalization are not a cultural question. This is a human question and matter of human rights. Sri Lanka has an accepting, tolerant and compassionate culture. The culture of prejudice, violence and discrimination is not Sri Lankan culture, but it is the culture of the politicians who have constantly exploited and abused it against the people of our country. 30 years ago, they used it against Tamils, more recently the Muslims, and now the Gays! Tomorrow they will find someone else.
Women constantly suffer immense amount of discrimination and prejudice but the law protects them. So why should not the LGBTIQ people be protected from discrimination and violence as well? How can you make into criminals, the people who are peaceful, caring and loving individuals because of the way they were born into this world and who they love?
The National Human Rights Action Plan was first drafted by the former government. It was the Rajapaksa government that expressly included sexual orientation in their draft bill of human rights and made a public statement that discrimination against LGBTIQ people was unconstitutional.
The joint opposition never raised an issue on this; even the Defence Ministry approved the plan. If everyone else approved it, then how did a government, elected on the promise of delivering human rights and democracy for everyone, become the government to oppose it?

We in Sri Lanka are still governed by the Victorian law and in 2017, it is disappointing to see how regressive we are becoming in protecting and upholding basic human rights. In 1990, the World Health Organization declared that homosexuality was not a mental illness, and both history and science has clearly shown this to be the reality.
Having such discriminatory laws affects Sri Lanka as a whole jeopardising people's access to health, education, safety and being able to live free from violence coercion and discrimination.
Human Rights Commission, Chairperson Deepika Udagama
The HRC has been receiving many complaints lately over various threats, prejudices and attempts to arrest due to their sexual orientation. I think social dialogue and awareness on the issue are vital. The HRC has already communicated this to the Constitutional Assembly. I would suggest that the non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation should be included into the Constitution.
The draft of ‘National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021’ has not been referred to the HRC so far. Several parts of it were sent to us and we sent our observations on them. However, we are still unaware of the draft action plan presented to the Cabinet this week. It could have been better if it was referred to the Commission prior to presenting it to the Cabinet. The Commission will ask for a copy of it from the Foreign Ministry.
The Commission has a role in examining the legislation from a human rights angle and advising the government on them, but many draft policies and Bills do not reach the Commission, and we have to search out for them ourselves.

Sex is a necessity, no one can deny that. A man or a woman getting attracted to their opposite sex is common. But by birth or due to biological reasons if that changes, how can they be held responsible for it? It’s not fair. They too have rights to lead a normal life like other people. One cannot be denied of their basic rights just because he or she is attracted to the same sex.
Kasuni Tennakkoon, student
The rights of every group is being violated every day. Being a girl, I would stand for women rights and then society would brand me as a feminist. If that is the situation for us, I can imagine how these people must be treated?
N. Keerthi, private company employee
I hardly see LGBTIQ people in better positions in our country. They are often cornered to a salon or a spa. They have not been treated equally by our society, which is not right. They should also be recognised and given due respect.
Akila Weerasekara, accountant
Now we see a man and woman holding hands or under the umbrellas in the public places. Maybe in future, we will see a man and man or a woman with another woman as couples all over. I don’t say that their rights should be neglected, but it is also important for us to maintain our culture.
K. Manoharan, private company employee
I am a Hindu and I see the whole thing in a totally different manner. I agree that they are being treated differently, but I fear what will happen if the government decriminalise homosexuality. I did not even know that these kinds of people existed when I was schooling, but today, children know everything. It is also a problem between rights of LGBTIQ and culture of our country. Sri Lanka is best known for its traditions and culture; sometimes this might become the beginning of us losing our culture.
