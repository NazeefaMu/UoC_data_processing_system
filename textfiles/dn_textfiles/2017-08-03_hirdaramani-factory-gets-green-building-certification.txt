Hirdaramani factory gets green building certification

Hirdaramani Woven Puthukudiyruppu was awarded the LEED Platinum certification established by the US Green Building Council and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI).
The Hirdaramani Woven Puthukudiyruppu facility now joins Hirdaramani Woven Kahathuduwa as the highest LEED point scoring projects in Sri Lanka in the industrial manufacturing category, making Hirdaramani an industry leader.
Hirdaramani continues to lead the way in sustainable manufacturing in Sri Lanka with six LEED certified facilities across the island.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a green building certification program that recognises best-in-class building strategies and practices. To receive LEED certification, building projects have to satisfy prerequisites and earn points to achieve different levels of certification. Commenting on this significant achievement, Hirdaramani Group Director Akshay Hirdaramani said, “We are very proud of this accomplishment by the team at Woven Puthukudiyruppu and how fast this factory has progressed in a short period of time. The LEED certification was achieved with minimal incremental investment thanks to the optimized design of the factory’s ventilation and lighting system. Once again, this demonstrates that investing into a good design at the outset pays rich dividends in the end.”
The Hirdaramani Woven Puthukudiyruppu facility scores high on sustainable use of resources. It achieves a high rate for water efficiency, substantial reduction in energy use, use of recycled materials in its construction, good indoor air quality and as a result, achieved operational efficiency and reduced its carbon footprint.  Hirdaramani
