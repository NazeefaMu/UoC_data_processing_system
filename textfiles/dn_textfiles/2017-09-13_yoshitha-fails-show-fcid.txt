Yoshitha fails to show up at FCID

Yoshitha Rajapaksa who had been summoned by the FCID over an investigation into his assets failed to show up for questioning yesterday.
The case in particular looked into Rajapaksa’s purchase of a land and house located in Mihindu Mawatha in Mt Lavinia and another land in Ratmalana.
Rajapaksa’s lawyers had informed the FCID that their client was unable to appear before them due to personal reasons.
Sources reveal that the son of the former President is likely to be given a date next week to appear before Department.
