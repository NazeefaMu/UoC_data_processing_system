Investor-friendly reforms to take  centre stage in 2018 report on Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s plans to enhance its investment climate by introducing mechanisms aimed at reducing red tape and speeding up key processes will be given wide-ranging coverage in a report by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will shine a spotlight on the new single window initiative, which has a key role to play in minimising delays and reducing bottlenecks for businesses waiting for projects to be approved. There will be detailed coverage of the screening process that has been put in place to help accelerate decisions on project proposals.
OBG’s report will also chart the latest developments in plans to set up investment promotion zones throughout the country, using the public-private-partnership model in many cases.
The Board of Investment (BOI) has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the firm will once again help to produce The Report: Sri Lanka 2018. Dumindra Ratnayaka, Chairperson, BOI, said he was thrilled to be working closely with OBG’s team on its forthcoming report and documenting Sri Lanka’s efforts to boost investment levels.
“The reforms introduced to improve the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka are timely, given the wave of infrastructural projects set for implementation and the high level of competition globally for FDI,” he said. “I look forward to helping Oxford Business Group’s readers navigate their way through these new initiatives and assessing their significance for investors keen to play a part in the next stage of Sri Lanka’s development.”
Michael Todemann, editorial manager in Sri Lanka, said OBG’s partnership with the BOI over the years had undoubtedly given the Group’s coverage of Sri Lanka’s evolving investment landscape an added dimension.
“BOI is spearheading national efforts to boost foreign investment and has been instrumental in implementing the reforms required to strengthen the country’s status as a trading hub and preferred destination for FDI, while also working to diversify exports,” he said. “With these aims now gaining momentum, I’m delighted that BOI’s representatives will once again contribute to our research.”
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will mark the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group. It will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments.
