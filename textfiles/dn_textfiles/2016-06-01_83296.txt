Gee Ranga Soba to aid undergraduates with financial difficulties

The University of Kelaniya has produced a number of brilliant scholars. Yet, higher education is no comfort at all for some university students in Sri Lanka. For instance, you will find many students with financial difficulties at the University of Kelaniya too. The recently formed Alumni association of the University launched a welfare programme to sustain the current students with financial constraints.
The initial step of the programme was held at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre in August, 2014. It was a musical concert titled as ‘Vidulakara Gee Ambara’ which garnered funds to the tune of Rs 50 lakhs, which was converted into a fixed deposit in People’s Bank. Students with financial difficulties will obtain a sum of Rs 2000 a month throughout the year.
And now the funds are dwindling. But not the students with financial difficulties. They keep on growing in number. The alumni funds 100 students with financial difficulties at the moment. Another musical concert will be held to generate more funds for the benefit of the growing number of students.
The second phase of ‘Vidulakara Gee Ambara’ will be held at Sri Dharmaloka Convocation Hall, Kelaniya University, on June 3 at 6 pm with Dr Jayalath Manoratne, Nissanka Diddeniya and a host of artistes performing at the concert.
