Nawarathna worked for underprivileged to make them productive citizens: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the late Mahajana Party Leader Ranjith Nawarathna always worked for the underprivileged to make them productive citizens.
He was addressing the fourth commemoration day of the late politician held at the Kurunegala Town Hall on June 24.
The Former President said Nawarathna rendered all possible services to all communities sans party politics. “He was completely unbiased of race, ethnicity, religion, creed or cast,” he said.
Rajapaksa said Nawarathna passed away on the World’s Labour Day in 2013.
He said the path shown by Nawarathna had left many footprints to follow.
Former Co-operatives Minister Johnston Fernando said Nawarathna was born on January 7, 1948 in the Nikawewa village in the Galgamuwa area. “He was a fellow member of the alumni of the University of Colombo and taught many students English language in his carrier. Later, he joined the Wayamba Provincial Education Department and rendered his service,” he said.
Former Minister Salinda Dissanayake said Nawarathna served all sections of people in the Sathkorale and the island. “He never selected people on the ground of their politics,” he said.
Democratic Socialist Front Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara said Nawarathna managed to maintain his political integrity.
LSSP Secretary Dr. Tissa Vitharana, Attorney D. Kalansooriya, Mahajana Party Chairman G.M. Saranapala spoke.
