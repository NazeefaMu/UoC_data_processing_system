Two months sufficient to hold election – Deshapriya

Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said two-month duration is enough to hold an election. He said three elections have to be held in 2020.
He was speaking to the media after participating in a meeting at the Hambantota District Secretary office yesterday.
The meeting was held to make aware government officials and others of the forthcoming elections.
”If we are given two months, we can hold an election. It is too late to hold the provincial election since we have the presidential election before December 9, 2019.
Hambantota Assistant Election Commissioner Subash Wedage and government officers participated.
