Udukiriwila to become model pottery village

The Udukiriwila village will be developed to the status of a model pottery village under the concept of Wewak Samaga Gamak on the initiative of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Thirty two families in the village engage in the pottery industry. The minster awarded Rs. 1.6 million to enable them to set up ovens to bake pottery materials.
The minister also pledged to provide financial assistance to repair defunct machines.
He said under the concept of Wewak Samaga Gamak, every fisher family will be provided with a house to live a decent life.
