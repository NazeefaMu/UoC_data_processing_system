Five years RI for former Akurana DS

Former Akurana Divisional Secretary Mohammed Haneefa Mohammed Niyaz was yesterday sentenced to five years Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court after being found guilty of accepting a bribe of Rs.50,000 to issue a permit for explosives to a businessman who needed it for use in a rock quarry, in 2012.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga observed that the prosecution has proved the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge observed that bribery and corruption have become a menace to society and he was passing sentence with the intention of deterring such crimes.
The accused Mohammed Haneefa Mohammed Niyaz was arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption on May 16, 2012 while accepting a bribe of Rs.50,000 from a businessman. The accused was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs.10,000 on two counts.
