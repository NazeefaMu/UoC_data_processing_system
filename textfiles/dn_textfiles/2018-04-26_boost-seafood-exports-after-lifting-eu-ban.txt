Boost in seafood exports after lifting of EU ban

Fisheries exports have been increased tremendously after the ban imposed on fisheries exports from Sri Lanka by the European Union (EU) was lifted in July 2016.
According to the statistics of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry, the country has exported 58,578 metric tons of seafood during the 21 months from July 2016 to March 2018, the period after the ban was lifted, and earned Rs. 92,117 million in foreign exchange.
Sri Lanka is one of the biggest seafood exporters to the EU.
But seafood exports were severely hit by the ban imposed in October 2014, and continued to decline.
Sri Lanka’s total seafood exports in the 2014 was 26,320 MTs. After the imposition of the ban, the country was able to export only 26,129 MTs of seafood and earn only Rs, 2,103 million in foreign exchange through the seafood exports between January 2015 and June 2016.
During the first three months of 2018, Sri Lanka earned Rs 11,804 million by exporting 7174.8 MTs of seafood. After imposition of the ban, most of the fish-processing factories were closed and now the number of those factories has increased from 34 to 68.
According to Ministry sources, the demand for tuna, prawn, crab and lobster exports from Sri Lanka has increased in the international market.
These facts were revealed at a progress review meeting held recently at the ministry under the patronage of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
