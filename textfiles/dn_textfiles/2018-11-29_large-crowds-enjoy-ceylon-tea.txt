Annual tea festival in Canada:
Large crowds enjoy Ceylon tea

The third annual ‘Tea Festival’, organised by the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Toronto in collaboration with the Royal Botanical Gardens(RBG) in Burlington, Ontario was held at the RBG premises, on November 3 and 4.
Over 20 tea vendors and some private sector entities dealing with tea and other natural products took part in the tea promotional event.
Sample tea sachets and brochures provided by the Sri Lanka Tea Board were distributed at Consulate stall, while tea from Nuwara Eliya, Uda Pussellawa, Dimbula, Kandy, Uva and Ruhuna was served to over 600 visitors.
The stall promoted Ceylon tea while creating awareness among visitors on Sri Lanka’s rich tea culture, history of Ceylon tea and tea cultivation in Sri Lanka. Many visitors showed interest in the tea production in Sri Lanka and on purchasing Ceylon tea.
As the event was successful, the Consulate General expects to work with the RBG to co-organise the event next year with expanded participation.
