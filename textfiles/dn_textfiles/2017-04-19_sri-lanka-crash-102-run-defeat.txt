Sri Lanka crash to 102-run defeat

Fast bowler Ryan Hadley and leg-spinner Lloyd Pope ran through the Sri Lanka batting to give Australia a thumping 102-run win in the third Under 19 youth ODI played at Kingston Twin Ovals, Hobart yesterday.
Sri Lanka chasing 252 for victory were bundled out for a disappointing 149 with only Jehan Daniel making any worthwhile contribution with an unbeaten 55 off 84 balls (5 fours).
Sri Lanka’s top order was blown away by Hadley who finished with four wickets for 61. They were reduced to 78-7 by the 18th over and it was only Daniel’s late blitz that saw them to a total of 149.
Earlier Australia winning the toss and batting first reached 251-7 thanks to a fine knock of 95 off 115 balls from Jack Edwards and two impressive innings from Austin Waugh (40 n.o. off 54 balls), the son of former Australian captain Steve Waugh and, Will Sutherland 49 off 33 balls.
Australia leads the five-match series 2-1. The fourth ODI is scheduled for April 21.
Scores:
Australia (U19) 251-7 in 50 overs (R Hackney 39, J Edwards 95, A Waugh 40 n.o., W Sutherland 49, P Jayawickrama 2/56)
Sri Lanka (U19) 149 in 32.4 overs (J Daniel 55 n.o., R Hadley 4/61, L Pope 3/46)
