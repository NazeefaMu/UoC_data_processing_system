Nestlé’s new milk chilling centre to benefit Seeppukulama farmers

Milk farmers in the North-Central village of Seeppukulama will benefit from a milk chilling centre upgraded by Nestlé, offering them increased opportunities to sell their milk to the company. Nestlé is currently the largest private sector collector of milk in the country.
Its payment to local dairy farmers over the last three years alone amounts to over Rs.10.5 billion.
The enhanced milk chilling centre was inaugurated by Minister of Rural Economic Affairs P. Harrison in commemoration of World Milk Day.
The unit will benefit around 300 farmers in the area with increased chilling and storage facilities, enabling them to sell more milk and keep it fresh until it is taken to the Nestlé factory in Kurunegala, for manufacturing its wide portfolio of dairy-based products.
World Milk Day is a day established by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, to recognise the importance of milk as a global food.
Said Minister of Rural Economic Affairs P. Harrison, “Dairy products are widely considered to be a foundation of health but current milk supply does not meet full consumer demand. There is huge potential for growth in the dairy industry and we have been working tirelessly over the years to help Sri Lanka become self-sufficient in its local dairy needs. Nestlé has been our oldest partner from the private sector to support our efforts, investing billions of rupees every year for training and development and in payment to farmers for their milk. I have witnessed firsthand their commitment to using local milk for their products, and look forward to their continued support for the betterment of the dairy industry and local community.”
Said Shivani Hegde, Nestlé Lanka’s Managing Director, “Nutrition and wellness have always been at the core of Nestlé products, and milk has always been an important part of this endeavor. By helping our dairy farmers to increase supply, we are not only supporting rural livelihoods, but also helping our consumers to increase milk consumption through nutritionally enriched milk products and delicious dairy treats.”
