Legal action against illegal scheme house sellers

Since there is information that some of the houses coming up in the Naula Arangala Watta Housing Scheme funded by the NHDA have been sold to outside parties by the beneficiaries themselves, the CID will be called into probe the matter and bring the offenders to book, Matale District Parliamentarian Kumari Kaviratne said.
Kaviratne, who visited the housing scheme on an inspection tour on March 25 said, 62 houses are coming up in the housing scheme with the beneficiaries contributing the labour and financial assistance being extended by the NHDA.
However, there were allegations that some of the beneficiaries had sold their half completed houses to third parties and this is an irregularity which should needs to be probed.
Kaviratne, who said that beneficiaries of the housing scheme had still not been granted titles inquired from the acting District Manager of the NHDA who was present, whether beneficiaries had the possibility to sell their houses to others. Since the District Manager informed her that such a possibility was available, Kaviratne said illegal transactions could not be permitted in low income group housing schemes launched by the government and said if such transactions had occurred in the housing scheme, legal action would be taken against the perpetrators irrespective of their positions.
