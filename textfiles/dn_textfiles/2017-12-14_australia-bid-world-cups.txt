Australia to bid for World Cups

Sydney: Australia will bid to host the 2021 women’s and 2027 men’s World Cups, Rugby Australia said on Wednesday, building on government plans to construct new stadiums in Sydney.
Australia successfully co-hosted the men’s edition in 1987 with New Zealand and hosted the 2003 event alone, but has never staged a women’s World Cup.
“The World Cup is the pinnacle for our Wallabies and Wallaroos teams and we want to bring those tournaments home for any player who has ever dreamed of lifting the Cup here on our home soil,” Rugby Australia chairman Cameron Clyne said.
