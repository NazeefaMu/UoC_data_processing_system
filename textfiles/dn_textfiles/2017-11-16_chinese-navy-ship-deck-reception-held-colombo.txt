Chinese Navy ship deck reception held in Colombo

A deck reception was hosted in Colombo on the Chinese Navy Ship Qi Jiguang, on November 13. Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Chinese Task Commander Rear Admiral Yan Zhengming, Commander Lieutenant Genearal Mahesh Senanayake and high officials from the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and the government, as well as members of diplomatic corps in Colombo, attended the function.
Rear Admiral Yan welcomed distinguished representatives for attending the reception, thanked the considerate arrangement, powerful support and cordial hospitality provided by the Sri Lanka Navy, after which he expressed the best wish to enhance the friendship and cooperation between two Navies.
State minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the relationship between China and Sri Lanka spans more than 60 years—it lasts for centuries. On the historical moment of the 60th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the 65th Anniversary of the signing of the Rubber & Rice Pact.
He said he was glad to see the friendship continuing. China has always been a warm friend of Sri Lanka. China helps Sri Lanka not only economically. During the internal conflicts, China offered help to Sri Lanka. Because of China, the Sri Lankan government managed to defeat the LTTE and won peace. On behalf of the tri-forces of Sri Lanka, he welcomed the visit of the Chinese navy ship.
Ambassador Yi said that it was the fourth Chinese Navy ship visiting Sri Lanka this year. The exchange between China and Sri Lanka, especially the two navies, becomes more and more frequent.
They come here for peace, cooperation and friendship. Six hundred years ago, Zheng He, Admiral of the Ming Dynasty, called on the ports of Sri Lanka five times. This year, many naval ships visited Sri Lanka, including those from USA, Indian, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan etc.
Yi strongly appreciated the balance policy of the Sri Lankan government that opened its port to everyone. As ambassador of China to Sri Lanka, he said he fully supports such a balanced policy of foreign affairs.
Sri Lanka’s good relations with everyone is not only important for Sri Lanka, but also for China and other countries. He cited the motto of Alfred Thayer Mahan, one of the most important American strategists of the nineteenth century, “Whoever dominates the Indian Ocean, controls Asia.”
Fortunately, this anticipation didn’t come true. If some country dominates Indian Ocean, it might be a disaster for the whole region.
Yi further said there were more than 500 crew members on board of the Qi Jiguang. Most of them are students from Chinese Navy academies. They came here to exchange with the Sri Lankan Navy.
All of them went out shopping and interacted with local people, which further improved the understanding between each other and enhanced the friendship between them and the Sri Lankan people.
The Chinese Navy ship crew and Sri Lankan Navy officers who have been trained in China, brought performances for the guests during the reception.
