Sri Lanka Medical Council President Prof.Colvin Goonaratne said the finalised criteria of minimum standards for medical education do not require any amendments.
Speaking to the media following a special meeting with the Sri Lanka Medical Council members yesterday, Prof. Goonaratne said that the draft minimum requirements will remain the same and that they are not to be amended again. “We will not change the decision that all of us have agreed upon.”
Prof. Goonaratne while assuring that the SLMC is not working against the government, explained that they make submissions to the government with regards to certain shortcomings with regard to matters involving minimum standards for medical education.
He also pointed out that the emergency SLMC meeting which was called upon yesterday was not with regards to the SAITM but regards to drafting of minimum standards in medical education.
Prof. Gunaratne pointed out that the authority to take the final decision on SAITM lies solely with the government.
He also said that he consider the finalised minimum standards to be just and fair while adding that they do not know how the students will receive this final decision. However, Professor Gunaratne observed that the decision will be for the betterment of the students.
SLMC Registrar, Dr. Terrence de Silva also said the SLMC unanimously decided that no changes are necessary for the finalised minimum standards for medical education.
SLMC member Dr. Upul Gunasekara told Daily News, that the SLMC is now seeking an opportunity through the Health Ministry Secretary to meet the Attorney General to discuss these finalised standards.
He pointed out that the minimum standards the SLMC has finalized after getting receiving observations and recommendations from eight medical faculties and the Kotelawala Defence University’s medical faculty. Dr. Gunasekara pointed out that they have also discussed with the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena and the Secretary to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. “We have discussed, compromised and have finally decided to go with the finalised standards unanimously,” he said.
The SLMC finalised the minimum standards for medical education in earlier this year.
