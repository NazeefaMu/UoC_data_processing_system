Chris Gayle to become a father

 
Chris Gayle, Royal Challenger Bangalore’s (RCB) dashing opening batsman, will miss the next two Indian Premier League (IPL) games of the franchise - against Mumbai Indians, on April 20 and Rising Pune Supergiants (RPSG), on April 22 as he has flown back to Jamaica to be with his partner, Natasha Berridge, who is expecting the couple’s first child.
RCB’s middle order batsman, Sarfaraz Khan confirmed his departure while the West Indian batsman has also written about his impending fatherhood on Instagram. “Chris flew back immediately after RCB’s last match (against Delhi Daredevils on April 17). We did not expect this.
He got a call and flew back home,” a source close to the Bangalore based franchise said.
