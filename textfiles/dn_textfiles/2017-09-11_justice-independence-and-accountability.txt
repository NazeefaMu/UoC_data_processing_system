JUSTICE, INDEPENDENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

We are regaled ad nauseum now with reports and updates on all manner of legal processes in the country. Is it working? A statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) refers to an important debate taking place now on the need for judicial reforms. A debate the result of a statement made by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka with regard to a public statement made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake MP. A debate must ensue and we must adopt what works best for us.
A Rapid Assessment of the Justice Sector in Sri Lanka
Objective - To understand what justice means in Sri Lanka and the current standards and systems in different sectors of the justice system
Specifically: Arrive at a situation analysis of the justice sector, identify gaps and challenges in the justice sector design a blueprint for reform with sectoral work plans set up a Committee to guide and monitor the implementation of the work plan.
Sectors for assessment - Administration of Justice - Judiciary and judicial process, court processes;
Law enforcement – Police; Access to justice- Prosecutions Attorney General’s Department, Private Bar, Legal aid, Mediation, Probation and Childcare, Administrative process – Ministry of Justice
AHRC on problems
The system of policing - which is the premier crime investigation institution in the country - is clearly unable to cope up with its primary obligations and public complaints about this institution have been seriously on the rise.
The criminal investigation process which is envisaged in the Criminal Procedure Code is being often neglected to an extent that a tendency has developed among the public to distrust the possibility of the pursuit of justice even for very serious crimes.
People look for alternative methods for solving disputes rather than relying on the legal process.
It is therefore, essential to improve the supervisory role over criminal investigations both by the prosecutors (Attorney General’s Department) and the judiciary itself.
Improvement of accountability for investigation into crimes, by the higher authorities of the police and proper exercise of their command responsibility are some of the essential requirements of such improvements.
Absence of a regulatory process where public complaints against the failures of the system is authentically, competently and speedily investigated is one of the major causes of the failures in the justice system.
The speedy introduction of a regulatory framework over the legal profession as a whole, must be urgently attended to, if any credible change is to take place.
Some months back the Minister in charge of Prisons has said his Ministry is currently working with the Justice Ministry to address issues such as ‘no date cases’ and overcrowding.
How does one have a case with No date? Though practically there is such a category of persons facing indefinite incarceration without a sentence pronounced on them.
These factors scream at the face of any decent citizen and public at large. The report of two UN Rapporteurs was damning on our systems of Justice. In age in which Cabinet papers can be accessed under the Right to Information Act this writer espouses a Justice audit. The salient features are spelled out.
Process
Literature review: provide an overview of the justice sector, summarize the lessons learned from earlier reform initiatives, capture good practices that have been developed
Data gathering
1. A profile of each institution in terms of: Its statutory framework, hierarchy/organisational set up, powers, staffing, Levels (established and filled), terms and conditions of service, training, Promotion, budget, oversight and complaints mechanisms, ‘Mapping’ the physical location of institutions around the country, Mapping of how institutional linkages that exist which join up the system as a whole, public and professional surveys
2. Sectoral data
Police- Crime figures (complaints, prosecutions, convictions; typology of offences; rates and trends), Case management (procedure on arrest and detention, discretionary powers of police – caution, bail, diversion, referral – measures for dealing with victims of crime, young offenders and other vulnerable groups, time management (average times: from arrest to court (law and practice), from arrest to charge, from arrest to trial, from arrest to disposal)
3. Legal service providers- Map the provision of legal services – delivery mechanisms, actors and budget(s),Profile access to legal advice and assistance (in law/practice, at all stages of the criminal justice system) and identify unmet needs, Profile the application of ADR in the community, by way of diversion from the justice system, at court
4. Case management (procedures; ratio of cases to legal service providers: at police, court, prisons and community; co-ordination mechanisms between the justice actors).
5. Prosecutions (AG’s Department) - Case load (by court type, typology of offences, trends; ratio of prosecutors to caseload), Case management (procedures and discretionary powers, police/prosecution co-ordination; possibilities of referral to ADR; time management (average times: from charge to start of trial, from start of trial to end of trial, from end of trial to appeal hearing); conviction rate.
6. Courts at all levels (with JSC)-Case load (current/pending, trends - last ten years - by court type, rural/urban, typology of offences, ratio of judges to caseload, adequacy of court space/time);Case management (procedures – esp. pre-trial - discretionary powers and co-ordination mechanisms with other justice actors; time management (average times: from first appearance to disposal, from arraignment to trial, of trial, from trial to appeal); conviction rate; appeals (conviction/sentence).
7. Corrections - Prison numbers (established capacity/total population at national level and individual facilities; trends in growth of prison population), prison numbers disaggregated, process issues: prisoners’ access to legal advice/representation (and other rights issues such as health care); average times: spent on remand (awaiting trial), under trial, between conviction and appeal; access to bail; consistency in sentencing.
8. Probation - Case load (order made by court, ratio of probation officers to probationers; typology of offences/offender), Case management (procedures; average length of an order; completion rates, reoffending rates)
