President provides sustainable solutions to Wayamba water issue

A mega development project is being implemented at present to fulfill the water needs of the people in the Wayamba Province, ending a long-term water shortage, under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Even though various irrigation projects were implemented in the country, the people in the Wayamba Province had faced difficulties as the past governments failed to provide a solution to their water issue, the President’s Media Division stated in a release.
The living standard of the people in the region decreased as farmers suffered from the lack of water for their cultivations and the drinking water shortage led to the proliferation of kidney diseases.
President Sirisena, as a leader who understood the pulse of the people, took steps to re-implement the abandoned projects, the release said.
In 2016, the Wayamba Ela project was launched under the guidance of the President to provide a solution for the water shortage for irrigation lands during both seasons.
Eight large-scale tanks and 353 small tanks would be developed under this project to facilitate irrigation for 12,500 farm lands in both seasons. The project will provide direct dividends to 13,500 farmer families and indirect benefits to another 80,000 farmer families.
Fifty percent of the first stage of the project, costing Rs. 16,000 million, implemented under the Mahaweli Water Security and Investment Project, was successfully completed. The second stage of diverting Mahaweli river water of the Eastern province to the northern region will commence under the President’s patronage on August 24.
The surplus water of the Nalanda reservoir is being diverted towards the Wamadilla reservoir. Under the first stage, infrastructure will be provided to carry water towards the Wamadilla project and Devahuwa reservoir, and to carry Mahaweli water and the Nalanda reservoir water to the Kurunegala district.
Under the second stage, it is expected to build facilities and infrastructure to construct canals to channel water of the Kurunegala district towards the small river systems of Polpitigama, Ahatuwewa, Galgamuwa and Mahawa, and to send the water of the Mahaweli River towards the Bowattenna reservoir towards Dambulu Oya and to channel this water towards the canal systems built at the first stage.
Meanwhile, under the mega plan to renovate 2,400 tanks in the rural areas under the Ellanga system, the reconstruction of 353 tanks in the North Western province will also commence under the patronage of the President.
Thus, 91 tanks in the Ahatuwewa Divisional Secretariat division, 119 tanks in the Polpitihgama Divisional Secretariat division, 107 tanks in the Mahawa Divisional Secretariat division, 30 tanks in the Galewela Divisional Secretariat division, one tank at the Palagala Divisional Secretariat division and five tanks in the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat division will be developed.
The people appreciated the programme initiated by President Sirisena to provide a permanent solution to a bitter experience they faced for a long time regarding the water shortage, the President’s Media Division stated in the release.
