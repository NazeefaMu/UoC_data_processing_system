Ministry forestalls health issues in flood hit areas

The Health Ministry tried its best to prevent communicable diseases in flood affected areas. No health issue has been reported from flood affected areas, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said treatment was available to needy persons. Medicines were provided to those who were on regular medications for diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Drugs were issued to required persons to prevent rat fever.
According to Dr. Bandara, allergic conditions were reported from some dengue patients who had been given Dextran 40 imported from India. The use of the drug was stopped after a few incidents. Dextran 40 imported from Thailand is being used for dengue patients. An order has been placed for Dextran 40 requirement for the next year.
Measures will be taken to prevent breeding of dengue mosquitoes in flood affected areas under the three month dengue control programme launched on June 1 under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena, Bandara said.
