Hambantota lawyers demand General Election

The Laywers’ Association of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in Hambantota held a protest yesterday at the Gabada Junction, Hambantota demanding a general election.
They also requested the Supreme Court to declare the judgment soon.
Hambantota MC Members and the public took part in the protest. Lawyer M.R. M. Samsudeen told the media that the Supreme Court in India gave its judgment fast when the Jummu Kashmir Governor went to court seeking a ruling over a similar issue.
Counsel Leslie Weeramanthri said a quick Supreme Court judgment is a must to resolve the crisis. He said the general election must be held to get the people’s verdict on the issue.
