SLFP won’t support Constitutional amendments which require referendum: SB

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) decided not to support any amendments to the Constitution which could harm the country’s unitary character, territorial integrity and sovereignty, Social Empowerment & Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said yesterday. He also noted that the President and the SLFP has decided not to support any amendments which require a referendum.
Speaking to the media in Colombo Dissanayake further noted that the SLFP also has decided not to fully abolish the Executive Presidency. Dissanayake also re-confirmed the SLFP stance that there will be no foreign judges in the domestic mechanism which is to be established to probe the alleged war crimes and human rights violations during the three-decade long conflict.
On Constitutional amendments, Dissanayake said that the SLFP will only support changes which will help further strengthen democracy and the country’s sovereignty.
