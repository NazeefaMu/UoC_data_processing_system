British era’s recorded traitors to be named Sri Lankan patriots

A letter requesting to name 190 Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim community leaders, who were recorded as traitors for working against the British Empire, as patriots was forwarded to Minister Thalatha Athukorale by State Minister M. H. M. Hisbullah.
The 190 community leaders were named as traitors in a gazette notification issued on June 4, 1804.
The request has been forwarded to President Maithripala Sirisena as well. Hisbulla said the same request was made from former Minister of Justice as well. He further said that President Sirisena has given a positive response in this regard.
Accordingly, Hisbullah requests the Minister of Justice Thalatha Athukorale to take necessary steps to issue a new gazette, naming these community leaders as patriots.
