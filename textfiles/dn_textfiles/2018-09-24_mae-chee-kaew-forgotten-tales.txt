From Mae Chee Kaew to forgotten tales

In the Pali suttas, whenever the Buddha relays a teaching or discusses a subject with Venerable Ananda, Venerable Ananda often replies with the inspired utterance, "It is wonderful, it is marvellous Lord", in praise of the Buddhas great wisdom. Now with regards to the biography that details the life and practice of Mae Chee Kaew, I am sure that all sincere Buddhist practitioners will respond in such a way, because the life and practice of Mae Chee Kaew truly was wonderful and marvellous.
Many contemporary Buddhist practitioners have come to feel grateful that Bhikkhu Silaratano made the considerable effort to collate and translate this work, as it gives a rare glimpse into the life of a truly gifted female practitioner from more recent history, a life that is truly inspiring to both men and women alike.
The Sinhala readership should feel blessed as the biography of this great saint is now available in Sinhala as translated by Tilaka Kudahetti, published by Sahitha Poth Piyasa.
Buddha is purported to have been born in 563 BCE in the area of India now known as Nepal. Buddha is a title which means “The Awakened One” or the “Enlightened One.”
The actual name of Buddha is Siddhartha Shakya, but he came to be known as Gautama Buddha (the Sanskrit form of his family name), Mahatma Buddha (Mahatma is a title for a good and wise person) or sometimes, Shakyamuni (an honorific meaning Sage of the Shakyans). He was born into a prominent family. His father was Suddhodana, an elected chief of the Shakya clan. His mother’s name was Maya. From the time of his birth, Siddhartha was seen as being destined to be a great king.
Buddha’s mother died within a few days of his birth, and he was raised by his mother’s younger sister. At the age of 16, his father arranged his marriage to a cousin who was his same age, Yasodhara. They had a son named Rahula.
The family was wealthy enough so that Siddhartha’s father could provide for his son’s every need and want. Siddhartha led a sheltered life never being allowed to leave the palace walls so that his father could shield him from knowledge of human suffering.
These tales almost forgotten in the contemporary setting are now available as a collection compiled by Halaliye Karunathilaka. The collection is published by Sahitha Poth Piyasa.
