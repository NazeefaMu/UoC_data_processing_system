Fitch maintains Rating Watch Negative on Distilleries Company

Fitch Ratings has maintained the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on Sri Lanka-based alcoholic beverage manufacturer Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC’s (DIST) National Long-Term Rating of ‘AAA(lka)’, as the company takes steps to complete its restructuring exercise and resolve its capital structure, which will require regulatory approval.
Fitch placed DIST on RWN in September 2016 to reflect potentially higher financial risks following a group restructuring exercise.
