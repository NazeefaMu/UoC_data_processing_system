Uswatte opens modern biscuit factory in Millaniya

Uswatte Confectionery Works, Sri Lanka’s oldest confectionery manufacturer with a history of 63 years, opened their latest factory in their premises at Millaniya by Honourable Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe including other distinguished Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
The state-of-the-art factory will focus exclusively on the manufacturing of biscuits and signifies the entry of Uswatte into Sri Lanka’s biscuit market.
The opening of a factory to manufacture Uswatte biscuits brings to life a longstanding dream of the company’s Founder Chairman - the late P.J.C Perera (Christy) - to manufacture and supply premium quality biscuits to the Sri Lankan consumer. Years of meticulous planning and preparation under the dynamic leadership of present Chairman/Managing Director S. Quintus Perera has enabled the company to venture into the highly-competitive biscuit market today.
Chairman, S. Quintus Perera - Chairman/Managing Director of Uswatte Confectionery Works stated, “From the very beginning, our priority was to give high-quality and hygienic products at a reasonable price to the consumer. Our innovative products have become iconic family treats loved by all age groups for generations. This new factory will help us to enter the biscuit market and we are confident our premium quality biscuits will soon become a hit with our consumers. We will continue to innovate and will introduce novel, exciting products for our trusted consumers to enjoy.”
Commenting further, he added that ever since the company moved their Corporate Office complex and factory to Millaniya back in 2015, the company has helped improve the lives of the people in the area. “We have provided employment to hundreds of individuals from the surrounding neighbourhoods.”
Uswatte Confectionery Works (Pvt) Ltd is the pioneer in Sri Lanka for the production of high quality, hygienic confectionery delicacies and snacks. With a history spanning over 63 years, Uswatte Confectionery Works is the oldest confectionery manufacturer in Sri Lanka.
