Norwegian State Foreign Affairs Minister Jens Holte here

The State Minister of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jens Frølich Holte is visiting Sri Lanka in connection with the arrival of the Norwegian research vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen to Sri Lanka. The research vessel arrived in Colombo yesterday followed by a 26 day research journey around the island. The research vessel will assist Sri Lanka in mapping her marine resources.
This visit will provide an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual benefit and interest, including bilateral cooperation, environmental challenges and promotion of ocean-based industries, says the Norwegian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther.
The State Minister will also pay a short visit to Jaffna, where he will learn more about the outcomes of the long-term Norwegian support to sustainable livelihood activities in the resettled areas.
While in Jaffna, the State Minister will open a fruit and vegetable packing center to the Palali East Cooperative and join beach cleaning in Gurunagar with local fishermen and their families. Before ending his visit, the State Minister will open a Business Conference on Blue Economy organised by the Norwegian Embassy, with participants from the maritime, marine and aquaculture sectors in both Norway and Sri Lanka. This conference will help to build new partnerships within the blue economy sectors.
