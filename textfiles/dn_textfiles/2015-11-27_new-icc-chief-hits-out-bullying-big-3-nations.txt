New ICC chief hits out at 'bullying' big 3 nations

New Delhi, Thursday: New International Cricket Council chairman Shashank Manohar has hit out at the imbalance of the sport's governing body which he said allowed Australia, England and India to bully the organisation.
Manohar, who replaced India's scandal-tainted former supremo Narayanaswami Srinivasan earlier this month, said he disagreed with changes to the ICC which handed more power to the big three nations of the game.
"I don't agree with the three major countries bullying the ICC," Manohar told the Hindu newspaper in an interview published on Thursday.
"That's my personal view, because as I have always said, an institution is bigger than individuals."
A controversial and wide-ranging shake up of the ICC last year gave India -- which contributes 80 percent of global revenues -- and fellow powerhouses England and Australia permanent seats on a new five-member executive committee. AFP
