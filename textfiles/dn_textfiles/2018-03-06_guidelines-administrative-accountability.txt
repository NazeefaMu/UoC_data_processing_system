Rule of law, key to Democratic Governance
Guidelines for administrative accountability

The applicability of the Rule of Law in Fundamental Rights jurisdiction through equality was further expanded and articulated by Fernando J in the case of Jayawardena v Dharani Wijeyatilake, Secretary Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Others [2001], in respect of the termination of the holder of the office of Inquirer into Sudden Deaths, where it was held that: respect for the rule of law requires the observance of minimum standards of openness, fairness and accountability in administration and this means- in relation to appointments and removal from offices involving powers, functions and duties which are public in nature- that the process of making a decision should not be shrouded in secrecy.
Rule of law and the pleasure principle: Application to Cabinet of Ministers
In 1994 Fernando J in Bandara and Another v Premachandra [1994] held in relation to the pleasure principle contained in Article 55 of the Constitution:
“It may well be that in the United Kingdom the prerogative in regard to office held at pleasure was very wide. However, any such prerogative recognizes or conferred under a written Constitution, such as ours, with separation of functions, must necessarily be subject to limitations. Article 55(5) makes the ‘pleasure principle’ subject to the fundamental rights and language rights. Article 55(1) makes it ‘subject to the provisions of the Constitution’, so that other limitations may be found elsewhere in the Constitution. The concept of holding office at pleasure suggests prima facie, that dismissal may be for a reason- good, bad, or indifferent – or without any reason. However, since Article 55(1) is subject inter alia, to Article 12, dismissal, even by the Cabinet of Ministers, cannot be for a reason which involves the denial of equal protection violative of Article 12(1) or an infringement of Article 12 (2). The subjection of Article 55(1) to the equality provisions of Article 12 mandates fairness and excludes arbitrariness. Powers of appointment and dismissal are conferred by the Constitution or various authorities in the public interest, and not for private benefit, and their exercise must be governed by reason and not caprice.”
Rule of law and the public trust
The concept of public trust and the abiding principle that the powers of the state and that of its officials, agents and instrumentalities are held in trust for the public is a necessary corollary of the more generic concept of the rule of law and operates, complements and renders efficacious, ‘the judicial application of the rule of law as a vital check on State and administrative excess.'
In the cases of Bennet Ratnayake v The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and others [1999] and the Widesheeya Chitrapata Anayanaya Karannange Sangamaya v National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka (1999). It was held by the Supreme Court that:the statutory powers which the respondents have are, like most statutory powers, not absolute, unfettered, or unreviewable; they are held in trust for the benefit of the public; and they cannot be exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously, or unreasonably. Now the concept of the Rule of Law entrenched within the matrix of Article 12 demands that the State must act reasonably and fairly at all times in the contractual sphere as well, irrespective of whether it is at the threshold stage of entering into a contract or after it has been executed.
A democratic form of constitution demands that it should be built on theoretical formulations which considered essentials for ensuring achievements of democratic goals and fulfilling aspirations of the people. However, due to vast powers concentrated in the Executive Presidency encroaching on and suppressing all three branches of the State, there has been a severe debilitation in the area of the rule of law affecting good governance liberties of individuals.
The fact that out of 40 years of the operation of our second Republican Constitution of 1978 the country had been ruled under emergency regulations proclaimed by the Executive President for a period of 25 years, thereby naturally poses the question whether this Constitution is the supreme law of the country which guarantees the rule of law. With the virtual abolition of the 17th Amendment by the 18th Amendment the powers of the Executive President had been virtually unchecked. Today the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which abolished the 18th Amendment restoring the rule of law to some extent is a landmark in Sri Lankan democratic governance.
