Vocational Training Authority embarks on Microsoft Imagine Academy agreement

In partnership with Vocational Training Authority (VTA) and Microsoft’s Imagine Academy, Tech One Sanje established another solid ground for digital transformation in the educational sector.
This time, by delivering an enhanced digital learning environment to VTA and its students. The VTA has already implemented the Imagine Academy in three of its centres nationwide in Colombo, Galle and Kandy.
The next step will be to extend the Imagine Academy to centres in Ampara and Jaffna toward the end of this year.
Sanje has been an active partner in the initiative, providing a modernized learning experience for the students and staff from VTA, while simultaneously setting an example for others hoping to improve the educational climate for local students. The Imagine Academy Programme offers quality education training resources on Microsoft technologies to help the institutions’ educators, faculty and staff empower students by helping them obtain the skills needed to reach full academic and career potential.
The programme provides rich online learning resources to VTA educators and ensures that their students graduate with the Microsoft technology expertise required to be successful in today’s job market. Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
