Luxury Ballroom to debut at Anantara Kalutara Resort

Anantara Kalutara Resort is set to open its luxurious 630 square metre ballroom later this month.
 
Influenced by Sri Lanka’s rich culture and heritage, the ballroom complex offers a unique setting for weddings, meetings, events and corporate retreats, combined with authentic luxury matched by world class leisure and dining facilities.
Designed for maximum flexibility, the pillar-free ballroom can be divided into two equal sound proof spaces, making it ideal for meetings and smaller gatherings. Designed by renowned architects MICD, the décor and furnishings use traditional Sri Lankan design blended with hints of vibrant colour, hand painted batiks and contemporary fittings.
An experienced dedicated meeting and events team is on hand to provide personalised planning and delivery of each event.
Opened late in 2016, Anantara Kalutara Resort is the brand’s second property in Sri Lanka. Located in a secluded ocean, river and lagoon setting along the southwest coast, only an hour’s drive from the capital, the resort is a heavenly getaway for visitors to the island, offering luxurious accommodation combined with finer touchpoints of an Anantara Spa and outstanding international cuisine, including Indian, Thai, Chinese, and Mediterranean besides the traditional local Sri Lankan fare. Sri Lanka as a destination itself is unique and interesting, offering diverse experiences and attractions, from beaches, mountains and wildlife to ancient cities.
