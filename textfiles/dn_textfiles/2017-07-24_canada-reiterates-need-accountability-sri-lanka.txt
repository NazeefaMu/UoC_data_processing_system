Canada reiterates the need for accountability in Sri Lanka

 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a message released on the anniversary of ‘Black July,’ reiterated the need to establish accountability in Sri Lanka ‘to have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war’.
“Today, we join Canadians of Tamil descent and members of the Tamil community to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the events of Black July,” the Canadian Prime Minister said in a statement.
“As we pause to reflect on the dark days of the Sri Lankan Civil War, we must continue to work to heal the wounds of all those who suffered.”
“Canada welcomes international efforts underway to achieve long-term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans, but we reiterate the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war.”
The Prime Minister said Canada’s cultural diversity is one of our greatest strengths and sources of pride.
“On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my deepest sympathy and support to all those who have suffered immeasurable loss during the Sri Lankan Civil War,” he said.
