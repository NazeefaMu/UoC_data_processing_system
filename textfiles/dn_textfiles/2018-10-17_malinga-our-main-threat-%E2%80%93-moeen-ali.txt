Sri Lanka is an amazing country to tour
Malinga is our main threat – Moeen Ali

PALLEKELE, Tuesday - All-rounder Moeen Ali has identified fast bowler Lasith Malinga as the major threat to his team in the ongoing five-match one-day series where England lead 1-0 with the third ODI scheduled to take place under lights at the Pallekele International Stadium here on Wednesday.
Malinga rattled the England batting line up in the second ODI at Dambulla with a five-wicket haul that included Moeen who became the bowler’s 500th victim in international cricket.
“He’s a brilliant bowler. He’s got 500 international wickets. He’s been around for years, and been at all the big tournaments. He knows what he’s doing and is going to be a major threat for us going forward in this series,” said Moeen at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
“As a team and as individuals we’ve spoken about how we’re going to play him. We’ve got plans in place. Nothing out of the box - it’s pretty simple. He’s the main threat for us and we’ve got to be really cautious against him,” he said.
England who scored 278-9 in 50 overs won the match by 31 runs under the D/L rain rule rushing through their overs to beat the rain through spinners Moeen and Liam Dawson.
“That was probably the first time it happened to us as a team for a while. You’ve got to rush through the overs but not rush through your bowling. You’re rushing through field placings and your thinking’s not as clear,” said Moeen.
“I think once we got the 20 overs out of the way we took our time a little bit as usual.
We’ve spoken about that and we’ve got to counter that and take that into the equation.
There may be a time when the situation gets like that again, and we’ve got to be a bit smarter.”
Moeen won’t have Dawson as his spin partner on the tour after the left-arm spinner was ruled out with a side strain.
“We’ll just probably go back to the balance of the team we’ve had over the last few years. It’s a shame for Daws. It would have been a great opportunity to play regularly. I think that’s something he’s been wanting for a while. Unfortunately it hasn’t happened for him. I think he’ll come back strongly into the side when he’s ready,” said Moeen.
In Dawson’s absence England’s third spinner in the squad Adil Rashid will come into the equation.
“It’s not been as easy because of the rain. The pitches are a little bit tacky, but it’s not spinning massively at the moment. I’m sure going forward it probably will spin quite a bit,” said Moeen.
“I really enjoy bowling with Rash as everyone knows. I think Dawson bowled really well as well during the match. Adil didn’t bowl as well because of the weather. We were just trying to get the overs in, which we were rushing to do. But I think going forward we’re going to have to keep it simple and use the pitches.”
Moeen described Sri Lanka as an “amazing country” and said that they were fortunate to be here on a few occasions.
“There’s so much to do in Sri Lanka. We know it’s one of the best places to come and tour. We do try to see wherever we go what the options are to go and see. I know yesterday (Monday) the guys wanted to play golf, but because of the rain they couldn’t play much. It’s an amazing country to come and visit. A few of us have been fortunate enough to be here a few times before, so we’ve seen some of the places,” Moeen said.
