‘Kala Pola’ on Jan 22

The 24th edition of Sri Lanka’s world renowned open-air art fair, Kala Pola will take place on January 22 from 8 am to 9 am along Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, Colombo 7. It will be held in a fun-filled ambiance of music and entertainment.
A fascinating display of cultural entertainment takes centre stage from the time of the official ceremony at 5 pm on the same day at which Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson will be the chief guest.
Presented by The George Keyt Foundation in association with the John Keells Group, Kala Pola has over the past 24 years been a major cultural and tourist attraction. It is today a not-to-be-missed event in Colombo’s annual cultural calendar.
