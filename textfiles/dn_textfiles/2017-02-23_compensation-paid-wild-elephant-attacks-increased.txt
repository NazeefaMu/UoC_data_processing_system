Compensation paid for wild elephant attacks increased

Compensation paid for damages caused by wild elephant attacks on individuals and properties have been increased by the Cabinet this week.
Human deaths and permanent disabilities will now be paid a compensation of Rs.500,000 instead of Rs 200,000.
The above proposal was put forward by Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera.
