Ensure quality uniforms for police - Sagala

Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka has directed his Ministry Secretary and other officials to submit a report to him within a month to ensure that high quality uniforms including helmets and shoes are provided to all officers and men in the Police Force.
He issued this directive after examining several samples of Police uniforms, hats, helmets and shoes used by Police officers on September 25.
A Ministry release said the Minister had also directed that a single type of quality cloth is used for all police uniforms relating to all ranks from the IGP down to the Constable.
He has said that the present procedure of tailoring Police uniforms at Police Divisions level was an obstructions to normal Police duties and tailoring should be done in future under the supervision f officers in charge of Police stations.
He had also ordered an increase in the tailoring allowance issued to Policemen saying the present allowance was woefully inadequate.
The Minister had observed that the helmets and shoes worn by Police Constables and Sergenats were too heavy and cumbersome and as such light weight helmets and shoes should be provided to them according to international standards.
Ministry Secretary Jagath P.Wijeweera and Acting IGP Chandana Wickremaratne accompanied the Minister during the inspection tour.
