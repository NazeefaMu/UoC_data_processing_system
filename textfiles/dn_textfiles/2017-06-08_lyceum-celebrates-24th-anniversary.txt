Lyceum celebrates 24th anniversary

Lyceum International School, the brainchild of prominent educationalist Mohan Lal Grero, will celebrate its 24th birthday in June. With eight branches in major cities, Lyceum is now considered to be the only school with the largest network of schools in the country, a press release by the school stated.
One of Grero’s prime objectives of setting up Lyceum, was to deliver affordable English medium education to the masses across the country, while developing the child through various extra-curricular activities as well as instilling children with a love for traditional cultures and value for all religions, races and societies.
This is the concept incorporated into every Lyceum branch across the island over the past two decades of its existence and is one of the reasons for its successful evolution through the years, the release added.
With the newest branch being established in Kurunegala less than a year ago, the school has seen a tremendous growth over this short period, which is no doubt due to the unconditional support received from our growing community of teachers, parents and students, the release stated.
In order to strengthen ties with the community and make awareness of Lyceum Kurunegala, the management of Lyceum Kurunegala will hold an ‘Open Day’, on June 15 at 4.30 pm at Lyceum International School, No. 71, Uduwalpola Rd, Kurunegala.
