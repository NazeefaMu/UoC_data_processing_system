Mastering a Fashionable  career

Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), has launched Sri Lanka’s first-ever fashion industry-oriented Masters programme with the introduction of the MA Fashion Business Management from the University of Westminster, UK.
The Masters in Fashion Business Management programme was launched in Sri Lanka by the University of Westminster in its commitment to developing innovative programmes for individuals pursuing careers in the fashion industry locally and internationally. It will provide students with the strategic decision-making, leadership and problem-solving skills required to become an entrepreneurial and visionary fashion business leader in today’s fast-evolving fashion industry.
All lecturers are academically qualified and possess industry experience at the highest levels. Students will also be able to work closely with fashion industry professionals, role models and mentors. They will receive a relevant, well-grounded, high-quality education and a skill base that will enable them to have a broad understanding of the business.
The course offers an innovative and state-of-the-art fashion business course that focuses on preparing students’ entry into senior roles in business and management within the fashion industry. The syllabus has been specifically designed to train individuals to polish their skills and become visionaries in their respective industries.
They will also be able to understand the process of making sound management decisions by utilising the knowledge and skills that they have acquired. The course provides an in-depth knowledge in areas of Supply Chain Management, Strategic Fashion Business Management, Fashion Marketing and Entrepreneurship followed by a Fashion Business Project. The intake commences in September 2018.
Dean of IIT Naomi Krishnarajah said, “Sri Lanka has a number of undergraduate programmes in fashion design but there aren’t any Masters programmes. Therefore, we decided to introduce the MA in Fashion Business Management from University of Westminster to help those in the industry to enhance their knowledge and advance their careers by moving into management positions. This programme will also help those with the entrepreneurial spirit to start their own fashion business and take Sri Lankan fashion brands to beyond national boundaries. It is a well-known fact that fashion is a fast-changing, highly-competitive industry and this programme will definitely help students to face the future with confidence.”
University of Westminster Alumni can be found working in senior positions all over the world, including world-famous brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Marks & Spencer, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Neiman Marcus, Net a Porter, Aldo, Loro Piana, Li & Fung, Selfridges, Harrods, Arcadia Group, Dunhill, Aurora Fashions, Mothercare UK, Prada Hong Kong, Saatchi & Saatchi, Omega, Purple Tree, Hermes and Anthropologie.
