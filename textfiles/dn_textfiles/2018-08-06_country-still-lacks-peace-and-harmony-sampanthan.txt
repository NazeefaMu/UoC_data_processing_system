Country still lacks peace and harmony - Sampanthan

Visiting Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland met Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) chief R. Sampanthan at the office of the Opposition Leader in Parliament on Friday.
Briefing the Secretary-General, Sampanthan said that even though the war has come to an end, the country still lacks full peace and harmony.
“People, particularly the minorities, had a great deal of hope with the change of government. They expected the government to deliver on the promises it made both locally and internationally.
A new Constitution which will alter the structure of governance and give more powers to the regions, ascertainment of truth and justice, reparation, dealing with the issue of missing persons, return of civilians lands occupied by the Armed Forces, and release of people held in custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are some of those promises, but the delivery on these matters has been slow and inadequate,” he said.
He said there is a commitment to draft a new Constitution.
“A unanimous resolution was adopted in Parliament in this regard. On account of political factors, there is a delay on the part of the government in pursuing this matter.”
“There were reasons why this country faced a war. One cannot address these reasons by not being firm, one cannot abandon these issues because of extremist elements. The government must take a firm stand and lead the country in the right direction. Adopting a new Constitution will be a big step in taking the country forward,” Sampanthan said.
The Secretary-General assured the Opposition Leader on the continuous support provided by the Commonwealth to Sri Lanka to promote democracy, rule of law, good governance and environment issues and said that the Commonwealth will continue to support the new constitution-making process.
Further, the Secretary-General appreciated Sampanthan for his moderation and for being an ambassador for peace.
