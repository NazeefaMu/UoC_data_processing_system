‘Sanctions relief on Iran will open trade opportunities’

Increased sanctions relief could open new opportunities for trade with Sri Lanka, Chief of the Political Section of the Iranian Embassy in Colombo Ayoub Heidari said.
“Even, with sanctions, we have relations with Sri Lanka,” he said. He was speaking at a conference organized by the Pathfinder Foundation on Thursday. He said if sanctions were lifted on the banking sector, Sri Lanka and Iran could increase their trade in products such as tea, oil, dates, and nuts.
Earlier this week, delegations from Iran and Sri Lanka signed new trade cooperation agreements at a ceremony in Colombo.
Addressing the conference, Dr. Mohsen Eslami, a Professor of International Relations from the Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, said that Iran will stay committed to the nuclear agreement even if the United States pulls out.
He said even if President Donald Trump exits the agreement, as he has signaled he is open to, Eslami said he believes Iran could continue the agreement with its European partners, as well as Russia and China.
“Some countries, European countries, want to manage and use their lobby to keep the (agreement) going,” he said. “Iran is following our end of the commitment. We are obeying the commitment, but the American side doesn’t want to do the same.”
He said the nuclear deal, which was brokered in 2015, signaled a new era of Iranian diplomacy.
