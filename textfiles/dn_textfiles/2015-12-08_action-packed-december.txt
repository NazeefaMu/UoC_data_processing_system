Action-packed December

Sri Lanka's Lifestyle station E FM is once again proving that it is the radio station to watch for the month of December 2015, as it rolls out an all-new, extensive slate of programmes, events and promotions to keep fans entertained and fill their hearts with joy this festive season.
Starting off with the third Colombo Comedy Show, held for a good cause with Asian stand-up star Uma Rana and the troupe from Comedy Masala Singapore on November 26 and the "Legends of Retro" concert featuring the fantastic Gypsies, Flame and Misty on November 28, Sri Lanka's most loved and innovative radio station E FM will elevate its festive programming to the next level as it moved its Radio Personalities (RPs) to the popular Crescat Shopping Mall.
Fans will have the highly enviable chance of directly interacting with great E FM shows, including "Morning Showgram with Shaq and Mark", "Divas on E with Dana", "PM Crunch with Deen and Chrissy" and "Alive at 5 with Gem and Bless" amongst others, as E FM takes up residence at Crescat for the entire month of December 2015.
Excitingly, Crescat will also be the fun-filled venue for a number of great E FM promotions, including long-time fan-favourite Cash Splash as well as Super Market Shopping Blitz and much more, with visitors and even callers having access to an unprecedented number of prizes, surprises and entertaining competitions.
Fans can also visit Crescat to pick up Sri Lanka's first radio loyalty card, Club E, after filling out an application online at efm.lk, to be able to get highly exclusive, never-for-sale E FM merchandise including t-shirts, thumb drives and more.
At the same time, while also gearing up for the big E FM New Year's Eve 2015 party, for which details will be announced soon, E FM is additionally powering a number of spectacular musical events in December 2015, featuring only the best in terms of international and local musical talent.
Just a few highlights include the worldwide selling-out Enrique Iglesias LIVE Tour concert in Colombo, its only Asian tour stop, to be held on December 20 at CR&FC Grounds.
Aside from all this, E FM will also continue its already full schedule of movie premieres at the iconic Savoy 3D cinema, which includes the Sri Lankan debut of much-anticipated Hollywood Blockbuster "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in late December.
"E FM takes fans on an unmatchable thrill ride this December, featuring the likes of Enrique Iglesias and Mark Ronson, as well as a number of festive events and promotions to help our fans celebrate the upcoming Christmas season.
"From musical events, to competitions and entertainment and even movie premieres, get ready for an action-packed December 2015 brought to you only by E FM", COO Chalaka Gajabahu said.
