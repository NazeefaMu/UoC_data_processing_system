Report will not divide country: PM

Initial report on new Constitution in Parliament soon:
An initial report on the proposed new Constitution is now being formulated to be presented to Parliament for discussion. It is not a report that would divide the country. Neither is it a report of the majority or a minority. It will only be a basis for further discussion and debate, which the Constitutional Council can take into account in formulating the final draft, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister added that during the period of the conflict, they first thought of finding a political solution to the communal problem through a new Constitution. That was not done because the introduction of a new Constitution would not find a solution to the problem during a time of war.
“First of all, mutual understanding had to be created among communities. Now that unity and understanding had been created among communities, they had gained an opportunity to work on a new Constitution,” he said. The Prime Minister expressed these sentiments participating in the launch of the book ‘Sri Lankawe Janathawa’ (People in Sri Lanka) published by the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry held at the BMICH Colombo on July 18.
The Prime Minister said for the first time after the war, they are trying to move forward with all communities under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Their version of politics was not based on communalism or religionism.
Instead, their objective was to govern the country with an economic, political and social vision. Their intention was to steer the country forward devoid of conflict.
When they took over the reins of the government under the leadership of President Sirisena, no one thought that they would be able to create a salutary environment in the country. Some expressed doubt whether solutions could be found within a short period of two to three years in a country which suffered from 30 years of war, now that they had proved it was possible through concrete action.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the local government election would be held without delay after amending the election system in a manner acceptable to all because all parties disagreed with the system formulated by the previous regime.
Although the new system would be 100 percent acceptable to all, people should be given an opportunity to exercise their franchise in a fruitful manner.
Referring to Minister Mano Ganesan, the Prime Minister said Ganesan had always fought for communal and religious amity. As such, he had the best credentials to take charge of building national unity and co-existence.
