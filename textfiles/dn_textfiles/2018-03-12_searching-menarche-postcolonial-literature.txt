Searching for menarche in postcolonial literature

I teach a course on world literature from a two-thousand-page anthology, and in it there is not one mention of menstruation, much less menarche. To supplement the anthology’s dearth of female narratives, I teach Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis.
But even in this graphic novel, though there is a significant discussion of her body changing as she comes of age, the text makes no mention of her menarche or her menstruation. In a full-page panel starting “The Vegetable” chapter, Satrapi draws the protagonist’s transformation from a prepubescent girl into a woman. Somewhere in the midst of this growth of breasts, butt, and body overall must have come Marji’s menarche, but that moment often considered by cultures to be the onset of womanhood is omitted from Marji’s coming of age.
Postcolonial canon
With 2015 being deemed the “year of the period” in the United States, I began to notice the numbers of absent menarches in narratives of girls coming of age in world texts, Why did these bildungsromans from the postcolonial canon not include the moment where many cultures believe a girl transitions to a woman physically?
The most obvious marker of coming of age is absent from the majority of postcolonial texts with female protagonists. I began to pull books off the shelf that I thought must have menarche—or at least menstruation—scenes that I had just forgotten about. I could find four—Nervous Conditions, by Tsitsi Dangarembga; The Bride Price, by Buchi Emecheta; Breath, Eyes, Memory, by Edwidge Danticat; and The Bathhouse, by Farnoosh Moshiri.
The authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation note the dearth of menstruation stories in their chapter “Absent Literature: The Menarche.” They find the earliest mentions of menarche in French novels from 1884: Edmond de Goncourt’s Chérie and Emile Zola’s La Joie de Vivre.
When outlining the history of menarche in Western canonical texts, they do not mention any non-Western texts in which menarche seems to be investigated even more rarely.
This article calls for a reconsideration of the importance of Buchi Emecheta’s 1976 novel The Bride Price—one of the few postcolonial literary texts that features menarche as a significant theme—and argues that the moment of menarche in it is a turning point that brings an onslaught of pain and distress for Aku-nna, who is coming of age.
In The Bride Price, Aku-nna must leave her more cosmopolitan life in Lagos after her father dies. She returns to her original tribe with her mother and her brother. Though the mother is bucking tradition, she fights to ensure that her daughter will continue her education. Frail in frame, Aku-nna is seen by many members of the tribe as someone who needs protection, and her teacher and soon-to-be lover Chike feels the same way. Her mother foreshadows the novel’s end when she states, “I am not allowing you out of my sight until you are seventeen, or you are bound to die in childbirth. You are so thin and not very developed. All you have are eyes and legs.”
Her psyche
There is much talk about the fact that Aku-nna has not had her first period—to the point where fellow women question her sex and gender—as there is great celebration in the tribe when a girl becomes a woman. On that night suitors may begin to come to the father (or stepfather, in her case) to begin to court the girl and offer a bride price.
At the novel’s midpoint, Aku-nna reaches menarche during school. Before she realizes she will bleed, her teacher Chike admonishes her and she flees to be alone.
Chike seeks her out and tells her that he wants her to be happy, that she should return to class. As she walks ahead of him, he cries out “You are bleeding. . . there is blood on your dress.” Immediately, she is afraid: first for her body and then for her psyche: She swirled round quickly, looked and saw that there was blood smeared on a part of the hem of her dress. At first she was frightened, thinking that she had hurt herself.
Then common sense took over, and she knew what was happening to her. She had heard about it from her friends so many times, she had seen it happen to many women, she had been told about it often by her mother and she knew the responsibility that went with it. She was now fully grown. She could be married away, she could be kidnapped, a lock of her hair could be cut by any man to make her his wife forever. This “it” of the paragraph is the unspeakable: menarche. For Aku-nna, her menarche is not something to be celebrated, as she knows that her entire life is going to change. She realizes “She was now fully grown.”
Though she really isn’t—her body is so tiny that it will not be able to sustain a pregnancy at the age of sixteen—she is marriageable now, so she is “grown.” She is afraid of having her period and all that comes with the new burden of being perceived culturally as a woman. She wants to “run, run as far as possible,” but instead she stays, and she and Chike plot to hide her period until she has passed her exams.
