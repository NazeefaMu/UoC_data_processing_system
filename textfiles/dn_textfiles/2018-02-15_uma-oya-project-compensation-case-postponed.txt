Uma Oya project compensation case postponed

When the case filed by people in the Badulla district affected by the Uma Oya project seeking compensation payments came up for hearing in the Uva provincial High Court yesterday, High Court Judge Thusitha Devapriya Gunawardene postponed the hearing for April 26.
At the outset, the state counsel making a statement in Court submitted that complainants had no right to file this case as another case filed by affected people seeking compensation earlier was in the process of being heard in courts. Counsel for the petitioners Vijaya Neranjan submitted that people in Badulla too had been affected by the project and they too had a right to seek compensation.
Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake, Uma Oya Relief office Director P. B. Amarasekera, Uma Oya Project Director Sunil de Silva, Badulla GA Nimal Abeysiri and Provincial Director of Agriculture A. B. M. Wijetunge have been cited as respondents in this case filed by Uva Provincial Council members Samantha Vidyaratne, H. A. Bodhipala and Vasantha Sanjeewa Somasiri.
