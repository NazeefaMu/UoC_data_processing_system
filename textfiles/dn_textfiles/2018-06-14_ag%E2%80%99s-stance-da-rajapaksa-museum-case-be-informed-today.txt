AG’s stance on D.A. Rajapaksa Museum case to be informed today

 
The Court of Appeal yesterday directed the Attorney General to inform his stance today (14) regarding future legal actions to be taken against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. This is over a complaint that the D.A.Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara made this directive to Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General when a writ petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa was taken up for hearing. The Court of Appeal has already issued an Interim Order preventing police from acting against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over this incident.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal had upheld the petitioner’s version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of petitioner’s legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva under the instructions of counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake and Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleka and SSC Nirmalan Vigneshvaran appeared for the Attorney General.
