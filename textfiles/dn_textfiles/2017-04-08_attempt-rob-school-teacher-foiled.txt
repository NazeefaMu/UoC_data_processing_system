Attempt to rob school teacher foiled

Two women from an organized crime group were apprehended by residents in the Battaramulla area, when they attempted to rob Rs 10,000 from the bag of a school teacher travelling on the 174 bus route from Kottawa to Borella. The women were handed over to the Thalangama Police.
On 7 April, Thilini Kalubowila, a teacher of Ananda College, Colombo, had withdrawn Rs 10,000 from a bank in Battaramulla and thereafter got on to a 174 bus headed towards Borella.
A short while later, she had felt someone tugging at her bag. When she looked into what was happening, she noticed that a woman had managed to grab hold of the money in her bag and had jumped off the bus, running away with her cash. She had then shouted at her and proceeded to pursue the woman, but two other women in the same bus had pushed her aside and escaped with the suspect.
The residents of the area and three-wheeler drivers who had gathered around the bus when they heard the woman shouting, had managed to apprehend the female suspects. They were handed over to two officers from the Thalangama Police station who arrived at the scene much later.
