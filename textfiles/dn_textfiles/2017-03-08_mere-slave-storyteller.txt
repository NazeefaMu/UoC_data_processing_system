From a mere slave to a storyteller

With almost all his plays, Chamika Hathlahawatta has been trying to explore different theatrical genres and demonstrate these experiments to create a unique experience to the spectators and to introduce something new or forgotten back to the stage. King I Am The Slave is one such an attempt to resurrect the age-old tradition of storytelling in a modernistic approach to the national and world theatre. This play can be staged not only in a proscenium theatre but also in an open theatre.
Taking a minimalist approach, the players present three incidents in Sri Lankan history that have been taking place during different time spans using a set of inexpensive jars which are turned into a thorn, mountains, chairs, horse, riverbank and many more as the story reveals. Five storytellers narrate the stories and enact the characters that they encounter through the play with a mix of wordplay and action. They manage to refrain from absorbing themselves wholly into the roles so as to ensure that they do not get totally away from primarily role of the storyteller. Play concludes throwing the responsibility of selecting the best hero to the spectators.
King I Am The Slave is an experimental attempt of Chamika Hathlahawatte to resurrect the age-old tradition of storytelling to the national and world theatre. It consists of three stories.
The first story is a fairytale of a slave gaining power against the king. The second is the legendary story of King Dutugemunu reuniting the state against King Elara. The third story is about a wise child, Premathilaka, who subdues to commit murder due to the rejection in love. The fourth story changes in end. Each story takes a twist and the storytellers change the expected ending to reach different and unexpected endings.
Hathlahawatte is the director as well as the playwright of King I Am The Slave. He has earned a Bachelor of Arts (Drama and Theatre special), Masters and Diploma in PHD. He translated Hayina in 2004 as a participant in Bharath Ranga Mahotsav. His Hari Apooru Dawasak staged in 2008 won eight awards at the State Drama Festival. Dragon directed in 2013 won eight awards at the National Drama Festival. King I Am The Slave produced in 2016 has won 10 awards.
 
The stage play will be staged at the Lionel Wendt on April 1 at 7 pm.
