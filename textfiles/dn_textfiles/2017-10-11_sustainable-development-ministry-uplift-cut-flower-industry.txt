Sustainable Development Ministry to uplift cut flower industry

Considering the growing market demand for cut flowers in the local and international market, the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry has taken various measures to expand the country’s cut flower industry, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said.
Accordingly, the Ministry has implemented various programmes to assist cut flower growers by providing planting materials, knowledge and technical assistance to them.
Immediate measures would also be taken to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between flower growers and exporters enabling flower growers to engage in this industry without any risk of losing their income, said the Deputy Minister.
She also invited flower growers to grow more roses and jasmines to meet the huge market demand for these flowers in the local market.
“Though Sri Lanka produces around 500,000 roses per a month, that’s not sufficient to meet the market demand. Therefore, we have to import roses and jasmines from India and Netherlands. The flower growers would be able to earn a good income by growing roses and jasmines,” she said. The Minister further stressed the importance of producing high quality flowers in order to meet the growing market needs.
The government has taken measures to increase foreign exchange earnings through the expansion of the cut flower industry.
In 2015, Sri Lanka had earned $ 13.9 million through cut flower exports. But it has reduced to $ 13.6 in 2016. Hence the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry has taken measures to encourage flower growers to pay urgent attention to the increase of cut flower exports.
Netherlands and Japan are major buyers of Sri Lankan cut flowers and there is a huge demand for roses, carnations and orchids in their market.
