Citizens’ Mail

A plea to clean up SriLankan airlines
I was astonished and baffled to hear the public enterprise Minister Kabir Hashim's recent statement of his disappointment for not being able to ‘clean up’ SriLankan airlines and bring offenders to book even though a strong Yahapalanaya, good governance government is in existence. He has said that there is a mafia within the Sri Lankan airlines and it still exists.
His confession shows us he confronts challenges and difficulties in cleaning up the airlines.
The Weliamuna report apparently says the former Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe was allegedly involved of financial misappropriation in the airlines. But it surprises us how the current chairman Ajith Dias has dismissed the Weliamuna report saying there is no problem with the airline. It is vividly clear and evident the national carrier the SLA has been continuously on loss since the previous regime in power and it has been investigated by the FCID that massive fraud has taken place.
At such a scenario how could the current chairman vindicate the fraudulent and corrupted officials in the airlines who still exist in service who were illegally manipulated by the Rajapaksa clan.
Hence, I very earnestly request the President and the Prime Minister to take immediate action to bring all the culprits to book or empower the Minister Kabir Hashim to do so.
