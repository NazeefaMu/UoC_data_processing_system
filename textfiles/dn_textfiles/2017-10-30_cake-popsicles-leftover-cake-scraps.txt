Cake popsicles from leftover cake scraps

Meet Raymond otherwise known as Ray Ray. He is a self-taught baker from Melbourne.
About three years ago, whilst completing his Master Degree in Accounting, which wasn’t of his interest, he started baking as a humble hobby. That year, he conveniently announced that he will be bringing desserts to every friends and family party he is invited to. Then he baked his first cake.
He is probably best known for unique cake designs and cake pops or as he calls them ‘cake-popsicles’. The idea of it came from using leftover cake scraps from his offcuts and failed attempts at bad recipes. He finds the usual round cake pop shape was a little dated and decided that the little popsicle shape would give him a slightly bigger canvas to play with.
The cake comes in a variety of flavours from classic butter pound to black sesame, spinach and most recently white lotus and salted egg yolks.
Some of his favourite designs are inspired by architecture, mythical creatures, elements of nature, cartoon characters and often from his travel.
Apart from accepting occasional limited order, in the past year, he has travelled to cities like Paris, Singapore, Taipei, Bangkok Jakarta and Seoul for demonstrations, workshops, and collaborative work.
