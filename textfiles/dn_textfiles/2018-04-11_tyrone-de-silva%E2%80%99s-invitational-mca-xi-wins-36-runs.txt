Tyrone de Silva’s Invitational MCA XI wins by 36 runs

Despite an elegant 99 runs by the Club President, the 45-year-old, Devon Ranaweera for the visiting United Tarneit Sports Club from Victoria, Australia, Tyrone de Silva’s Invitational MCA XI coasted to a comfortable 36-run win in their friendly 20+20 cricket encounter played at the MCA Grounds recently.
Ranaweera (99 in 58 balls, inclusive of 04 sixes and 12 fours) unfortunately got run out while going for the 2nd run to reach his well deserved ton.
Earlier on, Tyrone de Silva’s team batting first, put up a challenging 209 for 5 in 20 overs, built on two productive partnerships – 57 runs for the 2nd wicket between Sujith Perera (42) and Namal Seneviratne (50rtd in 26 balls, with 4 sixes and 04 fours) and 61 runs for the fourth wicket between Wasanthalal Fernando (45 rtd) and Punnyakantha Abeygunasekera (26 not out). The solid spell of bowling by Anjelo Dissanayake (4-20-2) turned the tide against the visitors, who could only reach 173 for 6 in 20 overs.
