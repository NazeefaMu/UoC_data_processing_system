Right to Peace

In today’s Sri Lankan context peace process and the role of peace is predominant. The three-decade-long armed conflict in Sri Lanka ended in May 2009. Some people are under an illusion thinking that we achieved peace by winning the war. We have to question ourselves whether everyone is happy with the situation. Not really. The war ended leaving behind several casualties, dead bodies, trauma, destruction of public utilities and civilian properties, and innumerable human rights violations.
An absence of war or armed conflict in and of itself does not automatically lead to peace and reconciliation. It has been a decade after finishing the war. For a decade what have we achieved in the peace journey? What initiatives has the government taken? What you, as an individual, have done? More than anything else, as the young generation who owns the future of this country, what have we done? Scars and wounds are there and what have we truly done as a nation to heal those bleeding wounds?
Peace is a demand in the current world context. Peace is when people are able to resolve their conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of life. The World Peace Day fell on September 21 under the theme Right to Peace. Declaration on the right of peoples to peace has been approved by General Assembly Resolution 39/22 of November 12, 1984. There it is being recognized that the maintenance of a peaceful life for peoples is the sacred duty of each State.
Peace, human rights and development
At present, there are mainly two types of interpretation of the meaning of peace-negative peace and positive peace. Negative peace refers to the absence of violence (i.e. the violence stopped, oppression ended). A modern example would be North and South Korea. Positive peace refers to the absence of indirect and structural violence. Here it is visible, restoration of relationships and having a social system that whole population respect and recognise. Over the past decade what we saw in Sri Lanka was negative peace. The three UN pillars of the right to peace namely peace, human rights and development are closely connected.
Needless to say, seeing and experiencing or committing violence and injustice every day, for long years of our life, it will take an untold toll on our humanity. Moreover, due to complications in the economy, politics, freedom, unemployment, education, ethnicity, lack of opportunities etc, youth in Sri Lanka is connected to anxiety and hardship in post-independence Sri Lanka. Consequently, two main insurrections occurred in 1971 and 1987 - 1989, identified as economic-politicized. Subsequently, the third one, which was Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insurrection in 1983-2009 was ethnic-politicized and dragged this country to a miserable condition.
We have a long journey to go in order to achieve sustainable peace. According to Fedenico Mayor, former Director General of the UNESCO, “Instead of absence of war, peace is increasingly seen as a dynamic, participative, long-term process, based on universal values and everyday practice, at all levels the family, the school, the community as well as the nation”(Serto, 2003). Reconciliation is the only path to achieve peace effectively.
Reconciliation process
Reconciliation is defined by its Hebrew root word ‘Tikuum Olam’ which means a three-part process of HEAL, REPAIR and TRANSFORM. It is high time we concentrated on the reconciliation process as it has not been properly addressed and processed through every part of the country. The longer the society remains segregated and communities live apart from each other, the deeper the hatred and greater the chance for animosity to continue. History has proven that grievances ignored will eventually destroy the potential for a sustainable peace.
Transforming war into peace is a long-term process. This process is not a goal or an event. It is a lifestyle and attitude-changing. As Sri Lankans, we are blessed to see a ray of hope for positive peace in recent past.
Fortunately, a semblance of peace has returned to Sri Lanka. In 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka renewed its commitment to reconciliation and thereafter embarked on several initiatives for national reconciliation. In contemporary Sri Lankan context, sparks of positive peace are arising. It is a light of a hope and a green light for youth to have a bright future. Correspondingly there are new entities being established to secure the peace process such as Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM). On June 24, 2016, Right to Information Act was passed with the Right to Information Commission being established. It enables:
(i) The public to access to information, (ii) Responsibility of state institutions to publish information, (iii) Responsibility to release information.
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) was set up in January 2015 and they have initiated a number of programmes focusing on art and culture, psychosocial perspectives, religion and education. Furthermore, on September 21, 2015, the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry was established. They take action on development projects. Government is strengthening the peace process. It may be slow but a steady process. Context peace is understood as a dynamic process, not an absolute end point.
The then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has asked for more time from UNHRC with the peace process in 2017. Yes, it is not an overnight task. Office on Missing Persons was established in February 2018 as an independent entity. The Government is working towards Office for Reparations and the Bill was gazetted on June 25 and submitted to parliament on July 17. It is about the light of faith, hope and justice. Also, SCRM has launched an awareness-raising campaign for reconciliation titled “Ahanna” (listen) launched on August 8, 2018. Ahanna programme reaching out to the public in a very effective manner. The campaign travelled across the island, visiting 41 towns (so far) as a street-theatre performance, promoting social cohesion and communal harmony with the aim of bringing together communities by sharing among them a collective of personal stories as a creative initiative that fosters unity and reconciliation. There are positive peace activities being carried out recently by the government. This process of reconciliation should be appreciated, acknowledged and recognized.
Legitimate mechanism
Most importantly, the establishment of transitional justice in Sri Lanka is a huge step in the process of reconciliation. To achieve sustainable peace and reconciliation transitional justice is important to address past abuses in a proper manner with the legitimate mechanism. Looking at the other countries where transitional justice being processed such as Latin America and later South Africa, Yugoslavia, Chilli, Brazil, Canada and Indonesia, it is intelligible and we should understand that it takes time to proceed.
Peace researcher and former Australian Ambassador John W. Burton argues that peace does not mean the absence of conflict. Looking at recent abrupt racial conflicts, Sri Lanka is still very much divided along ethnic lines. There was a considerable amount of international dissatisfaction with the slow pace of progress due to the long delay in setting up the reconciliation mechanisms such as the Office on Missing Persons, Office for Reparations, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Special Judicial Mechanism.
Sri Lanka is a developing country dealing with a post-conflict strained society. Reconciliation is not only important to achieve a peaceful society. It will also have an impact on our society in numerous ways. The civil war lasted over 25 years produced a political fragmentation, deep ethnic division and weak economy. Pluralistic nature in Sri Lanka is challenging, yet it is the Sri Lankans’ responsibility to take it as strength. Reconciliation, peace-building and transformation of the politics and economy are essential for Sri Lanka to heal.
Non-recurrence is important. Every individual in this society should work towards peace. Teenagers to youngsters and youngsters to adults, we all should bear the responsibility with regard to peace, not the mere government. Us, the younger generation carries the main responsibility in the peace process in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we can be the generation to change the negative peace into the positive peace. State of peace is beneficial to individuals, states, nations and for all mankind and it is everyone’s right - P E A C E.
