Meteorology Department issues warning
Sea level surges

A weather warning was issued by the Meteorology Department yesterday on a sea level surge in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle until April 24.
When contacted by the Daily News, the duty forecaster said the surges are a result of high tide and a depression condition developed closer to Sri Lanka. The duty forecaster said that there will not be a Tsunami danger. There can be significant wave height which can increase up to 2.5-3.0 meters during the period.
The Natural Hazards Early Warning Center said that the areas will experience rough seas and requested the fishermen and coastal population to be cautious during the period.
“Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle. Winds will be South-westerly in direction in the sea areas around the island and wind speed will be 20-30kmph,” the Duty Forecaster said.
“Showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in the Western, North-western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces and the Galle and the Matara districts after 2.00 p.m. Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity,” the weather forecast said.
Civilians living near Marawila, Thoduwawa coasts and the Arachchikattuwa Muthupanthiya island were affected by a sea surge yesterday. According to eyewitnesses, the sea has turned extremely rough by last Saturday evening and the sea water has risen. A resident of Thoduwawa, one Peter Paul Fernando, 75, said that they have never experienced such a change. “We were not affected even when the tsunami came. This is a first. The police and the Grama Niladhari visited us. But our fate is in the hands of the God.” he said.
According to a young man, Nilukshan Madhuranga, living at Muthupanthiya island, a stream of sea water flowed across the island. He fears a possibility of the island being divided from its mid section. Another resident at Thoduwawa, one Marian Fernando, said that they are concerned of what might happen if the sea turns rougher. “All of us are out from our houses today and stand by the road. We don’t know what will happen to us tonight. Water level is going beyond the road now. We have never witnessed something similar to this before.” It has also been reported that tourists visiting Kalpitiya islands in boats were terrified by the rough seas.
