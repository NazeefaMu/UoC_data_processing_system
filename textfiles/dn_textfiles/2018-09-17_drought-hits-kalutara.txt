Drought hits Kalutara

Drought has affected over 45,000 families in Kalutara and over five lakhs do not receive water from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board plant at Kethhena, Kalutara.
Sources at the plant said sea water flows to Kaluganga making its water unsuitable for drinking.
Many hotel owners in the district say they cannot carry out businesses without drinking water.
Kalutara District Secretary U. D. C. Jayalal conveyed a meeting of relevant officials and discussed the issue at length last week.
The District Secretary said 200 water bowsers will be provided to supply water for the residents. Kalutara tea smallholders complain they incur a huge loss since their tea plants withered in the drought.
