Measure for Shakespeare

All of Shakespeare's plays have terrific story-lines. Take Hamlet; a magnificent tragedy with an extremely powerful depth. The main character Hamlet finds out about his father's death, his mother's marriage to his uncle and speaks to the ghost of his late father who tells him to seek revenge on the new king (the same uncle) for his murder.
The play explores different relationships such as Hamlet's obsession with Gertrude, his mother and his love for Ophelia who he tries to convince his insanity to. Beautifully written and a must for all who have a love for literature, Hamlet is a truly gripping drama.
Shakespeare Centre Sri Lanka recently organized the Shakespeare Challenge Sri Lanka Award Ceremony at Western Province Aesthetic Resort. Dr Edwin Ariyadasa was the chief guest.
