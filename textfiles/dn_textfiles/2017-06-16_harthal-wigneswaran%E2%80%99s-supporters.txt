Harthal by Wigneswaran’s supporters

 
A Hartal campaign was launched against the ‘No Confidence Motion’ filed against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran today by his supporters in the North.
Several shops and businesses were closed and black flags were hung in Killinochchi, Jaffna and Mulativu districts in protest.
A ‘No Confidence Motion’ signed by 21 Northern Province Council members against the Chief Minister was submitted yesterday to Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray. 
The Motion was signed in the wake of the Chief Minister asking for the resignation of NPC Education Minister T. Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P.Aingaranesan over charges of corruption.
