NZ’s Guptill signs for Lancashire

LONDON, Friday – Lancashire have signed big-hitting New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill for the beginning of their defence of the English domestic Twenty20 title, the county announced Friday.
Guptill is due to arrive at Old Trafford following the conclusion of his commitments with the Mumbai Indians in the Twenty20 Indian Premier League and is set to play for Lancashire in the first six games of their Twenty20 campaign.
The 29-year-old was the first New Zealand player to score a double century in a one-day international and is the holder of the highest score in a 50-over World Cup after hitting an unbeaten 237 in the Black Caps’ quarter-final victory over the West Indies last year.
“Martin is a formidable batsman, particularly in white-ball cricket, and is currently ranked as the world's third best batsman in T20 cricket,” said Lancashire coach Ashley Giles in a statement issued by the county.
“He's got the ability to take games away from the opposition very quickly once he gets going and I'm sure our fans will really enjoy watching him play,” the former England spinner explained.
Guptill, who has previously played county cricket in England for Derbyshire, added: “I hope I can make a real impact and help with their pursuit for another trophy in white-ball cricket.”
