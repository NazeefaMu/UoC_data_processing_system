The King of Horror

It is amusing that as I try to figure out the opening line for this article, I find myself distracted by one of my favorite Stephen King interviews,in which King talks about the vital importance of a good opening line. “There are all sorts of theories,” he says, “it’s a tricky thing.” “But there’s one thing” he’s sure about: “An opening line should invite the reader to begin the story. It should say: Listen. Come in here. You want to know about this.” What King says next is even more significant. “We’ve talked so much about the reader, but you can’t forget that the opening line is important to the writer, too. To the person who’s actually boots-on-the-ground. Because it’s not just the reader’s way in, it’s the writer’s way in also, and you’ve got to find a doorway that fits us both.”
A door Stephen King has no trouble looking for. After all he is the Big Mac of writers (his words, not mine). But the great thing is, unlike the fast food restaurant, King is actually good for your soul - provided you have a taste for excellent pieces of horror-tinged prose.
Something which, I, sadly don’t have. But which millions of others seem to cherish. It is said that King has sold an estimated 350 million books to-date, and he is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. John Grisham and Fifty Shades of Grey author E.L. James may outsell him these days, but it’s hardly a problem. “He’s not competitive,” says his longtime agent Chuck Verrill. “The only guy he ever cared about was Tom Clancy. They were both at Penguin once, and it was made clear to King that he was seen as the second banana to Clancy. He didn’t like that, but he’s very content where he is right now.”
Not so in the early years though. It had hurt at first. The reason was clear. By writing horror novels King had entered the least respected genres of fiction. King admits this is true, and asks, “But what could I do?” Then he adds, “I have to say this: To a degree, I have elevated the horror genre. It’s more respected now. I’ve spoken out my whole life against the idea of simply dismissing whole areas of fiction by saying it’s “genre” and therefore can’t be seen as literature. I’m not trying to be conceited or anything. Raymond Chandler elevated the detective genre. People who have done wonderful work really blur the line.”

But the critics continue to be brutal. King recalls an article in the Village Voice. “Early in my career, The Village Voice did a caricature of me that hurts even today when I think about it. It was a picture of me eating money. I had this big, bloated face. It was this assumption that if fiction was selling a lot of copies, it was bad. If something is accessible to a lot of people, it’s got to be dumb because most people are dumb. And that’s elitist. I don’t buy it.”
The cartoon was doubly painful because King says he never thinks about money. “I’m not a clothes person. I’m not a boat person. We do have a house in Florida. But we live in Maine, for Christ’s sake. It’s not like a trendy community or anything. We have the houses and stuff. My wife likes all that. But I’m not very interested in stuff. I like cars, because I grew up in the country and a car was important. So we’ve got more cars than we need, but that’s our only extravagance.”
King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father abandoned the family when King was very young (“He went out to buy cigarettes and never returned”). He was raised poor, by his mother, who worked in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged. ‘As a kid,’ he says, ‘I went to see every horror movie I could possibly see. Sometimes my brother went with me. My brother’s two years older, and he would put his hat over his face. I never put my hat over my face.’
He had started to read when he was around twelve years old – borrowing books from a mobile library. “I read a wide range of books. I read The Call of the Wild and The Sea-Wolf one week, and then Peyton Place the next week, and then a week later The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Whatever came to mind, whatever came to hand, I would read. When I read Tess of the d’Urbervilles, ...I loved that book, so I read a whole bunch of Hardy. But when I read Jude the Obscure, that was the end of my Hardy phase. I thought, This is ridiculous. Nobody’s life is this bad. Give me a break.”
King’s first published story was, “I Was a Teenage Grave Robber,” which appeared in 1965 in a fan magazine called Comics Review. Around that time he received a scholarship to attend the University of Maine in Orono, where he met his wife, Tabitha, a novelist with whom he has three children and to whom he is still married. To this day, King believes there are two secrets to success: “I stayed healthy, and I stayed married.”
After having struggled for several years to support his young family by washing motel linens at a laundry, teaching high-school English, and occasionally selling short stories to men’s magazines in 1973, he sold his novel Carrie, which quickly became a best seller. Since then, virtually all of his novels and most of his short stories have been adapted for film or television. Although he was dismissed by critics for much of his career his writing has received greater recognition in recent years, and in 2003 he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation. King has also been honored for his devoted efforts to support and promote the work of other authors. In 1997 he received the Writers for Writers Award from Poets & Writers magazine.
Ever ready to advise young writers King has many tips on how to write a good novel. Using the passive voice, he says, should always be avoided. “Timid writers like passive verbs for the same reason that timid people like passive partners. The passive voice is safe.” He also says adverbs should never be used. “The adverb is not your friend, especially after “he said” and “she said.” And yet, he does not see the need to obsess over perfect grammar. “The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.” His most important piece of advice is “Read. Read. Read, because ” if you don’t have time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write.”
With a career spanning over forty-four years as a writer, forty-three novels, eight collections of short stories, eleven screenplays, and two books on the craft of writing, when the Paris Review asked King how important were his surroundings when he was at work he had this to say. “It’s nice to have a desk, a comfortable chair so you’re not shifting around all the time, and enough light. Wherever you write is supposed to be a little bit of a refuge, a place where you can get away from the world. The more closed in you are, the more you’re forced back on your own imagination. I mean, if I were near a window, I’d be OK for a while, but then I’d be checking out the girls on the street and who’s getting in and out of the cars and, you know, just the little street-side stories that are going on all the time...My study is basically just a room where I work. I have a filing system. It’s very complex, very orderly. I write down birth dates to figure out how old characters are at certain times. Because if I do something wrong now, it becomes such a pain in the ass to fix later.”
Talking about the unique way his novels get under the skin of the readers, King explains, “I’ve always thought that the sort of book that I do—and I’ve got enough ego to think that every novelist should do this—should be a kind of personal assault. It ought to be somebody lunging right across the table and grabbing you and messing you up. It should get in your face. It should upset you, disturb you. And not just because you get grossed out. I mean, if I get a letter from somebody saying, I couldn’t eat my dinner, my attitude is, Terrific!”
So, beware. If Stephen King is around, you are bound to come across a world filled with mysteries, the improbable and the inexplicable; rats as big as cows, plants that swallow publishers, men who eat their own fingers... As Holly Gibney says to an empty room at one point in ‘The Outsider’: “‘Anything is possible. Anything at all. The world is full of strange nooks and crannies.’
If those last lines gave you goose bumps, relax. The King of Horror himself is scared of many things. He is mortally frightened of flying and of number 13. “The number 13 never fails to trace that old icy finger up and down my spine. When I’m writing, I’ll never stop work if the page number is 13 or a multiple of 13; I’ll just keep on typing till I get to a safe number. When I’m reading, I won’t stop on page 94, 193, or 382, since the sums of these numbers add up to 13.”
Tell me you are smiling. Tell me you will sleep with the light off, tonight.
