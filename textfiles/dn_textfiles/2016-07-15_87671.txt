Pakistan 282-6 against England at first day close

LONDON, THURSDAY: Pakistan were 282 for six after winning the toss at stumps on the first day of the first Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday.
Misbah-ul-Haq, who in the course of his innings became the oldest Test centurion in 82 years, was 110 not after Rahat Ali was bowled by Chris Woakes off what became the last ball of the day.
Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes led England’s attack with four for 45.
This is the first of a four-Test series.
The first hour saw Hafeez and Masood put on a 38-run stand that involved a little bit of luck alongside some proactive batting.
Hafeez might have been taken on 11, when a drive at Broad resulted in a thick edge low to the left of James Vince at third slip but he could not hold on one-handed.
The same batsman flashed wide of the slips off Ball in the 10th over and Masood followed suit, off Woakes, moments after.
Woakes, though, found success shortly before the drinks break, inducing a thin edge from Masood with a delivery than bounced a touch more than expected.
The elegant-looking left-hander is well acquainted with the surroundings at Lord’s, having grown up around the corner in St John’s Wood, but he was unable to linger in the middle long enough to truly enjoy himself.
Hafeez gambolled his way to 40 before finally falling in lackadaisical fashion, trying to flip Woakes across the line only to offer a straightforward catch to Jonny Bairstow running across towards square leg, but Younis’s presence at the crease, springing cat-like into line 15 years after his last appearance at Lord’s, hinted at the work to come for the bowlers.
