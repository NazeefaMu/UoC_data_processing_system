‘MR had plans to rent out Hambantota seaport, airport’

Southern Provincial Minister H.W. Gunasena said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had plans to rent out the Hambantota seaport and Mattala airport to China, but today he supported protest campaigns against the purpose.
The Provincial Minister was addressing a meeting held at Teldeniya.
The SPC Minister said the Joint Opposition must do something unique to attract people rather than protesting. He recalled that protests could not be carried out during former President’s regime.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa sold 2,000 acres to foreign investors.
“The members of the joint opposition wanted them to be remanded to get the public attention,” he said. The SPC Minister said the country could not be developed without foreign investments. He said the Government would govern the country even beyond 2020.
