Samsung Galaxy J6 joins ‘J’ line smartphones in SL

The Samsung Galaxy J6 is the latest smartphone to join Samsung’s ’J’line-up and is highly budget-friendly at an affordable price.
Speaking on the occasion, General Manager and Head of Mobile Biz of Samsung Sri Lanka Shantha Fernando said, “The Samsung Galaxy J range of smartphones has empowered budget-conscious customers to enjoy flagship features such as the Super AMOLED display and infinity screen which produces deeper contrasts and delivers the most vivid viewing experience. J6 is a true choice for millenials as it features chat over video, stickers, rear fingerprint scanner and clearer selfies.
The Galaxy J6 ensures users can do more with their smartphones when it comes to expressing themselves.”
The device also comes with Samsung’s advanced memory management feature that automatically direct content from social media applications to the external memory card.
The Infinity Design on the Galaxy J6 gives users nearly 15% more viewing space without increasing the overall size of the device. The super AMOLED screen produces sharper contrast and more dynamic colour.
A 13MP camera can be found on the back while selfies are captured with an 8MP camera and features such as selfie focus and the built-in LED flash help users to capture clearer self-portraits. 
The front camera on Galaxy J6 smartphones feature an adjustable selfie flash, allowing consumers to snap stylish selfies, from day to night. AR stickers can also be added to photos captured with the Galaxy J6. 
The Galaxy J6 comes with two memory variants; 32GB with 3GB and 64GB with 4GB. The device is available in Blue, Black and Gold colour options at authorized Samsung dealers, Damro, JKOA, Singhagiri, Singer and Softlogic from mid-June onwards.
