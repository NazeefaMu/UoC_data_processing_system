London fire updates: Blaze engulfs apartment block [Video]

 
A massive fire has ripped through a 27-storey apartment block in west London, causing an unknown number of fatalities and at least 50 injuries. Two-hundred firefighters in 40 trucks have been battling the blaze, which began shortly before 1am local time, and several hours later continues to burn. Eyewitnesses said they had seen people fall or jump from the stricken building. Large pieces of debris could be seen falling from Grenfell Tower, a 1970s block in the working-class north Kensington area — a short distance from chic Notting Hill — which underwent an extensive refurbishment only last year.
What we know
London Fire Brigade has confirmed a “number of fatalities” following a blaze at Grenfell Tower in north Kensington.
London Fire Brigade was first called at 12.54am on Wednesday to the Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, North Kensington. Fire commissioner Dany Cotton said the first crew was on the scene in less than six minutes.
It is a 27-storey building.
Forty engines with more than 200 firefighters attended the scene.
Thirty people have been taken to five hospitals.
The fire is burning from the second to the top floor.
The cause of the fire is not yet known
London mayor Sadiq Khan says the fire has been declared a “major incident”.
Grenfell Tower was built in 1974 and contains 120 homes, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
Police statement
The Metropolitan Police have released a statement confirming “there have been a number of fatalities’’ in the fire. Commander Stuart Cundy, from the Metropolitan Police, said: “All the emergency services and other agencies continue to work together at the scene.
“I can confirm there have been a number of fatalities and others receiving medical care. We will be soon making contact with next of kin.
“Anyone who is concerned about loved ones in relation to the fire should contact Casualty Bureau which has been opened following the fire. If you do not get through immediately please do try again.
“Extensive cordons remain in place and a number of nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The A40 is closed in both directions. We kindly ask that the public stay away from the area. I thank the public for their patience and their co-operation today which has already greatly assisted our policing response.
“It is likely to take some time before we are in a position to confirm the cause of the fire.
Fatalities confirmed
“A number” of people have been killed in the massive fire in a west London apartment block on Wednesday, London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton told reporters at the scene. At least 30 people have been injured in the fire which engulfed all floors from the second to the top of the Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, where several hundred people lived.
“At this time I am very sad to confirm that there have been a number of fatalities, I cannot confirm the number at this time due to the size and complexity of this building,” Dany Cotton, Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade told reporters.
‘They were trapped’
Witnesses have told how they heard screaming from the upper floors as the flames rose in the night and one desperate resident could be seen waving a white cloth from a top floor window.
“They were trapped. They couldn’t come downstairs, especially from the top floor ... people have been burned,” a witness identified as Daniel told BBC Radio London. “I have seen it with my own eyes. And I have seen people jump.”
Jody Martin told the BBC that he battled his way his way to the second floor only to encounter choking smoke. “I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window ... hearing screams, I was yelling everyone to get down and they were saying ‘We can’t leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors’,” he said.
