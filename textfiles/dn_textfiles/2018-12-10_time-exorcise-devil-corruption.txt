Time to exorcise the devil of corruption

Yesterday, Sunday December 9 was International Anti-Corruption Day. The United Nations’ General Assembly designated it in 2003 as the day to raise awareness about this insidious crime and ways of combating it.
Corruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects all countries. It undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development and contributes to governmental instability. In addition, it attacks the foundation of democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existing is the soliciting of bribes. Economic development is stunted because foreign direct investment is discouraged and small businesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the ‘start-up costs’ required because of corruption.
Governments, the private sector, non-governmental organisations, the media and citizens around the world are joining forces to fight this crime.
The world has allowed the ugly and sinister head of corruption to creep into our daily lives. Stories of scandals, kickbacks, greed and moral laxity have been capturing media attention of late, proving that it is becoming part of our national heritage.
Corruption is deemed one of the biggest tragedies of mankind for the simple reason that it is ongoing and extremely difficult to combat, forcing the poor into ever more hopeless conditions while the select few in power get ever richer and more powerful. Bribes prevent chosen criminals from ever having to take responsibility for what they have done. The fact is that the line between right and wrong has become so blurred today that many people wonder if there is a difference anymore. I believe it is time we examine the moral and ethical problems facing society.
Everyone, even the most dishonest among us, it seems, agrees that honesty is an ideal to live by. Every major religion preaches honesty. Civil laws exist to enforce it.
Individuals and governments claim to want to practice it. But is this only mealy-mouthed lip-service we are paying? And how many people are really committed to dealing honestly as an ongoing, constant way of life? Lamentably, the corrupt are getting bolder and their operations border on the reckless. This is because graft and kickbacks have become an accepted norm in our society.
Intelligent people who thoughtfully look at the long-term effects of honesty and dishonesty must come to the logical conclusion that honesty is the only way that ultimately pays off in success. But trapped in the rat race for material success we all too often tend to forget that such crime expands because of our willingness to put up with it. There was a time when Sri Lankans reserved their greatest admiration for people of integrity and moral rectitude.
But sadly, this does not seem the attitude anymore. Most will argue that nobody is perfect. Everyone has their faults. So why should one get worked up about good and evil? They argue that they are not big-time swindlers, drug barons, mass murderers or genocidal dictators. We claim to be petty sinners compared to these ruthless individuals. We see ourselves as not all that bad when compared with the big-timers. Therefore there is really nothing to worry about.
Various measures have been suggested to exorcise the devil of corruption such as transparency in public life, stringent laws to deal with the corruption cases, electoral reforms to check the misuse of money and muscle powers, reform in the judiciary system, to quicken the disposal of cases of corruption among others. Let us face it. We all want success and the sense of satisfaction that comes from achievement. But is it honest achievement?
Our religion endorses education, diligence and the value of making sound investments. No one denies those who work hard and honestly the fruits of their labours. But this is an era when material prosperity becomes a measure of one’s success. Conversely, we see the absence of material prosperity as evidence of moral failure. I repeat that no one should condemn worldly success, brought about by solid, down-to-earth honest principles.
But the corruption syndrome is having an effect on our community and our nation. It will ultimately pose the chilling danger of trickling down to our children who no doubt are perceptive enough to observe our moral laxity. Which poses the relevant question: Are we as responsible adults teaching our children about the importance of good practices in a practical way? Most children who are entering prestigious schools know in practice that they got this opportunity by their parents’ giving bribes to the school authorities.
Overwhelming evidence has surfaced of widespread and deeply ingrained practice of accepting bribes and corruption as part of everyday life. Politicians, bureaucrats and clerks unethically and shamefully use taxpayer’s money without any hesitation. These unacceptable practices seep into the minds of our children, who will grow up to do the same in the future.
Certainly, tougher anti-corruption laws and stricter law enforcement are necessary to prevent people of upper ranks from helping themselves to public funds. However, we must place greater focus on instilling civic ethics, values and sense of duty and responsibility in our children’s minds.
Unless we strengthen values and teach our children why bribery and abusing power are unacceptable personally and socially, the insidious cancer of corruption and exploiting public wealth for personal benefit will continue, being reproduced generation after generation.
It would certainly be a great lesson to our children to note that deterrent punishment is meted out to offenders whoever they are. For as long as we fail to address the disease where it takes root - in the youngest members of our society - we will be condemning ourselves to a future in which our collective wealth will continue to be plundered and related social problems helped to flourish.
Through all this the entire nation seems to be running away from what had once been its conventionally honest shadow. Our people’s hopelessness becomes even greater when such issues and blatant injustices are ignored, conveniently misinterpreted or totally blown out of proportion.
In a larger sense some of the blame has to be apportioned to us by encouraging such a virulent malaise by our very acquiescence.
Today we must be more sensitive to moral issues and must regard bribery and dishonesty in its varied forms as crimes against society. It can be done with your help.
