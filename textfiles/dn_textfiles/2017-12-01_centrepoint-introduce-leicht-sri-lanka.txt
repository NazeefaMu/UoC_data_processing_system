Centrepoint introduce LEICHT to Sri Lanka

LEICHT, the No 1 best sold premium kitchen brand in Germany, has entered the Sri Lankan market via Centrepoint, a Fairway Holdings company. LEICHT is brought to you by Centrepoint, the leading interior solutions specialist in Sri Lanka.
With the introduction of LEICHT, Centrepoint broadens its range of product offerings to introduce the very best of world class brands to our country. Centrepoint supplies kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, doors and flooring to the local building industry. A state-of-the-art uPVC fabrication plant was commissioned in 2013 under Centrepoint Homes to supply uPVC doors and windows to both project and retail markets in Sri Lanka.
LEICHT was recently bestowed the Most Innovative Brand Award 2017 at the industry’s Plus X Awards in recognition of its unique product development.
These superior quality German kitchens are of timeless elegance and add the extra dimension to make a kitchen practical and an enjoyable experience. Fairway Properties will be incorporating LEICHT-fitted kitchens into their luxury apartments, for Elements by Fairway and Aqua Vista in Galle. Fairway Properties views the LEICHT product as a value-added function oriented, design savvy product for its discerning clientele.
