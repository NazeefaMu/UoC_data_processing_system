Richard Marx serenades Colombo

It was a night of simple joy for the fans of Richard Marx as he performed Live at the Stein Studios, Ratmalana to packed audience on June 26. There was the stage, there was him and there was him paying attention to his audience and serenading them with the classics they grew up listening to.
Richard Marx set the mood to bring back all those memories one had with the start of everyone’s all time favourite Endless Summer and having the audience sing along with him. He had it all. The looks, the voice and the charm – that’s all that was needed to end a perfect Sunday.
These are some of the highlights of the night as Richard Marx sang almost everything that you and I grew up listening to.
