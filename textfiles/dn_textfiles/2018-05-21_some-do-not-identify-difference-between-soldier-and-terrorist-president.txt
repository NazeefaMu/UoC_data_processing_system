Some do not identify difference between soldier and terrorist: President Sirisena

President Maithripala Sirisena says our security forces have not been accused of war crimes in the resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) as certain media and extremist parties falsely depict.
President Sirisena said that today such accusations are made by the parties who support the LTTE and living abroad and those who are against the government and security forces.
The President was addressing the participants at the ”National War Heroes Day” celebrations held near the War Heroes Monument at the parliament grounds on Saturday (19).
It is a shame some have failed to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist, the President said.
President Sirisena said certain politicians and Non-govermental Organizations that are after money fail to identify the difference between the soldier and the terrorist. He invited everybody who respects the great local cultural inheritance and wants to work on behalf of the country, the people and the war heroes, to work together with him.
“The brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives will always be hailed by the nation and the government will always work to give them the highest respect and gratitude they owe and also to look after the well-being of their families,” the President said.
President Sirisena said that it is sad to see that certain government media channels have failed to portray the importance of soldiers. He said non-state media do not talk about the programs conducted by the government for the soldiers. The President asked to work towards reminding the public the great services done by the soldiers to the motherland and to give them the highest dignity they deserve.
President Sirisena admitted that the soldiers should not at all be a political victim, and they should not be used to gain political power, to change governments in power, or to organise political parties.
President Sirisena further stated that terrorism is now beaten in the war front, but yet it is not ideologically defeated, and that he would not let dreams of the extremists who want to make a separate eelam state to become a reality.
President further stated that it is with the collaboration of friendly states that the government made dedicated efforts to defeat the idea of breaking the country in to pieces.
The Annual National War Heroes Commemoration Day to celebrate the brave soldiers who fought for a free country was held gloriously. President Sirisena, who offered flowers to the War Heroes Monument honoured the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.
