‘Pohottuwa’ party to go it alone

The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna has decided to contest future national elections on its own without coalescing with any other main party, said its Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris. He was addressing a meeting attended by members of the Podu Jana Peramuna’s Anuradhapura West and Mihintale Youth organisations held at the residence of Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena at Kurundankulama recently. Prof. Peiris said his party had now created the background and the environment necessary for his party to contest future elections under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In the face of imminent victory, his party had no desire to join hands with persons who had betrayed the SLFP Prof. Peiris said. He said certain SLFP minister in the Yahapalanaya Government were criticising their other Minister colleagues and parliamentarians to attract people’s attention and win them over. He would request people not to fall victim to this fraud. Parliamentarians S.M. Chandrasena, Shehan Senasinghe and Dilum Amunugama, Provincial Minister S.M. Ranjith, Provincial Council members Sarath Ilangasinghe, and P.S. Kumarasiri, Eastern Provincial Council member W.D. Weerasinghe, Prof. Jagath Wellawatta and actress Oshadee Hewamadduma were also present on the occasion.
