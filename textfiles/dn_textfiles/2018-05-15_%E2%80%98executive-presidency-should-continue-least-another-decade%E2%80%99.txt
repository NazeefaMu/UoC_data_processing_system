‘Executive Presidency should continue at least another decade’

“Sri Lanka needs to have an Executive President at least another decade” National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Language Minister Mano Ganeshan said.
He was addressing journalists after participating in the SLBC Verification radio program broadcast live from Matara yesterday.
The Minister said the Presidential Election was the only instance when the whole country becomes one electorate and every citizen eligible to vote irrespective of ethnicity, caste or religion could vote for an individual of their choice. “It is imperative that we continue with the Executive Presidency for the national unity.” the Minister stressed. “The powers vested with the Executive President were reduced by the 19th Amendment, and I believe they should be reduced further,” he said.
He said it was the responsibility of the government to provide solutions to people’s issues to prevent them from appealing to international organizations and other countries.
“I do not approve of our people appealing to foreign nations and international organizations to resolve internal issues of our nation.
They have no other option if the government is unable to address their issues,” the Minister said. “Every Sri Lankan must be conversant in Sinhala and Tamil for them to settle issues as one nation,” he said.
