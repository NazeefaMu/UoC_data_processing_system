CEB to sell LED bulbs

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will buy 10 million LED bulbs and sell them at a subsidised price to people for them to save electricity.
Power and renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said this at a religious event held under the Presidential Sadaham Yatra programme at the Bokkawala, Morankanda Sri Gnanaloka Bauddha Madyasthanaya on August 25.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that saving electricity is as important as generating it. Today over two million electricity consumers use ordinary electric bulbs burning more energy at their homes and other establishments.
The CEB will encourage them to use LED bulbs that burns less energy.
The Minister said that every temple where the Presidential Sadaham Yatra Programme is held will be made a partner of the Ministry’s ‘Solar Energy War’. Today over 150 megawatts of electricity is produced through rooftop solar panels, he said.
A person could save over 60 per cent of electricity by using LED bulbs. The CEB will sell LED bulbs to consumers through the meter readers, he said.
“If consumers use all these 10 million LED bulbs, we can save 304 megawatts of electricity,” the Minister said.
