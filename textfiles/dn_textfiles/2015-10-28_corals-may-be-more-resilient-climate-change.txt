Corals may be more resilient to climate change

US: Corals may have a greater capacity to survive climate change than previously thought, a new study suggests.
Some corals are more protective than others of their partner algae in harsh environmental conditions. This individual variation among corals could reflect a greater capacity than currently recognised to adapt to changing ocean conditions brought about by climate change, researchers said.
"Our study provides a glimmer of hope that corals can respond to and survive climate change, as long as it's not too fast," said Iliana Baums, associate professor of biology at Penn State University.
"The variation in response to extreme temperature that we observed is the raw material for evolutionary change and indicates that these corals may be more adaptable than previously thought," said Baums.
Reef-building corals depend on single-celled algae called Symbiodinium to provide energy through photosynthesis, while the algae benefit from the corals' nutrients.
"This delicate symbiosis can break down under extreme ocean temperatures associated with climate change," said John Parkinson, lead author of the study and a former graduate student at Penn State.
