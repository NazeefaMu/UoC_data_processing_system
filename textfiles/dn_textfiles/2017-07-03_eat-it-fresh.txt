Eat it fresh!

Leaf vegetables, also called potherbs, greens, vegetable greens, leafy greens, or salad greens, are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable. Nearly one thousand species of plants with edible leaves are known. Garden Talk speaks to Director Institute of Indigenous Medicine Swarna Hapuarachchi who furnished the Daily News with information on Lettuce which is known for its nutritious, religious, historical and cultural significance.
“This incredible leafy vegetable has more health benefits that you can possibly imagine. Leafy vegetables are typically low in calories and fat, and high in protein per calorie, dietary fiber, vitamin C, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, folate, manganese and vitamin K. Lettuce is very easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies Indigenously, it is found in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is most widely used in salads all over the world and finds its place among the list of nutritious foods. Apart from salads, it is also used in soups, sandwiches and wraps. It is also used for the purpose of juicing,” said Hapuarachchi.
“Lettuce's native range spreads from the Mediterranean, although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world. Plants generally have a height and spread of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in). In the world at large the leaves are colorful, mainly in the green and red color spectrums. There are also a few varieties in the world with yellow, gold or blue-teal leaves. Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties.
Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots. Some varieties, especially those found in the United States and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots. Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia,” pointed out Hapuarachchi.
“Proper selection plays a vital role in ensuring that you are buying fresh vegetables. As far as lettuce is concerned, always prefer whole heads of lettuce over loose lettuce leaves as they are fresher and more nutritious. Also, ensure that the leaves are crisp, tender and brightly colored.
Lettuce can be best enjoyed if it is fresh and crisp. Dark green veggies are great sources of vitamin C, folate, beta-carotene, iron, calcium, iron and dietary fiber.”
Therefore, try to look for dark colored leaves. Lettuce is delicious as long as it is fresh. While shopping for lettuce, you should avoid bunches that are limp, wilting, brownish or have rust, spots or holes on them,” explained Hapuarachchi.
Many people love growing lettuce in their garden. Nothing tastes better than a fresh salad made from lettuce you picked only minutes earlier!

Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.
* Lettuce was first cultivated by the ancient Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds.
