Garbage issue not my ministry’s responsibility: Patali

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry or the Urban Development Authority has nothing to do with the garbage issue although it is the worst affected institution with the issue, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday.
He said garbage has been dumped in the lands of the Urban Development Authority such as in Bloemendhal and Meethotamulla where several deaths occurred due to the recent collapse.
He added that those who are responsible for that incident should be sentenced to death since it was such a grave crime.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla inauguration ceremony of the Nikasala Purawara (Garbage Free City) project.
Minister Ranawaka also said Local Government institutions including the Provincials and the Pradeshiya Sabahs should take responsibility.
"However, the Meethotamulla garbage issue initiated with the Supreme Court intervening to solve the garbage issue by ordering the dumping of garbage there for six months by the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva," Minister Ranawaka said. "Thereafter, it was extended to two years and then continued until the collapse took place. Finally, three million tons of garbage was dumped there in an area of 21 acres which is worth more than Rs 1,100 million. At last, no body dared to take the responsibility of the catastrophe."
Minister Ranawaka further said that media personnel had reported a person claiming that they had means to export garbage even to the United Kingdom. "I challenge those people to export even a single kilogramme of garbage to UK," Minister Ranawaka challenged. "If they could do so, I would resign from my ministerial portfolio tomorrow."
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe and Garbage Management Project Director Jayavilal Fernando were present.
