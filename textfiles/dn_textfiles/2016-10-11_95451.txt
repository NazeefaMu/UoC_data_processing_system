Pitt on his and Jolie’s ‘family situation’

A week after Brad Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie are divorcing, the actor finds himself in a strange Hollywood scenario. As the narrator of Terrence Malick’s ambitious, 30-years-in-the-making Voyage of Time: Life’s Journey, Pitt would normally be called upon to promote the IMAX film, which arrives in theaters October 7. But because of his headline-making divorce, the actor has elected to sit out this round of publicity, a choice he described in his first public statement since confirming his split last week.
“Terrence’s Voyage of Time is an incredibly beautiful and unique experiential IMAX film for children and families chronicling the birth of time,” Pitt told Access Hollywood exclusively. “I’m very grateful to be part of such a fascinating and educational project, but I’m currently focused on my family situation and don’t want to distract attention away from this extraordinary film, which I encourage everyone to see.”
The film will be released in two alternative cuts—a feature-length version narrated by Cate Blanchett and the 40-minute IMAX alternative narrated by Pitt.
Last week, Pitt confirmed that he and Jolie would be separating in a statement given to People.
“I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well-being of our kids,” Pitt said, referring to his six children with Jolie. “I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.”
Earlier in the week, Jolie’s attorney confirmed the split, saying, “Angelina Jolie-Pitt has filed for dissolution of the marriage. This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting at this time, and asks that the family be given their privacy during this difficult time.”
Later in the day, the actress’s manager followed up with a second statement, adding, “Angelina will always do what’s in the best interest of taking care of her family. She appreciates everyone’s understanding of their need for privacy at this time.”
Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged argument that took place while the family was flying on a private jet from France to the United States. Because the reported incident took place in flight—where the F.B.I. has special aircraft jurisdiction—the F.B.I. has since confirmed that it is gathering information about the alleged event before deciding whether to pursue an investigation.
