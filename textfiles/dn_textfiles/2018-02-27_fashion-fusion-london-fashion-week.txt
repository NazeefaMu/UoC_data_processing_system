Fashion fusion at London Fashion Week

Following a strong start in New York, we’re now onto the second leg of fashion month in London, and the collections have not disappointed. Displaying their signature whimsy, many British designers have debuted out-of-this-world looks for spring-from brilliant color fusions at Peter Pilotto to ethereal silhouettes at Simone Rocha to impossible-to-resist prints at Erdem at the London Fashion Week which took the fashion world by storm recently.
