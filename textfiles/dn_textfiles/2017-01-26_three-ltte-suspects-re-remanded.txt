Three LTTE suspects re-remanded

Three alleged LTTE suspects including Subramaniam Nagulerasa alias Nagulan arrested over the seizure of several caps bearing the LTTE logo in April last year, in Narahenpita were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 8 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala.
The Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) conducting investigations into the incident informed Court that they have sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against the accused.
Defence counsel Ajith Prasanna appearing on behalf of the suspects had filed a bail application citing that his clients were still in remand over a period of about nine months.
Meanwhile, Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Atygala ordered the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) to reveal its stance in writing regarding bail on February 8.
Police seized several caps bearing the LTTE logo at Narahenpita when they were to be sent abroad through a courier service. The parcel was detected when the “from” address was found to be suspicious. The suspects were arrested after reviewing CCTV records near the Vavuniya post office.
