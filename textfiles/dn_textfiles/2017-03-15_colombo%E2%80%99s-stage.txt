“CITF 2017 drama performances will commence on April 4 and continue till April 9 at the British School in Colombo each day at 7pm. The maiden performance will be Lucian Bulathsinhala’s popular stage drama Tharawo Igilethi.

The third segment, Colombo Theater Forum aka International Directors Conference will take place from April 5 to 7 at the German Cultural Centre aka Goethe-Institut.

Seasoned actor and scholar Saumya Liyanage said in many countries international drama fests are held for the benefit of art lovers and artistes. He said though these fests are not glamorous ones, they enhance knowledge and appreciative capacity of people.
“CITF is an inter-cultural event that cuts across socio-political and cultural spheres in the global context. We have resourceful people who volunteered to support this endeavour. However finances have been a challenge from the inception. We welcome sponsors who like to invest on a noble venture”, said Liyanage.
Thespian Lucian Bulathsinhala paid his gratitude to M Safeer and his team for sustaining the momentum and credibility of CITF.
“Art doesn’t confine to any race, religion or doctrine. Artistes are people who love humankind. CITF sheds light on a global context of Art”, said the thespian.
Countries participating at the Colombo International Theatre Festival 2017 are; Sri Lanka, Germany, Sweden-France, India Pune, India – Assam and Belarus.
Comedy of Errors
Veteran playwright, lyricist and actor Lucian Bulathsinhala’s Tharawo Igilethi is an adaptation based on a Roman Play named, ‘The Brothers Menaechmi’ By Plautus (BC.254-184) who is acclaimed as the father of European Comedy.
The Brothers Menaechmi has influenced Shakespeare to create his play ‘Comedy of Errors’.
Tharawo Igilethi is so popular among the masses throughout since its premier in 1981 as a ‘Semi Musical’ with music scores rendered by late Visharada Gunadasa Kapuge.
