Many dogs left vaccine free

Sri Lanka has a canine population of nearly two million. Only 50 percent are immunised. It is targeted to reach at least 70 percent shortly, said Animal Production and Health Department Director General D. R. T. G. Ratnayake.
He was addressing a press conference at the Gannoruwa Institute of Continuous Education Auditorium to mark World Hydrophobia Day.
He said nearly 70,000 people succumb to hydrophobia every year throughout the world. The disease is rampant in countries in the SAARC region.
India records nearly 20,000 deaths annually, he said.
Ratnayake said Sri Lanka has been able to restrict the annual hydrophobia deaths to around 20. It is hoped to eliminate the disease by 2020. He said the government spent Rs. 500 million annually to control the spread of hydrophobia.
Nearly Rs. 400 million was spent for the vaccination of people bitten by dogs.
