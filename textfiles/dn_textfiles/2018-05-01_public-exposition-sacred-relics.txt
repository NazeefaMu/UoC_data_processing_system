Public exposition of sacred relics

Large crowds thronged ‘Temple Trees’ yesterday to pay homage at the public Exposition of the Sacred Bone Relics of The Buddha brought from India and Pakistan, after a special ceremony attended by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Buddhist artifacts brought from Nepal, Bhutan and relics from Sri Lanka too are on display. Picture by Hirantha Gunetilake
