Shortage of 2018 school textbooks - CTU

A severe shortage of text books is visible for 2018 with only 28,210,600 text books were printed, while the total requirement is at 41,189,027, the Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) said.
The CTU issuing a press release stated that the teachers too are affected by the situation as the number of textbooks needed for the teachers has not been included in the printed textbooks.
“Of the 28,210,600 books printed, the students from Grades 1 to 4 need 8,802,100 books, while students of Grade 9 need 6,432,000 and 2,630,000 workbooks must be compulsorily printed. But only a small number of the requireent is printed,” the press release stated.
The statement further stated that printing a lesser number of textbooks on the basis of re-use is problematic when Rs 4,385 million is allocated from the budget for textbook printing. The announcement also stated that calling for tenders of the Educational Publications Department for reprinting 2018 textbooks in January is a joke.
