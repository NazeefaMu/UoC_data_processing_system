Growing ‘rewards’!

Many of us like to eat fruits because of their health benefits. However we do not give much thought to how these fruits are planted. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Director's Office of Agriculture Ratmalana, Subject Matter Officer (Fruit Cultivation) Chitrani Menikge on the stage where fruits are planted.
“First of all we must select an appropriate area and prepare the soil. A good drainage system is vital as we need to protect against soil erosion, using specific methods like creating drains. Soil erosion affects the roots damaging it and sweeping away the compost. There also must be appropriate spacing between the plants. It must be done in a certain way where the branches will not come into contact with each other. The ideal spacing should be 8m- 10m or 10m - 10m. After this we dig the pit,” said Menikge.
If the spacing is 10m - 10m (Rambutan and Mango), then you can grow 100 trees in a hectare. If it is 8m - 10m, then you can grow 125 trees in one hectare.
“We must also clear the ground of weeds. If the soil is good then the height and width of the hole must be 60cm - 60cm. If the soil has a clay like nature then the height and width of the hole needs to be 90cm - 90cm. This is because for proper healthy growth, you need soft soil. This is for the development of the roots. Two weeks before planting the hole must be filled with a mixture of Compost and Top Soil,” stated Menikge.
Process

When digging the hole, we must dig up the top soil and place it separately. Then we must dig up the ground soil and place it separately. Then we mix the compost and top soil and fill the hole. Then after two weeks, we plant.
“When we choose the plant that needs to be planted, we choose a budded plant. This is because it yields a bigger and faster harvest that seedling plants. The harvest comes in three years. You can get exactly the same variety that you want. Two days before planting, we need to apply chemical fertilizer. This is also mixed into the soil,” pointed out Menikge
However prior to all of this we have prepared the budded plant. We fill a polythene bag with compost and top soil, and plant the seeds there. After it grows it is put through the budding process. So we have the budded plant in the polythene bag. “Then what we do is, we remove a section of the hole (that we have filled in with compost, top soil and chemical fertilizer) which is the size of the polythene bag. After that we remove the polythene bag and place the soil mound (containing the budded plant) in that hole,” explained Menikge.
Shade
After planting we introduce a supporter into the hole - a piece of wood, and tie the plant to that piece of wood. Then we administer the required amount of water. As soon as it is planted it needs shade. The shade must be given for at least six months.
“If the soil mixture is good, there will be a good development of roots. This is especially important when it comes to secondary roots. If the secondary roots have developed well, then you will see leaves coming. That is why the soil needs to be soft and not hard and clay like. Leaves are a good indication of good root development. If the soil is too hard you won't see leaves. Also the roots need proper nutrients - Water and Compost. Too much water is bad and too little water is also bad. Irrigation and good drainage is important. If there is too much water and the clay like quality is there, then there won't be proper air for the roots,” elucidated Menikge
The secondary roots absorb the water and nutrients. In the Wet Zone, fruit planting is done in April and May. In the intermediate zone it is in October to November.
“When growing in home gardens, the growing area must be a little distance from the house and the wall. When the plant is growing you need to apply more compost. You need a boundary here. The boundary where the compost and chemical fertilizer is applied is marked by the edge of the branches. In that way the secondary roots which are branched out will receive the nutrients. The soil is loosened and compost is applied. Of course in the Rambutan trees, the roots are near the surface, so in that case the soil does not need to be loosened too much. Of course the loosening of the soil takes place 35cm away from the plant, forming a sort of inner perimeter where the compost is applied,” explained Menikge.
When the leaves appear we know that the plant is well fixed to the ground and that the roots have developed. Compost is applied to the boundary in four months, and every four months till harvest. After the harvest, the amount of compost needs to be changed.
Budding
Budding is yet another propagation technique where a bud is excised from a mother plant and used as the scion material. When a leaf falls after maturity there is a scar. That is the bud or a growing point. It can develop as a branch. A part of the bark of the stock plant is removed and the selected vegetative bud along with a patch of bark from the scion plant is inserted onto the stock plant. The graft is further tied to keep the bud in place and maintained till the union takes place. After the union is ensured, the portion of the stock above the bud union is removed and the sprouts from the scion bud are encouraged to grow further.
