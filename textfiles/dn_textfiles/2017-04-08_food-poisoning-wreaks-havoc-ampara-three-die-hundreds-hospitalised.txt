Food poisoning wreaks havoc in Ampara: Three die, hundreds hospitalised

Over 800 people including children were admitted to the Irakkamam Government Hospital for food poisoning on April 5 and three of them died.
A large number of patients undergoing treatment at the Irakkaman Hospital with minimum facilities.
They had been poisoned by consuming a food item distributed among them when they were attending a religious event at the Mohideen Jummah Mosque at Vanagamuwa in the Irakkamam DS division in the Ampara district on Wednesday.
Several the affected were discharged the following day.
Many were transferred to the Ampara General Hospital, the Akkaraipattu Base Hospital and other nearby hospitals for further treatment since Irakkamam Hospital lacks even minimum facilities. The hospital had only 11 beds, Irakkamam Hospital sources said.
Eastern Province Health Minister A.L.M. Nazeer visited the Irakkamam Hospital and spoke to the patients.
He also inquired about the shortcomings of the hospital. Police investigations are continuing.
