GMOA Strike Under Fire On Social Media

As the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) strike was underway, Facebook and Twitter erupted in argument over the legitimacy of the trade union action. While some argued that trade union action was part of a healthy, functioning democracy, the majority were of the authoritarian opinion that trade union action of this kind must be forcibly stopped.
Those that observed trade union action were a function of democracy opined the trade union action was merely the ‘downside of democracy – the right to freedom of expression,’ but others argued the ‘armed forces should be deployed to carry out essential services’ as this was the order of the day ‘some years back’ and ‘should it not be followed now?’
Adding fuel to fire were reports that prominent doctors affiliated with the GMOA were in fact not on strike at private hospitals. The guise with which they played their purported double game was swiftly uncovered when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake made an appointment with GMOA Chairman Dr. Anurudda Padeniya at the Nawaloka Hospital, proving the doctors' strike was political not practical.
Adherents of social media were quick to point out it was the ‘poor man’ that was affected by the GMOA strike, not ‘patients with means.’ There were those that said the GMOA ‘ought to be punished,’ and that ‘hypocrisy’ of the GMOA must be uncovered. Others wondered aloud why transport trade unions had joined with the GMOA’s cause while still others did as Cicero did and lamented the times: ‘O tempora o mores’.
Meanwhile certain fuel stations decided to join in on the trade union action by refusing to fill up vehicles owned by doctors on strike. Displaying prominently signboards that said they would not service striking doctors, the fuel attendants turned away vehicles bearing doctors insignia, much to social media's congratulation for dealing the doctors with a taste of their own medicine.
The Government Medical Officers' Association is protesting the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). The issue is a long-standing one, and although the government offered solution last month in the form of a private-public partnership, the GMOA remain adamant they want the private institute shut.
The token strike yesterday is a precursor to a much larger strike threatened by the GMOA. Over a 100 trade unions are reported to have joined with the GMOA's token strike yesterday, and several more have promised to join hands with the Association to conduct continued strikes until the government relents.
