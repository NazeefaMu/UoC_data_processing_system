‘Lanka could be among  top four ICT destinations’

India has made tremendous progress and is ranked among the top four ICT destinations in the world. Sri Lanka with high literacy rate and high use of internet too could come into that position, said Ravi Shankar Prasad Minister of Law and Justice and Electronics and Information Technology of India.
The minister said that today India has very high data usage and will soon introduce new laws to protect its users. “I see data as the next crude oil deposit which will bring in high investments to any country and we are keen to share the Indian success with Sri Lanka,” he said.
The minister said today out of the 1.3 billion total Indian population close to 1.2 billion people use mobiles. Out of this 400 million have smart phones. The Minister also said that four years ago there was only one mobile manufacturing factory in India. “However today the number of mobile manufacturing plants has increased to 108,” he said.
Minister of Telecom and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said that Sri Lanka too is making fast progress in the ICT and mobile sector and was the first country in the SAARC region to have introduced mobile phones. “We were also the first to introduce 3G, 4G and 5G too is now being tested in Sri Lanka.” However the Minister said that there is lot of red tape to implement more public sector based ICT initiatives.
