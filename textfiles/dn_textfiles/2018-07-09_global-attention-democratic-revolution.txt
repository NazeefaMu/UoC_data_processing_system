Global attention to the democratic revolution

“It is good to note that the real conspiracy is between Trump supporters and the Sinhala racists who want Lanka off the global HR agenda. However, we should not forget that one of the earliest pledges with the presidential victory was to get the UN resolution thrown away with Trump's help. Unfortunately, left-leaning governments in the UNHRC either opposed or non-committal to the resolution. Although our faith in the global working class forces pushing for justice, no movement is evident. At least, I haven’t seen having it in their international agenda and I believe it is upon us to get the global attention it needs”, said my friend who has doubts about our democratic revolution. What he said is proved by cries made by former Minister Vijayakala.
At the bottom of his mail, there was a note from a speech by Sambanthan at the launch of a book named ‘A Judge Speaks’ by Wigneswaran. My friend thought this gives an idea of how the government is working on Tamil issues. The implied message is that even the Mahinda regime was compelled to look at Tamil demands when the armed struggle was live!
As for the OMP, the militant mothers in the north are boycotting. The clear and concrete demand is for the OMP to get the release of at least a 100 so that they can have trust in its intentions. In addition, apparently, the President has appointed a 48-member Task Force for the north without consulting TNA. Apart from many Sinhala ministers, it has tri forces commanders and police chief. “This is a blatant effort to bring the north under the central government once its term lapses instead of devolving power.” When considering these developments, obviously it would be better to have a more critical approach to the government’s action on the Tamil issue, than applauding its cosmetic manoeuvring.
The global powers helped the Lankan regime to destroy an armed movement for the liberation of the oppressed Tamil people. Thus the Liberation Tigers were overcome and destroyed completely. The Lankan government at that stage gave a promise to the international powers to give a just political solution to the problem. Not only that; during the time where LTTE was active, the government gave various proposals for a political solution. Today the Yahapalanaya and the parliament, due to pressure or undue fear are reluctant to offer anything. This no doubt, goes to the consideration of the international; international community pressed by progressive movements understands its responsibility.
UN resolution on Lanka
Many civil organisations and human rights campaigners believe that it is necessary for the government to fulfil the commitments it made in the UN resolution on Lanka. However, the pro-Mahinda politicians including some left organisations condemned this resolution as an act of imperialist subjugation. So-called patriots have been in the forefront of agitation against this resolution claiming that is an attempt to strengthen the conspiracy for the division of the country.
They deny that there is or were any national discrimination in Lanka. Further, they claim the Tamil liberation is an American supported military action to divide the country and strengthen the American interest in the Indian Ocean. This opinion is challenged by the democratic movement that helped to overthrow the fascistic Mahinda regime. This democracy accepts these commitments are ones that need to be kept whether or not the government has international commitments or not; because these were national commitments spelt out by Democracy. These are for the release of civilian land held by the military, release of prisoners held without charge for years, demilitarization, removal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and establishing a truth-seeking and accountability mechanism to investigate and prosecute violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law.
The recently announced release of yet another hundred acres of land by the military in the North to the civilian population is a message that the process of land returns is continuing. This is complemented by the government’s decision to build a further 50,000 houses in the North for those who were affected by the war.
This should be done whether the affected are LTTE suspects or not. Suspects are suspects under PTA; their family members not even suspects. Hence any discrimination based on PTA investigation should be prevented. In spite of such lapses, the government has been providing livelihood assistance to war victims, rehabilitating ex-LTTE cadres, and has recently passed a law that criminalizes enforced disappearances, set up an Office of Missing Persons, and is in the process of establishing an Office of Reparations. These were done with UN assistance and UNHRC supervision.
It is necessary for the government to seek to implement the remaining commitments made in the UNHRC resolution, which include reducing the military presence in the former war zones of the north and east and engaging in constitutional reform that would devolve more power to those areas. The military should be confined to the camps and barracks as in other areas of the country.
Democracy and human rights campaign
Devolution of power should include land and police powers. These are necessary to bring about a lasting solution to the nationality conflict that has plagued the country since its independence and prevented it from developing as a united, democratic and strong nation. The government also needs to be more democratic, collective and with a single programme, in communicating the truths about the need for reform and for change to the larger population.
It is necessary to communicate so that they understand them to be part of the process of national integration and unification of nationalities in the country. This should be taken to the hearts and minds cleaning and eradicating racism and chauvinism in the aftermath of decades of war and conflict.
The US departure from the UNHRC exposes the fallacy spread by Sinhala racists that the US is behind the UN human rights campaign and it is the western conspiracy against the developing world. On the contrary, the US was against the democracy and human rights campaign continued by the left and workers movement in the developed world.
This act of Donald Trump may weaken that global institution, but the rise of the left and workers power will support Lanka’s commitment to ensure the protection of human rights and achieve reconciliation within our own country. Clearly, this is for the good of all Lankan people and certainly, not in any way giving in to the international powers.
The US action should not be seen as leading to a lessening of international attention on Lanka. On the other hand, we must defeat racist who sees this as an opportunity for either this government or future governments to evade engaging in the reforms that would bring a political solution to the national problem and make national reconciliation a reality.
