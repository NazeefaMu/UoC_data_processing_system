Tense situation at Chilaw Hospital :
Three infants and mother die during delivery

A tense situation arose at the Chilaw Hospital following the death of three infants at birth and a mother during delivery in the last 10 days.
Acting Hospital Director Dr. L Poddalagoda, who has assumed duties only a month ago, said that the deaths were unusual incidents. Rasika Jeevani (35) and her child died in delivery.
Thereafter on November 4, 21-year-old Tania Kalhari’s baby girl died at birth. On November 5, 30-year-old Periyandi Wadani’s daughter died at birth. Rasika’s husband Aruna Priyabnga said his wife was in good health when she was admitted on October 24. He said his wife had signed on the bed ticket requesting a Cesarean operation.
But the hospital authorities said Rasika died during normal delivery and denied that she requested an operation.
He asked for proper investigation into the deaths.
At the inquest into the death of Tania Kalhari’s infant, the cause of death was recorded as mother’s acute diabetic condition.
Tania’s mother said hospital authorities should take responsibility for the baby’s death.
The body of Periandi Wadani’s child was interred at the Chilaw Cemetery without a post mortem examination as requested by the parents.
