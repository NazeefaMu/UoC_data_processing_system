Golmaal Again to weave its magic in cinemas

From the time it was announced, Rohit Shetty’s ‘Golmaal Again’ has been one of the most awaited films of the year. And, the trailer of the movie, starring Ajay Devgn, Parineeti Chopra, Tabu, Tusshar, Arshad Warsi, Kunal Kemmu and Shreyas Talpade, has further upped anticipation by promising a joyride to cinegoers this Diwali.
Not surprisingly, advance bookings for the fourth instalment of the much-loved franchise started a month before its date with cinemas today.
Attributing the success of the previous films of the franchise to the audience, Rohit says, “People are familiar with the franchise and its characters; they have also loved ‘Golmaal Again’s trailer and promotional campaign.
The audience has made the franchise what it has become today. They’ve kept it alive on satellite television as well.”
The filmmaker adds, “Our attempt has been to go beyond the previous instalments, and give the audience something bigger, spookier and even magical. We’ve shot in new locations; also, there is a lot of grandeur along with a comic-book feel.”
Even as the team is upbeat about the response the trailer and promos have generated, the filmmaker admits that he experiences pre-release jitters. Rohit sums up saying, “We have to work hard on every film and give each one more than 100 per cent. We hope the audience will continue to shower their love on us and the franchise.”
