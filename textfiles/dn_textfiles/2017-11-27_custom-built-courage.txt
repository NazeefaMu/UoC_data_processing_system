Custom-built courage

Sri Lanka Customs, one of the oldest Customs administrations in the world, has a history of more than 200 years. Customs and its operations currently come under Finance and Mass Media Ministry. This department which brings in a huge portion of Government’s revenue is now headed by P S M Charles, the first ever woman to be the Director General of Customs. Prior to the appointment, Charles served as the Batticaloa Government Agent (GA).The appointment was made on the recommendation of the Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.
To make Sri Lanka Customs the place that delivers the best customs service in South Asia is the vision that she wants to achieve together with her supportive staff.
National efforts
“Sixty percent revenue of the government is collected by the Customs. Its ordinance is more than 200 years old. The mission of Sri Lanka Customs is to dedicate to enforce revenue and social protection laws of the State while facilitating the trade with the objective of contributing to the national efforts at large. I am assisted by five Additional Director Generals and there are over 2000 employees working for the department to help me achieve this massive task,” Charles said.
“Collection of revenue, prevention of revenue leakages and other frauds, facilitation of legitimate trade, the collection of import and export data to provide statistics, cooperation and coordination with other Government departments and stakeholders in respect of imports and exports are some of the functions of the Customs Department. Sri Lanka Customs is a member of the World Customs Organisation which has a membership of 177 countries. We are aiming to improve the systems at the department,” she added.
According to Charles, Sri Lanka is still lagging behind in some areas in trade facilitation. She said Customs is planning to implement Singapore Trade Concept to increase the revenue while protecting the nation. “We are working to improve the services we provide to be on a par with globalisation that is taking place. We will benchmark a few countries and increase trade facilitation. We have to identify and address the areas that need to be developed and facilitate more international trade,” she said.
She also pointed out that fighting against the circulation of drugs which is done using the path of transport and preventing any activity that involves terrorism are the main objectives of the department’s social protection service.
Values and norms
Charles, a Special Grade Officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, has 26 years of service in the public sector. She previously served as the Additional GA and the GA of Vavuniya. Born in the beautiful coastal village Ilavalai, Jaffna, Charles is the only child in her family. Her father being a Police Officer and mother being the Deputy Principal of a Government school, she grew up witnessing the service her parents rendered to the needy people.
“I was inspired mostly by my parents. My uncles were also in government service. This enkindled a passion in me to serve people. I grew up in a family that upholds values and norms. It shaped my life and today I have the opportunity to serve the people,” Charles said.
“This appointment opened up a new avenue for me. It is a very challenging job. I thank the President, Prime Minister, Finance and Mass Media Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers for placing their faith in me and handing over this greater responsibility. This is a male-dominated area. I am glad to be the first female to get this opportunity through which I can serve the country and its people. I am here because of the people around me. With this position they bestowed on me I will serve them back,” she said.
Charles added that she enjoys her work at the department though each day brings a new set of challenges for her. “My intention is to prove myself. Being a woman does not have to be a barrier to achieve top positions. Women in whatever position, whether in private or public sector, should not mix their family life with the career. Being a wife, mother, sister or a daughter is different. When you are a social worker working for a company or a department it is important to give priority to your responsibilities in office. At the same time, I think being a woman it is important to respect our culture and values without blindly following fashion and other trends in the society. Working genuinely and honestly for the people will one day reward you,” she added.
Vavuniya, the richest district
She points out that although Sri Lanka is full of resources, the failure of the people to commit themselves to the nation has hindered the country’s development. “When I was in Vavuniya, I handled a lot of responsibility. The experience gained in the government service laid a strong foundation for my career. I was in charge of the Menik farm during the conflict times, and I made arrangements of resettling around 300,000 internally displaced persons. I converted Vavuniya to the richest district declining poverty to 2.3 percent. When I took over the Batticaloa as its GA, the poverty level was at 20.4 percent. With several livelihood projects that I initiated poverty dropped down to 7.5 percent in 2016,” Charles said.
Among many projects she commenced empowering women financially takes the lead. “I invested a lot of money in livelihood development programmes especially for widows and woman-headed families. The youth leadership programmes were also given a prominent place. Even today the people of those districts talk to me with gratitude and it brings me immense joy to be a part of their accomplishment,” Charles said.
Charles is a graduate of the University of Jaffna and has also obtained two Masters Degrees from the Universities of Peradeniya and Rajarata in the fields of Disaster Management and Business Administration. Like every other woman, Charles derives her strengths morally and physically from her family. Her husband, who serves as the Assistant Director of the Agriculture Department, her children and her mother supports and encourages her to handle her responsibilities efficiently and finally to achieve goals of the nation.
“A woman educated or uneducated holds the family together. A woman has the capacity to make decisions for her family, protect the members and provide for them. If they are educated they have the ability to serve better the country and their community,” she concluded.
