‘Ruthless’ Roy impresses Root

Cardiff, Friday: Joe Root has praised the “ruthlessness” and “clarity” shown by fellow England batsman Jason Roy following the Surrey star’s century-making exploits in the ongoing one-day international series against Sri Lanka.
Roy made 112 not out as he and opening partner Alex Hales (133 not out) seta new England ODI partnership record as they chased down a target of 155and saw the team to a 10-wicket win in the second ODI at Edgbaston.
And Roy then followed that up with a stunning knock of 162 off just 118balls at his Oval home ground on Wednesday as England got to a target of208 in a shade over 40 overs to win the fourth ODI by six wickets and sotake an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-match series. Born in South Africa, but brought up in Surrey, Roy fell for three in thetied series opener at Trent Bridge and was five not out when rain led to a no result in game three at Bristol.
But the series has seen him score 282 runs at an average of 141 and a strike rate of more than 122 heading into Saturday’s finale in Cardiff. AFP
