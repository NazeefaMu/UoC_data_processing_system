Damsel deciphered

The identical nature of all the portraits on the Sigiriya Mirror Wall led HCP Bell to believe that King Kassapa hired the services of one painter. That conclusion came to be a matter of dispute among local scholars including Professor Senarat Paranavitana. If we are to accept Bell’s opinion, Professor Paranavitana warns, it means that King Kassapa had used the rock cavity as a portrait gallery of the queens and princesses of his court.
According to Dr Raja de Silva, a former Archaeological Commissioner, the king commissioned a master artiste to paint innumerable females of a specified class in a certain coherent understandable theme and would have set about his work accordingly. When the stage was set for the actual painting process, the master painter and his atelier would have commenced work high up on scaffoldings erected by the prepared surface of the great rock.

The Sigiriya paintings, 19 in all preserved in two caves on the western rock face, were discovered over a century ago. The paintings are almost identical with women carrying flowers. If these women turned out to be court ladies for Bell, they were mere celestial nymphs for Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy.
In John Still’s words, the whole face of the hill appears to have been a gigantic picture gallery... the largest picture in the world perhaps. The paintings that cover an area 140 metres long and 40 metres high are referred to in the graffiti. Professor Senarat Paranavitana deciphered 685 graffiti in 1956.
Deciphering the ancient text is a tough job. It explains why no one dared to resume Paranavitana’s job. Not until Benille Priyanka undertook the job for his doctoral research in 2002. Dr Benille Priyanka has deciphered 400 new graffiti in addition to the Paranavitana collection.
Dr Priyanka received his MSc in Archaeology from the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology, the University of Kelaniya in 1992. He obtained the MA Degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures from the University of California, Los Angeles, specialising in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian Languages and Civilisations. He read for the PhD at the same University. In 2002, he was awarded the esteemed Chancellor’s Award for Postdoctoral Research in 2002 for his research on the hitherto undeciphered script of the Indus Valley Civilisation.
Dr Benille Priyanka’s attempt is to introduce new archaeological evidence for parallels of Sigiriya paintings – in its subject matter and motifs – from different regions of Asia. His observation is that these parallels hold a secular nature. Although he agrees with the conclusion that the Sigiriya damsels are court ladies, Dr Priyanka maintains that the same figures were drawn on the western rock face to portray them as celestial nymphs. Dr S U Deraniyagala, former Director General of Archaeology Department, identifies Dr Priyanka’s observations as thought-provoking. They compel the reader to look beyond the seas and re-think their perceptions on Sigiriya, Dr Deraniyagala notes.
“I wanted to introduce new archaeological evidence which appears to be close to the subject matter of the Sigiriya paintings. This evidence comes from Persia, Siberia (Central Asia), Afghanistan, Northwest India and Sri Lanka covering a wide area of Asia. Much of this evidence is older than the Sigiriya Period (5th Century AD). It goes on to suggest that subject matter parallel to Sigiriya paintings have been popular in a wide area of Asia much before Sigiriya,” Dr Priyanka notes.
Apparently, Sigiriya is a gigantic creation which has attracted a number of international artistic and architectural elements. Dr Priyanka has published two works, one slim and the other voluminous, to present these ideas. The two publications are titled ‘Meanings of the Sigiriya Paintings: Based on Recent Archaeological Evidence’ and ‘Recently Deciphered Records from the Mirror Wall at Sigiriya’.
“I noticed this new evidence for the first time in 1998 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) while I was researching for my PhD in archaeology. This evidence was contained in a number of journals and books. Some of these publications may not be easily available in Sri Lanka. This new evidence I hope will be helpful to get a better understanding of Sigiriya and its renowned paintings,” Dr Priyanka adds.
With the permission from Archaeology Department, Dr Priyanka has included the 19 surviving paintings of Sigiriya in his publication.

The theory put forward by Dr Senarat Paranavitana is that King Kashyapa built Sigiriya to resemble the Alakamanda of Kuvera (Paranavitana 1961: 387). According to Hindu and Buddhist literature, Kuvera is the god of wealth. His abode Alakamanda was on the summit of Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. The heavenly abode Alakmanda in the sky is surrounded by lightning (vijju) and clouds (megha). So after a lengthy discussion of the paintings, Paranavitana proposed that the golden coloured damsels painted on the Sigiriya rock are symbolic of lightning (vijju), and the dark coloured damsels are symbolic of clouds (megha) surrounding the Alakamanda of god Kuvera.
These different points of view have contributed to the debate on the meaning and symbolism of the Sigiriya paintings. Both Paranavitana and Coomaraswamy have depended on literary evidence from Hindu and Buddhist literature for their theories on the Sigiriya paintings but not considered the archaeological evidence adequately on the subject.
Some archaeological evidence I have recently observed regarding the Sigiriya paintings appear to be helpful to provide a more pragmatic interpretation of the meaning of these damsels. This evidence concerns two main themes occurring damsel holding flowers in her hands accompanied by a handmaid.
The above-mentioned archaeological evidence is found from Persia ca 5th Century BC, Siberia in Central Asia ca 4th Century AD and different regions from northwest India ca 3rd – 4th centuries AD. These areas are a part of a substantially large region of Asia. There is also one example from Sri Lanka found in a village named Kuttapitiya in the Palmadulla area (Ratnapura District). It is a carnelian intaglio found from a gem pit, dated to the 4th Century AD. It is also about 100 years older than the Sigiriya paintings. - Sigiriya paintings
