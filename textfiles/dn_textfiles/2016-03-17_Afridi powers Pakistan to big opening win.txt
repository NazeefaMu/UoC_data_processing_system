Afridi powers Pakistan to big opening win

Kolkata, Wednesday: Skipper Shahid Afridi starred with bat and ball as he powered Pakistan to a comprehensive 55-run victory against Bangladesh in his team's opening match of the World Twenty20 in Kolkata on Wednesday. Afridi's blistering 19-ball 49 helped Pakistan post a commanding total of 201 for five and his two-wicket haul was instrumental in restricting Bangladesh to 146 for six from their 20 overs.
"Boom Boom" Afridi, whose batting form had fallen away in recent months, rose to the occasion after promoting himself to number four in the order.
The skipper smacked four boundaries and four sixes to help Pakistan register their second highest score in T20 internationals. Their highest total is 203 against the same opposition in 2009.
Opting to bat after winning the toss, Pakistani top-order batsmen Ahmed Shehzad (52) and Mohammad Hafeez (64) hit entertaining fifties to stitch a 95-run second wicket partnership and lay a solid foundation for others to build on.
The duo combined the right dose of caution and aggression to blunt the Bangladesh bowling attack, with the Tigers' captain Mashrafe Mortaza unable to stem the tide in the absence of injured bowler Mustafizur Rahman.
Shehzad, who was recalled after missing the recent Asia Cup, reached his fifth T20 international half-century in 35 deliveries. Hafeez was not far behind as the former skipper, who posted his ninth T20I fifty, struck seven fours and two sixes in his 42-ball stay.
The only bright spot for Bangladesh was a moment of brilliance in the field when Soumya Sarkar took a breathtaking catch on the boundary rope to bring an end to Hafeez's innings.
Bangladesh were never really in the hunt and their innings got off to a dreadful start when opener Soumya Sarkar was bowled by Mohammad Amir with only the third ball.
The in-form Tamim Iqbal and Sabbir Rahman put on 43 for the second wicket, but they both fell victim to Afridi and Bangladesh's chase fell away.
