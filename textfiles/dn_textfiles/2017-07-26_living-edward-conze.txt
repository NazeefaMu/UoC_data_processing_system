Living with Edward Conze

As far back as 1969, I remember the moment when I met a certain BBC World Service Producer who came to see me. I still remember what she told me.
“Dr Edward Conze has come all the way from Washington to launch his latest on Buddhist studies. If you wish to see him and participate in one of our radio programmes, this may be a good chance that you should not miss.”
As I was listening, I was wondering who Edward Conze is. But I faintly remembered his first work, titled as ‘Buddhism’ published in 1951.
Entire life
Although I was not inclined to participate in any of the programmes, I wished to see what was happening as scheduled by the BBC World Service when my friend left me leaving the invitation extended to me, I went on doing the necessary homework about the German writer Edward Conze, who seemed to have dedicated his entire life to Buddhist studies gaining a PhD from the University of Cologne in 1928. Since gaining such qualifications, he proceeded to study Indian and European Comparative philosophy at the Universities of Bonn and Hamburg.
Having left Germany, he held several university positions as a lecturer and researcher in Buddhist Studies. The work authored by Dr Conze, which is with me now, is titled as Buddhist Scriptures, compiled in 1959. His other works include ‘Buddhist Wisdom Books’ (1958), ‘Buddhist Thought in India’ (1962) and ‘Thirty Years of Buddhist Studies’ (1967). The launch on the part of the BBC World Service marked the occasion as menti
oned above. Dr Conze was speaking generally about Buddhist studies and its significance.
I think this is a notable contribution from a German-born English researcher, devoting several salient factors of resourceful insights. At the outset, he does not attempt to demarcate the Buddhist teachings into country-based sectors. Instead, he initially classifies the standpoint of the Buddha as a teacher. He attempts to trace the important factors that lead him in search of the truth of the existence and what he revealed as his own findings as different from other teachers.
He tries to compare the textual material as well as the material drawn from word of mouth as passed down the centuries as Buddhist myth and legend. From this point onwards, the scholar enters the aspects of mindfulness, where the moment of illumination happens to be the aspects of meditation. He uses the term ‘secluded meditation’ as a means of perceiving oneself cut off from external disturbances, which make a person involve in outer activities. He points us to the practice of introversion. This is followed by the progressive steps of secluded meditation.
Simpler interpretation
Though the subject of secluded meditation had been an area in discussion in various other religions, the work ‘Buddhist Scriptures’ deals perhaps for the first time, the benefits of the same in simpler interpretation. Conze states how meditation makes the thoughts one-pointed and softens the mind. Then he deals on how the same procedure when cultivated, generates gladness or delight, makes one venerable, makes one worthy of homage etc.
In this manner, Conze underlines 28 advantages of meditation. His main source of information is cited as the dialogues that ensued between the King Milinda and Venerable Nagasena Thera as cited in Milinda Panha, a Pali text. The material for the source has been culled from the original texts like Paticcha Samuppada and other Suttas. As Conze states, meditation differs from ordinary behaviour. It implies a withdrawal from all outward activities and objects, which he denotes as an extreme introversion, which is held to open up a new world of reality beyond the ordinary pattern.
Dealing with various facets of the concept of Zen, Conze states that it could be regarded as a form of teaching meditation. Zen stems from the Sanskrit term ‘dhyana’ or the deep form of concentration, which is also a form f meditation. Sitting in meditation according to Zen teachings I named Za-Zen. Defining the term, the Zen masters have pointed out that it is outwardly to be in the world of good and evil, yet with no thought arising in the heart. As such, this is sitting (Za), inwardly to see one’s own nature and not move from it. This is meditation (Zen).
Conze too emphasises the need on the part of creative artiste to be meditators in order to achieve the highest form of a creative process. He cites one example of the painter known as Tanyu, whose work exists even today at the Myoshin Temple. This is the story of the time when he painted the great dragon on the ceiling f the main hall of the temple, the dragon which was his masterpiece and today is one of the art treasures of the world. At that time it is said that the Master of the Myoshin Temple was the celebrated Zen Master, Gudo, famous as the teacher of the emperor.
Dragon’s tail
The emperor had heard that the painter Tanyo had drawn dragons were so realistic that when a ceiling on which one had been painted fell down by chance, some said it had been caused by the movement of the dragon’s tail. Proceeding from Zen, Conze comes to the area of wisdom (pragna). It is termed by Conze as the crown of all Buddhist endeavours. It is an attempt to penetrate to the actual reality of things as they are in themselves. Once again in the context, the questions of King Milinda are cited.
In order to elucidate the teachings pertaining to wisdom, several Buddhist sources both from the Theravada and Mahayana are quoted. Samyutta Nikaya, the Heart and Diamond Suttas are traced. In his work on ‘Buddhist Scriptures’, Dr Conze makes references to other fellow scholars such as D T Suzuki, Christmas Humphreys and Rhys Davids. The references are made to illuminate certain areas of the Buddhist teaching formulae such as faith, vigour, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom and the illusory nature of the world.
Professor Edward Conze left a whole legacy of Buddhist vision for the posterity summing up his work on such as areas as birth, suffering, mindfulness, rebirth, karma and the possible birth of future Buddhas. Wherever possible, he uses versification of Pali stanzas. The glossary of technical terms as enveloped in the work enhances a reader to find more meanings alluded in the text.
