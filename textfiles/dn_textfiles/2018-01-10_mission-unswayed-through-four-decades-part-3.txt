A mission unswayed through four decades-Part 3

We conclude our series on the Mahaweli Development Project with an interview with Nanda Abeywickrama, who functioned as Secretary, Ministry of Lands and Lands Development, from 1978-88 and was closely associated with the original Mahaweli plan from his days in the Agriculture Ministry in the 1970s.
Abeywickrama’s direct involvement with the Accelerated Mahaweli Programme (AMP) started with his appointment to the Mahaweli Task Force soon after his return from post graduate studies in Land Policy at the University of Cambridge, UK, in September 1977. The Task Force developed the initial strategy for the AMP and was regularly reviewed by President J.R. Jayewardene.
The twin Ministries of Lands and Land Development (MLLD) which would oversee overall policy of Mahaweli Development (MD) which in turn would oversee AMP operations under one Minister, the late Gamini Dissanayake, were created in September 1978, followed by the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) in 1979.
The following are excerpts of an interview conducted with Abeywickrama via email:
Q. How did you balance the environmental and developmental needs of the Project?
This is a very interesting question. When the government that came to power in 1977 focused on the Mahaweli as a Lead Project and conceptualized the AMP, environmental concerns were not uppermost in the minds of development planners in Sri Lanka, the priority being infrastructure development which was the urgency of the hour.
The Mahaweli Master Plan developed by UN FAO in the 1960s envisaged a step-wise implementation over a 30-year time frame for the provision of irrigation facilities for 362,000Ha and settlement of an equal number of peasant families in addition to generating 560MW of power.
The 1977 government made a bold political decision to accelerate the project to complete four major power/irrigation dams (Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala and Maduru Oya) and several other reservoirs, to irrigate 158.800Ha in systems A, B, C, D and G and another 23,600Ha in System H, making a total of 182,400Ha in six years.
There were many challenges as well as imponderables in the fields of engineering and power generation and in human settlement since there were many options to be considered and choices to be made.
The main reason that prompted the President to appoint me as Secretary, MLLD, apart from my knowledge and experience in Land Policy and Settlement and my seniority in the SLAS, I believe, was my post-graduate training in Agricultural Planning at FAO in Rome and in Land Policy and Economy at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I got a good grounding in environmental issues confronting major development projects as well. Hence AMP was a real-life professional challenge for me - to balance the country’s development and environmental goals.
While the AMP framework was on the drawing boards and initial fieldwork underway, the government, in response to environmental concerns expressed in different quarters, commissioned an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the AMP, the first such major initiative in Sri Lanka, with assistance from USAID.
The team was made up of Tippets-Abbot-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS). This team, following an exhaustive survey, submitted a report to government in 1980, now called the TAMS Report, taking the entire Mahaweli basin as a single unit (not by projects).
Project impacts relevant to surrounding areas and to the upstream watershed were also considered. The TAMS Report recommended some far-reaching changes to the components and targets of the AMP already cleared by the government and the Mahaweli Task Force.
Soil conservation and agro-forestry in the upper catchment, protective planting of forests on hill tops and slopes, planting forests for fuel wood and timber, establishing wildlife reserves and natural parks with connecting corridors to retain high quality wild life and maintaining riverine forests on reservations of all waterways were some of the novel features recommended which had escaped the attention of the planners.
It also addressed an important issue: the potential shortage of fuel wood to meet the needs of future settlers, which would become critical after several years.
These recommendations necessitated the re-drawing of the land use plan; consequently the potential irrigable extent and, by extension, the number of settlers had to be revised downwards from an original 182,400 to around 125,000.
Although this was politically less attractive, the government complied with the recommendations in the interests of providing a more sustainable environment for the communities. It was estimated that the forestry programme under AMP had to cater to the needs of 250,000 families (1.5 million people) inclusive of the non-farm families. Over time, it was argued, that increase in off-farm economic activities would offset the reduction in the number of setter families.
The decision to conduct an EIA on the AMP at the very outset proved to be wise and beneficial. In the first place, some of the mistakes made in river basin projects like Gal Oya and Uda Walawe were avoided; secondly, forestry programmes executed in the catchment areas were a direct outcome of the AMP and reduced soil erosion and degradation and siltation of reservoirs.
The AMP, by its very magnitude and speed of execution, generated awareness and consciousness in taking the long-term effects of river basin development projects. The concern of both national and international groups was sharpened by these factors themselves. Hence it developed a self-propelling concern for adopting sound environmental practices.
The recommendations of the TAMS Report and its adoption came at a critical moment which enabled government and donor interest to be heightened to mobilize resources for development with conservation.
In discussing the potential conflict between development and environment, the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake, in his address at the Annual Sessions of the Institute of Architects in 1984 said, “We have seen this conflict surfacing at all levels and we have made a conscious effort to see that if one were to enter the Ring, as it were, in the perpetual conflict between exploitation and conservation, the government is not merely going to be an Umpire. The government is going to intervene on the side of conservation and preservation. That has been this Government’s commitment from 1977 up to now.”
There were other environment-related measures taken in the location and design of townships (off the high roads), allocation of premises for utilities and architecture of houses and shops, all of which were novel and forward looking.
“The ultimate purpose and effort of the enormous amount of capital invested in the Mahaweli Project is to provide a better life for over one million people, principally through agriculture. The dams and the tanks and the canals are the means to this end. The people who settle in these areas should not only earn more money, they should live in better houses, they should have better villages and better towns than where they came from. Finance, transport, marketing and many other considerations come together to create a better quality of life. And we want to give them enough space so that with the accumulation of capital and the development of a society on its own terms and according to its own rhythm, it will develop perhaps after another century and beyond. This process must necessarily take a long time,” said Minister Dissanayake.
Q . How well was the land policy designed by you implemented on the ground?
Although the AMP was implemented by MASL under the provisions of the MASL Act which enjoyed wide powers, precautions were taken to ensure that the land settlement policy was consistent with that prevailing at the national level and the regulations and guidelines of the Land Commissioner (LC) who is the national-level authority for the implementation of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO), which is the operative law for allocation of state land to settlers.
In the first place, the design of the settlements for irrigated land and the homesteads was based on field research conducted in Mahaweli System H during the 1970s with support from Sogreah, a French consulting firm. The new design was a cluster and turn out model, a departure from the previous ribbon type settlement along field canals which had proved to be less productive. This was consistently adopted in AMP. The accepted rules for maintaining road and canal reservations, community and commercial needs and village woodlots were religiously adhered to.
In the selection of settlers, AMP operated through the Land Commissioner’s Department and the government agents who adopted government-approved criteria for screening applicants for land on their potential ability to be good farmers. Since the applicants are selected at open public land ‘kachcheries’ in their own localities, there is little room for deviation from the approved criteria for there would be objections from competitors. The system though not foolproof, I would say, was sound and fair.
One deficiency I had observed in the selection process was that one could end up with a set of selectees who would not eventually make a cohesive community in the new environment. Although we had proposals for remedying these, the competition for land from landless was so intense that fine-tuning these concepts became impractical. As a remedy MASL had a strong team of community development officers to design and implement programmes to promote social cohesion. I would think they have been largely successful, subject of course, to the inherent shortcomings within any social milieu.
AMP, in the selection of settlers, went a step further and selected persons with other skills like masonry, carpentry, sports, etc., as well as entrepreneurs like small businessmen. AMP also catered to bigger investors who would venture into non-traditional farming systems which was the right thing to do.
Q: Looking back, do you believe that the land policies implemented then have been successful?
There is no ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to this question.
I would say that Mahaweli settlers were definitely more fortunate than settlers in other previous settlement schemes or peasants living in their own traditional villages in that immense state resources were invested on infrastructure provision for these people, especially in the initial years.
The magnitude of the project, the continued availability of resources and a heavy management input with some imaginative concepts like animal husbandry programmes, Mahaweli Games, secured competitions and so forth provided a kick start for the settlers. The settlers by and large enjoyed an assured supply of irrigation water for regular cultivation backed by a sophisticated Water Management Secretariat which orchestrated and monitored the bulk water allocation. This was a major asset. Additionally, there was constant attention from the Minister or perhaps even from the Head of State level to solve emerging problems faced by settlers.
About 20 years back, I visited System C with a Japanese research leader. Then we came across a number of enterprising farmers; one who was growing ornamental fish on part of his plot and making good money and another who had a permit to fish in the tank and supplement his family income.
On another visit, I met some women who were operating a very successful micro-credit scheme without retaining cash at home since their capital was always in circulation. In recent years, though we often see media reports about crop damage due to water shortages and flood damage. I am not sure whether they are genuine or distortions.
Q: Could you recall some of the significant moments during your term at the Ministry?
Well, in the first place, my entry into the AMP itself and appointment as Secretary, LLD is a significant memory.
Secondly, Minister Gamini Dissanayake’s portfolio was very big and the budget very high. In addition, he had other interests - in plantation trade unions, as President of the Cricket Board, Buddhist activities and so on. So, early on he told me that he wants to focus on wider politics and that I should run the Ministry. True to his word, he allowed me to select my professional team and allowed wide discretion providing excellent leadership at critical moments.
Minister Dissanayake always reminded us that his is an ‘outdoor Ministry’ and that senior staff should spend more time with people in the field. He always encouraged us to use helicopters to travel to far-flung districts since the road network was poor then.
Going back, as a member of the think tank I had a very interesting experience when NGP organised a ‘travelling seminar’ to brainstorm on the AMP strategy. We were a group of about 10 - NGP Panditharatne, Eng. Douglas Ladduwahetty, Mahi Wickramaratne, Dr Walter Abeygunawardana, Dr Melva Perera, Eng. Kirupa Rajaratnam, Dr Gamini Gunasekara, A D N Fernando, myself and one other, all packed into a Volkswagen micro- bus, started off early morning from Colombo on the AMP route via Kandy.
Before reaching Teldeniya, we witnessed the rock drilling operations for the Dam under way near the Victoria Falls; as we reached the plains we saw that work on Ulhitiya, the first reservoir planned under AMP, had already commenced. The dialogue on ‘how to and when to’ continued throughout. As we were a multi-disciplinary team, disagreements were many but everybody learnt from each other.
We reached the Eastern Province by sunset and continued discussions over drinks and dinner at the Irrigation Department Circuit bungalow at Vakarai. Over three days, we covered the entire eastern flank of the AMP, including the Maduru Oya dam where they had stumbled on the 1500 year old ancient sluice while setting out the dam axis for the new reservoir.
The travelling seminar was a tremendous success especially in overcoming disciplinary barriers and agency prejudices. We reached consensus on the direction and strategy to be submitted to government.
Q: What are your thoughts on having finally completed the Mahaweli Project?
I took early retirement in December 1988 to join the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI now IWMI) after 10 consecutive years as Secretary LLD. By that time, all the major dams had been completed and commissioned and settlers had moved into Systems B and C amidst severe constraints caused by JVP and LTTE disruptions; thus the initial phase was successfully completed along with many innovations especially in resettlement activities and community development. Mahaweli had acquired a brand name.
The credit for that should go to Minister Gamini Dissanayake who assembled a very talented multi-disciplinary team drawn from the public and private sectors and motivated them through a very imaginative and sophisticated management system drawn from real-life experiences. Staff morale and commitment was very high because the government responded swiftly whenever obstacles surfaced.
However AMP was not without its detractors. At the very outset, there was criticism that the acceleration was not feasible and that borrowing funds from international agencies was not in the national interest. However, in the event practically all assistance came either in the form of grants or as very concessionary soft loans. The entire AMP was completed within US$ 1 billion and mostly through foreign funding. That achievement would be unthinkable today.
The President and the Minister also dealt with public criticism very swiftly, as for example when LSSP leaders Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva expressed some concerns, the President and the Minister took them before the farmers in the field and resolved the issues. Similarly, opposition politicians, media personnel and other interested parties were invited to visit the work sites and shown around the work in progress.
Having said that, in the years that followed, it cannot be said that the same level of imaginative leadership prevailed. To illustrate, on completion of the initial dams and the downstream settlements, there was a need to review the management model.
Logically, there should have been a transition to a river basin organisation model as a regulatory body to plan and allocate the water among competing uses through sophisticated yet consultative mechanisms, while downstream management could have been merged with the adjacent major irrigated settlements by empowering the settlers to manage their affairs.
In this way, MASL costs could be reduced substantially. Furthermore, if an incentives regime for improved water use and agricultural productivity were introduced, there would be greater prosperity and innovation and cost sharing by the farmers.
Dependence of the local community on MASL could be reduced considerably if the land tenure system were liberalised and public-private partnerships were encouraged to optimize the use of the resources already developed. If such radical reforms are not introduced, the standard of living of the settlers will stagnate at a level ordained by the level of resources available from government. Public funds should be allocated for more urgent and productive sectors like technological innovations and R&D. MASL should not become another CGR or CTB. Minister Gamini Dissanayake (standing, extreme right) addressing cabinet to recommend the Accelerated Mahaweli Program in September 1977.
