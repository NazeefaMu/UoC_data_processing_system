England add Mark Wood to Lions squad for Lanka tour

Durham seamer Mark Wood and Northamptonshire left-arm spinner Graeme White have been added to the England Lions squad for the five-match one-day series against Sri Lanka A which begins in March.
Wood, currently in South Africa as part of England’s Pace Programme, will join the squad to further increase his workload after recuperation from ankle surgery last year and White has taken the place left open by the England selectors when they announced the squad in December.
Both players have already been included in the North squad for the three-match 50-over series against the South, that will be held in Dubai and Abu Dhabi after the Lions one-day series in Sri Lanka. James Whitaker, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) national selector, said: “We believe these selections will work well both for the Lions and for the players involved.
“We had always been planning to add a left-arm spinner to the 14 players we named last month for the one-day series, and Graeme White deserves this chance after his performances for Northamptonshire in county cricket last summer which had already earned him a place in the North team through the PCA’s [Professional Cricketers’ Association]
Most Valuable Player rankings.” After an injury hit year, it is the selection of Wood which is the most interesting for England. Capable of bowling in excess of 90mph and skilled at reverse swing, the Durham man will be a valuable weapon, if he remains fit, as England look ahead to the summer’s Champions Trophy at home and next winter’s Ashes.
“Mark Wood will also be a valuable addition to the Lions squad,” said Whitaker. “In his case, the one-day series in Sri Lanka is a good opportunity for him to start bowling again in competitive cricket before the North-South series and then the domestic 2017 season.” The England Lions, who will be led by Durham’s Keaton Jennings, begin the one-day series on March 2 in Dambulla. Before that, the Lions play two four-day matches against Sri Lanka A, the first of which begins on February 17 in Kandy.
