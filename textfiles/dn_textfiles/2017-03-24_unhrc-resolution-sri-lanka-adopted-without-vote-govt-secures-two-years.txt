UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka adopted without a vote: Govt secures two years to strengthen transitional justice process

The resolution on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council, submitted by US with Montenegro, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka was adopted yesterday without a vote in Geneva.
The passage of the resolution, A/HRC/34/L.1 titled ‘Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’ gives Sri Lanka two years to gain greater momentum and sustained progress on the transitional justice process, which will include establishing measures for seeking truth and justice. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Harsha De Silva thanked member states of the Council and the observer states of the UNHRC session for extending their support to adopt the resolution by consensus. “We thank the international community for their continued support.We thank them for placing their faith in our government, and our people, and for walking with us at our side, as we strive to establish ‘Sri Lankan Government-led processes’ with international assistance, engagement and support for the benefit of all our citizens, without discrimination,” said Dr De Silva.
Recalling that the government promised on January 8, 2015 to its people that it will engage and work with all stakeholders to uphold human rights, establish rule of law, end impunity, strengthen democracy and good governance, and create the stability and peace, Dr De Siva said the government look to the support of the international community and the UN Human Rights Commissioner in achieving this objective.
