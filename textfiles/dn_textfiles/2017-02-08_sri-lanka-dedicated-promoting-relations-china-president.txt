Sri Lanka dedicated to promoting relations with China: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said Sri Lanka is firmly dedicated to promoting its relations with China and that he believed on the basis of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, the Belt and Road Initiative will open up a new era for Sri Lanka-China cooperation. He said since the two countries established diplomatic relations 60 years ago, their ties have gained constant and sound development, which were later upgraded to a strategic partnership.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Sirisena on Tuesday exchanged congratulatory messages to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Sri Lanka.
Xi said he appreciates Sri Lanka for its active participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. “I am willing to work with you to consolidate political mutual trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and deepen people-to-people friendship between the two countries, so as to inject new vigor and vitality into the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership featuring sincere mutual assistance and enduring friendship.”
