Hyatt Project leased on annual rental of SL Rs. 10,000 for a period of 99 years: Finance Minister
The much controversial Hyatt Hotel Project case came under spotlight at yesterday’s Parliamentary session, when JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa posed a question regarding the lease basis, tender and consultancy services of the Hyatt Hotel project.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the total land with regard to the Hyatt Hotel project in Colpetty was given out on an annual nominal lease rental of Rs.10,000, being lawful money of Sri Lanka for a period of 99 years.
Questioned by MP Jayatissa as to who in the previous government forwarded a Cabinet Paper regarding the lease of land, Minister Karunanayake said, to his understanding, the Cabinet Paper in this regard was tabled by the former Finance Minister.
“The former Finance Minister aka former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tabled the Cabinet Paper regarding the lease.” Minister Karunanayake said.
MP Jayatissa too directed the attention of the House that it is only through an irregularity that a plot of land situated in the heart of Colombo be leased for such a small amount of lease fee, for such a long period of time.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake also said the FCID was currently looking into the large scale misappropriation and irregularities of funds and malpractices which allegedly had taken place in the construction of the Hyatt Hotel projects in Colpetty.
Minister Karunanayake alleged that Gamini Senarat, the former Chairman of M/s Canwill Holdings Ltd., that owns the Hyatt Hotel project, attempted to influence the operation of the project and tactically disturbed the ongoing investigations as well.
“Certain people in this project who are not in power, are still acting as if they were in power,” Minister Karunanayake alleged.
Minister Karunanayake also said that it was quite difficult to get the names behind the alleged malpractices to the surface. The procedure regarding this whole project is unspecified, he further said.
Minister Karunanayake also said the project had been used as a private property.
He also said, it has been very difficult to obtain the necessary documents, details and data which are relevant to the malpractice probe, due to these external influences. Karunanayake also pointed out that the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Hyatt Hotel project in Colpetty, had cost Rs.7 million.
“These are only the official data. If we speak on unofficial calculations, the cost amounts ten times that had been mentioned,” Minister Karunanayake said.
The Hyatt Hotel project is owned by M/s Canwill Holdings Ltd., which is a fully government owned public enterprise. 46% of its shares are held by Sri Lanka Insurance, while the rest is equally shared by the EPF, and the Litro Gas Company under the Finance Ministry each holding 27 percent of the shares.

Sooriyawewa Stadium construction costs left unsettled: COPE Chairman: No party willing to take responsibility
The construction cost of the Sooriyawewa Stadium had been left unsettled as no party was willing to accept its responsibility, Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said.
He made this observation while addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, to brief the latest COPE report on 15 public enterprises.
Handunnetti said the officials of both Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), shirked responsibility concerning payments for the costs incurred in the construction of the stadium when they were summoned before COPE.
“The interest of the amount to be settled was increasing day by day. This stadium has become a burden to the country’s economy. We would soon be in a position when we would not be in position to settle the debts from the funds earned by playing cricket. The SLC says that they did not ask for that stadium, while the SLPA which built it, says it does not need a stadium,” MP Handunnetti said.
“When COPE inquired, SLC officials said the initial estimation for the construction of the stadium was Rs 1.2 billion. Later on, the cost had increased to Rs 2.8 billion. Then again another bill of Rs 4.2 billion was forwarded to the Board of Control for Cricket for settlement. Construction of the stadium had been undertaken by the SLPA and later on it was submitted to the China Harbour by them. The SLC had at time taken a decision to develop and promote the stadium,” Handunnetti explained.
COPE observed that there was a failure to obtain the assistance of the Valuation Department to get a comprehensive valuation report with regard to the Sooriyawewa Stadium. A private company named KPMG had been assigned the task of carrying out the valuation.
SLC officials had informed COPE that the capital expenditure was indicated at Rs 5.4 billion at present even though it was indicated as Rs 4.2 billion three years ago.
GMOA members earn money by private practice, but oppose SAITM: Justice Minister
Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament, slammed the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) over its stance on the SAITM, while also exposing the hypocrisy behind those objections.
“The members of the GMOA make enormous amounts of money through private practice, but at the same time, they oppose the Malabe Private Medical College,” he said.
The minister was participating in the debate on Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act.
“I would wish to question those who shout concerning the standards of the private medical colleges as to why they do not show the same concern on the standards of government medical faculties. The GMOA calls the SAITM a degree selling shop, but who are those who teach at the SAITM? The very same doctors of the GMOA teach at the SAITM. There are some children of GMOA members studying in it. It is not the businessmen of the ‘Mariya Kade’ in Maradana who teach there at the SAITM, but senior doctors. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa continued to be the President of this country today, we may find GMOA officials acting like lapdogs and tamed kittens. It is the duty of the government to provide opportunities for higher education without limits,” the minister stated.
MP Sumanthiran’s security detail increased: Speaker Karu Jayasuriya
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, informed Parliament that the security detail of TNA MP M A Sumanthiran had been increased due to the security concerns faced by the MP.
The Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) recently, uncovered a plot to assassinate Jaffna District MP Sumanthiran. The Speaker making a special statement said he instructed the defence authorities to enhance the security of MP Sumanthiran.
The Speaker said he held discussions concerning this issue with several MPs including party leaders. “The latest situation was assessed before making the decision to call for additional security for the MP.
Several MPs have met me and forwarded this issue to me. I had discussed it with MP Sumanthiran too. Thereafter I informed the relevant security authorities to take measures to assure his safety and to increase the security detailed to him,” the Speaker told the House.
Minister Kiriella denies having advisors working under him
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella yesterday, denied having a long list of advisors operating under him who were attached to the Road Development Authority(RDA). The one year service period under which these advisors were recruited is already over, Kiriella pointed out.
“They no longer work under me. The appointments were only temporary,” he said.
The Leader of the House made these observations when his name was mentioned by Joint Opposition MP Udayashantha Gunasekara, during the oral answers session in Parliament regarding a question directed from Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
MP Udhayashantha questioned the Finance Minister on the number of coordinating secretaries, consultants and other staff that had been appointed to the Finance Minister’s staff.
Replying to the question raised, Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the number of coordinating secretaries, consultants and other staff was maintained at a minimum.
“There were only two coordinating secretaries, one consultant and fourteen other staff,” Minister Karunanayake said.
Questioned as to whether the Finance Ministry had any unofficial appointments as consultants or secretaries, Minister Karunanayake said such unofficial and unlawful appointments stopped after the last Presidential election.
“The Finance Ministry has taken nothing unlawfully or unofficially,” he said.
