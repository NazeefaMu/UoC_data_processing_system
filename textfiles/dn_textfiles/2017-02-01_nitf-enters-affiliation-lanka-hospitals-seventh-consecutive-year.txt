NITF enters into an affiliation  with Lanka Hospitals for  seventh consecutive year

Lanka Hospitals and the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) for the 7th consecutive year, entered into an affiliation offering government employees access to high quality private healthcare services at affordable costs.
All public sector employees are automatically entitled to NITF’s health insurance scheme titled Agrahara. The affiliation between the NITF and Lanka Hospitals will eventually make high expenditure private medical treatment like Heart bypass (CABG) and kidney surgery, hip and knee replacement surgeries more affordable to all public sector employees covered under this scheme.
Lanka Hospitals, in its 7th year into the affiliation with NITF, is the pioneer and the preferred hospital by Agrahara insurance policy holders in Sri Lanka.
