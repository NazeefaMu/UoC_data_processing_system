Forum to  rethink urban  solutions

#THEBIGSHIFT: Rethinking urban solutions for sustainability in Sri Lanka, a forum organized by the Sri Lanka Association of Australia Awards Alumni, will be held on October 24 from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm at Galle Face Hotel.
The forum will focus on the following SDGs: UN SDG 9 – Industry, innovation and infrastructure: build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation, UN SDG 11 – Sustainable cities and communities: make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable and UN SDG 12 – Responsible consumption and production: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
The forum will include panel discussions and keynote speeches by experts in the field. There will also be a session for information and experience-sharing by multiple stakeholder groups and the presentation of selected papers.
The objectives of the forum are to convene a multi-stakeholder dialogue to support the implementation process of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to create a networking opportunity for policymakers, business leaders and other stakeholders and discuss progressive actions undertaken to incorporate the SDGs and national development priorities into their agendas and business models and to create working groups on the four thematic areas for future forums which will be held as follow up sessions to this main event.
