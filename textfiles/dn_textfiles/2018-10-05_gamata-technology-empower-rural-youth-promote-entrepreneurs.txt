The event will be a cultivated Dialogue on Digital Sri Lanka with the participation of erudite speakers of the industry as is targeted to attract over 1000 individuals from all parts of the country.
Dr. Ashan Perera, Co-chairperson of the Gamata Technology platform said, “The main aim of Gamata Technology is to provide people with a comfortable platform to engage with the rapidly growing and changing technology landscape and helping communities to realize the value of what technology builds. We are working towards bringing the concept of Digitalization in Sri Lanka to higher standards and increasing the crowd accepting and engaging in this digitizing process. This will help the government in its way to digitalizing the public and other sectors”.
Digitalization opens up new opportunities to influence and transform various fields in a country such as business models, organizational patterns, legal and policy measures, economical structures and most importantly cultural barriers.
Co-Chairperson, Dr. Ashan Perera said, “But sadly, this has mostly been limited within the walls of urbanized and industrialized areas. Often citizens in rural areas are not reached with technology due to various difficulties they face in using technology. This has affected the development of the country as a whole because digitalization of the public sector cannot be fulfilled, as the common public is rather uncomfortable with it. But recently the private sector has focused on this issue and has acted upon changing this. They have introduced various services, which include the use of technology to fulfill one’s day-to-day activities. This method has proved to be more efficient and helpful to its users.”
On the positive light, the Sri Lankan market is very conducive to and very adaptive to new technology. With the revolution of Technology Sri Lankan technological system is starting to gear up with the ongoing tech World. With that eruption many youth from urban to rural have paved their way by using maximum of the modern technology. Gamata Technology will be a debut of such talented entrepreneurs who will showcase their knowledge and talent in technology at the forum.
