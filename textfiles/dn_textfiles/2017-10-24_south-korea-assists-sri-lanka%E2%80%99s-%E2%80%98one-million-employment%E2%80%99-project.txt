South Korea assists Sri Lanka’s ‘One million Employment’ project

South Korean government has extended assistance to implement the ‘One million Employment Programme’ of the government, Labour and Trade Union Ministry spokesman said.
A special discussion was held recently regarding this project at the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry between Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne and an official team of delegates who arrived from South Korea.
During the discussion the South Korean delegation team expressed their willingness to provide technical assistance to develop and set up Public Employment Service Centres islandwide. Several centres have already been set up in many areas in the country and a significant number of unemployed persons visit these centres to obtain various services, Ministry spokesman said.
South Korea will provide training for seven Sri Lankan officials attached to the Department of Manpower and Employment as the first step of providing technical assistance to create one million employments in Sri Lanka, he added.
