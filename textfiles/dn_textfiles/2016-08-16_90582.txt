No int’l interference or foreign judges

There will be no international interference or no foreign judges be appointed to the panel to inquire into missing persons as alleged by certain groups, UNP Colombo District MP S. M. Marikkar said.
“However, International inspectors are welcome to arrive in the country to witness the transparency and the progress of the investigations,” he said while addressing a media briefing at UNP Headquarters - Sirikotha yesterday.
“A bad image was created internationally about our war heroes. There are a million tri forces and police personnel in the country. But they all have been accused of human rights violations by the international community due to wrong doings committed by a few. Therefore if those who had committed the crimes are brought before the law and justice meted out it will erase the black mark internationally on our security establishment. At the same time this will bring glory to the security forces from the international community and re-establish their recognition among the international community”.
Marikkar said that the government’s move to set up an office to inquire into the missing will not be limited to find about those who went missing during the civil war, but to inquire into all who had gone missing since 1971 and 1989 rebellions.
“The family members of the persons who had gone missing have the right to know whether their loved ones are dead or alive. This office is set up to ring redress to those affected. The JVP had filed six complaints so far regarding disappearances of their missing members, including their former leader Rohana Wijeyweera.
This proves that it provides equal opportunity to everybody regardless of any differences to find the persons who are reported missing,” he said.
He also said that those who oppose for the setting up of this office is directly encouraging such actions to take place in the country again.
“Nobody should fear if they had not made any person to disappear. You as journalists witnessed how your pen and camera were censored during the last regime. White van concept emerged and a number of people who were against the wrongdoings of the previous government went missing. No person can legitimately go missing. What had happened to them? What paved the way for them to go missing? - These questions should be answered. The office set up to find out about the missing persons will address these issues,” he said.
