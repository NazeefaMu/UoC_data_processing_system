LOW GROWNS MEET WITH FAIR DEMAND

The weekly tea auction which ended on Wednesday ( 14) saw Low Growns meet with fair demand. Select best BOP1 / OP1s held firm, whilst others gained in value. OPs sold at dearer rates. Well-made OPAs held firm, others appreciated.
Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC Director/ Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake told Daily News Business yesterday that Pekoe / Pekoe1’s gained in value all-round. In the Tippy Small leaf catalogues select best FBOP1/FBOPs sold at lower rates. Below best and others appreciated. Few select FBOPF1s held firm.
Others declined in value. FBOPFs sold at lower rates. Few select best BOP/BOPFs held firm, whilst others sold at lower rates. In the Premium Flowery catalogues long leaf and small leaf tippy teas discounted sharply.
There was less general demand in the Ex-Estate catalogues. Better Western BOPs declined Rs.20 to Rs. 30 with some withdrawals; others lost a further Rs. 10. Select Coloury BOPFs held firm, but others declined Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Nuwara Eliya BOP / BOPFs were lower all-round.
Select Udapussellawa BOP were firm to dearer on special inquiry; others and BOPFs were lower Rs. 20 to Rs. 30. Uva BOP / BOPFs declined Rs. 20 to Rs. 30; others and the BOPFs lost Rs. 20 on average.
Few select best CTC PF1s were firm. Below best declined Rs. 10 to Rs. 20, poorest eased further. A few Better BP1s were firm; others declined Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.
Meanwhile, Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama said that improved weather conditions with better sunlight have been experienced in the plantations during the last few days following several days of heavy rainfall. Workers in the High and Medium category plantations too have now returned to work after one week of holidays for the Deepavali Festival.
“Crop harvests are now poised to increase, and Estate Managers need to keep a close scrutiny on the green leaf quality that is accepted for manufacture. During cropping periods, past experience will tell us that the vast majority of poor leaf, plain liquoring teas have got neglected and even been difficult of sale, whilst, well made, true to grade teas have invariably attracted reasonable prices,” Algama told Daily News Business yesterday
He said: “This year will be no exception and critical attention is therefore required to monitor the standard of leaf that is accepted for manufacture from now onwards”
The Sri Lanka Tea Board has released the data of orthodox teas sold during Jan/Oct. which indicates a total volume of 224 million kilograms that have been sold through the auctions at an average of Rs.590.04. The Low Grown sector has sold 147.7 million kilos at Rs.607.29 whilst Western High Growns have sold 30.4 million kilos at Rs.600.40.
A weight of 20.4 Million kilos representing CTC manufacture has also been sold during the period under review at an average of Rs.512.94. The combined total of both Orthodox and CTC teas reveals that a total weight of 244.4 Million kilos have been sold during the first ten months this year at an average of Rs.583.61.
It is salient to note however, that all sectors have performed lower than during the corresponding period last year, both in terms of quantity and price.
The 2.5 million kilos of Low Growns on offer this week met with good demand. In the leafy grades segment, the better made BOP1’s/OP1’s and OP’s/OPA’s were fully firm although Pekoe grades were barely steady. FBOP’s in the Tippy catalogue were firm as were select best FBOPF1’s. Others were irregularly lower.
There was sustained demand from Saudi Arabia, Syria, U.A.E and the C.I.S whilst Iran was less forceful. Buyers for Turkey were more selective.
Ex-Estate teas met with less demand resulting in much lower prices. The greater majority of offerings had plain and uninteresting quality, and these teas lost Rs. 20-40/- per kg.
A very limited selection of best Westerns that had maintained quality however, were in receipt of firm prices. Buyers from Japan and Europe were selective.
CLIPPER LAUNCHES PLASTIC-FREE TEABAGS MADE FROM BANANA
Tea giant Clipper is to launch a new plastic-free teabag that will be made from a type of banana.
The green alternative is part of the company’s ambition to lower its carbon foot print and reduce the environmental impact of its tea products.
A number of leading tea brands currently use polypropylene, a sealing plastic, to fasten tea bags and make sure they keep their shape.
Clipper announced that, as of October 20, it has moved all production to a new type of tea bag that, instead of the plastic polypropylene seal, will use natural plant-based materials.
The tea bags will be made using a blend of abaca, which is a species of banana, and a biopolymer made from a non-GM plant material known as PLA.
The new bags will also be biodegradable and compostable to industrial standards, making them more eco-friendly.
The tea company, one of the UK’s biggest, is believed to be the first brand to introduce a plastic-free tea bag.
Other leading companies, like PG tips and the Co-op, said earlier this year they both plan to switch to biodegradable tea bags by the end of the year. (Source: Evening standard.UK).
CHINA BUYS $1 MN OF INDIAN BLACK TEA
India’s ongoing campaign to increase tea exports to China paid off this month with an order for $1 million in black tea to supply COFCO (China Tea Co.) the largest of China’s tea companies.
Jay Shree Tea & Industries will ship several hundred thousand kilos of Assam cut, tear, and curl (CTC) tea, in the latest and largest of several transactions between the world’s major tea producing countries.
Year-on-year growth in tea sales was 29 percent in 2017 with China paying $25 million for approximately 9 million kilograms of Indian teas.
Prices were not disclosed but Shree is likely to have negotiated a higher average rate per kilo based on quality. COFCO benefits from the higher price Chinese are willing to pay for tea.
China is now India’s 10th largest tea export destination, the result of a concerted effort by the Indian Embassy in Beijing and Indian Consulates in Shanghai and Guangzhou to promote Indian tea.
Jay Shree Industries is part of the B. K. Birla Group, a conglomerate with substantial holdings in chemical production, fertilizer, sugar production, and real estate. The tea division’s 27 gardens account for 3 percent of India’s total output and 11 percent of the Darjeeling harvest.
It is the only tea company in India with large estates in every major tea growing region. Jay Shree also has substantial holdings in East Africa. Under the supervision of Managing Director D. P. Maheshwari the company has invested in modern packaging equipment located at the factories to preserve freshness and reduce outlays to middle men.
“Technological up gradation and modernization is a continuous process,” writes Maheshwari of the China outreach. The deal was signed during China’s first global import expo in Shanghai, an event that resulted in $57.83 billion in trade deals across many sectors.
The week-long China International Import Expo (CIIE) attracted 400,000 buyers and 3,600 exhibitors from 172 countries, according to a report by the China Internet Information Centre.
“Global demand for black tea will continue to rise, driven in particular by its increasing popularity in China, “accoounting to The Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) monthly forecast of consumption growth. EIU predicts “a relatively high” 4.6% average in 2019-20 that is “in line with the long-term historical average.”
“Tea consumption will continue to be dominated by Asian consumers, particularly China and India, which together accounted for an estimated 59% of global demand in 2018, up from 48 percent in 2010,” according to EIU.
Most of this growth is due to the rising demand of Assam CTC black tea, known for its strong colour and flavour, which goes well with milk-based tea drinks. (Source: WTN).
