NCP meeting in turmoil

The North Central Provincial Council meeting held yesterday morning ended up in turmoil as members belonging to the Joint Opposition group created a rumpus by burning the order papers alleging that the appointment of Council Chairman D M Amaratunge is illegal.
It all began when former Council Minister K H Nandasena stood up and claimed that the new chairman had no legal status as the Joint Opposition group commanded the majority in the house.
All efforts made by new Chairman D M Amaratunge to conduct business in the house ignoring the protest campaign launched by Joint Opposition members wearing black bands led by former chief minister S M Ranjith Samarakoon and former Ministers K H Nandasena H B Semasinghe and P B Ratnayake failed due to the loud din and the smoke enveloping the chamber by the burnt order papers.
Chief Sergeant at Arms Rohana Dodanwela was seen moving in the chamber trying to douse the fire. Tension within the chamber heightened once again as UNP member Aruna Buddhika threw a bottle of water towards the joint opposition group members.
There after the protesting joint opposition members walked out from the chamber and continued the protest campaign seated on the stairs at the main gate of the council complex.
A heated exchange of words ensued between the Joint Opposition members and the UNP member Aruna Buddhika as the latter peeped out of a window of the chairman's official room in the first floor and abused the opposition members. Later, Chairman D M Amaratunge continued the business of the house in the absence of opposition members and adjourned the council meeting for August 22. Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne was not present in the house yesterday.
