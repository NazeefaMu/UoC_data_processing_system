RAJIVA WIJETUNGE: A shining example of a record 40 years in TT

A promising cricketer with tremendous potential to hit the big time, but who prematurely quit the lovely game of cricket to concentrate on table tennis and athletics was Royalist RAJIVA WIJETUNGE.
Now called a FRCS – an acronym for - Former Royal College Students -. In medical terms FRCS stood for - Fellow Of the ROYAL College of Surgeons. But now Old Royalists revel in being tagged FRCS.
Having said that WIJETUNGE'S first love was cricket at Royal after performing brilliantly under captains Ranjan Madugalle and Ashok Jayawickrema. A Sri Lanka cap could have been his for the asking, but he quit cricket lu’verly cricket and put aside his talent with bat and ball and took to a tryst with Table Tennis and Track and Field In which games he excelled.
Keen cricket fan
WIJETUNGE who is still a keen cricket fan, keeps a tag as to what is happening on the cricket field, reached the top in Table Tennis, being a player of more than ordinary promise where he missed by a whisker of sporting national colours in this sport was just one of those things. He reached a milestone completing 40 memorable years in the table game and is still going strong.
That is an achievement of great significance. It is said that many are called, but a few are chosen and this saying rings true of the unassuming and ever ready to help WIJETUNGE who while sporting that certain smile still keeps going forward playing the sport he loved with the enthusiasm and intensity of a schoolboy.
WIJETUNGE in addition to his prowess in cricket, excelled in table tennis and was also a superb athlete. He could well be tagged an all round sportsman and a pride to his school and the clubs he represented.
Frame to be admired
I have watched and followed WIJETUNGE’S sporting career from the time he opened bowling for his school and to the time of writing. With a frame to be admired, strong and sturdily built, he was a batsman’s nightmare when with new ball in hand.
He could vary his deliveries, with competent swing both ways, with good speed and also packed a stinging bouncer. As a batsman, he could contribute using the long handle as it was then known with big hitting.
Although he is now known for his dominance in table tennis, I would like to first start with his cricket career at Royal. He was lucky to have a captain in Ranjan Madugalle and he says Madugalle had natural talent and was a good thinker of the game and playing exquisite strokes all round the wicket with a straight bat and says he was fortunate to have played under him.
Leading by example
Little wonder then that Madugalle captained the country, making runs leading by example and who is now a much sought after Chief Test match referee.
In addition to having Madugalle to show him how, he had the good fortune of coming under competent coaches in Gamini Salgadoe, Mahes Rodrigo and Vijaya Malasekera who etched a niche during their careers as Royal cricketers.
WIJETUNGE rode the high horse when he became President of the Table Tennis Association of Sri Lanka and was elated when under his Presidency Udaya Ranasinghe won a Gold Medal in the junior boys singles event at the South Asian Table Tennis Championships in 2015 and it was the first time that a Lankan had won a gold medal in an international tournament.
List of achievements
Here’s a list of his achievements that he, his school, club, the country, employers Ceylinco and MAS Holdings could well be proud of. Starting with cricket where his best bowling figures were 5 for 20 against St. Benedict’s College and had a match bag of 8 for 37. With the willow his best was an unbeaten 54 against Richmond College.
He also played Donovan Andree and for CCC and had best bowling figures against Cots 7 for 21 with his blistering pace. He also played under former Sri Lanka captain Michael Tissera when CCC won the Sara trophy and also played for Nomads. In a Donovan Andree game he made 138 against Bloomfield.
At school he won colours for cricket, table tennis and athletics. He helped Royal win the Most popular team of the year award in 1979. Won the Best Bowler’s award at the Royal-Thomian Mustang’s trophy 50-over game. Was a member of the Royal TT team in 1974 which won the junior and senior inter-school tournaments. He captained the school in TT team in 1976.
Putt Shot record
WIJETUNGE holds the school’s under 14 Putt Shot record which he established in 1973. Since 2002 he has represented the Sri Lanka Veterans TT teams and toured China, Japan, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa and Singapore. He was the first Sri Lankan to win an individual medal at TT at the World Masters’ Athletics and TT.
He also won a triple crown at the Sri Lanka Veterans tournament in 2007 and won the Sri Lanka national veterans title in 2003. Was the chief de mission for the Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune, India in 2008 when Shehan Ambepitiya won the three gold medals for the country establishing records in 200 metres and 4 x 100 meter relay.
WIJETUNGE served on the National Olympic Committee from 2007 to 2009. Was a national selector for TT from 2002 to 2007 and 2009 to 2014. He was President of the TT Association of Sri Lanka and President of Mercantile TT Association. It is amazing to note that he played Mercantile TT tournaments from 1979 to 2018 continuously for 40 years.
Discuss Throw record
He won a Bronze Medal for the country in the discuss throw event for men over 45/49 age category at the 14th Asian Masters Athletics Championships in Bangalore, India in 2006. Holds the Mercantile Athletics shot putt over 55 record which he established in 2014.
In 1979 he helped Royal win nine inter-school matches which was a record in the school’s calendar. In the centenary Royal - Thomian game he opened bowling with that ace paceman Asantha de Mel
WIJETUNGE has many more rare achievements to his credit but space constraints holds me back from mentioning them all. Suffice to say that he is one of the legends in sport in the country.
