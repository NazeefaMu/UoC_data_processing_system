Six arrested with cocaine further remanded

Six suspects arrested with 1.816 kg of cocaine were yesterday further remanded until February 1 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) was ordered to obtain suspects’ fingerprints.
Suspects Abdul Abbas Husain, Timothy Denis Wangbow, Noni Vike Abdeen Iqbal, Francis Okelow, and Onwara Sunday Vinindu were remanded.
The court refused to grant bail to the suspects since the PNB had not concluded investigations.
The magisterial inquiry was fixed for March 21.
