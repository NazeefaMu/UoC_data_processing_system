Lanka Women suffer 109-run loss to India

Half-centuries from Punam Raut and Mithali Raj, followed by a four-wicket haul from Rajeshwari Gayakwad, led India women to a 109-run win against Sri Lanka in their Women’s Cricket World Cup warm-up match played at Chesterfield.
Raut added 92 for the first wicket with Smriti Mandhana and 49 with the second with Raj as the top three set up a daunting total of 275 for 8.
Four of Sri Lanka’s top five got past 20, but none of them managed a half-century, with Dilani Manodara’s 49 the top score of the lot.
At 135 for 3, the chase still held some hope, only for Sri Lanka to collapse to Gayakwad’s left-arm spin, the last seven wickets falling for 31 runs.
Scores:
India Women 275 for 8 (Raj 85, Raut 69, Kanchana 2-49)
Sri Lanka Women 166 (Manodara 49, Gayakwad 4-12)
