Political motive behind arrest - FSP

The Frontline socialist Party (FSP) yesterday said that the sudden arrest of Kumar Gunaratnam of the FSP was illegal and it was only a political reason behind the sudden arrest
and not a legal reason. Addressing the media yesterday at the CSR, Maradana, FSP Politburo Member Duminda Nagamuwa claimed that Kumar Gunaratnam was taken into the Police custody without a warrant while he was at his mother's place in Anguruwatota, Kegalle.
"The present government is also following the footsteps of the previous Rajapaksa regime without doing what they promised prior to the 2015 Presidential Election. The Rajapaksa regime kidnapped Kumar Gunaratnam on several occasions they alleged and the present government has arrested him. But finally both parties wanted to expel him from the country," he said.
Nagamuwa also said that Gunaratnam, is an Australian Citizen and he applied for dual citizenship. But the Immigration and Emigration Department didn't granted dual citizenship for him. Therefore, he entered the country on a tourist visa and requested the Immigration authorities to extend it. But, they didn't responded to the request.
The FSP urged all parties who raised their voices against the anti-democratic rule of the Rajapaksa regime to be united and raise their voices against this attempt to expel him from the country.
FSP Secretary Senadheera Gunathilake was also present.
