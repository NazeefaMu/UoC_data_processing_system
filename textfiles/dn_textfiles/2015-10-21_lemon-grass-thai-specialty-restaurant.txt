Lemon Grass - The Thai Specialty Restaurant

The Grand Kandyan Hotel in Kandy has taken the culinary life of the Hill Capital to another level by opening its first Thai Restaurant with two chefs from Thailand brought down especially for this.
Chef Kamonchat Pummilamnow and Chef Korawik Songyoo have already won over the dinning fraternity of the hill capital.
Grand Kandyan Hotel invites all to taste the authentic Thai cuisine and mouthwatering menus created by these two expert chefs, both who have excelled in their art of cooking.
The list of dishes on the menu of Lemon Grass has a large variety to select ranging from starters to soups, Main course and Desserts to pick from.
After a hearty meal mixed and matched with what one picks from here can be topped-up with an all-sweet dessert from the equally varied menu list. So during one's next visit to the hill capital of Kandy make it a point to drop in at Grand Kandyan and make a date with the Chef duo Kamonchat and Korawik to crown a vacation or business visit to Kandy with that special Thai dining experience.
Bon Appetit!
