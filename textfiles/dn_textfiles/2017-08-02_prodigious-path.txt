Prodigious path

For most of us, conquering a university degree is hard work. It is amazing to achieve it before one is old enough to vote. Sandika Shanil Jayamaha’s Alma Mater was Lyceum International School. He completed his Cambridge (Ordinary Level) having achieved excellent grades, entered ANC Education to pursue his Bachelor of Business Administration – International Business degree from Northwood University USA.
Being too young to be alone at an University in USA and seeing the opportunity offered by ANC Education was an excellent option for him here in Sri Lanka.
ANC Education Graduation Ceremony 2017 was held on Friday the 28th July at BMICH, where over 400 students received their degrees. The Chief Guest was National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva. Sandika was the youngest person to receive a Bachelor’s Degree from the Assistant Vice President and Dean of International Programs at Northwood University Dr Mamiko Reeves as he walked across the stage.
Sandika’s dream is to become an Airbus Pilot and work for an airline. But when he completed his Cambridge (O/L) he was too young to get into the Airbus program, the minimum age being 18 years. Currently, he is pursuing his Private Pilot License at Fairway Aviation Academy at Ratmalana. Immediately after completing his PPL, he will begin his Airbus program. He may well become one of the youngest Airbus pilots.
All this was possible for Sandika Jayamaha because his parents Dr. Seba Jayamaha and Surani Jayaweera Jayamaha were able to carefully, methodically plan his career path and help him stay focused to achieve the goal.
