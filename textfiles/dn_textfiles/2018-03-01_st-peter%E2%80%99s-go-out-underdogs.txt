St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya go out as underdogs in the 84th battle of the Saints cricket encounter against St Joseph’s College fought out for the Rev. Fr. Maurice Le Goc Challenge Trophy which will be played on March 2 and 3 at the P.Sara Oval.
This battle of the Saints encounter started in 1933 with George Jayaweera (father of former Sri Lankan national under 19 cricket captain cum Royal College 1970 and 1972 1st XI captain Asitha Jayaweera and former St.Peter’s College 1974 1st XI cricket captain Ruwan Jayaweera) leading the St.Peter’s College outfit in the first encounter. So far out of the 83 encounters that have been played, the Peterites have won on 10 occasions. According to the form book of the two teams St. Peter’s will be coming into this game with mixed fortunes as underdogs having recorded five outright wins against Gurukula Maha Vidyalaya, Richmond College, St.Servatius College, Dharmaraja College and St.Anthony’s College and losing three matches outright.
They are led by all rounder cum Sri Lanka national under 19 player Santhush Gunathilake who is the son of former Thurstan College cricketer Sirosha Gunathilake, Shalith Fernando is the leading run-getter for the Peterites this season with nearly 750 runs while all rounder and left handed batsmen Ranmith Jayasena with a tally of over 700 runs will be the mainstay of the Peterite batting department.
The other top run scorers are skipper Santhush Gunathilake over 675 runs, Shannon Fernando close to 650 runs, Sulakshana Fernando nearly 500 runs, Sachin Silva close to 350 runs and Prabasara Herath over 300 runs, they will be expected to make their contributions to bolster the Peter’s scoreboard.
There is no shortage of amour in their bowling attack and they will be banking heavily on two bowlers left-arm spinner Mohammad Ameen Miflal their top wicket-taker with over 100 scalps and off-spinner Sachin Silva who has taken close to 70 wickets. They have plenty more in the bowling department with Santhush Gunathilake who has also taken nearly 25 scalps along with Ruwin Seneviratne close to 20 wickets and Shivan Perera and Tariq Saboor over 15 scalps each to give the senior duo the backing they need.
The Peterites will once again be coached by their 1998 captain who scored a breathtaking 159 in the big match and Sri Lanka national cricketer Malinda Warnapura. Warnapura guided them to a sensational double by winning both the big match and the limited over encounters convincingly under all-rounder Vinu Mohotty in 2016.
St.Peter’s has produced many national cricketers who have gone on to represent the country with distinction - Clive Inman was one of the finest left handed batsmen in schools in the 1950's who later went on to play English county cricket for Leicestershire, Dr. H.I.K. Fernando - once rated as Asia’s best wicket-keeper, David Heyn, Tony Opatha, Keerthi Gunaratne, former Sri Lanka vice captain Roy Dias, Rumesh Ratnayake, Vinothan John, Amal Silva, Russel Arnold, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Malinda Warnapura and Angelo Perera to name a few. Incidentally Inman holds the all time batting record for the highest individual score of the series - 204 not out in 1954.
The outcome of the match will depend on which side will have the upper hand of scoring more runs in the first innings due to the 60 overs restriction.
