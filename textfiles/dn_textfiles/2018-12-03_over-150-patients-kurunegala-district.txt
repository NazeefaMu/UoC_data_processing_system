Rat fever menace
Over 150 patients in Kurunegala district

Around 157 rat fever (Letospirosis) patients were reported from the Kurunegala district during the past ten months.
Health Services Director of Polpithigama in Kurunegala Dr. G. G. N. D. Gamage said that around 17 rat fever patients were detected from Polpithigama during last 45 days while three of them have already died of letospirosis.
He told the media that many paddy farmers do not obtain medicine provided by the Government free of charge and their irresponsible and careless practices lead to the spread of disease.
All the government hospitals in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts issue tablets free of charge, he added.
