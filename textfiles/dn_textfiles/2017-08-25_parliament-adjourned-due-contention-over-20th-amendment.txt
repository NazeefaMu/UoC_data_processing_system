Parliament adjourned due to contention over 20th Amendment

 
Parliamentary sessions were adjourned for ten minutes today following an issue created during the second reading of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Amendment Bill for the first reading on August 23.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was presented by Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe in order to hold all Provincial Council election polls on the same day.
The Bill also seeks to take over the powers of provincial councils when they stand dissolved.
