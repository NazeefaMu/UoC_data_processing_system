Extremists remove bricks from archaeological pillars: Gnanasara Thera

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday that Muslim extremists have removed bricks from archaeological pillars at the Somawathiya and Jala Gelum Nimnaya conservation sites to use them at cattle slaughterhouses.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, the Thera urged the government to take action against this practice.
Muslim extremists with the support of politicians are engaged in illegal tree felling, sand mining, treasure hunting and hunting of animals in the conservation sites, he said.
“But the Sinhala people who are protesting against these practices are being
arrested by the Police. We urge the President to end this destruction. There are slaughterhouses in the area. If the government would not intervene to solve this problem, the BBS would forcibly remove them,” he said.
The conservation areas are full of animal skeletons. Extremists have cleared thousands of acres illegally and destroyed the building of the archaeological sites. But, the political leadership of the country remains silence as they want the support of Muslim politicians, the Thera said.
Archaeology Director General said the department does not have sufficient funds to preserve archaeological sites.
The Thera urged the philanthropists to spend their money to preserve archaeological sites. Most archaeological sites do not have sign boards and fences around them, he said.
