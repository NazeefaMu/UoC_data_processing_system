Good opening for national government

The Finance Minister has carefully drafted the Budget 2018 for the betterment of the country, National Unity Alliance Leader Azath Sally said.
"The most important thing is how the country is going to repay the loans, the Minister explained about the “ tax of medha mulana” and it is a wise move by the government. Former government put the country into a mess, they were not even in the position to pay the installments. The present government has taken better initiatives to develop the country whilst looking for ways to repay the loans," he said.
"It is a people friendly budget. This time, the prices of the essential items were reduced even before the budget was released and it was very different underprevious governments," he said.
