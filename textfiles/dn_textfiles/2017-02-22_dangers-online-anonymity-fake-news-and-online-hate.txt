Dangers of Online Anonymity, Fake News, and Online Hate

The Associated Papers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), (Lake House) yesterday held the D.R. Wijewardene Memorial Panel Discussion entitled: “The Dangers of Online Anonymity, Fake News, and Online Hate"
The lecture took place at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. It marked the 131st anniversary of the birth of Wijewardene, the founder of the Lake House.
The five panelists, who hailed from both private and state media bodies, wrestled with the definition and relative danger of fake news.
“Before we discuss fake news, we have to figure out how it is different from false news or bad journalism. For me, the objective of fake news is to earn money by getting more hits. At the bottom of fake news, there are money and power,” Rasika Jayakody of The Daily News said.
Umair Wolid of the Wijeya Newspapers, concurred with Jayakody, but also added that fake news is meant to intentionally mislead, whereas bad journalism misleads unintentionally due to a lack of fact checking or poor practice on the part of journalists.
Indi Samarajiva of YAMU, played devil’s advocate by briefly arguing that fake news can, in certain instances, lead to positive outcomes.
“Let’s think back to the story of Rajapaksa sending several Lamborghinis out of the country. This story turned out to be either untrue or un-provable, but it did help get rid of Rajapaksa, so can we say it was such a bad story?” Samarajiva queried.
The panelists discussed the economic aspect of fake news, touching on the fact that new media companies make a mint on it.
“For all the complaining about Trump, he made media companies a lot of money. Facebook and Google are making a huge amount from fake news, while old media bodies point to the importance of facts,” Samarajiva said.
