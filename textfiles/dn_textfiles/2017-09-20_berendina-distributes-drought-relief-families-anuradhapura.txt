Berendina distributes drought relief to families in Anuradhapura

Berendina Group recently distributed 2,000 dry ration packs to families affected by drought in the Anuradhapura region.
The donation was sponsored by Berendina Microfinance Institute (Gte) Ltd. (BMI), Sri Lanka’s leading microfinance institution in the Non-Governmental Sector with a view to mitigate the negative economic impact of the drought on destitute families. The ceremonial event to handover the relief was held at the Yowun Nikethanaya in Anuradhapura on August 30.
Since the last heavy rains in July 2016, there has been little to no harvest for three consecutive seasons, which has forced many farmers and herders in the Anuradhapura region to abandon their cattle and farms in search of work and water elsewhere.A joint report by the World Food Program and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that was released in mid-June, classified the drought in Sri Lanka as the worst in 40 years.
Realising the severity of the situation, Berendina stepped into donate dry rations worth Rs. 8 million in total with each dry ration pack donated costing Rs. 4,000. Each pack included a 25-kilogram rice bag and other consumable items.
The beneficiaries of this relief action plan consisted of families living in the remote regions of Manupa, Thirappane, Kahatagasdigiliya and Ipalogama.
The donations were presented at an event attended by the Chairman of Berendina Anura Athapattu, Director Jagath Godakanda, Director of Berendina Stichting Jan De Witte, General Manager of Berendina Development Services Dayantha Fernando, Area Manager Saman Wijesundara, senior government representatives and other distinguished invitees.
Berendina envisions to create an empowered, equitable society where povertydoes not exist.
