Impartiality assured in Treasury Bond investigation

The government would take action to recover the damage caused by the treasury bond issue if the allegation is proved, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
He added that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe the controversial Treasury Bond Issue as it is required to investigate the alleged fraud of this government in the same manner that it investigates alleged frauds of the previous government under Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Minister Jayasekara said that the Commission was given three months to submit the report with its decision on whether there had been any irregularity or corrupt practice in the transaction and who was responsible and the recommendations.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head office.
He said although some question why the President did not appoint a special Presidential Commission to look into the treasury bond issue, they lack legal knowledge. He added that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry has powers to inquire in detail into the matter whereas the Special Commission is appointed to deprive one's civil rights.
"Although some question the President's delay in taking action, he had to wait for the response in Parliament and the Courts."
Jayasekara said the members of the Commission are Supreme Court Justices K.T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardana and retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai.
He said the President had assigned the Commission to examine the management, administration and conduct of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in respect to the Bond issuance of the controversial Treasury Bond issue and if there had been any malpractices, irregularity or non-compliance with or disregard for the proper procedures applicable.
The commission was assigned to query if there had been negligence or irresponsibility that resulted in damage to the Government or any statutory body including the Central Bank. He added that they will inquire if there had been any misuse of power too.
He added that after three months further action would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had also submitted a report of the debate to the Attorney General and he is expected to take action.
