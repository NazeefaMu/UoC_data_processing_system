Treasury Bond issue: Severe punishment for those responsible under criminal justice system: President

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he had appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate the Central Bank’s controversial Treasury Bond issue in March 2015 with the intention of meting out severe punishment to those involved in the scam under the criminal justice system.
Speaking at a function at the Abhayarama temple, Narahenpita yesterday afternoon the President went on to say that after bringing the culprits to book in the above case separate investigations will be launched to find whether similar malpractices have taken place involving the Central Bank during the last 7 to 8 years and punish those responsible.
The President said that he found out that a current Police investigation on the Bond issue was being conducted under the civil law and added that he was not satisfied about it.
A Presidential Commission can recommend to the Attorney General to initiate action under the criminal justice system, if an offence has been committed.
Commenting about the debate in Parliament on the Bond issue, the President noted that both the opposition and the government had resorted to a verbal battle accusing each other.
On the Presidential Commission, the President further said that he had appointed it after consulting and getting the views of renowned legal experts.
He said that Commission will investigate the issue in a very transparent manner. The President said that he will not allow any cover ups on corruption charges and added that he had left the previous regime as he could not tolerate corruption, malpractices and bad governance. Prior to the President’s speech, Prof. Ven.BellanwilaWimalarathana Thera in his Anusasana brought up the bond issue and asked why the Government was hesitant to punish those responsible.
