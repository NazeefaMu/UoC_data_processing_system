WICB change name to Cricket West Indies

The West Indies Cricket Board, on Wednesday changed its name to Cricket West Indies, Johnny Grave, the new chief executive, announced. In addition, the team will now be called Windies.
"Cricket West Indies better reflects how the organisation operates, as there are many different stakeholders who we work in partnership with, under the unifying aim of improving cricket at all levels within the region," Grave said. "We plan to work even more closely with them over the next few years and consultation will begin immediately as we develop a new strategic plan for 2018-2023."
Dave Cameron, the president, said the new name appears more inclusive and appropriate.
"Whilst the Board of Directors has an important role, we feel that the new name is more inclusive and appropriate, as we want to recognise the valuable role that our players, territorial boards, staff, supporters, governments, coaches, match officials and volunteers, play in the organisation," he pointed out.
