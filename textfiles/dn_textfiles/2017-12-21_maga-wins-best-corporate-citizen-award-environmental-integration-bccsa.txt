Maga wins Best Corporate Citizen Award for environmental integration at BCCSA awards

Sri Lanka’s leading construction firm Maga Engineering received recognition for its pioneering efforts in the field of environmental integration at the Best Corporate Citizens Sustainability Awards (BCCSA) 2017 organized by The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The company was also adjudged one of the Ten Best Corporate Citizens in Sri Lanka.
The company emerged as the category award winner for Environmental Integration in recognition of its best-in-class performance in integrating environmental concerns into core business practices, including the promotion of sustainable buildings and reduction of its environmental footprint through resource efficiency and use of renewable resources.
Clearpoint Residencies in a 47-storey green building with cantilevered terraces on each floor that contain a variety of hand-picked, nursery-nurtured plants.
These planted terraces offer the building a unique character while providing many benefits: Formation of a green cover provides a natural cooling system for the entire building, resulting not only in a fresher, more relaxing atmosphere, but less energy spent on air-conditioning.
NSBM Green University town is a BCA Greenmark rated green building that will eventually house 30,000 students and offer state-of-the-art educational facility that has incorporated many energy-efficient principles. Established under the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, the building was ceremoniously opened in October 2016.
Commenting on the awards, the Chairman and Managing Director of Maga Engineering M.G. Kularatne said, “The construction sector inherently has a larger ecological footprint than most sectors.
Therefore, we hold a deep responsibility towards doing our best to minimize this adverse footprint, and go one step beyond by creating a positive impact through the built environment.
With Clearpoint Residencies in particular, we, together with Milroy Perera Associates, took the bold step of fully integrating sustainability principles into a large-scale commercial venture.
The unique project presented us many technical and operational challenges, but we had clear design intent from the start and an amazing construction team.”
The company remains focused on service and product excellence and is committed to its vision of creating lasting socio-economic value for all stakeholders. Being a multidisciplinary construction company, Maga offers a diversified range of construction and allied services across industrial, government, real estate and commercial sectors in Sri Lanka.
