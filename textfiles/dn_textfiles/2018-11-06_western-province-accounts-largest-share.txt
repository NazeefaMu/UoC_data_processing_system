Nominal GDP
Western Province accounts for largest share

The Western Province continued to account for the largest share of the country’s nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Government Information Department said in statement.
The Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP) estimated by the Statistics Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) by disaggregating the annual nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) shows that the Western Province continued to account for the largest share of the country’s nominal GDP.
However, in line with recent trends, its share in the GDP declined in 2017, contributing to narrowing of regional disparity. The Central and North Western Provinces were the second and third highest contributors to the national GDP in nominal terms.
During 2017, increases in PGDP shares could be observed in the Eastern, North Western and the Uva Provinces, while that of the Western, Southern, North Central and the Sabaragamuwa Provinces decreased.
The shares of the Central and the Northern Provinces remain unchanged.
Analysis of the economic structures within the province shows that services and activities play a dominant role in each province contributing more than 50 per cent to the PGDP, except for the Uva Province where the contribution from the services sector was 37.8 per cent.
The performance of the services and activities in each province was largely backed by the developments in wholesale and retail trade together with the expansion in transportation activities.
Provincial GDP of the Uva Province was largely driven by industry activities (44.2 per cent), for which mining and quarrying contributed significantly. In other provinces, the contributions from industry activities on PGDP varied from 16.2 to 31.5 per cent. In line with the trend observed in national GDP, contribution to PGDP from agriculture activities was the lowest in all the provinces ranging from 2.1 to 15.1 per cent.
During 2017, the Eastern Province recorded the highest share of 15.1 per cent, which was led by production of rice and marine fishing.
