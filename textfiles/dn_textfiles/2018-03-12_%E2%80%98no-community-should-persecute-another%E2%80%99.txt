‘No community should persecute another’

We are all Sri Lankans and we must love our country. No one community should persecute another to demonstrate their supremacy. If any community intends to do so, it would be disastrous. Therefore, one should learn to live with other communities cordially, in order to avoid conflict, Senior DIG Kapila Jayasekera said.
He was addressing a meeting attended by religious dignitaries, trustees of mosques and temples, civil society members, business community and social service movement representatives, which was held at the Akkatipattu Divisional Secretariat Office Auditorium.
The event was also participated by Ampara DIG Nuwan Weddhasinghe, Akkaraippattu Divisional Secretary Latheef, Akkaraipattu and Ampara ASPs and other police officers.
DIG Jayasekara thanked religious dignitaries for their efforts to curb the recent incidents of racial violence. He recalled how people suffered and lived in fear during the 30-year conflict and added that he regretted the series of unfortunate incidents that took place in Ampara and neighboring villages.
Although religious dignitaries appealed the public not to engage in unwarranted protests, people did not pay heed, he said.
