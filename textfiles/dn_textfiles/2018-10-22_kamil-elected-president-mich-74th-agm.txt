Since its inauguration in 1944, the MICH has an impressive and enviable record of work to the community, sports and the country. In fact the organization is now in its 74th year. Its resolve and determination to work with greater and enthusiasm in the years ahead remain undaunted.
MICH which gives a big hand for billiards and snooker helped the country produce its first world champion, MJM Lafir, in whose memory they organize a cue tournament. National hero Lafir was synonymous with both Billiards & Snooker in the country and by winning the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay in 1973 he became the first Sri Lankan to win a world title in any sport. The MICH is hoping to revive the MJM Lafir tournament which was no held in the last few years.
