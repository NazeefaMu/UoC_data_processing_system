Dairy farmers in Southern Province to be facilitated

The Animal Husbandry and Livestock Development Ministry of the Southern Provincial Council launched a project to improve and expand animal husbandry and livestock in the region.
Dairy farm villages, cattle and buffalo reproduction centers, and cattle sheds will be established under the project, ministry officials said.
Hybrid milch cows will be provided to farmers at concessionary rates and their milk production will be taken through collecting centres and sales points, they said.
Dairy farmers will be provided with appliances needed for the field and granted many other benefits encouraging them to engage in dairy farming, the officials said.
