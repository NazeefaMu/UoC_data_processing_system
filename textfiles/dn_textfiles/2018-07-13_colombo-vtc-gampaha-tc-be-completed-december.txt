Colombo VTC, Gampaha TC to be completed by December

The construction of Colombo Vocational Training Centre (VTC) and upgrading of Gampaha Technical College (TC) project financed by the Korea Eximbank is gearing towards completion in December.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama was on a site inspection tour with the Project Director at Colombo VTC under construction by Samhee Construction and Engineering in Orugodawatta on July 9.
Korea Eximbank is financing for this project valued at USD 26 million at 0.15 percent interest rate and 40-year repayment period including a 10-year grace period. After completion, Colombo VTC will conduct National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) courses on subjects such as robotics, electrics and electronics, mechatronics, welding, automotive technology, refrigeration and air conditioning, pneumatics and hydraulics.
The textbooks for the subjects are being developed with the experts dispatched from Korean universities such as Shinhan University and Hanbat University. In addition, capacity building programmes for the management staff and teachers in these two institutes are being conducted in Korea covering the subject areas. The workshop equipment will also be supplied and installed to these two vocational institutions within this year. The project will boost the supply of better jobs for youths by creating a skilled labour force vital to driving the economic growth. Furthermore, the project will bridge the gap between the labour market demand and the labour supply, thereby enabling the production of skilled labour for local and international markets. In the long run, it will lead to providing decent and sustainable jobs required in an aspiring upper middle income economy, the Korean Embassy stated in a release.
