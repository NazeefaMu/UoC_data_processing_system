Opex Holdings invests Rs 550 mn in region’s first liquid fertilizer plant

Opex Holdings (Pvt) Limited a pioneer company in the field of agriculture with over 40 years of experience has started manufacturing liquid fertilizer with an investment of Rs. 550 million. This first liquid fertilizer plant in South Asia will be inaugurated in Maradagamuna today.
This is a bid to slash the fertilizer import bill which is around Rs. 28 billion annually. All developed countries have moved away from the use of basic fertilizer which has reduced by 20% with the use of liquid fertilizer, said Onesh Subasinghe Managing Director said.
The objective of Opex is to commence the production of high quality liquid fertiliser with the use of advanced German technology. The company also intends to create a platform to sell high quality liquid fertilizer for a reasonably lower price. In the meantime the company is also looking for avenues to bring foreign exchange to the country by exporting the liquid fertiliser to foreign countries too.
Another major objective of Opex is to help the economy to reduce the Rs 28 billion that is spent on importing of fertilizer. Opex further expects the farmers to receive higher harvest. It is also environmental friendly and will cost lesser due to its distribution of liquid fertilizer expanding island wide.
He said that the liquid fertiliser that they manufactured using advance technology can reduce the water stress in a drought condition.
“Around 40% of paddy fields have been abandoned due to drought and this liquid fertilizer can solve this issue too. This technology will produce higher harvest even in a drought condition.
