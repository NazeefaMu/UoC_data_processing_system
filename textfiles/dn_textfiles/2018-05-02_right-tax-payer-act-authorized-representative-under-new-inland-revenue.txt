The right of tax payer to act via an authorized representative under new Inland Revenue Act - Suresh R.I. Perera

The new Inland Revenue Act, unlike the repealed Act, has granted the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR)the discretion to specify the circumstances under which a tax payer could be represented via an authorized representative.
Section 115 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 which provides the discretion reads as follows.
“The Commissioner-General may specify the circumstances under which a taxpayer may designate an authorized representative to communicate with the Department on behalf of the taxpayer and shall accept a designation made in accordance with such circumstances.”
Above Section generated much apprehension and was looked upon with fraught by many as this posed a threat to the rights of the tax payers. Perhaps due to the concerns expressed by many, the recent Gazette notice issued specifying the circumstances a tax payer may make representations through an authorized representative has been formulated very broadly.
It provides the opportunity to every tax payer to correspond with tax office regarding registration, apply for private rulings, and provide information requested and make appearances via an authorized representative. In addition a tax payer may file the income tax return & capital gains returns also via an authorized representative.
The Gazette also permits a tax payer to request for extension of time to file a return and extension of time for making tax payments via an authorized representative.
The new Act unlike previous Act has provided the facility for a tax payer to request additional time to file the income tax return & obtain extensions for making payments going beyond the applicable due dates under certain circumstances.
The new Act has replaced the concept of preferring an appeal to CGIR by a tax payer and reduced the process to a mere administrative review upon an application by the tax payer. The recent Gazette permits the tax payer to make representations via an authorized representative in an administrative review by the CGIR.
Furthermore a tax payer could be represented via a representative in an investigation by the Inland Revenue Department too.
Perhaps the main feature of the recent Gazette is that it attempts to retain the status quo under the repealed Act in relation to the right of the tax payer to act on behalf of the person. This has been ensured by including a clause which empowers the tax payer, by writing to authorize the representative to act on for any other purpose whatsoever.
Due to this very broad parameter, one could opine that the right of the tax payer to be represented via an authorized representative has not been impaired due to the power vested on CGIR by section 115 of the new Act.
