Spellbound!

Meandering under the scorching sunshine, you find this house perched a cut above the rest with its window blinds. A decade ago, this very house was home to Sri Lanka’s music ambassador. Once inside, you naturally set sights on a framed portrait of him hung on the wall.
Daily News encounters Gayathri Khemadasa, a composer, contemporary pianist and, above all, the daughter of Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa to trace how she was inspired by her legendary father. He did not see any boundaries in music, Gayathri opens the conversation going on to add how her father wanted to offer a meaning of depth where words go silent. His music spoke in the vacuum of words. And that is exactly why the Khemadasa is still a living entity subject to distortion as well as experiment.
“Father never tried to teach music to us. He discussed music with us. He let us listen to various genres of music. He wanted to hear our side of the interpretation. That was such a practical influence. When I learnt music later on that was quite useful. Most of the teachers I have met abroad did not try to cut and chop the students. They let the students unravel things for themselves. They tried to bring out the creativity in the children,” Gayathri anatomises her father’s inspiration.

Father’s inspiration was a definite factor when Gayathri chose a career in music.
If she heard something at home, it was music. If she discussed something, that was music more than politics. The first time she felt the uniqueness of her father was when she undertook studies under local schoolteachers. There was a vast difference between the traditional teachers and her father. But it is not their fault, Gayathri is quick to add. The local schoolteachers are moulded in the traditional pedagogue whereas Premasiri Khemadasa stepped out of the boundaries.
That explains why the Maestro claimed no school. With no proper place to teach proper music, how can Khemadasa claimed to have had a teacher, questions Gayathri. Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa was someone who seems to have inherited music, though Gayathri opposes it.
“What the people do not know is how my father dedicated his time to study the subject. He studied music quite a lot. As my mother tell us oftentimes, my father started his music studies in his early teens. He was never content with what he heard. He explored other possibilities of rejuvenating the same sound. He was someone who thought differently. His solitary battle as a child hailing from a not-so-wealthy family was a blessing in disguise to come a long journey in music,” Gayathri breaks down the genesis of his father’s brilliance.
That brilliance will be revived with a concert to commemorate the Maestro’s 10th death anniversary on October 23. Named Master Khemadasa Concert – Obama Mada Viya, the event will be held at the BMICH as a collaborative effort of Kites Ads and Idea and the Khemadasa Foundation. The concert will feature melodies cherished as well as unheard for some time. A notable addition is Mathi Amathivaru penned by Vijith Gunaratne aired in the eighties banned later owing to its controversial theme.

The Khemadasa legacy is still alive subject to distortions and experiments. Ironically, it is distortion that happens in the name of experiments, according to Gayathri Khemadasa.
“You need to know the basic structure to break the same structure. Most people try to break that structure without any knowledge of the basic structure. A song is distorted mostly because of ignorance. If you try to remove a certain element of an original score, you need to have an idea why the original musician added it in the first place. You should have a valid reason to remove it. For instance, Nanda Malini’s ‘Ammavarune’ is sung by different singers in a different tempo. But they do not know why my father chose Nanda Malini in particular to sing this song,” Gayathri notes.

Premasiri Khemadasa’s originality is mostly owing to the interfusion of oriental and western music. As Gayathri puts it, the genre did not matter to her father. What mattered most was expression.
“You see elements of oriental music in Manasa Vila. He never confined himself to the instruments or a particular genre. He looked for tools to suit his expression. So you get to hear instruments of both west and east in his music.”
Coinciding with the concert is an photography exhibition of unknown faces to pay tribute to the memory of the maestro. Named Unheard, the exhibition features the people engaged in random acts of kindness such as feeding the stray dogs or any other charity without any publicity anticipation.
“We always get to see the faces of sportsmen and artistes. But the people are made of all of us. They include these particular people engaged in noble deeds without expecting any return. My father came from the lower rung of the society. So this exhibition will be held to honour his memory,” Gayathri remarks.
Step into the BMICH on October 23 and relish in the Khemadasa memory relished as Gayathri joins hands with her sister, Aupama, to bring forth an extraordinary evening.
