Gammanpila’s alleged Rs 21 mn fraud case :
Shaddick’s wife denies giving false evidence

The wife of Australian businessman Brian Shaddick yesterday denied the suggestion made by defence counsel that she is giving false evidence.
This is regarding the alleged financial fraud case filed against the two accused, including Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila.
Witness Janet Elizabeth Shaddick, (69), was present before Colombo High Court A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe for allegedly misappropriating Rs.21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000.
The witness was cross-examined by defence counsel Shavindra Fernando PC.
Defence Counsel: Do you have any evidence other than the evidence of you and your husband to prove the allegations against accused?.
Witness: Yes, evidence are in the hands of police. I am just a witness.
Defence Counsel: I put it to you that you have failed to place them before Courts.
The witness: The prosecution will deal with these documents.
On a previous occasion, the witness had informed Court she had never put her signature executing a Power of Attorney to Udaya Gammanpila, for the selling of shares belonging to the Digital Nominees Company.
Further trial was fixed for June 19.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has cheated Rs.20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick.
The AG had listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with Shavindra Fernando and Senior Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the accused.
