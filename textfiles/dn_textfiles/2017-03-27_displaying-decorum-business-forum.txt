Displaying decorum at a business forum

Business meetings are an integral part of all corporate enterprises and partnerships. Your first priority is to get to the conference on time. You will not encounter much of a problem if the engagement is in the same office you occupy. But for an out-of-the-office meeting, arrive at the venue at least ten minutes ahead of the scheduled time. For in-house meetings, make sure you turn up at least about five minutes ahead.
The early-bird approach gives you time to get nicely settled and relaxed and prepared for any eventuality.
It is vital that you remain calm and unperturbed when the meeting begins and not all flustered and harried because you just cut your arrival too fine and rushed in.
Stay attentive
Essentially for any meeting or discussion you have to be prepared and unhurried. When requested to attend a meeting, make certain you know every possible detail about it.
Reassess the agenda and work out what would be expected of you and what you should contribute beyond simply attending. In other words, take a proactive, leadership role by always learning exactly what is going to happen at a meeting. Never try to guess the reason especially for a hastily summoned emergency meeting. Ensure you are as well-informed as possible. A wrong assumption on your part could leave you clueless and totally ill-equipped to play the role of an effective participant.
Your behaviour at meetings will be observed by your peers and superiors so don’t overstep the bounds of common courtesy. It is common to observe people while attending forums resorting to what is tantamount to boorish behaviour. These include viewing emails, texting, holding side conversations, and plainly not paying attention to the discussions. Learn to respect the chair and listen attentively to the participants expressing their views.
In the event you have sufficient time to make plans remember to organise your materials. A good idea would be to set up a temporary file or location to systematise and set aside all information needed for the particular meeting. Make sure you include a pen and pad.
Always make certain you adhere to the proper seating arrangements. At most formal meetings the seating may be designated. Don’t just barge in to a conference room and plunk yourself in the first seat that takes your fancy. Usually a secretary or co-ordinator will usher you to your selected seat. In the event there is no usher and you are unsure simply ask the ‘Chair’ where you should sit.
At most meetings the chair sits at the head of a long rectangular table, with the participants on either side. The most senior partner or guest speaker sits to the right of the chair. Always remain focused while the meeting is in progress. At times it is easy to get sidetracked. Make certain that nothing distracts your attention from the discussions at hand. You must stay attentive and take in the flow of the agenda and talks.
A heated debate
If your mind begins to wander you may suddenly find yourself caught on the wrong foot, so to say. You never know when you may be called upon to express an opinion or an estimation of the practicality of a project that comes within your purview. As such, avoid holding side conversations or comments to the person next to you and pay your undivided attention to the meeting.
Never forget the fact that you are a team player and that is the primary reason you have been requested to attend the discussions. For instance, the group may vote or go with a decision that may be contrary to your opinion. Once a decision has been made despite your diverging view make sure that you throw your weight behind the programme.
Never express recriminations after a decision has been finalised. And never complain about subjects discussed, or against specific people at the meeting. Any grievances should be aired with the chair, or perhaps with the specific individual who concerns you.
There are other meeting etiquette tips that should be adhered to even when the discussions may turn into a heated debate. Always keep your cool and an open mind to all ideas and comments shared. Never, ever attack a proposal or suggestion by saying things such as, “That’s a silly idea” or, “That is totally impractical and will never work.”
Another significant factor especially at higher level meetings is not to sound off too pompously. Protocol demands that you should first allow more senior level individuals to make their initial contributions before you begin holding forth. If you think your superior has missed a vital point in his address you could always dash off a hurried note reminding him of it and have it slipped to him.
Never interrupt
When it comes to your turn to address the gathering do not get carried away with your own verbosity and go on and on. Simply get to the point and end your comments as fast as possible, unless you are asked to elaborate on certain issues. In the event you arrive late for a discussion, quietly take a seat. But make certain you express your apology at the next appropriate break.
Never interrupt a speaker while he is holding forth. That would be considered downright churlish and rude. Allow the other person to finish his or her comments before you chime in. It would be appropriate to raise your hand to be acknowledged by the chair before speaking, if the meeting is a formal one.
Convention demands that you address all comments to the chair, even when responding to someone else’s comment, unless doing so is an acceptable practice within that group culture. Never make a fool of yourself in an endeavour to impress the other participants. Stick to this age-old adage and you will be safe: "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
Being an appreciated participant of any meeting requires you to be aware and adaptable to the many prevailing nuances, styles, and cultures. At the first meeting, it would be wise to remain silent until you are sure that when you choose to speak, your words will be well received.
As another old political saying goes, “What happens in the Cabinet, stays in the Cabinet.” This means it would be improper to share meeting information with all and sundry. Bear in mind that all discussions and information are confidential, unless otherwise stated. When in doubt, ask the chair.
Always keep your cool. Don’t take things personally or take offence at adverse comments. Remain calm and composed. Never raise your voice. Always speak clearly and concisely in a professional, low and even manner of voice and tone.
