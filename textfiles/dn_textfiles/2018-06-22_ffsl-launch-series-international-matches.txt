FFSL to launch series of international matches

The Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) is launching a series of international matches from July onwards as part of their long term strategy to bring back international games on home soil, an FFSL official announced at a press conference held at their headquarters.
Jaswar Umar, General Secretary of FFSL said that the Federation has now established a commercial department directly under his supervision with the support of AFC.
“The new department has now finalized its long term strategy that looks very existing than ever before and the international match campaign begins in a colorful style with two games from a Europe team Lithuania on the 8 and 11 July at the Race Course,” said Umar.
“The FFSL has very professionally planned these international games to mix both international commitments and to bring back football as a strong brand for commercial exploitation. Fans and other stakeholders will see very different experience and engagements before Match Day, on Match Day and after Match Day,” he said.
The president of FFSL Anura de Silva also shared views about the new progress and said, “We requested AFC president Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa that FFSL needs more practice international matches and the AFC have agreed and come forward to support us. This year we will play practice matches against Korea, Japan and Maldives. Our main concern is the South Asian Football Championships and we are towards it.”
The AFC president is driving his ambitious vision of One Asia, One Goal by supporting countries that require extra support from AFC.
They have already approved several special projects such as Mini-Pitch, President’s Development Initiatives Projects and Capacity Building projects for Sri Lanka. “The artificial turf that was funded by FIFA shall be used for the Sri Lanka National team’s preparation for International games. Complying with international standards, this turf provides an opportunity to train national teams for any weather conditions,” said De Silva.
“This is part of our football vision 2030 and there are many similar development programs scheduled to take place in the near future for the development of our country’s football right throughout the country,” General Secretary of FFSL Umar said. - KR
