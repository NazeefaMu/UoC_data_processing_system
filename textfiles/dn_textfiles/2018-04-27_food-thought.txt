Food for thought

The 16 SLFP rebels who quit the unity government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is planning to cross the floor of the House on May 8 when parliament convenes for the new session, and sit in the Opposition benches but professing to support President Maithripala Sirisena, rebel MP Laskman Yapa Abeywardena told the media the other day. He and the other rebels were adamant that they would not play any part in a government that has the UNP as its chief component. They insist that there cannot be a journey with a government in which Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Prime Minister. Ranil Wickremesinghe agamethi wela inna aanduwak samaga ape gamanak ne, Abeyweardena was emphatic. Dilan Perera too signaled in no uncertain terms that their association with government, that included the UNP, was now history, while Dayasiri Jayasekera, after some procrastination, finally stepped down, and, like the rest, attacked the UNP and its leader.
Amidst this brouhaha on the part of the SLFP rebels comes the news that Cabinet portfolios are once again for the asking for those who quit the government following the NCM, if indeed they return to the fold.
True, those who quit stand to lose all their ministerial perks, including salary cuts, vehicles, special accommodation at elite addresses, personnel staff etc. It will be interesting to see if there will be any takers, particularly after the public spectacle made by the departing ministers, virtually portraying themselves as martyrs.
Addressing a news conference, on Wednesday, SLFP spokesman Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said his party has informed the UNP that those who had voted for the NCM should also be given portfolios, if they so desire, adding the Premier Wickremesinghe was told in no uncertain terms of the SLFP's stand regarding Cabinet portfolios for those who voted for the NCM.
It is not clear if the rebels have been approached in this regard by the SLFP and if they (rebels) are willing to eat humble pie and accept Cabinet portfolios, once again, after what they have been saying about the UNP and its leader. But the likes of Mahinda Samarasinghe could not be unaware how these rebels, particularly the ex-ministers, conducted themselves while holding important Cabinet portfolios. For instance Susil Premajayantha was going about bad mouthing the PM at every turn, openly critical of the Hambantota port agreement and was publicly criticizing the UNP for ‘selling state assets’. Ditto for his erstwhile colleague Dayasiri Jayasekera, who, only the other day, shortly after leaving the government, was seen wrapping his arms around Mahindananda Aluthgamage in the company of Dilan Perera in the Fort Magistrate Court premises. How viable will offering Cabinet posts, once again, to such types, when it is quite clear where their loyalties lay, perhaps, Mahinda Samarasinghe will be able to explain.
Equally it will be untenable for the ex-ministers who voted for the NCM to sit in the company of Premier Wickremesinghe, at Cabinet. Also, in an ironic twist, being accommodated in the Cabinet once again, they will from time to time be compelled to vote for Bills presented by the Prime Minister in parliament, signifying their CONFIDENCE in the PM. Are they going to barter away their credibility, or whatever is left of it, in this manner? Besides, the return of the prodigals are not going to be taken to kindly by the young Turks in the UNP occupying the back benches who were vociferous in wanting the renegades thrown out.
Premier Wickremesinghe who is having a lot on his plate at the moment, no doubt, will be risking another rebellion within the party ranks if he sanctions the reentry of the 16 SLFP rebels who clamoured, and, is still clamouring for his ouster.
Believe It or Not
In one of the most bizarre happenings one would ever encounter, and one that could be right out of Ripley's Believe It or Not, a notorious underworld figure celebrated his wedding with full police protection at a reception hall in Wattala. The reason. A rival underworld leader was gunning for our man, according to a report in a vernacular newspaper.
Full police protection, including backup jeeps and motorcycle escorts were provided to the young couple right from Marriage Registrar's office to the honeymoon destination.
All the guests, numbering over 300, were thoroughly searched by a police contingent numbering over 20, at the reception hall with the Wattala OIC too in attendance. What is more, written orders to the Wattala Police for police protection for the wedding had come from the IGP, no less. This follows a request from the groom (to the IGP) that there will be an attempt on his life on the big day.
Below this particular news item another report states that two STF personnel who went on a raid to seize heroin in the same Wattala area were set upon and brutally assaulted by an underworld gang. The two policemen who were seriously injured in the attack are receiving treatment at the Ragama Hospital.
Sri Lanka, a land like no other.
