SL needs more private universities - Arun Miranda

Sri Lanka needs more private universities but their standard should be regulated, said Arun Miranda, Chairman and Managing Director, Trinity Steel (Pvt.) Ltd, Sri Lanka. He was speaking at the second day of the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017, at Cinnamon Grand, yesterday.
He said that private universities setting up in Sri Lanka should be accredited and regulated. He said the government university cannot cope with the demand from students and the solution for this is the creation of private universities.
He said that existing universities too could increase their student strength by having joint venture programs with foreign parties.
Former President, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Director and CEO Ceylon Breweries, Suresh Shah also endorsed this. “It’s a crime against the youth to stop opening new universities and depriving them of higher education.”
