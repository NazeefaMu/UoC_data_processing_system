Held in a time of change in leadership style and organizational functions, the National HR Conference 2017 focused on recognizing emerging HR leaders who tackle the challenges brought forth by ‘generational disconnects’ that prevail in the current business world.

In selecting award winners at the National HR conference, the judges followed a stringent selection process to choose leaders who had succeeded in delivering stakeholder expectations through transparent, credible and innovative HR initiatives.
In addition, the conference sought to promote the value of emerging HR leaders who actively work towards integrating technology and people to make organizations smarter, more conscientious and agile.
