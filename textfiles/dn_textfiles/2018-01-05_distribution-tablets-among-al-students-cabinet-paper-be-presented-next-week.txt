Distribution of tablets among AL students: Cabinet paper to be presented next week

The Cabinet paper to procure 200,000 tablets to be distributed among students entering Advanced Level classes would be presented next week, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Observing that the government has allocated Rs. 5 billion to procure the tablets, the minister said all the A/L students and teachers would receive a tablet each within the next couple of months. He said his signature was placed on the said Cabinet paper, yesterday.
The minister made these observations addressing a programme for school principals and officials at Temple Trees, yesterday, to make them aware on the government’s move to distribute mobile science laboratory kits to 3,000 rural schools.
He also said they have decided to make the IT subject compulsory for schoolchildren. He added that 150,000 laptops purchased on lease, would be distributed among schools that have classes above grade 6.
Commenting further on intended educational reforms, the minister said the number of subjects for the G. C. E. Ordinary Level Examination would be reduced from 9 to 6. However, the Minister rebuffed the claims that the History subject is going to be removed. “There is no such move. We have included History into the school curriculum,” he said.
The minister added that the English language, which was taught as a subject only from Grade 3 above, would be taught from Grade 1 this year. He said 26 vocational streams have been introduced for the students to follow after the Ordinary Level exam.
“No student will be left out after O/Ls when these reforms come into effect,” he said. He added that an independent Supervisory Board would be appointed soon to supervise the learning and teaching methods and physical resources of all schools including the private and international schools.
