Indian PM’s Sri Lanka visit based on political motives: Gunadasa Amarasekara

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka was based on political reasons and not to strengthen cultural ties, Federation for National Organisations Convener Gunadasa Amarasekara said.
Addressing the media at the National Library and Documentation Services Board yesterday, he said the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with India. It will extensively benefit India, he said.
Patriotic National Movement General Secretary Dr. Wasantha Bandara said the negative impacts of the MoU will affect Sri Lanka’s sovereignty.
He said Indian Prime Minister Modi’s speech at the Vesak festival was focused more on India-Sri Lanka relationship than on Vesak Day.
Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera said War Heroes should not be imprisoned to please foreign nations to get concessions such as GSP+.
The Thera said a War Heroes memorial ceremony will be held today at 3.30 p.m. at the Independence Square.
