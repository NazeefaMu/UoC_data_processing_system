President’s Committee fails, GMOA to strike

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will go ahead with all pre-planned trade union action pertaining to the SAITM issue because no people friendly solution had been given to the issue through the committee appointed by the President, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said an island wide persisting national strike has been planned by the GMOA along with the other organisations of the Anti SAITM People’s Barricade on September 21st. The GMOA Executive Committee has granted permission to go ahead with it.
According to Dr. Aluthge, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should immediately announce its stand on SAITM after considering the committee report and the media release issued by the President’s Media Unit. The entire country is waiting for the response of the SLMC. The GMOA has appointed a committee headed by GMOA Vice President Dr. Sanjeewa Thennakoon in order to study the committee report and the media release.
The committee has totally rejected all the requests made by several parties demanding a people friendly solution.The committee is purely aimed at legalising SAITM ignoring all the requests made by the GMOA, State Medical Faculty Deans, Lecturers attached to state Medical Faculties, students, unions, parents unions etc. The committee report deny its facts by itself and the committee is illegal because it was presented by others and not by the persons appointed by the President, he added.
