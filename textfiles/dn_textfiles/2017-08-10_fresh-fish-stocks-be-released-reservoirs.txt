Fresh fish stocks to be released to reservoirs

The freshwater fisheries industry is badly affected due to the severe drought prevailing in most parts of the island, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
According to the minister, small reservoirs in several areas have completely evaporated and fish resources of these reservoirs are destroyed.
The Fisheries Ministry will take measures to release fresh stocks of fish once the reservoirs are filled with water.
The ministry has taken measures to provide technical and financial assistance to promote inland fish breeding among families whose income is based on fishing at small reservoirs since the fish catch has drastically declined, said the minister.
