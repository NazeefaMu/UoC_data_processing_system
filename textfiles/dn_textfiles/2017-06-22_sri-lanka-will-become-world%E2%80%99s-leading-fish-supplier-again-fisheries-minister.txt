Sri Lanka will become world’s leading fish supplier again: Fisheries Minister

 
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Minister Mahinda Amaraweera assured that Sri Lanka will regain its position as the leading fish supplier to the world market in the next few years.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head quarters in Colombo he said that fishing industry received many benefits after Europe lifted the ban on Sri Lankan fish exports and granted the GSP Plus concession again.
About 40 percent of fish harvested in the country gets destroyed before being exported. Arrangements will be made to prevent this, the Minister said.
At the moment Sri Lankan fish export stands bellow the tenth place, but it is expected to climb up to the third place by 2020.
Furthermore the Minister said that three aqua culture parks will be constructed.
A Crab City will be constructed in the Hambantota district, he said.
Around 100,000 new employments opportunities will be availed by 2020. Around 10,000 employment opportunities have been already created, he said.
