Nation’s first Palliative Care Centre to open in Anuradhapura

The government along with Shanthi Foundation, an Australian registered charity, announced its plans to establish Sri Lanka’s first ever Palliative Care Centre in Anuradhapura.
This is a joint initiative involving the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease, the Health Ministry, the Sri Lankan High Commission of Australia and the Prime Minister’s Office.
The project is endorsed by the Palliative Care Associationof Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Medical Association.
Palliative care is the medical specialty dealing with the physical, psychosocial and spiritual well being of patients diagnosed with life limiting illnesses such as chronic kidney disease (CKDU) and cancer.
Sri Lanka has four hospices run by various charities but lacks a specialised palliative care unit to take care of the growing number of CKDU and cancer patients.
The proposed facility in Anuradhapura, estimated to cost over one million dollars upon completion, will have the capacity to hold 40 beds and plans to operate a mobile Community Palliative Care Unit (CPCU) to visit patients who are not ambulatory.
In addition to a palliative care clinic, the facility will house a training and research unit. The government will provide five to 10 acres on a 99-year lease (free of charge), for this venture.
The facility will be located within five km from the Anuradhapura hospital. Doctors and nurses working in the Anuradhapura hospital will provide care to the patients who will be referred by the consultant nephrologists, oncologists, etc.
The training and research unit will engage in collaborative research with Australian universities and hospitals to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are available in Sri Lanka.
