Students should be prepared for a changing job market- Akila

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday appealed to education providers to prepare students towards a changing and varied job market.
Speaking at the opening of the Edex Expo; career and job fair organised by the Royal College Union at the BMICH, Minister Kariyawasam said, “Our duty as education providers is to equip our youth to deal with this constantly changing job field and develop their skills for a varied job market”.
“We should also instil in children good working habits, desire and flexibility to learn new things”, added the Minister quoting research which showed that by 2030, almost 10 percent of the workforce would be employed in occupations which do not exist today and typical jobs which will no longer consist of 9-5 work hours but would be based on output.
The Expo which is to be held from January 19-21 has the participation of universities and higher education institutions from 20 countries.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attended as Chief Guest and handed over the Guinness World Record certificate to the Student Association of Royal College for breaking the record for the most number of water rockets launched simultaneously.
“The government on its party has identified education and skills training as one of the key factors for social and economic growth,” the Education Minister said.
He stressed that their two key programmes of making 13 years of schooling compulsory for all and the introduction of technical streams to schools, will have a positive impact on getting youth involved in the country’s development.
“After Grade 11, all students will be absorbed into the Advanced level class irrespective of their O/L results. These students can choose from seven career based paths if they are unwilling to pursue an academic path. Those who choose career based subjects will be given vocational and industrial training,”the Minister said.
