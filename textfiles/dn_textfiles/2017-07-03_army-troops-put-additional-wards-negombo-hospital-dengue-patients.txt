Army troops put up additional wards at Negombo Hospital for dengue patients

The troops of the 1 and 6 Corps of Engineer Services are constructing two new temporary wards at the Negombo General Hospital for dengue patients after the hospital authorities brought the lack of warding facilities to the notice of the President when he recently visited the hospital.
Commander of the Army General Crisanthe De Silva responding to the SOS need instructed the Corps of Engineer Services, Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps, and Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers of the Army to immediately commence the construction and equip the two new wards with necessary medical accessories, manpower and all other paraphernalia as soon as possible.
Just two days after the visit of the President, the Engineer troops have partly completed the construction and are giving finishing touches to both buildings by Saturday.
The Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps will provide 25 Army personnel for medical assistance, while the Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers will equip both wards with saline stands and other medical accessories.
The Army will put up a separate laboratory to conduct blood tests and other laboratory procedures.
