Investigation Officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority of the Southern region have accumulated a revenue of over Rs. one million from errant traders by way of Court fines in mobile raids and inspections throughout the Southern region last month.
According to investigation officials, 95 sudden raids were carried out in the Matara district, 76 raids in the Galle district and 108 raids and mobile inspections in the Hambantota district. The total number of raids carried out in all three districts last month was 297. The total income collected was Rs. 1,031,500.
Errant traders were prosecuted before the Magistrates’ Courts in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts.
The fraudulent vendors were indicted on counts of sale and display for sale food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling rotten food and food eaten by rats, weevils and insects, altering set prices marked on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sale of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority.
According to the CAA, complaints on fraud, malpractice and corruption committed by unscrupulous traders are pouring into the Authority. Under these circumstances, the CAA has enhanced its raids and mobile inspections to nab traders committing fraud and offences throughout the Southern region, investigation officials said. Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being held for schoolchildren, members of voluntary organizations, people and the trading community by the Authority.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, the CAA investigation officers are conducting raids covering the Southern region, they added.
