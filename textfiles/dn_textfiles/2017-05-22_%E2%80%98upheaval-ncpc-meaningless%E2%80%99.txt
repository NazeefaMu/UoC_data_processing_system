‘Upheaval in NCPC meaningless’

The upheaval in the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) is meaningless because Provincial Councils have been set up through a weak and powerless Act, Matara District Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene said.
Addressing a meeting held at Weligama on May 26, Abeywardena said the setting up of Provincial Councils could be likened to the Sinhala saying "changing pillows to cure a headache". Under the Act, a Governor could act according to his whims and fancies.
The common belief was that power is lost once a no confidence motion was carried through successfully. But this was not so in the case of Provincial Councils. In a Provincial Council, power cannot be changed through a no-confidence motion, he said.
"Even Prabahakaran opposed Provincial Councils because they were established under a pointless and useless Act," Abeywardena said.
"The North Central Provincial Council's present administration cannot be toppled by whatever means. The only option left was to prevent its proper functioning by resorting to acts of sabotage,” he said.
