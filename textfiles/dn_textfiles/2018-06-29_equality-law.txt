Affirmative Action Reverse Discrimination:
Equality before the Law

The universalism of life demands that all people treat all others equally, without discrimination. It is imperative that the distinction between formal equality and substantive equality be made since most often the attainment of formal equality is accepted as the attainment of the freedom to exercise rights freely. The formal approach concentrates on the treatment of all persons who are alike in the same manner. The treatment of a person of a group, for example, a particular race, in a manner different to that of other persons of the same race or group would be seen as discrimination by the formal approach.
The substantive approach, on the other hand, is not only concerned with equal treatment of the law but also with the actual effect of the law. This approach takes into account socio-economic inequalities and puts forward positive measures for the elimination of these inequalities. Substantive equality seeks to eliminate systemic and institutional discrimination against disadvantaged groups. In the case of substantive equality, the Government has a positive response to level the playing field for those who experience inequality. The affirmative action is a means in the form of a set of laws, policies and administrative practices to achieve substantive equality.
Country perspectives Sri Lanka
The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees the right equality before the law and the equal protection of the law in Article 12(1) and along with it paragraph (2) prohibits discrimination on the ground of race, religion, language, caste, gender etc. There was, however, an express provision in Article 12(4) enabling a type of affirmative action, albeit in very narrow terms couched as follows:
‘(4) Nothing in this Article shall prevent special provision being made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, for the advancement of women, children or disabled persons’.
From one point of view, this was not a radical departure from the equality principle as this provision may be regarded as a specific instance of rationale ‘classification’ which is permissible under the equality principle. It is not a contradiction of the right of equality which only requires that persons similarly situated be treated equally and does not require it when there is manifest inequality between persons which justifies special treatment.
Seneviratne v UGC
In Seneviratne v University Grants Commission (UGC) the petitioner challenged the quota system adopted by the respondent UGC with regard to admission to the public university system on the basis that it violated Article 12(1). The facts revealed that the scheme of admissions to the Universities provided for 55% of the places available to be distributed on the basis of ratio of population among the 24 administrative districts: 15% of the places were to be apportioned at the discretion of the Commission among 13 districts which were considered to be underprivileged and 30% of the places were to be decided solely on merit. The challenge was directed to the said allocation of the 55%.
The respondent UGC submitted to Court that by reason of the educational – socio-economic circumstances of Sri Lanka and the unequal secondary education facilities provided mainly by the government, the determination of entry to the universities based solely on the aggregate of raw marks of a candidate cannot be accepted as the sole criterion for higher education. Further, as the Commission contended, it must conform to the national policy set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 27 of our Constitution.
Wanasundara J., upholding the classification stated that the increasing number of students pressing for admissions and the woeful lack of teachers and facilities in most of the Provinces had compelled the authorities to modify the merit principle to meet the ends of justice. The departure from the merit principle, though unfortunate is inevitable.
Ramupillai Case
The question of the constitutionality of ethnic quotas in promotions in public service was considered in Ramupillai v Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and others, a matter referred to a Bench of seven Judges. The quotas were introduced by two Public Administration Circulars issued in pursuance of a Cabinet decision. The petitioner, a Superintendent of Customs, was an applicant along with 15 other Superintendents for 22 vacancies in the grade of Assistant Director. Of the first twenty-two persons eligible for promotions, 15 were Sinhalese and 7 were Tamils. The petitioner was 10th in the order of seniority and would have been promoted if not for the ethnic quota. On the application of the ethnic quota, 19 Sinhalese and 3 Tamils would be promoted, but the petitioner would be left out as he was the 5th Tamil on the list.
The Supreme Court, in its unanimous opinion, struck down the circulars in so far as they applied to promotions. The Court held that the Superintendent of Customs formed a single class. All of them should have an equal opportunity for advancement of their career in the public service irrespective of race, caste, religion etc. Fernando J. explained that paragraph (2), (3) and (4) of Article 12 are essentially explanatory and declaratory of the principle of equality. Affirmative action is not an exception to the principle of equality but its necessary corollary. Differential treatment of citizens on account of factors set out in Article 12(2) is prima facie unconstitutional but there seems to be no such presumption in the case of others factors.
The learned judge stated that differential treatment must be for a legitimate object only. If in relation to a legitimate object, their race reasonably makes persons of one race a distinct class, they may be equally treated. The same is true of sex, religion and political opinion. Thus, for the legitimate object of appointing a suitable person as a matron of a girl’s hostel, the male may be excluded. In appointing a teacher of a particular religion, persons of other religions may be excluded. The learned judge further stated that racial quotas cannot be imposed simply for the purpose of ‘correcting’ an existing racial imbalance, except perhaps where there is serious, chronic, and pervasive under-representation or over-representation sufficient to raise a presumption of past discrimination.
Fernando J. took the view that affirmative action is permissible both at the stage of recruitment and promotion, where necessary proof exists, but the proposed remedy would be more strictly scrutinized in the case of promotions on account of other compelling needs and interests such as efficiency, higher levels of responsibility involved upon promotion and the legitimate expectations of employees that merit and devoted services would be rewarded. Applying the above principles, the learned judge held that the State had failed to establish the justification for departure from the merit principle.
The United States of America
The US affirmative action policies were developed to address long histories of discrimination faced by minorities and women. They first emerged from debates over non-discrimination policies in the 1940s and during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1961, President John F Kennedy became the first to utilize the term ‘affirmative action’ in its contemporary sense in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and employees are treated during employment without regard to race, creed, colour and national origin.
In the US a prominent form of racial preferences relates to access to education particularly avenues to universities and other forms of higher education. In early 1970s Administrators of Harward University invented the Harward plan, one of the country’s earliest and most effective affirmative action programmes, which became a model for other universities around the country. Affirmative action is a subject of controversy in American politics. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college and graduate schools etc.
Bakke Case
The first major US Supreme Case dealing with affirmative action was Regents of the University of California v Bakke. The Medical School of the University of California at Daves had adopted an affirmative action plan that sets aside 16 % of the places in its entering class for disadvantaged minority students. By a five to four vote, the Court struck down the plan as violating equal protection. But at the same time, the court upheld the general principle of affirmative action and determined that consideration of an applicant race could be a constitutionally permissible factor in university admission provided that it was part of a properly devised admission programme.
Grutter Case
In Grutter v Bollinger, the US Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 vote that race could be used as one of several factors in professional school admissions without necessarily violating the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court found that the University of Michigan law schools’ narrowly tailored policy which considered race and other factors, with no quota or predetermined weight associated with the factors, was constitutional and appropriate ‘to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. The Court also ruled that University of Michigan’ undergraduate admissions system, which granted extra ‘points’ to minorities based on race and which determined admissions status based on cumulative points was unconstitutional because it is too mechanical and does not appear to consider the individuals actual contribution to the educational environment.
India
In India, while Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, Articles 15, 16 and 17 spell out some specific areas of non-discrimination. Article 15 provides that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, and that no citizen shall be subject to disability or restriction on any of these grounds with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places for public entertainments or use of wells, tanks, bathing Ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public. There are two exceptions to the operation of Article 15. Firstly, it will not prevent the State from making any special provisions for women and children. Secondly, it will not prevent the State from making any special provisions for advancement of any socially and educationally backward class of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Article 16 provides equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment under the State. It provides that no citizen shall on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for or be discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State. An exception is provided to this principle. There may be reservation of posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services of the State. A special provision may also be made for reservations in matters of promotions in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 17 abolishes ‘untouchability’.
It is not permissible to waive the requirement of minimum educational qualifications and other standards essential for the maintenance of efficiency of services. The reservation should not be excessive that it practically denies the reasonable opportunity of employment to members of other communities. The provision for reservation in appointments and posts under the State should satisfy two conditions, firstly, the class of citizens in favour of which reservations are made should be socially and educationally backward; and secondly, the particular backward class has no adequate representation in the given public service.
South Africa
Article 9(2) of the South African Constitution recognizes the validity of measures taken to protect or advance persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination. In this section, persons covered under affirmative action programmes are broadly defined, as persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, unlike Article 12(4) of the Sri Lankan Constitution or Article 15(2) and 16(2) of the Indian Constitution. In the Grootboom Case, the South African Constitutional Court found that community’s right to have access to adequate housing under section 26 of the South African Constitution had been violated. The applicants about thousand men, women and children lived in the West Cape where influx control policies were implemented. The State’s extensive housing programmes as an affirmative action programme instituted through both legislature and other measures although a major achievement, failed to provide in any way for these people in desperate need. The housing plan provided for the progressive realization of access to formal housing to be accessed through a waiting period of up to seven years or even longer. This was so in essence because the government’s housing plan did not pass the threshold of reasonableness contemplated by section 26(2) of the South African Constitution. The Court held that in order for a legislative policy framework aimed at the progressive realization of economic and social rights to be regarded as reasonable, it must be adequate and be comprehensive, coherent and balanced and flexible.
The affirmative action is not a refinement or extension or an exception to, the principle of equality, but its necessary corollary: it is applicable whenever unequals are being considered. However, all differential treatment need be justified to remedy the present effects of past discrimination and not to perpetuate fixed quotas.
