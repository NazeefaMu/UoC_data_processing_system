'Global corrugated box industry in crisis'

Paper related industries around the globe are going through a crisis and incurring huge losses during the past months due to continuous price increases by paper mills, said Chairman, Agrarian Insurance Board, Sydney Gajanayake.
Box manufacturers and other paper related industries all over the world have faced serious consequences and some of them have already wound down the operations in the face of unbearable losses they have been incurring. Under these circumstances, the industry does not have any other option but to pass this increase to consumers to sustain this impact.
The box manufacturers in some countries have been able to sustain by recovering the additional cost from their customers while some of them are yet struggling to get an adjustment. This situation may further worsen in the current year.
The escalation of paper prices started early this year due to sudden closure of around 300 paper making companies in China. The Chinese government has toughened paper manufacturing regulations to address air pollution and other environmental problems. Small- and mid-sized paper mills have been shut down for failing to comply with greenhouse gas emission restrictions and other regulations.
Making the situation worst, Chinese government imposed an outright ban on waste paper imports, which is the major raw material for the corrugated board production. With this, Chinese demand for paper in the International market suddenly amplified escalating the prices.
Although the market expected the Chinese factories to reopen by improving their production facilities, it does not seem realizing as most of the companies yet unable to reopen as they have failed to pass the Environmental Impact Assessments & stringent approval requirements enacted by the Chinese government, resulting in a major drop in domestic supply of paper alongside the drop in overseas supply.
The situation has been ongoing and paper is still in short supply. Hence the tendencies indicate that the global price uptrend will not necessarily be ending any time soon.
Moreover, the box makers and the paper traders had much expectations, the new plant started in Vietnam by the China’s largest packaging paper manufacturers; Nine Dragons, Paper would ease the situation to a certain extent.
Although the new paper mill has commenced operations in last September, it has not at all been able to make a significant impact to the scarcity of paper. They have also raised the price of its paper products significantly during the second half of the last year.
Although the waste pulp prices all over the world have come down slightly during the recent few months, it has not impacted towards the reduction of world paper prices. Generally, the paper industry announces price increases once in four years and for the last three or four years, rises and falls of the prices have been relatively stable.
But peculiarly with the given current market dynamics, the current price hikes are yet on upward trend though the crisis has started a year before. According to market information, the prices are forecasted to rise even further during the current year. The global market for corrugated boxes has been witnessing a surge and is expected to remain observing so over the next few years. The growth of corrugated box market is influenced by the growing trend of the online shopping and growing demand for product safety.
Geographically, North America is a major revenue generator to the global corrugated boxes market where the US market has become one of the most attractive place for the box manufacturers owing to the rising e-commerce venture and shifting trends towards online shopping. Europe is the second leading region and Asia-Pacific has emerged as the fastest growing region. This trend has resulted in high demand for corrugated boxes and paper and increasing the presser on paper price.
As per the information available from the local Corrugated Box Industry, they too are reeling under the disruptive blows. On-going paper price increases have badly affected the financial viability of the box manufacturers & they need highly excessive funds to secure the volumes and their bottom lines have turned negative in their failure to adjust the prices in the market adequately.
The Corrugated Box manufacturing industry, which is employing a significant workforce is playing a pivotal role in the Sri Lankan economy by producing almost 180,000 Mts of corrugated boxes per annum with the total market size of over Rs 25 billion per annum. In Sri Lanka there are around 30 corrugated box manufacturers from small to big-time.
The market situation basically shows signs of a perfect market situation. As per the local industry information, the various grades of imported paper prices have gone over 40% - 60% by impacting a 35% of cost escalation in their production. However, the local industries have been yet unable to adjust their prices adequately. The gap of over 20% in the pricing is absorbed by the box manufacturers creating huge losses in their bottom lines. In this scenario, some corrugated box makers and other paper related industries would face imminent closures during the current year.
The box makers are an important part of the Sri Lankan economy, as they add value to end product. Without boxes most of the products will not be able to deliver or export. The industry should have a reasonable margin to accommodate the improvements of the industry. The collapse of this industry may severely damage the export market & result in displacement of workmen employed in this Industry, which would be inevitable unless all stakeholders and respective authorities come to the rescue of the corrugated Box manufacturing industry of Sri Lanka.
