SriLankan, passengers celebrate BIA’s return to full operations

SriLankan Airlines celebrated the return to all day operations at its hub Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Thursday April 6, by feting all passengers who arrived on the first flight of the day with traditional Sri Lankan milk rice and sweetmeats.
SriLankan’s CEO, Capt. Suren Ratwatte, the crew of the aircraft and other senior officials of the airline joined in the celebration with the passengers, who arrived from the southern Indian city of Trivandrum on a state-of-the-art Airbus A320neo, the latest aircraft in SriLankan’s modern fleet.
BIA had been partially closed for eight hours per day over the last three months while its runway underwent resurfacing. With the completion of this project, the airport returns to 24 hour operations with immediate effect.
