All fiction is crime fiction

In this episode, V.V. Ganeshananthan and Whitney Terrell examine the omnipresent American comfort narrative of mystery and crime fiction. Why do we love crime stories so much? How do they shape the way we think about a whole host of real-world issues from the Mueller investigation to Black Lives Matter and the shootings of young black men by police? They are joined for this discussion by Mat Johnson, author of the novels Loving Day, Pym, Drop, and Hunting in Harlem, the nonfiction novella The Great Negro Plot, and the graphic novels Incognegro and Dark Rain.
Mat Johnson: The mystery form is the fundamental structure of contemporary storytelling, and the mystery comes out of the European Enlightenment and the idea that you can look at chaos and by applying your intellect you can come to an understanding through reason as opposed to just saying, “God did it,” right? But it has a direct impact on the story.
The first story starts with Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” and builds on that with Sherlock Holmes. But if you break down the mystery story, where you start with the conflict, and you try to solve that conflict and your initial attempt fails because the most obvious person didn’t do it or the story’s over, so you have to go through these pages of research. And by going through this research you build other experiences, you get other information, and then you come to a different understanding, that instead of it being A, it turns out it was B. That’s basically the structure for most contemporary novels. Even the loosest sense, if you have the most abstract novel, you’re still compiling information as you go through the piece until the end, where you reach some sort of larger understanding. So, I think that the way we think about story is already based on the mystery.
Whitney Terrell: Right.
MJ: But if you look before the Enlightenment, Beowulf does not fit that way of thinking. The Iliad does not fit that way of thinking. So, it’s kind of like mainlining story. You add on to that that we live in a society where most people follow the rules, and many of us may consider a crime at different points. But even more than considering crime, I think we consider the consequences of a crime. Like, “What would happen if I did this?” So, to watch people just break societal norms in a very direct way, is incredibly fulfilling. Whether watching that documentary Wild Wild Country about the Ashram in Oregon or listening to Serial, the podcast, or any of the other true crime things, I think we’re fascinated by those moments because they in themselves are interesting. But they also end up saying so much about how we think about the world.
V.V. Ganeshananthan: I never really thought of all stories as mysteries, but I suppose they are. I gave a lecture on conflict to a bunch of undergrads, and I was giving them an old Frank Conroy analogy, which is: your reader is a person climbing a mountain with a bag, and they’re collecting rocks of information, and if they get to the top and they’re carrying rocks they don’t need, they feel angry that they’ve been carrying weight they don’t need. WT: My students are going to love that because I use that one all the time.
