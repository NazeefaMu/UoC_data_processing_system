Twitter may aid response in real time-study claims

Twitter and other social media platforms can help track natural disasters in real time and alert first responders of the areas that need urgent aid, scientists say.
With over 500 million tweets sent every single day, new research is investigating innovative ways to use that data to help communities respond during unexpected catastrophes.
While local governments and relief organisations can measure a community's ability to respond to a disaster or measuring its impacts after, they can not monitor the effects in real time. Researchers from the Pennsylvania State University in the US demonstrated the ability of social media to alert first responders.
