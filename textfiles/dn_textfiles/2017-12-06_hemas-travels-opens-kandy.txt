“We are proud to establish our presence in the beautiful city of Kandy with its cultural, historical and geographical significance. Just as much as Kandy attracts foreign visitors from all parts of the world, there are also a significant number of Sri Lankans from Kandy and the surrounding areas who travel overseas on business, leisure and even for studies. With this awareness, we’re committed to giving Sri Lanka’s central region, the best in terms of service, customer care and ease in all aspects of travel,” said Jackie Weeraratne, General Manager of Hemas Travels.
Hemas Travels has made its mark in the industry as a trustworthy and reputed travel agency, renowned for its excellence. Within a span of 38 years, the agency has rapidly grown with the times and now enjoys top slot in the extremely competitive field of travel and tourism.
In addition to being appointed as the wholesalers for the national carrier Sri Lankan Airlines and most of the foreign airlines operating through Colombo, Hemas Travels has a large and comprehensive sub-agent network.
