Wooing the wild

Amrit Rajaratnam and Shanik De Silva are true wildlife lovers. Their passion for wildlife has led them on a journey that they have captured through the lens. ‘The Wild’ is the first exhibition for both these photographers which took place recently at the Lionel Wendt Gallery. The Daily News chatted with Shanik about this wondrous exhibition.
Q. Shanik tell me a little bit about the varieties that were on display?
A. There were 80 pictures on display at the exhibition. It was mostly centered around the African Savannah and its inhabitants. This included many landscapes and portraits of animals. There were also many from the wilds of Sri Lanka.
Q. How did you manage to capture these photographs? How many sites in Africa did you visit to capture these photos?
A. These pictures were taken over a period of about four years and over several trips to national parks in many countries.
Q. Why wildlife? What interests you about wildlife?
A. We have been fortunate to be introduced to wildlife at a young age by our parents, but it’s something you can appreciate and enjoy at any stage of your life. For us the solitude you get when you are in a national park and the enjoyment of observing animal behavior is what fuels the interest
Q. Do you plan to go elsewhere? As in, out of Africa to capture more wildlife photos?
A. Would love to
Q. Have you visited other countries to take photos of more species?
A. I have only been to some national parks in India but without much luck. Amrit has had better luck
Q. How old were you when you started this hobby?
A. I have been going to wildlife parks from a very young age but only got into photography about 15 years ago
Q. What kind of a camera do you use?
A. Canon DSLR
Q. Do you have assistants?
A. We go on wild life trips with friends and family for the enjoyment of the experience, photography is a byproduct of this
Q. What kind of adventures have you had taking these photos? Were you ever chased by an elephant?
A. Have had lots of adventures and funny anecdotes, will have to meet in person to elaborate
Q. What have you learnt?
A. Photography and animal behavior is a vast subject and you need to know both to get great photographs. It’s a subject you will learn all your life. Mostly from your mistakes.
Q. What message do you want
to give people about animals?
A. Protecting our wildlife and ecosystems is vital for our very existence. This has to be addressed at a macro level and a micro level. We need to have sustainable development that will let both humans and animals coexist and prosper
Q. Were you one of the many wildlife
enthusiasts who were horrified and appalled by the killing of Cecil the Lion?
A. There is a huge debate currently on whether trophy hunting should be allowed. The hunting lobby will have you believe that the money earned from hunting plays an important part in the preservation of wildlife and pays for its protection.
They also say that they only remove old animals from populations however there is no real justification for it. At the end of the day people are paying to destroy an animal, if they were really concerned about its welfare they could just donate the money towards conservation. The need to kill is what drives them and that cannot be a normal thing.
Q. Do you feel you have a duty to protect animals?
Especially endangered species?
A. Of Course, if everybody does their bit, we can make a difference
