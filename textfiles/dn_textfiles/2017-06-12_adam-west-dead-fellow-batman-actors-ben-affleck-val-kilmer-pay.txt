Adam West dead: Fellow Batman actors Ben Affleck, Val Kilmer pay tribute

 
Television’s original Batman, Adam West died on Friday night aged 88, many sharing their memories of the actor online.
Various fellow Batman actors, including Ben Affleck, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Conroy paid tribute, posting various emotional messages. 
“Adam West exemplified heroism. Kind, funny and an all around great guy,” wrote Affleck — who currently plays The Dark Knight — on Twitter. “Thank you for showing us all how it’s done.”

Kilmer, who played the character in 1995’s Batman Forever, wrote: “Ah dear Adam West. He was always so kind when we met. A real gent. Once when I was a kid we found ourselves in front the bat-mobile. I got in.”
Jason O’Mara and Conroy — both of whom have voiced animated versions of the Caped Crusader — also paid tribute, O’Mara writing: “The OG Batman who influenced every actor who played the role since. I always thought Adam West was really funny. Batman eclipsed him, but he used that to send himself up. His recent voice work was superb.”

Conroy posted similar sentiments: “The Batman of my childhood. He brought us so much entertainment and was a truly class act. We'll miss you Adam.”
LEGO Batman voice-actor Will Arnett said West “will always be Batman,” while animated film’s director Phillip Lord wrote “RIP to a childhood hero who showed us Batman was kind and good and flawed and funny.”
West’s family announced West’s passing on Saturday, saying in a stamen: “Our beloved AW passed away last night. He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy. We know you'll miss him too.”
