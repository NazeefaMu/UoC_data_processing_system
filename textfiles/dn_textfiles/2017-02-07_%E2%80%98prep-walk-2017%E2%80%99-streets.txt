‘Prep Walk 2017’ on the streets

St. Thomas Preparatory School, Kollupitiya, organised ‘Prep Walk 2017’ recently. It was organised by Parent Teachers Association and the Old Boys Union. This was the first time in the school’s history that a walk of such nature had been organized. Students, teachers, parents, and old boys took part in the walk.
The event was organised to raise funds to renovate the school’s very first building, Fortrose which was home to the school’s hostellers. It was built in 1938.
The walk began at Galle Face and continued from Galle Road to Kollupitiya Junction and along Dharmapala Mawatha to Piththala Junction, turn left and returned to Perahera Mawatha and Rotunda Gardens. Then the parties trekked back to school.
