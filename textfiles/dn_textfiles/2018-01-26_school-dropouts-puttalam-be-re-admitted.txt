School dropouts in Puttalam to be re-admitted

A special project to re-admit school dropouts in Puttalam, has been implemented by the Puttalam Zonal Education Office, Puttalam Divisional Secretariat, and Mullipuram GN Division Economic Development Movement, in collaboration with volunteer organizations such as WODEPT, CHANGE, and FRIENDS.
As the initial step of this project’s implementation, school dropouts belonging to 20 families in the Puttalam Mullipuram GN Division were identified on Friday (19) morning. Children who had been neglected by their parents were also identified.
The Puttalam Zonal Education Office Peace Studies Director, Teacher Instructor M. M. Mouhammedh, the Puttalam Mullipuram GN Division economic development officer and the volunteer organizations’ officers also participated.
It has also been planned to take such school dropouts and their parents to the Puttalam Police Social Affairs Branch in order to conduct inquiries regarding the reasons behind their decisions to drop out from their schools.
In the 1950’s, there were government officials in Puttalam called dakubar, whose job was to identify school dropouts, file cases against their parents, and re-admit them to school.
