‘Symphony of Freedom’ commemorates Indian Independence

Bollywood playback singer Usha Uthup performed at ‘Symphony of Freedom’ commemorating India’s 71st Independence Day, on Wednesday.
The event, organised by the Indian High Commission to Sri Lanka, was attended by High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, as well as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and his wife.
The event was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The High Commissioner spoke briefly before the performance, about the power and innovation of youth in both India and Sri Lanka. He said, “The average age in India is 28 years, and it is expected to decline to 25 years, while the average age in Sri Lanka is 33 years.”
Uthup, an Indian singer from Bombay, was born the same year that India achieved independence: 1947. Her first public singing appearance was on the Ovaltine Music Hour of Radio Ceylon.
Uthup is also a recipient of the highest civilian award offered by the Indian government: the Padma Shri.
