Workshop promotes peace and reconciliation

The International Youth Alliance for Peace (IYAP) in collaboration with British Council, Colombo recently conducted a workshop themed, ‘Active Citizen’ in the Galle district for five days under their project, ‘Peace Ambassador Leadership Programme’ (PALP).
The programme consisted of 25 participants from Galle comprising different religions and ethnicities including Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims. Four of these participants represented the Southern Province Deaf Association (SPDA). The participants were given guidance on how to achieve peace and reconciliation first within oneself and then in the nation.
The Active Citizens is a global network of community leaders being developed by the British Council and civil society partners in several countries.
The 25 participants will be trained throughout a year. The organisers will monitor and guide the participants in contributing to attain the end goal. The aim of the programme is to encourage them to act, think and work towards a peaceful world, ultimately becoming an ‘Active Citizen’.
