Be dedicated workers, Pathirana tells IDB staff

Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana urged the staff of the Industrial Development Board (IDB) to provide a dedicated service to the country.
The Deputy Minister was addressing the IDB staff, including Chairman Mahinda Jinasena, Director General P. L. U. Ratnamala and other Directors at the IDB auditorium, Katubedde, Moratuwa on August 21.
The Deputy Minister said: “I am aware that to serve better, one needs to have job satisfaction.
“If you are not satisfied with the work assigned to you, you will not be able to serve those seeking your service.”
The Deputy Minister added that those with problems can directly write to him and that he would attend to them.
IDB Chairman Jinasena, outlining the achievements of the IDB during the past three years, told the Deputy Minister that by the end of the year, the IDB would introduce a Food Laboratory and a Centre for Excellency for Robotic Application.
He also valued the support extended by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen in providing the funds to upgrade the services of the Industrial Estates.
