Two brothers drown in Deduru oya

Two brothers aged 14 and 16 drowned in the Deduru oya reservoir on Wednesday. When the younger brother got into difficulties after going for a bath, the elder one had rushed to his aid, but both had drowned in the reservoir.
Although neighbours fished them out from the reservoir and rushed them to Nagollagama and Wariyapola hospitals, both were pronounced dead. The duo, residents of Minuwangoda, were on a visit to a relative’s house to attend a birthday party.
