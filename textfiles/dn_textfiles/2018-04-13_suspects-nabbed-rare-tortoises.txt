Two suspects who were transporting five rare aquatic tortoises on a motorcycle sans number plates, were arrested by Wildlife officials of Nikaweratiya, Kurunegala, in the Bogollagama area, yesterday.
The suspects were identified as residents of Ambanpola. It was also revealed that they were in the habit of capturing tortoises, crocodiles, peacocks, jungle fowls and iguanas for a long time, to be sold to tourist hotels.
They confessed to hunting wild animals for over eight years in government forest reserves.
A team of officials led by Nikaweratiya Wildlife Unit Chief Officer I. M. G. Seneviratne, had conducted the raid.
