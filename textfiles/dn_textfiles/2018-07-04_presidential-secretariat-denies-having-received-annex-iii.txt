Presidential Secretariat denies having received Annex (III)

The Presidential Secretariat in a statement yesterday denied having received Annex (III) of the Bond Commission Report and stated that such a document was not included in the documents submitted to them.
Secretary to the President Austin Fernando in the statement stressed that several media reports quoting National Freedom Front MP Jayantha Samaraweera had stated that this Annexure was being kept by the President to the President and not handed over to the Department of the National Archives along with the rest of the documents, “The media keeps asking me to reveal what happen to Annex (III)”.
The MP in his statement had said that when he went the Department of National Archives to get the Bond Commission Report, he was told by the Director General of the National Archives that Annexes 1,2,4 and 5 could be released, with the permission of the Secretary to the President. However he was also informed that she had not received Annex (III) of the report.
“I would like to clarify that the Bond Commission presented us the report with only the Annexes (I), (II), (IV) and (V) and we did not receive any named Annex (III)”, said Fernando in his statement.
Further, he stated that Presidential Inquiry into the Treasury Bond Issuance, Secretary, S.Udugamasuriya in his letter PC/CBTB/Misc on January 11, 2018 had informed him that the reporet only had the above documents.
“Thus, I would like to state that I have nothing to say to the MP and all who have questioned me, with regard to a non-existent Annexure. My stance has been the same with regard to the imaginary 118 list”, stated the Secretary to the President.
