After an avalanche of disaster

The combination of nature’s torrential downpours with their resultant floods and landslides with shocking levels of human unpreparedness has brought about the unprecedented level of disaster that remains an unshaken crisis, raising important issues of bad governance, maladministration and regretful politics that remain the new challenges before society.
Bangladesh faced Cyclone Mora that found land there, but the numbers killed were very small considering the size and nature of the attack by nature, whereas Sri Lanka is still trying to live down the reality of more than 200 lives lost and close to a hundred still missing, in what was not a cyclone or tsunami, but several days of heavy and continuous rain. What has stood out as the biggest calamity in this situation is the shocking level of disaster unpreparedness displayed by government and the administration, raising major questions about the very substance of government and administration; posing important questions about the very nature and substance of politics that this avalanche of disaster, raises issues about the future of both politics and governance.
The initial reports that showed the sheer unpreparedness of Disaster Management was particularly shocking the country that faced the huge tragedy of a tsunami not very far back, which in fact led to the establishment of the Disaster Management Authority in the country. The early reports about the absence of sufficient candles, matches, and bottled drinking water to give to the people in need, displayed the total absence of planning to meet a situation that the country had been pushed into.
It was a political tragi-comedy that took place n Parliament, when its last sittings were adjourned early in view of the advance and spread of bad weather, and the reminder by the Speaker to MPs to visit their electorates and assist in relief work. The very need for such a reminder, even casual, showed the increased distance between politicians and the people. The next part of the Act was the announcement that the Government had cancelled all vehicle imports for ministers this year, with the aim of using these funds for flood and disaster relief. It was only the previous week that Parliament took up the debate of a supplementary estimate of more than Rs. 360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate official residences of others. The disaster faced by the people had brought into sharp focus the reality of the huge and wasteful expenditure of public funds being regularly undertaken for vehicular transport for ministers, as well the huge costs of maintenance of their official residences. The issue of vehicle imports for MPs and Ministers, often of the luxury brands, has been a subject of public debate, or rather public protest for some time. But, the fact that a national disaster of floods and landslides, required such imports at least to be suspended, showed the very absurdity of the levels to which elected politicians are being elevated through the gross abuse of public funds for their comfort and convenience, and nothing to do with service to the people.
Reality of weather reports
Part of the problem faced by the people in this crisis situation certainly had to do with their being largely ignorant of the reality of the weather reports leading up to what became a huge national disaster. It certainly was the duty of those in charge of Disaster Management, however unprepared they may have been to meet with the subsequent and real crisis, to keep the public informed of the increasing bad weather they were to face, and prepare them for the dangers that lay ahead. This was another aspect of the colossal unpreparedness of the organisations and offices that carried this responsibility.
Media reports show that the Met Department did report that continuous rains for at least 12 hours were experienced by some areas starting from 6 pm Wednesday (24) to 6 am Thursday (25). It also reported that heavy rains, high winds, severe floods and landslides will affect the country in the coming days, especially in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-Western Provinces. Floods and landslide warnings have been issued across the country’s southwestern part while residents near the Kalu, Kelani, Nilwala and Gin rivers have been asked to be cautious of the rising water levels. Once this information was available it was the duty of those in charge of Disaster Management to convey this to the people, with the urgency that it demanded, and take the necessary follow up action to get the people moving to whatever necessary locations of safety. Unfortunately, this did not happen, with the speed necessary.
It is also regrettable that important sections of the media, especially TV and radio, failed in this major task of keeping the people properly warned of the approaching dangers, especially after the Met Dept did make its announcements. Key TV stations are today engaged in an almost competitive exercise to gather relief for the vast number of people in need. There could be some criticism of the nature of these relief campaign programmes, with more than a touch of publicity to the station or channels concerned. However, that can be set aside, and their work of relief gathering and supply is certainly commended. Yet, the failure of TV and radio channels to warn the people of the approaching dangers, and prepared them for the possibility of moving to safer locations at speed, or with the dawn of the next day, is regrettable. It was not done. Neither did these sections of the media do enough to activate organisations of civil society that could have been a good interlink with the disaster unprepared state institutions, to get them moving much earlier than they finally did. The interruption of regular programmes and pushing aside regular advertising to carry these “urgent” messages would certainly have helped very much, to even partly overcome the unpreparedness of these state institutions.
The path ahead
The talk of some politicians sounds as if they are in the mood for an avalanche of change. But that cannot be the reality. What is necessary is a proper understanding of the disaster that has taken place, and look at the ways and means of preventing such situations in the future, especially in the context of the reality of Climate Change that the world is faced with, and which will certainly have its various impacts on Sri Lanka in the months and years ahead.
The Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, who has returned from his conference in Mexico, sees the necessity for new legislation to face up to future crises, caused by nature and the weather. He says that people are not ready to move to places of safety when asked to do so for safety, and wants legal provision to compel them to do so. He also says there could be the need for laws to prevent cultivation on major hill slopes to prevent landslides. These are certainly two major issues, and the availability of legal provision to carry out these requirements cannot be opposed. However, with regard to cultivation on hill slopes, it is necessary to have a more scientific approach, which will be underlined by the law. It is good to recall that in Sri Lanka and many other countries' high, steep hill slopes have been cultivated in the past, through terraced agriculture.
However, it is also necessary to make a proper assessment of the role of politicians in people occupying lands that are unsuitable for cultivation and other livelihoods, in view of the threats of nature. It is no secret that a large number of unauthorized occupations of land, as well as the filling up of land meant for water retention, has often been done on the instructions or directions of politicians, usually in government, whatever the political party may be. Therefore, it is best to be aware of the need to have incorrupt governance and administration, if any of the proposed legislation is to have any impact in facing up to any crises in the future.
The torrent of disaster the country is moving away from, while calling for necessary legal and other official regulations to prevent such developments in the future, also calls for a much larger stress on the removal of politics and politicians from the major tasks of government that have to be carried out in conditions that are free of corruption, favouritism, trickery and false, as well as moving into areas of secular activity that gives the due importance to science. Our society has to be steadily moved away from beliefs in spirits and divinities that have no links with Buddhism, if we are to begin a major path ahead to development.
