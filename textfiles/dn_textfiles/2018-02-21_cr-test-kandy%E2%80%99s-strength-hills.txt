CR to test Kandy’s  strength in the hills

CR & FC who are trying their best to live up to their past reputation in the rugby arena will travel up to the hills to meet the defending Clifford Cup champions Kandy Sports Club at Pallekelle today match commencing at 4.00 pm.
Kandy is the number-one ranked team in the country and the reigning league and knockout champions. They outscored CR & FC in both the league games.
In today’s game Kandy will be a bit more direct and physical, and they’ve got some really dangerous players to do that. Kandy has got a set of threes who are really good carriers of the ball.
CR & FC have a formidable set of players, and have a lot to give. Their defense will be tested to the hilt. They have strong runners in the forwards and backs and are a very sophisticated kicking side. They will have to be smart about the ball in contact, and keep that fast-up defence in the face of the Kandy attack. CR & FC it is reliably learnt is working incredibly hard to prepare for a tough matchup against Kandy having upset CH & FC in the quarters.
An overseas referee Sam Jones (Australia) will handle the whistle.
