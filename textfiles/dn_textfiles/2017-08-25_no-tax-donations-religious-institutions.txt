No tax on donations to religious institutions

The proposed Inland Revenue Act does not impose any tax on the money received by religious institutions as donations, State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Information Department, he affirmed that the tax relief given to religious institutions has not been revoked through the proposed Bill.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the recent statements made by former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the Hamabantota Port agreement and the Bond scam, the State Minister affirmed that the Hambantota Port agreement was legal and that was unanimously agreed by the Cabinet. He said that if anyone is objecting the collective decision taken by the Cabinet, needs to be removed. “The COPE report was presented to Parliament and the President appointed the commission to investigate on the issue. There was two years of talk and arguments about it, he (Wijeyadasa) should have done it at that time,” he said.
The Minister further said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will present their Joint Vision for 2025 on September 4.
