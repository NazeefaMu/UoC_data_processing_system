President’s media denies alleged ‘deportation request’

The President’s Media Division denied a media report which said President Maithripala Sirisena had requested British High Commissioner James Dauris to deport or arrest the editor of a website who is said to be residing in the UK.
“The said news item is incorrect and falsely reports the said meeting, and no request was made for either deportation or arrest of the editor of the claimed website or any other person,” a statement from the President’s Media Division said.
