Fireworks in Pakistan

The more you think of the 1982 Australian cricket tour of Pakistan the more you want to forget it stated Rod Marsh in his book “The Inside Edge.” “Quite apart from the fact that the Pakis beat the pants out of us in the three tests and two one day internationals, the country itself was to the western visitor a non event,” notes Marsh.
It was the American humourist Tom Lehrer, who once said: “If you want a long holiday, spend the night in Adelaide.” “I don’t know about Adelaide, it certainly applies to Pakistan,” mused Marsh.
He stated that the population was almost exclusively Muslims, which meant that it was illegal for them to drink liquor. Every Australian cricket team of his experience looked forward to a beer in the dressing room, after a long hot day’s play, and Pakistan seemed to have, more long hot days than most countries. So beer in the dressing room was out.
Marsh pondered that it was no great loss because most of the rooms were less than luxurious “quite grotty in fact” and it might have been a little depressing to stick around there too long.
They were far better off than the touring teams of the 1950s and 1960s, though, because since those days the major cities like Lahore and Karachi have acquired fine modern hotels. And being VIPs that’s where they stayed, noted Marsh.
They were lucky, too in being able to have supplies of Australian beer and canned fruit shipped in. That was really their staple diet. That might not sound too health promoting, but unless you care to play Pakistani roulette by living on their curries, there is little else for the tourists to eat. Now Marsh loved a good curry as well as the next man, but he never came to grips with eating it when he had a game of cricket to play next day.
He never left the field during a Test match to complete his day’s ablutions. He knew what a curry can do to the internal nether regions. Imagine that one of the devastating Pakistani concoctions could do to you, as you stood there behind the stumps all day. You’d make more runs than Bradman.
And none of them would count on the scoreboard.
So, Swan lager and canned Australian fruit it was. For Marsh anyway.
Some of the guys who’d not toured Pakistan before were a little more adventurous and ignored warnings about sampling the culinary delights of the mystic east. They certainly kept the team doctor busy with their stomach complaints.
Even the most cautious of us tended to live with perpetual mild diarrhoea. You know that get up and go feeling. Not get up and go out and play cricket like a man possessed, but got up and went to the gents or to the ladies if he couldn’t make it as far as the gents, noted Marsh.
I suppose if you were on a tour an extended tour of Pakistan and lived on beer and tinned fruit, you’d come home an alcoholic with fruit fly. He figured that it would beat the ravages of gut tearing, bowel blowing curry.
But food was not really the drawback over there. It was the boredom. God, the boredom.
The average day’s play starts at 10 a.m. and ends about 4.30. So you have got the rest of the afternoon and all evening free. But what do you do? Very little. Because there was very little you could do.
You went back to your hotel (in the bigger hotels they gave you a team room) you sat around. You just sat around.
Having been there before, Marsh made sure he packed a cassette player and lots of ammunition that time. At least they could listen to music.
They also had inhouse television movies and if anyone would like to hear Marsh recite the entire dialog of “The Sting,” don’t hesitate to ask.
He saw the bloody thing 33 times on that tour and he knew it off by heart. I also hum the theme team so well that you’d swear I’d composed it. Da da da-dum da dum,da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-dum. Saw?
Scott Joplin, you know.
Boredom can make a man-or a touring cricket team do silly things and we found our outlet in firecrackers. Firecrackers mind you.
A few of them went shopping during a rest day in Lahore and they came to a little shop specializing in fireworks, which were pretty big in Pakistan but as you knew, a thing of the past in Australia. Frankly, he would have agreed with every campaign to outlaw them at home because he thought putting a cracker in the hand of a kid was about as sensible as letting a drunk driver take the controls of a fully laden Jumbo jet, concludes Marsh.
When one takes a brief glimpse on the current team, surprises are the order of the day. The ones in the know have now decided to have a toss-up between the every bodies darling, Angelo Mathews with fitness issues and laid back attitude to boot and the “Bubbly Dinesh Chandimal,” who has been nobody’s darling till late. I hope sanity prevails and Chandimal “malli” will get to lead his mother country in the Tests and one-dayers and our friend Mr Angelo Mathews will do the honours in the T20, as we know he is a worldbeater in his own right in that format.
