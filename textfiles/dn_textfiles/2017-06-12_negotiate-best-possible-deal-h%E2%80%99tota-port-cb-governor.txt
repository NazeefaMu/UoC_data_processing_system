Negotiate best possible deal  for H’tota Port - CB Governor

 Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy stressed the need to negotiate the best possible deal for the long-term lease of the Hambantota Port.
The Governor expressing his personal view about the Hambantota port development project noted that he didn’t see the Hambantota Port as an isolated project. He was speaking at the 22nd convocation of The Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL) held at the BMICH, recently.
“Leasing the port is only a piece in a much bigger picture. Since independence, we have been able to do very little for the people of Monaragala and Uva. People of Hambantota have some assets which are not working for them.”
The China Merchant’s plan to develop the whole area in the Hambantota Port would create much-needed employment opportunities for the people in Hambantota as well as Monaragala. Similarly, Japan, India and Singapore plan to develop the Trincomalee area and would also create opportunities for the people of Rajarata as well, the Governor said.
In addition, South Korea and Andra Pradesh have shown keen interest in developing the Kurunegala and Kuliyapitiya areas while Japan is also supporting the Kandy development project.
According to Dr. Coomaraswamy, there is considerable support from the international partners to take forward major area development projects in Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya and other areas in the country.
Noting that the proposed development plans were sound, the governor stressed that concerted efforts were needed to make sure that the plans were taken forward to realize the set economic targets. The Governor further noted that plans were also put in place to support the growth framework of the economy in the area of investment policy and promotion, trade policy and trade facilitation.
“There are measures being undertaken for the effective improvements of all these areas, particularly to strengthen the growth framework going forward.”
“In addition, CBSL is introducing a flexible inflation targeting regime for monetary policy, which would enable the CBSL to have a much more forward looking, proactive monitory policy.”
