Sparkling 172 by Nishan

A scintillating unbeaten 172 runs by the Captain of Moratu Vidyalaya and Sri Lanka under 19 cricketer Nishan Madushka was the highlight of the drawn first eleven game between Prince of Wales’ College and Moratu Vidyalaya which was worked off at Vidyalian Grounds. However Cambrians led by 38 runs on first innings.
Batting first Vidylains were all out for 13 runs with Kaumal Nanayakkara claiming 5 for 33 and in reply Cambrians were all out for 151 runs with Devaka Peiris scoring 50 runs. In their second essay Vidyalians scored 225 runs with Nishan Madushka 172 hitting 6 fours and 7 sixes and occupied the crease for 213 minutes and faced 209 balls and also he along with Hashen Adithya put on 175 runs for the 6th wicket record partnership who contributed 20 runs.
