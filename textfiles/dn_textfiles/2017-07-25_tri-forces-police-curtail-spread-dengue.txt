Tri Forces, Police to curtail the spread of dengue

As Colombo and its suburbs see rising cases of dengue, the Army, Navy, Air Force , Police and Civil Defence Force members stepped up their campaign to help control the spread of this mosquito borne plague. Colombo city has seen a rise in dengue victims, partly owing to the issue of garbage disposal which has become a major issue in itself. It is disheartening to see many citizens not taking any interest to keep their environment clean, and help the nationwide alert to restrain the breeding of mosquitoes. The Public Health Inspectors are under much pressure to control these sites, as they seem to be stretched to the limit.

Since July 1st, the following numbers of troops have been involved in visiting houses and setting up clinics that offer free blood testing to the most vulnerable areas - Army (337), Navy (220), Air Force 230, Police and STF (568) and Civil Defence Force (245). These teams have been active in Kalutara, Gampaha and Colombo. They have been able to visit 38,245 residences (as at 15 July) and business premises. Some of the residents of Colombo had various opinions on this campaign. Many were of the opinion that the local Police and PHIs should implement the existing laws to prosecute those who by their wilful negligence propagated the breeding of mosquitoes. On the other hand, some were mildly disappointed that the Tri- Forces should come to check premises for dengue as they feel that the dignity and decorum of the uniformed men must be used only for national disasters like flood and landslide relief operations, where the military displayed their prowess and courage in helping the civil population. This scenario of deploying them for dengue related programmes has been the topic of debate even in the past. Nevertheless the Tri- Forces have been humble to accept this new mission and move forward to eradicate the plague as someone has to take the lead in prevention.
Director of the Police Environment Unit SSP Chulasiri said, “Every police station has an Environment Unit, and our officers have supported the ongoing campaign to eradicate dengue.” Clogged drains and waterways need to be cleared. It is time that people shared the responsibility of keeping their homes, gardens and environment in an orderly manner.
The Commander Security Force Head Quarters – West, Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe has been guiding his men in the Western Province, Galle and Matara regions.
He said, “We are working closely with the AGA and health officials of these areas, and supporting them in this massive campaign. Parents must take care of their homes and keep their children safe”.
At the end of the day it is they who fall victim to the fatal sting of the stealthy dengue mosquito. If the citizens had done their part, the plague would not have reached these alarming levels, which has caused the death of so many children.
