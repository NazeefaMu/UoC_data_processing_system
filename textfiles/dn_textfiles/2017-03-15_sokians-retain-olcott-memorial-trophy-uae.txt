Sokians retain Olcott Memorial Trophy in UAE

Defending champions, Dharmasoka College Past Pupils retained the crown as the 10th Olcott Memorial Trophy cricket tournament worked off at the Ajman Oval Ground, UAE with the participation of past pupils of Sri Lanka Olcott Community schools, namely Dharmasoka College (Ambalangoda), Mahinda College (Galle), Ananda College (Colombo), Rahula College (Matara), Maliyadewa College (Kurunegala), Nalanda College (Colombo), Dharmapala College (Pannipitiya), Dharmaraja College (Kandy).
Dharmasoka College was in Group B along with the Ananda College, Nalanda College and Dharmapala College and their first encounter was with Nalanda College which ended in a nail biting finish after both teams scored 79 runs each during their five overs. The match decided in the super over, where Nalanda College beat defending champions Dharmasoka College.
In their second match against Ananda College, Dharmasoka College scored 72 runs, but successfully defended that low score, largely due to tight bowling. Sokians recorded their first victory with a 20-run win.
Dharmasoka College end at second in Group B, thanks to their healthy net run rate in league. They met Dharmaraja College in semis, where Sokians piled up a mammoth 125 total (at 25 per over). Dharmaraja only managed to score 98 runs, allowing Sokians a cake walk to the final.
Final match was played between Dharmasoka College and Maliyadewa College where Sokians decided to bat first after winning the toss and posted a 98-run total.
Chasing a 99-run victory target, Maliyadewa College was restricted to a paltry 43 runs in their allotted five overs with all 10 wickets intact. It was due to superb tight bowling of Sokians, non of the Maliyadeva batsmen were able to pose a threat to steal the crown.
Sokians also won many of the special awards including the Man of the Match (Nalaka Thenuwara), Man of the Series (Nalin Thenuwara) and Best Batsman (Pasindu Prabhash).
