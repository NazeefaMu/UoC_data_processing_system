Notes in harmony

‘Friends in Harmony” (FIH) orchestra presented an enjoyable and entertaining concert at the Russian Cultural Centre, on October 11.
Fifteen members including instrumentalists and singers were on stage. FIH orchestra consists of 46 players and singers, mostly professionals of diverse disciplines, who have got together for the love of music. The theme of the concert was “UNITY”. This was clearly demonstrated by all on stage representing a multi-ethnic mix enjoying unity as a team and harmony in their performance. The spirit of unity was further enhanced effectively in words by the compere, Ashan Algama who is also an accomplished musician.
Friends in Harmony Unity Concert displayed their versatility in presenting an enjoyable programme of selections from their wide repertoire ranging from evergreen Semi-Classics, Broadway favorites, Latin American music, haunting melodies and popular music across the world, Hindi music, waltzes and dance music, and the much loved Sri Lankan Sinhala and Tamil golden oldies and Bailas.
Friends in Harmony Concert was a special performance in which the audience showed that they were at ease to participate from time to time by singing along, clapping, tapping and swaying to the music. This was clearly visible from the spontaneous response of the audience especially when Dr. Prashanthi Mendis (Ethno-musicologist and Lawyer by profession and Co-Director of FIH) accompanied by the accomplished musician - Mrs. Indrani Wijesundera (Director of FIH) began her selection of pieces with a truly brilliant performance of “In the Mood” followed by “Kimada Nawe” and “Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White” on the Caribbean Steel Drums which is an unusual musical instrument for this part of the world on which any music from the East to West can be played.
An extraordinary rendition of the romantic Sinhala song “Ganga Addara” of Nimal Mendis popularized by late Vijaya Kumatunga was effectively delivered with a great deal of feeling by Dr. Prashanthi Mendis on the Caribbean Steel Drums in the second half of the programme. One verse was sung beautifully by the accomplished singer (and medical doctor) – Dr. Nilanka Wickremasinghe while Prashanthi played the drums. They were effectively accompanied by Mrs. Indrani Wijesundera. This rendition was indeed a charming and unique interpretation which was greatly appreciated by the audience.
The brilliant solo renditions of “Love Changes Everything” and “Sound of Music” by Dr. Nilanka Wickremasinghe were enjoyed tremendously by the audience with much applause. The other special vocal renditions which added color to the concert, to name a few, were the duets of Victor and Lancelot, Damian and Hashan.
“Kandy Perahera” done by Friends in Harmony orchestra with an entry by Akila from the entrance of the concert hall to the stage playing the Tammattama Drums was another unique item on the programme which was enjoyed by the audience.
The programme included a sing along and baila dancing with audience participation.
The grand finale was the audience standing up, crossing their hands and joining the “Friends in Harmony” Orchestra and Singers by singing “Auld Lang Syne” with a cheerful spirit of unity.
