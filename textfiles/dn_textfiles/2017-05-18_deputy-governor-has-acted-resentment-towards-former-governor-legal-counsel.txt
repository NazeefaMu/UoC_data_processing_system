Deputy Governor has acted with resentment towards former Governor: Legal Counsel

Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe has acted with much resentment towards former Governor Arjun Mahendran, suggested Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva yesterday.
De Silva further suggested that Dr. Weerasinghe has given directions to remove Mahendran’s name from the list of former Governors displayed in the Central Bank website.
De Silva also asked Dr. Weerasinghe had he not ‘broke down and cried’ when former Governor Ajit Nivaard Cabraal was stepping down from his post. Dr. Weerasinghe said he did not cry, but made an emotional speech.
De Silva then asked whether Dr. Weerasinghe make a speech at a party held at the Economic Research Department and said ‘Mahendran’s new year wish lacks weight’ and that his intention is to ‘lose Arjun Mahendran’.
Dr. Weerasinghe said he only wanted to get back the reputation that the Central Bank lost because of the doings of Mahendran. De Silva questioned as to how Mahendran’s wish relevant to gaining back the reputation of the Central Bank. The witness seemed unable to justify his comments.
Mahendran’s legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva also pointed out to the Commission that, Dr. Weerasinghe’s actions regarding the confidential draft report prepared by the IMF and the World Bank, is questionable.
De Silva pointed out that Dr. Weerasinghe had not even copied the link of his reply email to the IMF and World Bank regarding the draft report to the Central Bank Governor.
De Silva’s suggestion that Dr. Weerasinghe has acted with resentment towards former Governor Arjun Mahendran was based on these suggestions.
De Silva pointed out to the Commission that Dr. Weerasinghe’s testimony also is based on the same resentment.
Dr. Weerasinghe was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
