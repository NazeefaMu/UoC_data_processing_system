One among the greats

Elizabeth Moir School’s IGCSE results have maintained its position at the top of the world rankings of international schools, based on a survey of leading schools who publish their full results online.
After its students achieved the best IGCSE results of any international school in the world in 2016 and the second best in 2017, this year the school’s results are the third best in the world behind Dubai College and Harrow International School, Hong Kong. Elizabeth Moir School has consistently been placed in the top three in the world since it first took the IGCSE exams in all subjects in 2011.
For the third year in a row, over half of all papers were graded A* and almost all A*-B. All thirty-eight students achieved at least one A grade, with seventeen achieving seven or more A* and A grades.
Noah Le Berre achieved 11 A* grades, more than any student achieved in the Edexcel examinations in Sri Lanka last year. Kaavya Gnanam and Nashmoon Sheena both achieved 10A*, with a further four students obtaining 9 A*.
Three students won awards for achieving the highest mark in Sri Lanka in a subject at IGCSE, including Ameli Vidanearachchi, whose 97 percent in Chemistry was the highest mark in the world. Gaeun Kim won the prize for IGCSE Art, the fourth year in a row one of the school’s students has won this award. The school’s strength in Mathematics was reflected by Reanna Bakshani coming top in Sri Lanka in IGCSE Maths, in addition to a student winning the A-Level Maths Prize.
