Death penalty will be implemented - SLFP Media Spokesman

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Media Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena has assured that there is no second word on the death penalty which has been approved unanimously by the Cabinet of Ministers for convicted drug traffickers who are still engaging in drug dealings from inside the prisons.
“Although there is pressure from several countries and organisations not to implement the death penalty, the President has been very firm in his decision and the death penalty would be implemented” Minister Samarasinghe said.
“We are ready to go anywhere and explain why it was necessary to impose the death penalty for drug traffickers who are on deathrow as the entire country is adversaly affected by the drug menace,” the Minister said.
“If we do not take urgent measures to address this issue by now, the future of our next generation would be in danger,” he added.
He said that intelligence units have already informed the President that convicted drug traffickers on deathrow are engaged in the drug dealings.Since the entire Cabinet of Ministers have agreed to this decision, it is the bounden duty of all to support this effort,” Minister Samarasinghe said.
A total of 54 countries retain the death penalty in law while 105 countries have abolished it for all crimes, with an additional 29 countries abolishing the death penalty in practice.
Commenting on the loan repayment for the Hambantota Harbour, the Minister said that loan installments of the harbour will be paid by the Treasury and not the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Minister Samarasinghe said that the Treasury has received US974 million from China and another US$ 146 million will be received in the future. “This money will be utilised for the direct investment in the harbour on the agreement between China and Sri Lanka,” the Minister said.
