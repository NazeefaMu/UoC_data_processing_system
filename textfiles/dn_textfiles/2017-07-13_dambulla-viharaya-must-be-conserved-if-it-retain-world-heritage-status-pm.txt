Dambulla Viharaya must be conserved if it is to retain world heritage status: PM

It is essential to conserve the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya if the historic site is to retain its world heritage status, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a group of young Buddhist monks who met him at Temple Trees yesterday (12).
“The Government is prepared to stop the conservation work if the Maha Naya Theras want it stopped. However, it is up to the Maha Nayakas to decide the fate of this historical site. It is unfortunate if the Cave Temple Complex is to lose this status at a time UNESCO is considering the declaration of several other Sri Lankan sites including Horton Plains as world heritage sites,” Primier Wickremesinghe said.
PM Wickremesinghe said that the UNESCO has informed Sri Lanka to prepare a report regarding the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya within 2017.
The Premier also said that he would meet the Asgiriya Maha Nayake Thera next week to explain the matters regarding the issue.
PM Wickremesinghe also said some people attempt to politicise the issue targeting the next election.
