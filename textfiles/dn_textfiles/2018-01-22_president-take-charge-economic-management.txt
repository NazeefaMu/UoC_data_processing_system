President to take charge of economic management

President Maithripala Sirisena said he will take charge of the country's economic management this year in order to lessen the Cost of Living burden of the people.
"It was for this purpose that I appointed a national economic council three months ago and he will handle economic management through this council in order to provide economic relief to the people," the President said addressing a Jana Hamuwa held at Kegalle on January 20. President Sirisena said he would assume the responsibility of strengthening the national economy by protecting and safeguarding local industries, products and local investments.
The President said he would earnestly request all local industrialists and investors to join hands with him to uplift the motherland without seeking greener pastures abroad.
"This country is blessed with unlimited national resources needed to transform it to a highly developed nation in the world. But, corrupt politics stood in the way of achieving that goal. He would therefore launch his march towards crying halt to corrupt polities with the February 20 local government elections” the President said.
Along with the February 10 election victory he would launch the march towards making this country an enlightened state by rallying all religious leaders intellectuals and the general public under a single flag.
Referring to pledges held out to build several large scale reservoirs in Kegalle district, the President said a project to direct the mass of water now draining into the sea without towards the Northern Province through a tunnel network would be launched with the help of new technology without damaging the natural resources of the district while ensuring effective flood control systems.
A massive gathering attended the Kegalle Pola grounds as part of the election rallies held countrywide under the patronage of the president.
The rally organised by SLFP Assistant Secretary Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was attended by Minister S.B. Dissanayake, Central Province chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and others.
