Sampanthan calls for more Thai investments in North, East

A meeting held between the visiting Thailand Prime Minister Gen.Prayut Chan-o-Cha and the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance Hon. R Sampanthan in Colombo yesterday.
Sampanthan commended the progress made by Thailand in the past. He stated that Sri Lanka was unable to advance in development due to the longstanding conflict, which has not been resolved for the past 70 years.
Speaking on the need for Investments in the North and East, Sampanthan requested the Prime Minister to encourage the Thai private sector to invest in the North and East. “The people in the North and East are in need of employment opportunities and their economic status must be uplifted,” he said. Appreciating the initiatives taken to establish a sugar factory in the North by Thai investors, Sampanthan requested more of such investments to these areas and highlighted the adverse impact of the war in achieving development by these very hard working people of the North and East. He emphasized that more investments would certainly uplift the economic condition of the people in North and East and in the whole of Sri Lanka.
While assuring that he will certainly encourage the Thai Investors to invest in Sri Lanka the Thailand Prime Minister also requested Sampanthan to extend his support to facilitate these investments in the future.
