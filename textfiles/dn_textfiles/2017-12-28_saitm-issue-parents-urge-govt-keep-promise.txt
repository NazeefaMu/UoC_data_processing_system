SAITM issue: parents urge govt to keep promise

There should not be an institution called the SAITM after December 31. If the government does not keep its promise, all anti-SAITM forces will get together and re-launch the anti-SAITM struggle, Medical Students’ Parents Union Secretary Gamini Ekanayake said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said if the government fails to keep its promise made to the country, the union will commence an island-wide campaign targeting the upcoming Local Government elections and tell the entire country how the government fool the people.
“The Parents’ Union stopped the fast unto death after Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva promised to abolish the SAITM before December 31. But now it seems that it is an utter lie,” he said.
