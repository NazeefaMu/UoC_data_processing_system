Helpage Sri Lanka shows Elders' strength

Helpage Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Polonnaruwa District Secretariat and the Elahara Divisional Secretariat in Bakamuna, celebrated 'International Elders Day' on a grand scale.
The main feature of the day's programme was the 'Elders walk.' Around 500 Elders participated in the 'walk' which commenced from the Bakamuna Divisional Secretariat premises. The elders who were between the age of 60 - 84, had arrived from surrounding villages of Elahara and Bakamuna. They displayed their strength and raised an awareness among the slumbering general public, who took note of their presence in retirement after contributing their share for a better morrow for the 'new generation.' The walk was a sure means of sending their message to the larger society, highlighting the multi-faceted issues faced by the elders and encouraging the younger generation to take care of the elders in their homes, instead of dumping them in elders' homes. They displayed eye catching banners and posters with messages to capture the hearts and minds of those that mattered.
Sunimal Perera, a 71- year- old retired principal, said that it was the first time the elders in Bakamuna and Elahara villages participated in a 'Walk.' The elders were treated with refreshments and lunch by HelpAge Sri Lanka and the Pradeshiya Saba, when they reached the Bakamuna Mahaweli grounds at the end of the walk.
The elders who were felicitated at a ceremony at the Bakamuna Mahaweli Stadium, entertained the crowd with song, dance and drama. HASL, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said the 'Walk' had reflected the strength of the elderly population.
He said people in the Polonnaruwa District were happy to see elders showing interest by participating in the 'Elders Walk' to raise awareness among the public towards caring and respecting the elders. Liyanawaduge said that 98 per cent of elders in the country lived with their families and also highlighted the increasing 'abuses to elders' which could not be tolerated.
Helpage Mobile Unit was present with free spectacles and medications.
Polonnaruwa District Secretary S. Senaratna, former Bakamuna Pradeshiya Saba Chairman Amarawansa Mohottige and NCP Chief Secretary W.T.J. Manel were present on the occasion.
