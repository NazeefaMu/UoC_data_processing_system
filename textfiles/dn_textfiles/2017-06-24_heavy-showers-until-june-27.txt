Heavy showers until June 27

The Meteorology Department yesterday stated that fairly heavy showers (about 75-100 mm) should be expected at some places, particularly in the Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kaluthara, Gampaha, Colombo, and Galle districts.
The Department said showery weather is expected in the next few days (until June 27), especially in the south-western part of the country from today.
Fairly heavy showers can be expected at some places, particularly in the Colombo, Ratnapura, Kegalle, and Kaluthara districts.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central, and North-Western Provinces and in the Galle and the Matara districts.
Showers or thundershowers may occur at few places in the Uva Province and the Batticaloa and Ampara districts after 2.00 p.m.
Temporary strong winds during thundershowers may occur.
The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning, the Department said.
