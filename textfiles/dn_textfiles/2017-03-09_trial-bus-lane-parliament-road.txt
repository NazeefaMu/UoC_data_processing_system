Trial bus lane on Parliament road

A trial bus lane on Parliament road from Rajagiriya to the Ayurvedic junction will commence on March 12 to prioritise developing bus transport as a short term strategy to address Traffic congestion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said that this programme is implemented as a monitoring project and will be introduced countrywide if proved to be a success.
Minister Ranawaka added that the objective of this monitoring project is to identify the issues created by such a programme in the country.
He also said that if this project could reduce the traffic congestion by five minutes each day, around Rs.6,000 million could be saved. He also said that the country loses Rs.350 billion each year due to traffic congestion.
Minister Ranawaka was speaking at a press conference at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry auditorium at the Suhurupaya, Battaramulla yesterday.
The Minister also said that the country has spent Rs.one trillion on road construction during the period of 2013 and 2014.
He added that although such an amount was spent, the issue of traffic congestion has not yet been solved.
Minister Ranawaka said there are 10 million trips made by residents within the Western Province on a day. He added of these, around 50 percent end up in Colombo city and the immediate suburbs. Around 50 percent of these trips are made by public transport. "In the 1980s this was over 85 percent," Minister Ranawaka said.
"Increasing personal incomes and deteriorating quality of public transport have jointly caused this rapid decline. The resulting use of a personal motorbike or car for travel or even the use of a three wheeler has increased rapidly. However, if 40 people using a bus choose to use a private vehicle, the road space requirement to fill a mix of motor cycles, three wheelers and cars needed to carry those same people, will now be equal to 7-10 buses. As the incomes increase, more people buy and use private vehicles and this is creating a huge increase in demand for road space. However government cannot add road space at the same rate as the demand. Land for roads is not always available. Even when available and acquired, it takes time and money. Road construction is also expensive. Elevated or underground roads are much more expensive."
The Minister said that this matter has been discussed with the relevant institutions and hoped everybody ,including the private vehicle owners, would cooperate to implement this programme.
Minister Ranawaka also said that Colombo is not alone in battling traffic congestion. Some cities like Singapore City have avoided congestion by planning it carefully while adopting the most appropriate transport policies. Other cities like Bangkok and Manila have constructed expensive railways and expressways with limited success. Some cities like London, Bogota, and Seoul have stood out having successfully managed traffic congestion through developing buses and trains and getting vehicle owning people to use buses and trains.
Minister Ranawaka also said that a bus lane alone will not be successful. "This is only a start. If indeed a separate lane is found to work satisfactorily, then new and modern low floor buses should be introduced," Minister Ranawaka said.
"Over-crowding should be addressed through better schedules, cashless-ticketing, park and ride, passenger information needs to be improved. The good news is that all these can be implemented in the short term and at relatively low cost- especially to the government. Unlike an expensive rail system or a new road, a modern bus service with new buses and new routes that will attract even car passengers out of cars in traffic blocks can be implemented within a few months. This is the hope with which the trial bus lane is tested."
