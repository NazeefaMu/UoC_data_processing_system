Vinuja Ranpul excels for Cambrians

Cambrian Vinuja Ranpul missed a well deserved century by four runs in their Inter School Under 15 Division One Tournament second round third cricket match played against Tissa Central which was worked off at Moratuwa.
Batting first Prince of Wales’ College scored 225 runs and Pasindu Pathum too contributed 43 runs and in reply visitors were shot out for a paltry 52 runs giving their opponents a 173 runs first innings win. Kunchana Perera had a fine spell of 4 for 9 runs while Samudra Medis claimed 3 for 18
By virtue of this win Cambrians are through for the pre quarters and they are the leaders of their group.
