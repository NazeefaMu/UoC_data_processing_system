Fisheries Ministry to support dengue prevention programme

Fisheries Ministry has decided to extend their support for the dengue prevention programme launched by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Accordingly, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has directed the Director General of Fisheries Christy Lal Fernando to direct the relevant authorities take measures to remove and dispose potential dengue breeding equipment such as unused boats and other equipments that would collect rain water from the coastal line.
The minister has also directed to implement a mosquito prevention day during the month.
