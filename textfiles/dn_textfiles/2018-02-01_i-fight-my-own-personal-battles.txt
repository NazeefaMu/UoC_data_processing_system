I fight my own personal battles

Even as her latest film ‘Padmaavat’ drew ire from various feminists including Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar, Deepika Padukone has claimed the film “looks at the power of women”.
“Today again we are standing up for ourselves with dignity... I find her journey so relevant today,” Deepika said about her character in the film, Rani Padmavati.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmaavat’ was released January 25 after months of protests and threats. ‘Padmaavat’ has been facing protests and death threats by a group called the Karni Sena ever since the shooting began in January 2017. The protests continue even now, and the film saw limited release in a few states owing to the violent protests.
The film also stars Shahid Kapoor, who plays the role of Maharawal Ratan Singh and Ranveer Singh, who plays Alauddin Khilji, but it was Deepika who faced the wrath of Rajput community who issued death threats to her.
“When Rani has so much strength, why would she need others? In my personal life I fight my own battle, I don’t need anyone,” she added.
When lyricist Javed Akhtar called Padmaavat the “Mother India” of her career, Deepika was on cloud nine. But what gratified her more was that her parents praised her performance.
“My parents have seen the film and they were proud of my work, but there was a sense of disbelief, like they were thinking is she our daughter? As I don’t stay with them, they don’t know much in detail about the role or the film. I want them to enjoy the film as a normal audience. They had no idea about ‘Padmaavat’ and the story. The last 15 minutes of the film for my parents were tough... they hate it when I die in films,” Deepika said.
The lavishly mounted film has so far minted Rs 110 crore at the box office over the weekend and the leading lady is overwhelmed with the response.
For Deepika, playing the part of Rani Padmini in the historical drama was the most difficult role in her decade- long career. “This role of a queen had no crutches like she doesn’t have a sword, she doesn’t get on a horse and goes on battlefield - but there is sheer inner strength and resilience which I had to show through my eyes,” Deepika said.
