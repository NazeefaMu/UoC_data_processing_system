LAUGFS launches rooftop solar project

LAUGFS Power launched an ambitious project to install solar PV systems on the rooftops of all possible premises of LAUGFS’ businesses.
As the first phase of this initiative, 324 kW and 47.5 kW grid-tied rooftop solar PV systems were installed with an investment of Rs. 49 million at the LAUGFS Rubber factory in Horana and LAUGFS Holdings Head Office in Colombo respectively.
Launched in line with the Soorya Bala Sangramaya program by the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, the grid-tied rooftop solar PV system at the LAUGFS Rubber factory is expected to generate 490 MWh of clean energy and offset 350 MTs of CO2 emissions to the environment every year. The rooftop solar PV system at LAUGFS Head Office in Colombo is scheduled to generate 68 MWh of solar power, while offsetting 48 MTs of CO2 emissions per annum.
Adhering to international standards and taking advantage of the latest technologies, solar panels sourced from globally reputed US and Korean manufacturers have been used for the installations by LAUGFS Power.
“As a renewable energy solutions provider, LAUGFS Power has invested in both mini-hydro and solar power generation over the years. This newest project to convert all possible rooftops of LAUGFS’ businesses to help generate solar power, will enable us to significantly reduce our dependency on the national grid, while enabling us to continue to minimise our environmental impact,” said LAUGFS Power General Manager, Mahinda Senarath.
As per the Central Bank Report 2017, around 69.2% of the electricity demand in the country is at present met through fossil fuel based power generation. With the continuously increasing energy demand in the country, LAUGFS Power has further strengthened its investments in renewable energy solutions, primarily focusing on solar and mini hydro. It currently operates the country’s largest solar power project in Hambantota.
“With increasing economic activity, demand on energy will continue to grow and at LAUGFS Power, our focus is on supporting this rising energy requirement with sustainable energy solutions. That is why as a group, we have invested in our own businesses with this project to generate renewable energy through solar power, enabling us to reduce our dependency on non-renewable energy sources for our energy requirements. This means we will be able to significantly reduce our carbon footprint, while delivering cost advantages in the long-term for our businesses,” he further said.
“With this project initiated by LAUGFS Power, our LAUGFS businesses will become electricity producers and support the government’s ambitious plans to increase the stake of non-conventional renewable energy in power generation in the country.”
