Prison inmate protests from Dambulla Court roof top

An inmate of the Pallekele Prison staged a protest by climbing on to the rooftop of the Dambulla Magistrate Court yesterday.
He demanded to expedite the hearing of cases against him and not to transfer him from one prison to another. He came down from the roof top around yesterday, after the intervention of a Provincial Council member.
