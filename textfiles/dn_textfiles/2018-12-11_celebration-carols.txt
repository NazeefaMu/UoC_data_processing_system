A celebration of carols

Elizabeth Moir School Senior and Junior Choirs and Orchestra, and the choirs of Royal College and Trinity College Kandy will join together to present an evening of carols.
‘A Celebration of Carols’ will be a rare combination of contrasting musical traditions representing both diversity and unity through song. Trinity Choir Director, Lasantha Tennekoon joins Elizabeth Moir School Choir/Orchestra Director and Royal College Choir Director Sureka Amerasinghe to present the programme.
Speaking about the upcoming event Sureka said, “It’s that time of year when everyone comes together in unity and harmony to end the year with well known Christmas carols regardless of religious beliefs. The Moir school choristers are eagerly awaiting this opportunity where they get to explore a range of choral traditions while collaborating with the Royal College Choir and the Trinity College, Kandy Choir too. This year the Moir school orchestra will also perform on a range of instruments from violins to flutes, saxophone to cello, and even steel drums!”
Sureka went on to speak about Sri Lanka’s rich and diverse range of choral traditions. “The Trinity College choir is steeped in Anglican traditions and has firm classical roots. The Royal College choir,which will celebrate its centenary next year, has a wide repertoire ranging from classical to pop and folklore. The Moir school choir takes a contemporary approach and has been known to be a vibrant presence on stage”. ‘A Celebration of Carols’ will take place on December 14 at 7.30 pm at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour.
