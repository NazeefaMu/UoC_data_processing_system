PUCSL mulls on rooftop solar PV regulations

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) intends to issue guidelines and advice on government policy to support the implementation of the rooftop solar and achieve the set policy targets.
The government has set a target to achieve one million rooftop solar PV plants within the next ten years.The Government also launched “Battle of Solar” or Soorya Bala Sangramaya in view of promoting Rooftop solar PV in the country with a target of achieving 200 megawatts of capacity by 2020 and increase up to 1000 megawatt capacity by 2025.
Sri Lanka recorded 74 MW of total installed capacity through rooftop solar PV by August 2017, data showed. The same stood at 28 MW, a year earlier.A 46 MW of a capacity of rooftop solar was added to the national grid since the Battle of Solar was launched.
It is also seen that the day peak of electricity demand in Sri Lanka is growing faster than the night peak. Therefore, “Aggressive implementation of these schemes will also benefit Sri Lankan utilities and consumers by reducing the reliance on diesel power generation of the national grid and reducing costs,” the consultation paper said.
The PUCSL invites stakeholders views, suggestions, recommendations, concerns and comments related to following areas’ Suggestions to improve the existing framework (eg. Net-metering Application process, an estimate for net meter installation, cost etc), Financing for Solar PV installation, cost, payback and the benefits of solar PV as an individual and the country as a whole, Instillation standards, workmanship and installation best practices, Technical constraints and options for grid connection and Any other concerns and ideas to ensure the achievement of targets set by the government under “Sooryabala Sangramaya” program.
The draft consultation paper is available at www.pucsl.gov.lk for reference.A printed copy of this report also is available at the Information Centre of the commission.
