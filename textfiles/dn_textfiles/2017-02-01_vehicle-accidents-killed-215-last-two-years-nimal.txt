Vehicle accidents killed 215 in last two years: Nimal

The prime duty of the National Road Council for Road Safety is to assist road accident victims and try to bring down the number of road accident victims in the future, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The minister said 215 have died of unidentified vehicle accidents in 2015/2016 and 400 others had been seriously injured during that period.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony at the ministry to mark the awarding of compensation payments to persons seriously injured in vehicle accidents and the next of kin of those who had died of such accidents.
The event was held on January 30.
The minister said the victims of vehicle accidents become helpless when those responsible for committing such accidents go unidentified.
“Those receiving compensation on that day belonged to that unfortunate category,” he said.
The minister said this system of compensation payments had operated since 2008.
He said they had been able to pay a total sum of Rs. 765,000 for 137 seriously injured persons and Rs. 11,555,000 in respect of 165 persons who had died of such accidents since 2008.
De Silva said he had suggested that the compensation paid to a seriously injured person be increased from Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 100,000 and the amount be paid in respect of a person who had died be increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 200,000.
The minister said his suggestion had now been implemented and they were awarding Rs. 1.8 million in respect of 18 seriously injured and Rs. 2.8 million in respect of those who had died, at the ceremony.
“However, the value of a life of a road accident victim could not be really assessed in monetary terms,” de Silva said.
The minister said the non – implementation of safety networks and poor standard of roads were also major contributory factors towards vehicle accidents.
“Similarly, failure to wear seat belts and wearing of interior helmets by motor cyclists were other factors contributing to such accidents. On the other hand, negligence on the part of pedestrians was another factor leading to road accidents,” he said.
De Silva said drivers and pedestrians should make it a point to observe road signals before crossing the road.
He said the regulation relating to wearing of quality helmets would be enforced from April 1.
