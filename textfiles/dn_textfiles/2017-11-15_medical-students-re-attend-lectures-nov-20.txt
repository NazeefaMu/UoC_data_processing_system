Medical students to re-attend lectures from Nov. 20

The government Medical Faculty undergraduates will re-attend lectures from November 20 as the issue of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has received satisfactory solutions, Convener of the Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) Ryan Jayalath said yesterday.
Responding to the Daily News, Jayalath said the re-attendance does not mean that they have given up on their battle against the SAITM. Since there were favorable solutions forwarded, he said they decided to cooperate.
“However, we are not hundred percent satisfied with the solutions given. This also does not mean that our protests will completely cease. We are waiting until the government implements these proposed solutions soon.
We won’t allow them to bid time for a way out from implementing these solutions,” Jayalath explained.
