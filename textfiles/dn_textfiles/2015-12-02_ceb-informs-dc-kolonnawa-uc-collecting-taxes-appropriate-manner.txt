CEB informs DC: Kolonnawa UC collecting taxes in appropriate manner

The Ceylon Electricity Board on Monday (30) informed the Colombo District Court that the Kolonnawa Urban Council was collecting taxes in an inappropriate manner.
Coordinating Secretary Shyama Perera made this remarks while giving evidence on behalf of the CEB, consequent to a case filed against the Kolonnawa Urban Council.
The CEB had filed this case against the Urban Council in accordance with Section 236 of the Urban Council Act.
The evidence was recorded before Colombo District Judge T.D. Gunasekara.
