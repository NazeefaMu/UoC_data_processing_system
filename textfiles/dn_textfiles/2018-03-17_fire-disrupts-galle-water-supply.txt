Fire disrupts Galle water supply

Water supply for Galle was restricted owing to a sudden fire that erupted at a water treatment plant in Wackwella, Galle.
The fire had damaged the electronic machinery unit of the plant.
However, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWDSB) assured an uninterrupted water supply to hospitals including the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and Mahamodara Maternity Hospital amidst disruptions.
The Galle NWDSB Regional Manager said that the restoration work on the dented plant had been already initiated with the help of experts on the board and that the plant would be revamped and would be ready to function by noon, yesterday.
The board further informed the public that they had limited the supply of water to the region until the completion of restoration work.
