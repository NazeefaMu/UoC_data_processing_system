Major setback for farmers in Lunugamwehera, Tissamaharama

Farmers in Lunugamwehera and Tissamaharama complain that invasive plants have covered their lands and they cannot now receive an adequate harvest since the soil of their lands is not fertile as they were in the past.
They said they cannot cultivate subsidiary crops amidst invasive plants. The invasive plants have spread everywhere and the farmers’ attempts to remove them have been futile.
Therefore, they request relevant officials to take steps to remove them with modern equipment.
