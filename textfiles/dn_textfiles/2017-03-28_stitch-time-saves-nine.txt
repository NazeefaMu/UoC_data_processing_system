A stitch in time saves nine

Students’ violence in the country has reached alarming proportions. The other day , it was reported both in the electronic and print media that an unruly herd of black sheep had had a skinful in the holy precincts of their school and got intoxicated to the fullest and admitted to the nearest hospital by their own teachers. They were virtually in disgrace. The teachers are so pupil-friendly and it is said that the teacher is a caretaker and a facilitator in the modern sense.
Liquor is generally associated with the so called big Matches of the prestigious schools. The past pupils gather under the school flag on that day for some time and leave the match for a nearby rendezvous to have a fag and a drink. They return to their places having drunk and start cheering quite unconsciously. If their great alma mater seems to get defeated they encroach on the pitch and make a big pandemonium. This is the situation that I have witnessed for several years and now I avoid most of the big matches due to disgust. They become the role-model for the young children and they develop a certain idea how to behave at a big match when they become grown up children. This is how liquor got associated with the school system. The Dutch courage tradition has come to stay. Yet, no one can raise the accusing finger at all the past pupils because they represent only a small segment. Yet, that negligible faction could spoil the system. They do an irreparable damage to the whole education system of the country.
Student violence
Student violence in the present context depicts a different picture and the immediate attention of the higher authorities seems to be paid, because it is advisable to nip it in the bud before it makes a cancerous effect on the whole system paving the way to a total collapse. Mihintale Maha Vidyalaya goes into the educational map of the country as the first school where without even the first hairs on their yet to come out moustache, students consumed liquor in the very holy premises of their education. Above all, Mihintale is a sacred city and the holy land of the Buddhists as Arahant Mahinda consecrated the land by touching the earth with the sublime feet. Pilgrims from every nook and cranny visit Mihintale with pure feelings of Shraddha. These students spoilt the spirit of the Buddhists not in uncertain terms.
Yet, the incidents of this nature are not really rare. I had a very authentic piece of information from a teacher in the southern province which would straighten the eye brows of any civic minded person. Once, the teachers of a certain big school had organised an educational excursion as a part of the annual school calendar. It had been a three day tour to Rajarata. On the eve of the tour, some pupils in Grade Eleven had brought a sample bottle of toddy to the school classroom. They had started sipping the fresh toddy with loud cheers. Vigilant teachers had reported the matter to the principal and the discipline master had rounded off the little rascals. Lo and behold, a girl had supplied the sample to the boys. At the inquiry it had come to light that the girl student’s parents had run the business of moonshine in the locality with the blessings of the ‘authorities’. Their due share had been readily supplied free of charge.
Sil campaign
Let me relate my own experience to convince the gravity of the situation. Once I had the good fortune to work in a big school. The principal and the staff organised a Sil campaign and observation of Sil was made mandatory for all the students. Some black sheep publicly declared that they would not come. The arrogant principal told them that deterrent punishment would be meted out. Lo and behold again, on the day of the Sil campaign those students came having had a skinful and started vomiting in the main hall while the Buddhist sermon was in progress. Next day, they were to be punished at the morning assembly.
When the first name of the culprits was announced and the punishment was about to be given another culprit fainted. The rest of the culprits took him away from the assembly ground and the principal’s plan flopped. What I noticed was that the children of the new generation possess ultra-active intelligence and imagination and it should be exploited for the good of the country. If proper guidance could be given, they could be made the partners of progress. In a way, there is a sound message to be given to the school authorities. ‘SPARE THE ROAD AND SPOIL THE CHILD,’ Awareness of the human rights could play havoc in certain situations. When I was on a UNO teaching assignment in the Republic of Maldives, a young student phoned the police there and complained of punishing by his father. The immediate response was that the police arrived at the scene and in a fraction of a second they handcuffed his father. The rest is history.
Now, it seems that it is high time to reconsider the implementation of human rights for the good of the country. Our ancient system of child rearing seems the best for our country. We should not allow the west to make our country the guinea pig for human rights experiments and let the country ruin. We have our own cultural identity in these matters. I am convinced that it is not human rights education that should be introduced to the curriculum, but Sociology, Psychology, Criminology and other relevant disciplines that speak to the very heart’s core of the affective domain of the children. Otherwise our children’s psycho motor domain would ruin the country in the near future. The very recent, pandemonium and the fracas at YASODARA would reoccur and make a cancerous effect.
I would like to put another pertinent matter on record here. The teaching of General English has become an utter failure throughout the country. Because of the weight of the other three subjects, most of the A/L students dodge the General English periods. Some truly intelligent students spend their time usefully, but most of the unruly students play havoc in the school premise. The educational authorities turn a blind eye to this alarming situation and parents’ requests fall on deaf ears. Once a soft spoken fair woman on the staff where I worked was crying bitterly. On my asking she told that some filthy words had been hurled at her in the general English lesson. It is the ground reality.
University system
The crux of the matter is that those who are in ivory towers are not aware of the ongoing situation in the school system. So, they come out with unworkable solutions to these problems in the most vital department of life.
A pragmatic approach is of paramount importance to arrest the situation. The problems of the university system too should be immediately heeded, unless the whole country would have to face the music in the near future.
The influence of the social media and the unprecedented violence on the small screen, aggravate the already calamitous situation in the society.
The deterioration of the decorum in the august assembly and the politicians at the local level fuel some other disastrous situations. In a nutshell the whole country is going to be embroiled in a treacherous bog of an acute moral paralysis.
This situation is not confined to our country. In our own neighbourhood and also in the west the gravity is the same. The other day, I happened to know over the internet that a female teacher had unethically engaged with a student to get her carnal desires satisfied.
To clinch over, it seems that some clouds of gloom are floating in the eastern sky not allowing the evening star to shine to dispel darkness. The leopards and lions would pounce on our lambs. A severe catastrophe seems to be in the offing.
