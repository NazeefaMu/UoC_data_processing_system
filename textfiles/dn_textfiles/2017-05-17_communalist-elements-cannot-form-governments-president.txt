Communalist elements cannot form governments - President

It is only a political movement that ensures social justice to all communities including Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims which can form governments in the country in future, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
A person thinking on communal lines can never form a government in this country, President Sirisena said addressing a meeting after opening a new three storeyed building at the Kaduruwela Muslim Madya Maha Vidyalaya on May 15.
President Sirisena who emphasised that all people should live in unity and brotherhood as people of one country said they all should act with intelligence and understanding and beware of extremist elements in all communities who were trying to sow the seeds of disunity by creating tensions.
The President said community, religion or political party should not be a criterion in allocating funds for development work since such allocations should be based on the needs and requirements. Educational development was essential to produce knowledgeable and disciplined citizens who could promote development in the country.
The government was ever willing to allocate funds needed for the development of material and human resources in the education sector.
He said there should not be communal divisions in education since the government treated all children alike without communal distinction.
He said construction work on the proposed harmony school which would enable children of all communities to pursue education together, which is being gifted by the Indian Government at his request would be launched this year.
President Sirisena who arrived at the Kaduruwela Muslim MMV received a cordial welcome from its students. The President opened the new building by unveiling a plaque.
The new building is part of the Rajarata Navodaya - Pibidemu Polonnaruwa district development program initiated by the President.
The President also distributed prizes among students who had shown excellence in there studies.
North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, Parliamentarian Sydney Jayaratne, Principal A. Iqbar and members of the tu tonal staff and parents were present.
