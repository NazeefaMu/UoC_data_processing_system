[CITIZENS' Mail - (27-09-2017)]

Schoolchildren put in their place
School students should not be allowed to participate in protests or agitation during school hours or after, the Education Ministry said recently.
The ministry said special approval should be obtained from Provincial Education Ministries, Provincial Directors of Education and the Zonal Directors to hold such protests.
It also advised schools not to allow any individual or groups to enter school premises to address students or to meet teachers.
The Ministry said in case of unauthorized entry to the school campus, a school should inform the Police to ensure the protection of students and the normal functioning of the school.
The Ministry learns that several student organisations are attempting to mislead schoolchildren by giving the wrong perspective of the ongoing programmes and their organised campaigned has caused obstruction to the academic activities of schools.
This is an excellent preventive action taken by the Ministry of Education.
We are very kindly appealing to the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education to extend the above precautions and orders to all universities.
See what has happened to our universities. There is no discipline. Many students are boycotting classes. Politicians are misleading university students. Trade unions are using university students to win their demands.
Student union leaders are harassing the university students.
They are not learning and do not allow others to learn. These thugs are controlling and running the show in the campus. These thugs have become heroes in the campus. University teachers have no control of the situation.
These students are attacking security forces also. This is a form of terrorism that has gone out of control.
We request University Grants Commission to follow Education Department and take some meaningful steps to manage the universities. It may be difficult. Remember we want leaders to do difficult things.
