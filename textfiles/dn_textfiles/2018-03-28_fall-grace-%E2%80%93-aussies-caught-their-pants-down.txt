Fall from grace – Aussies caught with their pants down

Australia has been renowned over the years as a great sporting nation and many countries have made them the benchmark to emulate if they want to become successful in sports.
Cricket is a game that Australia has reached zenith heights. It is a game they play with a lot of passion with no quarters asked or given. Australia is also well-known for their sledging of opponents and for trying to put them off by making false accusations to distract them from their main priority that is to try and compete and beat them.
The ball tampering incident during the third Test against South Africa at Cape Town, involving Australian captain Steve Smith and team mate Peter Handscombe that has shaken taken the entire cricket and sports world is nothing new to a nation like Australia who have been getting away with almost similar kinds of tactics in the past.
Sri Lanka has been the victim of three such incidents starting with the cunningly devised plan to get legendary off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan banned from international cricket. The cricketing world knew that Muralitharan with his unique bowling action was going to be a threat to any cricket nation and that he would end up with a pile of wickets if he is allowed to continue playing. The Aussies tried to nip it in the bud by having one of their umpires call Muralitharan for chucking during the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne in front of a large audience. From that point onwards it was a battle for Muralitharan as well as Sri Lanka Cricket to try and defend his bowling action. Having failed in their first attempt the Aussies again got their umpires to call him when Sri Lanka made a tour there four years later in 1999. Many years later, one of the Australian umpires who called Muralitharan for throwing, Ross Emerson admitted that he did it on the instructions of a Cricket Australia official whom he did not name. Muralitharan however with his conscious quite clear that he was not resorting to any methods of cheating to obtain his wickets fought against all odds carrying the stigma of being branded a “chucker” throughout his career to eventually succeed and become the most successful bowler in the history of Test and One-Day International cricket.
Five years later in 2004 during the third Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the SSC grounds Justin Langer committed some very questionable sportsmanship and got away scot free with only a warning from ICC match referee Chris Broad whose judgment of incidents on the field varies like the English weather.
Langer appeared to knock one of the bails off the stumps as he walked past when changing his fielding position in mid over. After the next delivery the Aussie team en mass made a hit wicket appeal against batsman Hashan Tillakaratne after one of the bails was spotted on the floor by captain Ricky Pointing. It was turned down after TV replays appeared to show Langer knocking it off as he walked past the stumps. There was a lengthy hold-up while the third umpire scrutinised footage of the incident and gave Tillakaratne rightly not out. Langer insisted he had "no idea" the bail had fallen off, saying: "I'm glad common sense has prevailed." He added: "It goes without saying that had I known, I would have picked it up and put it back on straight away." However a few questions remained unanswered. Why was Langer running so close to the stumps when moving to a different fielding position? As anyone who has played cricket at any level knows, you shouldn't go anywhere near the wicket if you are not batting, bowling or fielding the ball. Why didn't wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist notice one of the bails was missing as he focused on the delivery after Langer had 'accidentally' dislodged it? Isn't it the job of the wicketkeeper to stand behind the stumps and follow the flight of the ball and to watch the movement of the batsman? Surely he should have known Tillakaratne had not dislodged the bail. Finally and most importantly, would another team apart from Langer's Aussies get away with such a crude act of gamesmanship? Langer was charged under level one, clause two of the ICC Code of Conduct that states that players should not "engage in conduct unbecoming to their status which could bring them or the game of cricket into disrepute". He could have been fined up to 50% of his match fee if found guilty. But match referee Chris Broad said Langer had given an "honest and succinct" explanation and had been "reminded" to avoid any such incidents in future.
The third incident involves Gilchrist himself when he slaughtered the Lankan bowlers for 149 off 103 balls to win the Cricket World Cup for Australia in 2007 in the Caribbean aided by a squash ball in his left glove to help him with his grip.
Gilchrist’s stupendous innings left the cricket pundits wondering how legal was his innings and how authentic was Australia’s World Cup triumph? Can a batsman carry an object - in this case, a squash ball - not connected with cricket to help him on the field? Did he secure the prior permission of the umpires? Was the fielding side captain aware of the use of the squash ball and did he approve of its use?
And, above all, did Gilchrist’s “hidden ball” give him an unfair advantage in knocking the daylights out of the Lankan bowlers? Hypothetical questions that left cricket haters plainly mystified but keeps cricket lovers breathlessly debating the whys and wherefores till kingdom come.
Law 3 (6) (c) (i) specifically prohibits a player from using equipment other than that permitted which is a helmet, leg guards (pads), hand gloves and, if visible, forearm guards. Gilchrist’s squash ball was, therefore, neither a piece of protective equipment, nor a clothing item, and was most certainly not visible to either side or the umpires. And nowhere in cricket’s 42 laws is there a mention of a squash ball as a permitted item. But MCC who are the final authority on matters to do with the Laws ruled that: "It is no different to wearing inners, etc." The matter ended right there and Gilchrist got away with it.
Having got out of so many escapades of this nature the past finally caught up with the Australians with the ball tampering affair that has left the entire nation humiliated and ashamed.
The words of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the incident speaks for itself: "We are usually the nation that fights against corruption in sport, but here we have the captain of the Australian cricket team involved in cheating. We see ourselves as a great sporting nation and this has really tarnished that image. It is a big shock when our heroes do something wrong."
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.
