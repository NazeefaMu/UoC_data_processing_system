Eleven Technological faculties started in universities - Minister Kiriella

Eleven Technological faculties and 35 departments have been started in the Universities by the Yahapalana Government, said Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella.
Only the deans of the medical faculties and the medical council have the right to take decisions and express views on medical education. The Minister made these observations at the stone laying ceremony for the new building of the Technological faculty of the Colombo University.
“According to the decisions taken by the government the doors will be opened for more than 20000 students in technological studies. No doubt that the number of technological students in the universities will be more than arts students within five years. The objective of the present government is to produce disciplined qualified graduates who are fit for the job market. But some graduates who are not fit for the available jobs since they have not trained for the requirements,” the minister said.
“The government is unable to arrange university education for each and every student who qualifies university education. That is how private universities had been established by other countries, the best example is India,” the minister said.
We will start another three medical faculties in Ratnapura, Moratuwa and Northwestern province soon, safeguarding the free education policy and we will be able to enroll another 150 students to those medical faculties, minister said.
