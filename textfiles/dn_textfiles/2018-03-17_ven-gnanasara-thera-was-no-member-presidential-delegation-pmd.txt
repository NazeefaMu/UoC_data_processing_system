Ven. Gnanasara Thera was no member of Presidential delegation - PMD

The President’s Media Division yesterday said the news circulating on social media tools and websites stating that Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was part of the Sri Lankan delegation that accompanied the President on his State visit to Japan, is totally fictitious and false.
“Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was in Japan on a personal visit prior to the commencement of the President’s State visit to Japan, and the Thera participated in a meeting which was organised by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Japan to provide an opportunity to the Sri Lankan community in Japan to meet the President.
The Thera also accompanied the Chief Incumbents of Buddhists Temples in Japan for this meeting with the President,” the President Media Division said. “Using a few photographs taken during that meeting, a news item has been created that Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was a member of the delegation of the President on his State visit to Japan and this news circulating on social media tools and websites is totally false,”the President Media Division stated.
