Two accused in a murder case were sentenced to death in absentia by the Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara recently.
The accused, Jayantha Parakrama and S.N. Leelawathi of Koswatta, had killed a 53-year-old married man on March 15, 2005 at Wariyapola, Koswatta.
The judge ordered police to arrest the accused and produced them before court.
