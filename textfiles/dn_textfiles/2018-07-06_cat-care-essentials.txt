Cat care essentials

How you identify a diseased cat
Cats are lovable animals often very lazy as all other members of the feline family. Diseased cats can be dull looking with unhealthy fur coat. Main signs of a sick cat are loss of appetite, unable to walk or limping, loose motion or constipation, vomiting, eye or nasal secretions, difficult breathing and rashes or wounds in the skin.
How to restrain a cat in disease situation
Cats don’t like unfavourable situations. Also they sometimes get furious if somebody disturbs them when they are sick. They normally escape and get lost, not allowing people to handle or treat them. Therefore handling a sick cat in a proper way is very important to make the cat comfortable. It also helps the cat to get relieve of the disease in a peaceful manner. Always keep a sick cat in enclosed area/room while examining and handling.
When the cats are afraid and uncomfortable they try to bite and scratch by claws. It is better to cover the face facilitating normal breathing of the cat as unseen handlings do not make them afraid. Also claws can be covered with a towel to prevent scratching. Holding he cat from its cuff area also make then clam. In addition both the hind limbs can be hold by one hand of the handler while slightly stretching the cat’s body to control them especially treating the animal.
How to care for a diseased cat
Cats love warm places. Therefore it’s a strict thumb rule to keep them warm when they are sick. Warm water filled packs or warm water filled glass bottles can be kept around the cat to make it feel warm. Feeding liquid diets using a syringe is good. Always use a new syringe. Maximum precautions should be taken not to force feed or prevent aspiration. Therefore best way of entering the syringe to mouth is by the side. You can lift the lip and enter the food syringe in to the mouth and release the food slowly according to the swallowing pattern of the cat. Holding the animal from its cuff also facilitate the feeding.
Cats love walking or roaming outside for fresh air. But a sick cat should be kept in a room with restricted movements as much as possible. Peaceful environment should be established to be calmed and to facilitate quick recovery. Cats always love to clean and groom themselves. Therefore if the cat is unable to do so you have to groom them at least once daily. If the cat suffering from diarrhea, vomiting, etc the contaminations of the skin which make foul smelling. A wet cloth or a wet tissue can be use to clean the animal. Do not wash the cat as it makes the body temperature to be low.
Common cat diseases
As a cat parent, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of common illnesses so you can seek veterinary help for your feline friend in a timely manner if necessary.
Cancer
Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, cats can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).
Diabetes
Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat.
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting, a cat’s immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.
Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV)
First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cat’s immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household and any sick cat should be tested for FeLV.
Heartworm
Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health problems in domestic cats. Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily causes lung disease in cats. It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.
High-Rise Syndrome
Many pet parents eagerly open their windows to enjoy the weather during the summer months. Unfortunately, unscreened windows pose a real danger to cats, which fall out of them so often that the veterinary profession has a name for the complaint High-Rise Syndrome. Falls can result in shattered jaws, punctured lungs, broken limbs and pelvises and even death.
Rabies
Rabies is a viral disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and humans. There’s good reason that the very word “rabies” evokes fear in people once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100 per cent fatal.
Ringworm
Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm isn’t caused by a worm at all but a fungus that can infect the skin, hair and nails. Not uncommon in cats, this highly contagious disease can lead to patchy, circular areas of hair loss with central red rings.
Also known as dermatophytosis, ringworm often spreads to other pets in the household and to humans, too.
Upper Respiratory Infections
A cat’s upper respiratory tract (the nose, throat and sinus area) is susceptible to infections caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria.
Viruses are the most common causes of upper respiratory infections (URIs) in cats. Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus account for 80 to 90 per cent of all contagious upper respiratory problems, and are prevalent in shelters, catteries and multi-cat households. These viruses can be transmitted from cat to cat through sneezing, coughing, or while grooming or sharing food and water bowls.
Worms
Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as “worms.”
Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well.
Most of the diseases can be cured by prior vaccination at proper age. Always try to manage your cat with expert advice of a qualified veterinarian to keep the cat in a disease free condition.
