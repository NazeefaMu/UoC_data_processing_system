Kalubowila Hospital
Health Minister denounces canard about ‘bill’

The bill issued by the Colombo South Teaching Hospital (Kalubowila Hospital) is only an indication to the public of the expenses borne by the government on their behalf and people do not need to pay any money towards it, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, some websites had distorted facts and reported this incident inaccurately in order to mislead the public. No money will be charged from any patient and the health service is completely free, as it was.
The system of issuing a bill (receipt) for the patients who obtain medical treatment from the Colombo South Teaching Hospital was introduced by a consultant of the same hospital to raise awareness among the public of the large amount of money spent on them by the government in order to offer them the free health service, the Minister said.
“The system was launched by me during another ceremony held at the hospital. But some websites use their service to mislead the public. Everything should not be looked at through a political angle. Healthcare is a service to the people,” the Minister added.
