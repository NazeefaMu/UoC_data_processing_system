Ravi Mangala Yoga in Cabinet

The much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle eventually took place on Monday and saw several key portfolios change hands. The objective of the reshuffle was to apparently stifle growing dissent within the National Unity government - although critics have quick to point out that it only amounted to a round of ‘musical chairs’ with ministers swapping subjects among each other.
The reshuffle- almost two years into the tenure of this government- was a long time in the making. Initial speculation was that a reshuffle would take place with the dawn of the New Year. As the rumours dragged on, it was then expected before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Thereafter, at a meeting with newspaper editors and publishers, President Maithripala Sirisena indicated that it would be undertaken before Vesak. Eventually, it did take place in the month of Vesak, but after the Vesak Poya holidays, a few hours before the President left on a visit to Australia.
The most significant change brought about by the reshuffle is the swapping of the Finance and Foreign Affairs portfolios between ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Mangala Samaraweera. Karunanayake’s removal had been a demand of a section of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its coalition partner, the United National Party (UNP), had been steadfastly resisting this.
Key institutions
The UNP has finally yielded, but by no means has Karunanayake been sacrificed: he has been offered the other plum portfolio in the Cabinet, Foreign Affairs. In addition, several other institutions which were under Karunanayake as Finance Minister, will remain under his purview. They include the National Lotteries Board, the Development Board, the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund and the troubled national carrier, SriLankan Airlines.
The retention of these subjects under the minister of Foreign Affairs appears surprising on paper- and is unprecedented- but it is clear it was the result of some hard-nosed bargaining between the UNP and the SLFP factions of the government. In the end, the SLFP had its way by having Karunanayake removed from the Finance portfolio, but it came at a price, where several key institutions remained with him.
Nevertheless, it was well known that Karunanayake, an accountant by profession, would have preferred the Finance portfolio. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had telephoned to commiserate with him. Karunanayake, to his credit, has however accepted the new portfolio without dissent and if he was disappointed with the change, did not show it when he was taking his oaths.
Stepping into Karunanayake’s shoes is Mangala Samaraweera. Samaraweera is a former SLFPer who defected to the UNP during the Rajapaksa era and is an avowed loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga as well. He is now firmly with the UNP. Apart from being appointed Minister of Finance he has also been entrusted with the portfolio of Mass Media, a subject previously held by Gayantha Karunathilake, who has been assigned the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reform instead.
While Minister Samaraweera’s appointment as Finance Minister was much anticipated, many did not expect him to be bestowed with the Mass Media portfolio as well. This subject is not alien to him though, having served as Minister of Mass Media under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. He was assertive but also controversial in this role.
The other major change that was effected in the reshuffle was appointing the vociferous Arjuna Ranatunga as Minister of Petroleum Resource Development, taking away the Ministry of Ports and Shipping from him. This portfolio has been assigned to Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was formerly the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training.
It is no secret that Ranatunga was an outspoken critic of the proposed Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese government and that his interventions had led to many modifications of the agreement. His ‘transfer’ is seen by many as a consequence of his actions but he has now been entrusted with another vital portfolio- Petroleum Resource Development- where international interactions are still a key issue.
UNP governments
Ranatunga’s ‘transfer’ was also interesting because there was general consensus that, despite any changes in portfolios, subjects assigned to the UNP will remain within the UNP and likewise for the SLFP. Now, Ports and Shipping has been taken away from a UNP minister and assigned to a SLFP minister.
However, this becomes a moot point because Ranatunga was a longstanding SLFPer with strong family ties to the party who contested from the UNP at the last election only because the circumstances demanded it. Similarly, Mahinda Samarasinghe began his political career in the UNP and crossed over to the SLFP later!
The only ‘real’ change in the reshuffle, so to speak, was the inclusion of senior lawyer and former Attorney General Tilak Marapana in the Cabinet once again. Marapana has been long and faithful servant of the UNP and has been particularly loyal to party leader Wickremesinghe. He has held the portfolios of Defence, Transport, Aviation and Highways in previous UNP governments.
In this government, he was assigned the portfolio of Law and Order and Prison Reforms and held that portfolio for a few months before he fell on his sword and resigned over the Avant Garde controversy, after he defended the issue in Parliament. It was felt at the time that his continuation as a minister could be construed as impeding investigations into Avant Garde.
Marapana has now been appointed as Minister of Development Assignments. His return to the Cabinet is an indication of the imprimatur of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on this reshuffle. Ever the astute politician, the Prime Minister has used this opportunity to invite a trusted ally back into the Cabinet.
If the changes among UNP ministers were noteworthy, the changes made to most SLFP portfolios appear to be cosmetic in nature. W.D.J. Seneviratne, who was recently engaged in a public spat with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and who was the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations has been assigned the additional subject of Sabaragamuwa Development. Similarly, S.B. Dissanayake, now a vociferous ally of President Sirisena, who was Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, has been assigned the additional subject of Kandyan Heritage.
The only change of note within the ranks of the SLFP is Chandima Weerakkody, a former Deputy Speaker, being relieved of his portfolio of Petroleum Resources and being entrusted with the subject of Skills Development and Vocational Training instead.
The General Secretary of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance, Mahinda Amaraweera could be excused if he is a disappointed man after the reshuffle. A few months ago, it was President Sirisena himself who hinted that Amaraweera would be granted a portfolio “where he could serve the entire country better” and those remarks added to the speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle.
Cabinet reshuffle
Amaraweera, who was Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has now been also appointed as State Minister of Mahaveli Development, a portfolio held by the President himself. Presidential duties are obviously taking its toll on the President Sirisena’s time and he has entrusted this portfolio- a subject very close to his heart-to Amaraweera, albeit as State Minister.
That the government was not prepared to ruffle too many feathers with the Cabinet reshuffle is clear. There have been other ministries which have come under relentless public scrutiny in recent months but their ministers have not been changed.
For instance, the crisis over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has engulfed the health and higher education sectors for many months now. In the health sector, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is more on strike than not while medical students in state medical faculties are boycotting lectures. The ministers concerned, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Lakshman Kiriella have come in for a lot of flak over this- but their portfolios remain unchanged.
This reshuffle would have been an ideal opportunity to assign different subjects to Senaratne and Kiriella but the President and the Prime Minister chose not to do so. It is therefore an indication that the government intends to pursue the solution it has envisaged for the SAITM- and other proposed private medical colleges- in earnest.
To expect the Cabinet reshuffle to be a panacea for all the ills of the government is to be naïve as well as overly optimistic. Still, the reshuffle is likely to silence the rumblings of dissent within the government of National Unity- at least for now.
