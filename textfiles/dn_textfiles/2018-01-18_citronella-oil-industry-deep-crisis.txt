Citronella oil industry in deep crisis

The citronella oil industry in Hambantota district that brought a colossal sum of money to the country in the form of foreign exchange is facing a deep crisis now. A bottle of citronella oil that fetched Rs.7,500 in the recent past now fetches a price of Rs.1,500 only.
The small scale citronella growers and citronella oil industrialists said that 700 kilograms of citronella leaves are necessary to distill eight bottles of citronella oil.
According to a citronella oil distiller at Katuwana, a loan of Rs one lakh was disbursed to women who engage in the citronella oil industry when a bottle of citronella oil fetched a price of Rs. 7,500. These women are now indebted to banks and other lending institutions due to the deep crisis in the citronella oil industry.
