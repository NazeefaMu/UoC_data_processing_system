Wear your heart on your weave!

Unstitched or stitched, tucked or pleated, neoprene or linen, with a blouse or not - the versatility of the saree turns heads. If you enjoy draping yourself in these six yards of elegance and grace, especially imported from the looms of India then you are in for a treat. Well known actress, Miss Sri Lanka Pancontinental 2015 and law graduate Alanki Kishani Perera has always proven that she embodies a versatile personality. The young lady has embarked on yet another diverse venture – into the realm of entrepreneurship as she launched ‘Radha’, a boutique for ethnic and traditional sarees.
 From acting to being selected as a beauty contestant to represent Sri Lanka, being a law graduate and now a Business entrepreneur. How different are these three field?
These three fields are all very different and unique. However all three were very demanding of time and commitment too. But I never had the ambition of being involved in all three!
I had always wanted to pursue a professional career but destiny had other plans for me. As a child I had always wanted to pursue my higher studies and therefore after my schooling education I completed my law degree through the external system of university of London international programmes. However prior to my studies, I was involved in acting and had to reject my acting offers until I completed my LLB. I was then selected to represent Sri Lanka in the first every Miss Pancontinental in the Philippines as Miss Sri Lanka Pancontinental. It was only after that, that I had the time to really consider my mum’s idea of opening up a saree boutique. Even though she had always had this idea, I never had the time to commit to a business venture with my other projects and studies. Being a business entrepreneur had paved the way for many more opportunities and a whole new level of experiences.
Why did you decide to venture into business?
My mum had always had a major passion for sarees and has an extremely good eye for sarees. She had always accompanied me to my shoots and supported me in all my endeavours so I thought we should give this idea a try and it turned out to be a great decision!
I also believe that it is important to have more than one career path for a woman. With entrepreneurship comes responsibility yet it also gives you a great level of freedom of being able to make your own choices and to express your own creativity at work.
What sets Radha by Alanki Collection apart from other brands of sarees?
Radha offers an exquisite collection of sarees for both daily wear and special occasions. We have an elegant collection of sarees in different types of silks and fabrics. What makes Radha special is that we import only one in each saree, thereby ensuring exclusivity. We have a wide collection for sarees in different designs and styles, catering for all age groups. Radha had an ethnic collection of sarees in bold tribal prints and natural dyes portraying the heritage and culture of the different regions of India from where we import the sarees. Since each region in India have different weaving techniques and different cultures, each of these sarees are unique to that particular region and therefore Radha has a variety of different styles. Radha also offers beautiful floral prints and vintage prints and sarees in pastel hues. Our cotton sarees are also very popular among many working women. My mum and I put a lot of thought and effort in handpicking each and every saree from our suppliers.
What is your perception about the saree suiting the Sri Lankan/ Asian woman?
I believe that a woman is best dressed and well dressed in a saree! Nothing really makes a woman looks as graceful as when she is in a saree. I believe that saree looks best on Sri Lankan and Asian women.
Saree is the one attire, which ensures you’ll possess the silhouette of a graceful lady. There is no one particular colour that suits Sri Lankan women. With regards to what colour, design or material suits Sri Lankan women, I think it depends largely on your complexion, figure and your personality. Almost anything looks good if a woman has confidence to carry it off!
How did the name originate?
My mum came up with the name, Radha. We are huge fans of Radha Krishna (Indian goddess and partner of Krishna) and used to collect antiques and ornaments of Radha Krishna. Enthralled by that romance and love story, we decided to name it Radha.
Is Radha purely sarees?
Yes we only provide sarees at the moment and have not really decided to expand into other clothing items. It is best to focus on sarees so that we could always give the best to our clients!
Who is your targeted clientele?
We have many working women who buy our cotton sarees and most of our client purchase sarees for weddings. Our most popular clientele include brides’ mothers since we offer a grand selection of exclusive sarees and brides and grooms mothers always want to look their best at the wedding.
Who are your fashion icons and why do you admire their sense of style?
I love Deepika Padukone. I feel that it is not always about what you wear but about how you carry it and how good you look. I feel that her sense of style is very versatile and she looks good in both ethnic wear and western wear!
What do you find exciting about this venture?
We love meeting our clients. We have made new friendships and it is always satisfying to see someone wear a saree by Radha. It would be two years since we opened Radha in April and it has been a worthwhile and fulfilling experience.
What are your future plans for Radha?
We wish to expand Radha and maybe move to a bigger space. We would continue to provide unique and exquisite sarees and maintain our standards in quality.
Do you hope to continue with acting in the future?
Yes I do hope to continue acting if I get offered worthwhile roles. Acting has always been a hobby for me but it is also one of my greatest passions.
