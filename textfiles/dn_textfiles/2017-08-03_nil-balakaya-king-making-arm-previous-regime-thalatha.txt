Nil Balakaya king making arm of previous regime: Thalatha

The Nil Balakaya was formed with an intent of making a son of a politician a king of the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said yesterday.
Minister Athukorala was speaking at the distribution of a monthly grant of Rs. 7,500 as house rents for those who were displaced by the recent flood in the Elapatha Divisional Secretariat division.
The government will respect the people’s right to carry out protests. It will never use white vans or armed gangs to control protests," she said.
“The government has ensured the people’s right to live peacefully. They can engage in protests against the government too," she said.
Minister Athukorala said those who were silent on SAITM and the Uma Oya project during the Rajapaksa era, have started organising protests demanding the government stop them.
“Where were they when these projects were started in 2011?, she asked. She said the government pays a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to every family affected by the recent floods.
Athukorala said the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) received step-motherly treatment during the previous regime.
“The NYSC is heading towards a right direction under the supervision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Niroshan Perera, she said.
The minister said the government ended the era in which corruption reigned the country.
“We ended an era in which government servants have undertaken road construction contracts," she said.
