Ja'pura Hospital authorities abolishes use of finger print scanner

The Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital governing board resolved to abolish using the fingerprint scanner after holding discussions with the Government Services United Nurses Union, a short while ago.
Earlier today, Chairman of the Nurses Union Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera warned to take drastic measures if a satisfactory solution is not provided by the governing body.
