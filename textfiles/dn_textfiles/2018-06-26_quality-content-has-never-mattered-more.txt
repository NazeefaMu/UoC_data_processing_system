Quality of content has never mattered more !

The Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards is one of the most prestigious film award ceremonies to be held in Sri Lanka. Winning an award is considered to be one of the highest honours that can be bestowed upon a film artiste. It is a rare opportunity and one that is truly special and close to one’s heart. And on August 3, at the BMICH, history will be made, when film artistes who have appeared in the films of 2016 and 2017 are given their day. This is Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards 2018.
Sarasaviya Awards is presented each year by the Sarasaviya weekly newspaper in collaboration with the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House).
Chairman ANCL, Krishantha Cooray stated that the film industry in Sri Lanka and the Sarasaviya Film Festival is one that evokes strong sentiment stating that it is an honour to be associated with it.
“On April 10, 1963 Sarasaviya paper was launched at Lake House to contribute to a cinema culture that is noble and of high standard in art form. So in May 10, 1964 the first Sarasaviya Film Festival began. The intention of Lake House was not profit or glory but the intention was to create something of a certain standard and quality. The aim here is to bring together popular culture with aesthetic value onto the same platform. It is certainly a great achievement for those who win these awards as the Film Festival is held in great esteem by its viewers. This is a golden opportunity for the winners and a matter of pride for all involved. ANCL and Cargills will never interfere in the process of selection. It is completely transparent and impartial,” said Cooray.
Cooray mentioned that it is pleasure being a partner with Cargills and this time as well as on previous occasions in the past, the endeavor will most certainly be a success. Cooray pointed out that in the life of any artiste there is a desire to win a Sarasaviya award. It is a pillar of strength to the Sinhalese Cinema industry.
Editor Sarasaviya newspaper, Aruna Gunaratna said that we can be proud of the Sarasaviya Film Awards which is an occasion to be celebrated openly.
“This is a huge and momentous festival and must be loudly proclaimed to the whole country. In the history of Cinema in this country, Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards without doubt holds a special place. It is has great prestige attached to it and is unrivalled and this cannot be disputed. ANCL has always been of service to this country. It is because of ANCL that this film award ceremony is in existence. The Sarasaviya film awards ceremony began in 1964 giving the film industry in Sri Lanka a much needed boost,” said Gunaratna.
Gunaratne pointed out that the film industry in Sri Lanka with its traditions owes much to the Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards.
“Sarasaviya Films Awards is a film festival that has overshadowed other competition. The competition this time is big and is keenly contested. This film festival and its panelists are impartial, transparent and completely fair. There will be a variety of awards including the Lester James Peiris Award in remembrance of that great director who nurtured generations. In this country there was a relationship between the cinema and the press with Lake House and the Regal Cinema facing each other. When Asokamala was in the process of being brought to the screen the main papers of Lake House – Dinamina, Silumina, Daily News and Observer gave publicity,” said Gunaratna.
Executive Director Ceylon Theatres Ltd, Sanjaya Niles, pointed out that Cargills is a name associated with retailing, food and financial services in Sri Lanka and that it is a lesser known fact that Cargills is part of the CT Holdings group which has had an association with the Sri Lanka film industry for many years.
“The course of the company was set by our visionary leader and late chairman Albert. A. Page. He took over the reigns of Ceylon theatres with one purpose and that was to entertain people. Way back in 1956, Ceylon Theatres began the first film production and processing facilities in the country with the establishment of Ceylon Studios ltd. Thus paving the way for development of local film production and expertise. Ceylon Theatres has produced notable films, namely ‘Nidhanaya’, ‘Ada Rae’, ‘Kusumalatha’ and ‘Akkara Paha’.
Even in difficult times the company continued to invest in the sector expanding and upgrading the film screening facilities for the benefit of the patrons,” said Niles.
Ceylon Theatres does not produce movies today but boasts the largest number of movie screens in the country- 15 screens in Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, Negombo, Gampaha and Nuwaraeliya with plans for 21 new screens across eight locations. It is committed to the further development of this sector.
“With our long history the promotion of Arts and Culture in Sri Lanka, Cargills and the overall CT Holdings group of companies steadfastly believe in the artistic skills and the talents blossoming in Sri Lanka. We believe that the movie industry will continue to grow and expand on the strong foundation of past successes. The recognition of the artiste is a vital step in the continued development of the industry and we wish Sarasaviya 2018 festival every success,” said Niles.
Veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya too expressed his ideas by saying that the quality of local cinema is measured by the Sarasaviya Film Festival. He won the Best Actor award in 1984, 1985, 1989 and 1990.
“The difference this film festival has made to our lives as artistes, and the support it has given to us is something that no other organization has been able to do. It is something that is totally dedicated to the industry and welfare of the artistes. It had done so much for me which I cannot express in words. This is something that is invaluable to me and it has etched my name in cinematic history. I strongly feel that this film festival needs to continue into the future. It is special and it has powerful meaning for me. The name of Cargills is legendary in Sri Lanka. We can place our faith in Cargills and Sarasaviya,” said Randeniya
