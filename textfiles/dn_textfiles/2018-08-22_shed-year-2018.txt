Shed of the Year 2018

Shed enthusiasts have been battling it out, displaying their standout structures for the coveted title of Shed of the Year in UK.
Among the thousands of unconventional entries are pub-inspired creations, a shed floating on skis and a converted black cab. Almost 3,000 people entered their outdoor havens and there are now just 24 hopefuls remaining in eight categories, which include eco-friendly creations and historic-like structures.
Entrants of the Cuprinol-sponsored competition are hoping to get their hands on a £1,000 prize, as well as the prestigious 2018 title. The winner will also receive a winner's plaque, a giant crown and £100 worth of woodwork products.
Judges had been "blown away" by this year's line-up, according to competition founder Andrew Wilcox.
He said, "I will be very interested to see who comes out on top following the public vote. It is going to be a near-on impossible task deciding who will take top honour as the Shed of the Year 2018, I love all 24 sheds."
