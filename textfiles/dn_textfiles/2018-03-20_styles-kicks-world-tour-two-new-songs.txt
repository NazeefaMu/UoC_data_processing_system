Styles kicks off world tour with two new songs

Harry Styles has treated fans to two new songs on the first date of his world tour.
The former One Direction singer, who released his self-titled debut album last May (17), took to the stage in Basel, Switzerland on March 11 to showcase his latest musical offerings.
The first song, which has since been labelled 'Anna' by fans, appeared to include brief snippets of the iconic hook from the late George Michael's number one single Faith.
Another new track, dubbed 'Medicine,' featured lyrics including; "Can I take my medicine, take my medicine/ Rest it on your fingertips/Up to your mouth, feeling it out/ Feeling it out," and was an edgier number with a heavy bassline. Music News
