Japanese management standards integrated with ISO9001:2015 QMS

JASTECA Institute of Management will hold a newly designed seminar on a concept titled 'Integration of Japanese Management Standards with ISO9001:2015 QMS International Standards' on Tuesday, October 3, at PIM.
Most managers assume that Japanese management teachings such as Toyota Production System, Kaizen, 5s and Lean Thinking are not aligned with ISO 9001:2015 international standard.
As a result, they try to run different programs with different responsibilities for Japanese and ISO 9001 systems separately. Good news is that both programs are heading towards the same final goal. However both Japanese and ISO QMS systems play different roles in the organizational journey towards performance excellence.
This seminar will be led by JASTECA Institute of Management and conducted by one of JASTECA's resource persons, who is also the President of Kaisha Kaisen Consultancies Kanishka Perera. He holds a Masters degree in Business Management from the University of Colombo.
He is a Trainer, Senior QMS Consultant/Lead Management Systems Auditor and Implementer (QMS, FSMS, ISMS, BCMS, EMS, TPS, Lean, Kaizen and Japanese 5s) and an external lecturer at the University of Moratuwa.
Perera has worked for over five years for Japanese manufacturers and service providers in managerial position and has more than 23 years of hands on industry experience.
Content of the program includes Introduction to TPS/Lean performance excellence journey with ISO9001:2015 QMS and TQM; Introduction to Quality (QC, QA and QM) and 7 Quality Management Principles; Explained new 10 clause high level structure of ISO9001 QMS 2015 version and links to Japanese Management standards implementation; ISO 9001 process approach with Japanese Hoshin Kanri; ISO 9001 Risk based thinking; Corrective actions with Kaizen and Innovations (5Ws and 1H); Management review with 3W project progress monitoring.
This program will guide a company’s management to bring both, performance excellence programs and ISO9001:2015 QMS new standard implementation in one cockpit control dashboard with regular monitoring and follow-up. A company can begin their performance excellence Lean journey with correct knowledge and zero system overlaps and repetitions.
