Zahira College appoints Collin Denish as rugby coach

Former Peterite captain and coach Collin Denish Peter has been appointed as head coach of the Zahira College, Maradana first fifteen rugby team for the upcoming season.
Denish who captained his alma mater in 1989 was one of the finest fly halves produced by Sri Lanka. He went onto represent CR&FC, Havelocks SC and Peterson SC and in 1991 played for Sri Lanka under the captaincy of Priyantha Ekanayake.
Denish was assistant coach of St Peter’s from 2007-2011 before taking over as full time coach of the school in 2011, a position he held until 2014.
