Presidential Comm. on Treasury Bond issue: Counsel concerned over ‘leading’ questions put to witness

Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva, Harsha Fernando and Nihal Fernando PC yesterday expressed their concerns at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, over certain questions directed at Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake.
They pointed out to the Commission that certain questions put to Ratnayake takes the nature of leading questions.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Priyanta Navana was leading evidence.
Following the concerns shown, Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri requested not to ask any leading questions from the witnesses.
The Presidential Commission, which is a fact finding commission that is to submit an impartial report on the issue, does not cross examine any witness that testifies before the Commission.
Meanwhile, the Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake testifying before the Commission yesterday said he was shocked by the decision to accept higher amount of bids than advertised at the questioned auction on February 27, 2015.
He said, to his personal knowledge, the loss incurred could have been averted. He presented an analysis of his personal view in the form of graphs and data, suggesting direct placement would have been a favourable option instead of solely an auction based system.
It was pointed out an independent witness will be summoned to the Commission to weigh the pros and cons of solely auction based method and direct placement method.
