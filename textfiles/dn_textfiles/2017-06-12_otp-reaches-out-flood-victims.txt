OTP reaches out to flood victims

Despite the owners being overseas, it didn’t take too long for the management and staff of the Owl and the Pussycat resort hotel (OTP) in Thalpe to hear the call of distress and lend a hand to the people in the neighbourhood who were badly affected by the floods.
Matara Walpola had families who had lost their homes and had taken shelter in the nearby temple. The GramaSevaka also rose to the call of need and helped the staff to identify the areas and the quickest way to get there.
The Sri Lanka Army, without whose help this exercise could not have been carried out, also joined hands with the hotel and rushed to their assistance. They helped transport the goods.
Members of the staff together with the kitchen brigade prepared meals for 200 displaced people. Whilst the meals were given personally to the people by the staff, dry rations were handed over to the temple authorities. Truckloads of water were also taken to the stricken areas.
Wading through the waters that had risen inundating the roads, the staff carried the provisions to those in need. Though this relief effort took place six days after the main flooding, families were still searching for their lost loved ones and even pets. A spokesperson commented that the water had receded and families were trying to get back to their homes.
Resident guests of the hotel have also pledged their contributions to this cause to help ease the burden of these suffering people.
