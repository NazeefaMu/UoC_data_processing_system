“Becoming the All Island third in the G C E Ordinary Level examination 2016 a great achievement in my life. It was a hard earned victory which was a result of hard work and dedication. My parents Chandana Mirissage and Pamoda Malawararachchi, brother Chamith Thisaranga Mirissage, family members, our school principal Mr Francis Welege, and all my teachers inspired me. The Provincial Education Director of the Southern province Nimal Dissanayake who was the school’s former principal too was very supportive. I believe that my determination and commitment helped me to succeed,” Dimuth said.
He had gotten to know about his results at around about 5 am on March 28 but I heard about his island rank about an hour later. An uncle of his who lives in Galle related the news to his father.
“I was delighted with the news. It was one of the happiest moments in my life! I was anticipating an all island rank among top 10 but wasn’t anticipating this!” Dimuth added with a smile.
Dimuth notes that if you work hard according to a plan with determination and commitment you can get good results in exams.
“I believe that we should have a plan in our mind about what we should do in a day. It will make our work easy and help to lessen the workload,” he opined.
He had started playing chess from grade one. He noted that it was a passion which he had cultivated from childhood.
Good combination
“I won many medals, certificates and I even got opportunities to go to foreign countries to play international chess tournaments. Meantime I could also become the first in the section in every term test. So there was no barrier about taking up chess. Playing chess improves one’s mental concentration and thinking ability too. This is contributes to our studies,” he said.
He had taken part in his first chess tournament when he was in grade two. That was a District Under-10 Chess Tournament. He won three rounds out of five in the tournament and had gotten selected to the all island level.
“My first international chess tournament was the 3rd Asian Schools’ Chess Championship which was held in January, 2008 in Kandy. I played as the Under-08 official Chess player of the Sri Lankan National Chess Team. I could win a gold medal and a silver medal in that tournament. I could get many valuable experiences from this tournament for my chess career and life,” Dimuth mused.
He notes that one should have a good concentration and imaginative power to become a good chess player.
“As chess players we have to play well in all three stages of the game which are named as opening, middle game and end game. So we have to practise both tactical and strategical thinking styles in all stages of the game. A good combination of these things make a good chess player,” he said.
Dimuth had been selected for the Maths Olympiad Provincial Pool in 2011.Organized by the National Mathematical and Science Olympiad SectionDimuth had been selected to the provincial pool after qualifying from the District competition. The selected provincial pool was practised in SangamittaCollege, Galle. About 15 students from the Southern Province who got high marks from the district test had been present in the provincial pool.
“This was a great experience for all of us. We could learn many new things and mathematical methods at there. I made many new friends and we enjoyed the time we spent together,” he recalled.
Dimuth had also captained the Rahula College team at the Sirasa Pentathlon Competition. The school won second place at the event.
Determination and commitment
“We had to face many tough situations throughout the event.We experienced the toughest out of them in the second round of the competition. Before the last round, our opponents were 52 points ahead of us but we could lessen that lead to two points just before the last question. Unfortunately, the presenter gave the chance to answer the last question to our opponents because they pressed buzzer before the question was asked. The presenter broke the rules of the competition but then he attempted to justify his action. As a result of this unfortunate incident we lost that game. That was a very tough moment for me and my teammates but we kept our mentality strong and faced the event,” he expressed.

Dimuth notes that his parents are his heroes in life. This is because of the remarkable manner in which manage everything wonderfully.
“They have faced many problems in the life but they are not weakened by them. So I try to learn something from them every day. I believe that those things will be really important for my life and made me the individual that I am today,” he pointed out.
Playing chess in the internet is his favourite pasttime. He enjoys especially because he can play with many foreign players. Collecting stamps and watch TV are his other hobbies. He also gathers important news and facts every day that are useful for him to excel in life. He says that he likes to engage in something useful while enjoying it.

“My ambition is to become a Consultant Doctor. So my first target is to get a high rank in G C E Advanced Level Examination and be selected to the Medical Faculty. After completing that degree I hope to do other exams which are need to become a consultant doctor. Living in my country and serving my people is what drives me in my life,” Dimuth said.
He advises other youth to take up sports while engaging in academics.
“Both of them contribute to making our life a success. We should take up both with determination and commitment but we should not let sports to become a hinderence for our studies. If you work hard according to a plan with dedication and determination, you can excel in both sectors,” Dimuth advised.
