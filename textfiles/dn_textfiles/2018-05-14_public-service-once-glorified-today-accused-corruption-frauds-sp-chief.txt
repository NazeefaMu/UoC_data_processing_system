Public service once glorified, today accused of corruption, frauds: SP Chief Minister

Many people accuse the public service of corruptions and frauds today, Southern Province Governor Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He was addressing the gathering at a function held to recruit 127 Grade III officers to the Public Management Assistant Service, Development Officers’ Service and Technical Officers’ Service of the Southern Province at the Southern Province Chief Secretariat Auditorium recently.
Forty four officers for the Management Assistant Service (Open) and 29 and 54 personnel for the Southern Province Development Officers’ Service and Technical Officers’ Service respectively were offered appointments. "The public still appreciate the state service of the past. The government service was well-disciplined and people-friendly those days. Now the public officials serve to politicians more than the public, the Chief Minister said.
"As far as they perform their duties honestly, they do not have to worry about allegations. The Establishments Code is to regulate the state service and to guide the public servants but not to harass the public. Public officers must serve the public, the Chief Minister said.
The Chief Minister said government officials engaged in foreign tours regularly. "But they do not learn and admire the overseas administration systems and forget all good methods they learnt there once they returned," he said. Southern Province Chief Secretary R.C. De Zoysa and Deputy Chief Secretary (Personnel and Administration) Gamini Weerawikrama spoke. Provincial Public Service Commission Chairman H. W. Wijerathne, Chief Ministry Secretary Saman Dharshana Pandikorale, Provincial Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry Secretary G.L.Verrnon Perera and Provincial Secretaries were present.
