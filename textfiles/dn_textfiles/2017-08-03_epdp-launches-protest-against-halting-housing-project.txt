EPDP launches protest against halting housing project

 
A protest was launched with the initiation of the Elam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) against halting the housing project funded by foreign donors, in front of the Eastern Province Governors Office in Trincomalee, today.
The protestors are residents from Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara districts, displaced by the civil war.
The EPDP protestors alleged the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leaders to have washed their hands off the issue.
The protestors handed over a letter subsequently to Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama on issues faced by the displaced people.
