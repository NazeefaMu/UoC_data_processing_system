Work with a backbone, public officials told

Delimitation Review Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris yesterday called on the public officials to work with backbones without yielding to political pressure. Peiris was addressing a ‘Diriya Purawesi’ National Representatives Convention organised by the JVP in Maharagama yesterday.
Peiris struck back at Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha during his speech, stating that he was under fire by the minister for not obeying his orders. “I retired last year after 36 years of public service out of which 14 years were spent at the Elections Department. However, this is my first speech at a political meeting. I speak today knowing the risk that I take. The ministers have a preconceived notion about public officials. They think we are supposed to come, go, sit, stand up and raise our hands obeying their orders all the time like in the school. They want us to behave like ‘kittens’. We showed we do not conform to this model through our work at the Delimitation Committee,” he said.“At a press conference called by Minister Musthapha I told him to be quiet and allow me to speak. The minister seemed shocked. The irate minister had then asked who had nominated me to the Delimitation Committee. That is because I did not work as he wanted. However, many in the public service called me later to express their admiration for not yielding to pressure,” Peiris said. Speaking of his past experience in the public service, he said a minister who was not alive now, was in the habit of calling the officials in the names of animals, adding that the officials should have had the backbone to refuse to obey the orders made in such derogatory terms. He also compared the country as a vehicle being driven without breaks, adding that it would come to a point that could not be moved forward any longer.
