Controlled price for cooking oil

The Consumer Affairs Authority is planning to have a controlled price for all cooking oils including coconut oil.
Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Hasitha Thilakarathne said the aim was to prevent traders from earning unreasonable profits by selling cooking oil at exorbitant prices.
He said that some traders are in the practice of selling cooking oil for unreasonable prices in order to earn higher profits.
He said the Consumer Affairs Authority will be issuing a gazette notification on the revised prices of essential food items. “The recently reduced prices of goods have been sent to the Consumer Affairs Council too,” said Chairman Hasitha Thilakarathne.
He also said that the Gazette paper including new revised prices of essential food items will be submitted to the Cabinet Sub – Committee on Cost of Living to get its approval today.
Cabinet Sub – Committee on Cost of Living is scheduled to meet today at the Parliamentary Complex.
