Why support Trump’s cesspool on Human and Children’s’ Rights?

Reconciliation and Religion, Human Rights and the Robe of the Sangha, have pushed the political divisions within the Government and the Opposition somewhat to the rear this week, with the politico-tactical and media reverberations on the US withdrawal from the UNHRC and the refusal by Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena to wear the prison uniform for convicts, known as the ‘jumper’.
There are strong demands emerging that Sri Lanka should now consider removing its co-sponsorship of the USA-led 2015 resolution of the UNHRC, dealing with issues of peace building, reconciliation and accountability in the post-war context in Sri Lanka. The resolution calls for necessary action on violations of human rights or any war crimes, alleged violations of international humanitarian law, and participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges in the related Sri Lankan judicial mechanism.
The political strategies of the Opposition, especially the Joint Opposition with the SLPP, will make a strong move to bring pressure on the government, especially the President, to use the US withdrawal as a means to withdraw or reject the UNHRC Resolution. The Rajapaksa forces in the JO and SLPP will strongly support all moves against this Resolution, with narrow political concerns and little interest in human rights aspects.
The UNHRC Resolution 30/1 0f 2015 came for heavy criticism from those politically opposed to the government, and others who consider its contents a danger to the majoritarian concepts of governance in the country. It has prompted much objection as being a threat to the glory and dignity of the War Heroes in the battle against the LTTE, and criticized as giving in to moves of the pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora active in the West.
The mounting criticism from these diverse quarters, largely in opposition to the Yahapalana government, did often make the government move backwards with regard to support for a resolution it did co-sponsor with the US and many other countries, and exposed the differences in thinking on the related issues between the UNP and SLFP within the coalition of unity. President Sirisena has since said he was both unaware and opposed to having any foreign judges in this context, and was opposed to any moves to bring disrepute to the War Heroes of the country. The UNP leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too had to move away from some of the highly critical aspects of the UNHRC Resolution, especially regarding foreign judges.
Better International Image
A resolution pushed ahead by the Yahapalanaya Coalition in its early period in office, seeking to bring a better international image to Sri Lanka from the near isolation threatening the country from the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime’s confrontations with the UNHRC and the international community, has remained one of political disconnect for the government, with the developing clashes between the SLFP and UNP.
The government has made considerable progress on some aspects on peace building and reconciliation as sought by the UNHRC, such as setting up the Office of Missing Persons despite much opposition; increased release of land held by Security Forces in the North, moves for better rehabilitation of those who surrendered to the Security Forces after the defeat of the LTTE. There are issues such as continuance of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in a manner unsuitable in the current context, delays in filing action against those held in custody on matters of terrorism, and questions about the speed and functioning of the judicial process on terrorism related matters.
In this context the call for a withdrawal of the UNHRC resolution gathers content, coming from the pro-Sinhala majoritarian forces, especially the voices of War Heroes, and opposition political forces, particularly the SLPP – led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. The government, and particularly President Sirisena, will be have to face much of these calls, as this can be easily moved into a major political drive against Yahapalanaya, as some commentators in the media have already done.
Cesspool Twist
There is an interesting twist to the situation on US withdrawal from UNHRC. US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has called the UNHRC ‘a cesspool of political bias’. The Trump drive against the UNHRC comes as a support for Human Rights, while its real intent, said by Nikki Haley, is objection to its support for the Palestinian and Arab cause against Israel.
The US could not accept its defeat in the Security Council on the killing of more than 60 Palestinians from the Gaza, in the recent critical days of the Nakba Day (Day of Catastrophe) protests, especially when the US moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
What is worse in this US call for Human Rights in opposition to UNHRC is that its withdrawal came at the height of its current and most terrible violation of Human and Children’s Rights, when it put in cages more than 2,500 children, some infants, separated from their parents who tried to enter the US illegally through the southern border. The protests within the US were so strong, compelling Trump to issue an Executive Order, much against his will, to stop the separation of children from parents. Those calling Sri Lanka to follow Donald Trump and the US in withdrawing from the UNHRC should think a little more on the US records on Human Rights on a larger scale, and not be confined to Trumps tactics to Keep America Strong Again.
It is also useful to note that the Trump move was against the Arabs, especially the Palestinians, with whom Sri Lanka has strong ties, and has always supported of the right of the Palestinians to have a two-state settlement with Israel. Any move to follow the US and Donald Trump to move away from the UNHRC, which certainly needs much criticism, will be moving into the anti-Human Rights cesspool largely maintained by the United States.
The Right of the Robe
The new twirl in the twist of politics comes with the refusal by Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena to wear the prison uniform for convicts, known as the ‘jumper’, after his sentence to rigorous imprisonment for highly unruly and disrespectful behaviour in a court of law, directed at the wife of the still ‘missing’ journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
This shows a rise in the politics of religion with the Yellow Robe used as a major political icon, moving it away from the sacerdotal garb of monkhood that is so special to the culture and traditions of Buddhism. The calls from some members of the Maha Sangha and politicians, as well as academics and professionals promoting and emphasizing the religious dominance of Buddhism in this country, against any move to compel Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera to wear the ‘jumper’ that is the traditional garb of a convict in prison raises many issues relating to religion and government, and the equality in enforcement of the law in the country.
While Nayaka Theras of some chapters and units of the Nikayas have written to President Sirisena on the matter, there are also street protests and calls for stronger protests and agitations if the prison regulations are to be enforced regarding the dress behaviour of this monk. It is certainly moving to a situation calling into question the basics of democratic society and governance, with attempts to push forward the concepts of a religion, and not, a law based society.
Sangha Sabhava
There is one political leader, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, from the political party that promoted Buddhist monks into parliament, suggesting that matters such as the garb of a Buddhist monk in prison should be decided by the Mahanayaka Theras or a special Sangha Sabhava. There is little thought given as to what such moves can cause in the context of unity in a society that has several religions, entitled to equal rights, while predominance is given to Buddhism in the Constitution. It is significant to note that the Bodu Bala Sena and Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera is one who has paid hardly attention to such equality among religions, which is better remembered by politicians, and future presidential hopefuls too, who have Iftar celebrations at Beruwela, where the Bodu Bala Sena was hugely, violently and tragically active in 2014.
Do politicians who seek Sangha Sabhas to decide on the handling of members of the Sangha, also call for Members of Parliament, and not the judiciary, to decide on how those who obtain crooked funds for election campaigns or any other purpose, should be dealt with?
The Minister of Justice and Prison Reform Thalatha Atukorale, has made it clear that the Prison Regulations should be observed with regard to the garb of inmates, including those of the clergy of any faith. It is in the interests of democracy and social equality that such a position is followed by the government and its leaders; despite the popularity that some in key positions may try to achieve, by giving a pardon to the ‘anti-jumper’ convict or give a new twist to the Constitutional provisions of Buddhism.
