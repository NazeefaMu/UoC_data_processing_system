‘Pacific Partnership 2017 will build trust between US and Sri Lanka’

Pacific partnership 2017 will be the foundation to build and preserve trust and credibility between the United States and Sri Lanka, USN Task Force 73 Commander Admiral Don Gabrielson said answering to questions raised by the media at the opening ceremony of PP2017 held at the Magampura Port in Hambantota on Tuesday.
Admiral Gabrielson on-board US Naval Ship ‘Fall River’ belonging to the US Pacific Command arrived at the Hambantota Port on Tuesday.
Gabrielson said: “There is an old saying that you cannot search trust. It takes a lot of effort to build trust and credibility. This exercise will make it easier for us to help each other when the unthinkable happens.”
On being asked why Sri Lanka was selected as the first of four nations for the 2017 Pacific Partnership programme, Admiral Gabrielson said the Sri Lanka government had made the request. Hambantota area was selected out of about 48 areas proposed for PP 2017.
Sri Lanka's Southern Naval Area Commander Rear Admiral Nishantha Ulugethenna stressed on its importance and benefits, while Director Naval Operations Commander Kalana Jinadasa proposed the vote of thanks.
PP 2017 Mission Commander Captain Stnafiels Chien said the Pacific Partnership Goodwill mission started in 2006 through which a healthy exchange of knowledge and building of trust and friendship has been formed.
