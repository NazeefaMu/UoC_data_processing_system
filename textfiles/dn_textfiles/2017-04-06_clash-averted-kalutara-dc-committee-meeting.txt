Clash averted at Kalutara DC Committee meeting

The Kalutara District Coordinating Committee meeting held at the District Secretariat on Monday had to be stopped mid way as Lakshman Wijemanne, MP and Provincial Council member Jagath Pinnegodavithana, both from the UNP, almost came to exchanging blows following a heated argument.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who chaired the meeting intervened to stop the tussle and later called off the meeting.
The heated argument between the two erupted over a proposal made by Pinnagoda to accommodate an addition class to the Grade 1 classes of the C.W.W. Kannangara Maha Vidyalaya being rejected by educational authorities.
Pinnagoda first had a heated argument with education authorities for not endorsing his proposal and later Wijemanne had taken on Pinnagoda over the verbal barrage against education officials.
