‘Govt. accepts rise in underworld activities’

The government accepts that underworld activities in the country has seen a dramatic increase, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said yesterday.
He said that the matter was discussed at the Cabinet meeting too. He added that the Cabinet was of the view that underworld crimes should be brought to an end.
Minister Weerakkody was responding to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation head office auditorium in Dematagoda.
He said that if there are politicians behind these activities as the opposition members allege, they too should be dealt with by the law.
“But, we have to think twice on the statement made by opposition member Alahapperuma,” Minister Weerakkody said.
The minister further said the Police has to handle such activities as the Police is independent now. “There was a period when certain politicians sat on the Police OIC’s chair and tried to handle Police matters,” Minister Weerakkody said.
“But, that situation has changed now. The Police is independent”.
He added that earlier, politicians were given STF backup. “But today, I saw a prison bus transporting inmates with a STF backup,” Minister Weerakkody said. “It’s a real change”.
