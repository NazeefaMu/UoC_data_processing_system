Step into a scene, and let it drip

Sri Lanka’s book market does not offer much enthusiasm or encouragement to a budding writer as compared to that of a western country. Although publishers would flourish thanks to the sale of textbooks, translations and a host of novels, they have become the lamenting crowd with hardly anything up for sale.
That is why there are more author publishers than professional publishers in Sri Lanka. Most authors are destined with the danger of having their work rejected. The publishers of course are not to be blamed, as they too have to earn their bread and butter. And the author publications are mostly launched as a result of enthusiasm. Only a handful could claim a sizeable profit from the author publications.
Gunaratne Ekanayake belongs to that ‘handful’ team, which is almost non-existent.
Sudu saha Kalu, which was launched recently, is Ekanayake’s 75th book. Dealing with the White rule in Ceylon, Gunaratne Ekanayake uses his creativity to elaborate how the good old Ceylonese traditional village was capsized owing to the political and social changes caused by the colonial rule. The charming village traditions were demolished with the new highways built across the paddy fields.
Ekanayaka writes at a rate, anyone can comfortably state that. And he has a reason. His books sell well. Some of the books have even gone to 10 prints with 1000 copies each.
“I am focusing on teenage novels, because the teenagers of this country are looking for material to read. Most novels published today contain more adult material than teenage-interest situations,” Ekanayake observed.
Writing to the teenagers is the secret behind Ekanayake’s bestsellers.
“I am content. I am living by the income generated from my books. If someone thinks no one can live by books in Sri Lanka, I would cite myself as an example to oppose that theory. Books like Madol Duwa are sold because they are prescribed for examinations. I have earned a place in the market though none of my books is prescribed for examinations,” Ekanayake noted.
Ekanayake’s muse is simply a walk in the street. Or traveling by bus on the other hand. Once the muse settles in his mind, Ekanayake lets it brew in his head. The thoughts and the muse grow in his mind until he gets a chance to put the thoughts on a piece of paper.
“Usually I write about four half sheet pages. That amounts to 60 pages in a month. That could be considered a novel on average. There is a lot of editing happening while I write. But once I am done, I will never rewrite it. I send it directly to typesetting. I may add or omit certain things while proof-reading. When I wrote Hutapata Veediya, I did not just write. I let it grow inside me. I was thinking about my own youth and was remembering all what happened by then. After it got implanted thoroughly only I began writing,” Ekanayake explained.
That too does not happen all the time.
“It will be wrong if I claim that I am always on the writer’s mood. No, I too face the writer’s block. There are times when I do not feel like writing a single word. Then I do not struggle to write. For instance, I am just idling around these days,” Ekanayake said.
A novel has to be written when you are in the right mood, believes Ekanayake. Otherwise, you cannot produce a fine-quality novel. The writers have to read a lot. But Gunaratne Ekanayake does not have enough time to read.
“The problem we have today is that we have a large number of books being published. The number of books is much larger than it used to be in the past. But the reader cannot be on the equal grounds. They are not in a stable financial situation to buy books. We have to make this journey slowly,” Ekanayake said.
Slow and steady wins the race, of course. - SM
