Play with your pout!

Want to step up your make-up game this year? If yes, the first step is to give your matte lipstick a break. Gloss and glitter are clearly back in action. So, stack up on them to make a statement.
The hot trending colours for your pout are peaches, electric oranges, corals and the deeper shades of violet.
Liquid matte lips dominated the last few years, but in 2017, lip gloss is the refreshing change to exude a youthful appeal - while enhancing the dimension of the pout.
Also worth trying would be lip glosses with translucent plumping serum, incorporating a range of pigment to the formula. Such glosses trigger a slightly intense tingling sensation that can (and most likely will) last up to 10 minutes, creating temporarily fuller and high gloss lips with each application.
For those willing to go bold and experimental, here’s what you ought to try - 3D, statement lips from ombre effects to an overlay of glitter.
If you are thrilled about carrying the look to work; play it up minimally. Begin by layering two different effects, such as a base layer of a satiny lipstick with a dab of high-glitter gloss - right on the centre of your lips to create new dimensions!
Make-up trends are fleeting. But, if there’s a classic pick which won’t disappoint, it’s got to be the bold red lip - which never goes out of style.
The deep red lip still finds a major spot in the beauty block. Jazz it up with a hint of gloss to let your lips do the talking!
