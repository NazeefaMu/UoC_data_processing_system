Hartal paralyses North, East

Many towns in the North and East were deserted with all shops and other institutions closed yesterday due to a hartal organised by families and relatives of missing persons saying their 63-day satyagraha campaign had not helped in obtaining information on their loved ones who had gone missing. Pictures show the deserted towns of Kalmunai, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa.
