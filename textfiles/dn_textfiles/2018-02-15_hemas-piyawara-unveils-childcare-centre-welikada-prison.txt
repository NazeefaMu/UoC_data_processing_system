Hemas Piyawara unveils Childcare centre at Welikada Prison

Hemas Outreach Foundation (HOF), the CSR arm of Hemas Holdings together with the Welikada Prison Department, unveiled the newly refurbished Child Care Centre on February 4, at the Welikada Prison Complex.
The occasion was graced by Commissioner General Prisons H.M.N.C. Dhanasinghe and CEO, Hemas Holdings PLC Steven Enderby with other dignitaries including officials from the Civil Defense Force who provided their services to renovate the center.
The 3.5 million project, enriched and empowered the lives of the young children who were compelled to live with their mothers under appalling conditions for no fault of their own.
The newly refurbished child care centre provided improved sleeping conditions, sanitation facilities, and a play area within the premises. Further, along with providing the basic daily nutrition requirements of the children, Hemas will be distributing consignments of its Baby Cheramy products under the supervision of the HOF and Prison Authorities on a monthly basis.
‘Piyawara Singithi Diriya’ enhances the lives of the children residing at the prison quarters with their mothers who are prisoners at the Welikada Prisons.
It is part of a larger project, ‘Piyawara’ which was launched in 2002 in partnership with the Children’s Secretariat of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs.
The project focuses on promoting Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in Sri Lanka.
At present there are 44 ‘Piyawara’ preschools across the country, focusing on key aspects within the framework of ECCD providing a holistic approach to preschool education.
Senior Superintendent of Welikada Prison Chandana Ekanayake stated,“We have received suggestions by well- meaning individuals and renowned companies in the past towards the betterment of these children who have been incarcerated for no fault of their own, but it never materialized until this prerogative by Hemas.”
The Management and staff at Hemas place immense value on ‘Piyawara Singithi Diriya’ and extend their fullest cooperation towards the success of this project,” said Shiromi Masakorala, Executive Director of the Hemas Outreach Foundation.
The special occasion was further signified by the planting of trees by two of the most legendary Sri Lankan cricketers, Roshan Mahanama and Kumara Sangakkara along with Yehali Sangakkara who extend their support to ‘Piyawara Singithi Diriya’.
