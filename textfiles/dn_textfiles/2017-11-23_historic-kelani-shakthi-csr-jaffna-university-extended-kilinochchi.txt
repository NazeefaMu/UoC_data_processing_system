The Kelani-Saviya, CSR project was launched in 2007 between the University of Peradeniya, Engineering faculty and the MoU was signed by the then Kelani Cables PLC MD Hemantha Perera and Prof SBS Abeykone of the faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. Prof. Janaka Ekanayake and Jayantha Wijesinghe, then Asst. Marketing Manager, Kelani Cables PLC, were the co-initiators of this CSR Project.
This agreement was in force upto 2012. A fresh MoU was signed in 2014 and is in operation now.
“We are extremely happy with the progress made so far judging from the letters of appreciation we receive from the trainees.
We are confident that this CSR project will yield excellent results in developing young electrical technicians from the Northern Peninsula and also help in winning the hearts and minds of the people of the North. 50 electrical Technicians have passed out since the first MoU was signed in 2014,” Saranapala added.
Making the welcome address Dr T Thiruvaran, Course Director, Kelani Shakthi, said they had started the collaboration with Kelani Cables in June 2014 for the period of 3 years and today they had extended it for another 3 years.
He said 24 students from the first batch and 23 from the second batch have successfully completed their studies and the second batch will be presented with their certificates. Dr Thiruvaran said the demand for this course is always on the rise and the idea of the course is to enhance the knowledge of electrical technicians in Sri Lanka by teaching the technical background of the electrical wiring to them.
Dean Faculty of Engineering University of Jaffna Prof A Atputharajah said, the MoU signed was the very first by the faculty with the industry and they were pleased to extend the MoU with a internationally recognized company like Kelani Cables which recently recived the World Class Award (Highest) in the large manufacturing category at the Global Performance Excellence Awards 2017 held in Manila.
Prof Atputharajah said his relationship with Kelani Cables runs way back to 2007 when the Kelani Saviya was launched at the Peradeniya University in Sinhala medium. He said since he took over as the dean of Engineering University of Jaffna, CEO Kelani Cables Saranapala and Course Coordinator Jayantha Wijesinghe had continuosly requested him to start a similar course in Tamil medium.
This resulted in the launch of Kelani Shakthi in 2014, he said. Prof Atputharajah said the program would have not been a reality if not for the tireless perseverance and support of CEO Kelani Cables Saranapala in bringing Kelani Shakthi to Jaffna.
