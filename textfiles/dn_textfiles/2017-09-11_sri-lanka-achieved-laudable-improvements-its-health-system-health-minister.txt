Sri Lanka achieved laudable improvements in its health system: Health Minister

Sri Lanka achieved some laudable improvements in the health system; Malaria eradication, migration health policy, and multi-pronged battle against NCDs are to of them, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South East Asia held in Male, Maldives recently.
The Minister said cardiac stents and eye lenses were provided free of charge to patients of government hospitals and prices of commonly used 48 drugs were reduced.
He said Sri Lanka was enjoying universal health coverage for almost six decades. The country managed to have high ranks in many international health indicators by now, especially in its maternal and child health field. Communicable diseases were controlled effectively supported by 100 percent immunization coverage, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka achieved polio free status way back in 1993 and completely controlled lymphatic filariasis last year. The country is now eliminating rabies, mother to child transmission of HIV, measles and congenital rubella and the programme in this regard will complete by 2020.
“We have a fairly low viral hepatitis burden. It is below two percent. We will strengthen our routine immunization programme, three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine,soon to be boosted with a birth dose of the vaccine based on expert opinion, he said.
