Flight with furry night flyers

Juliet Coombe discovers the nightlife at Jetwing Yala, is one of the most unusual in the country with their new bat man experience run by the hotels leading naturalist Chamara Amarasinghe, who will give you a whole new perspective on the debate Dracula versus The Dark Knight.
Some people go to Yala for only a night stay for a safari in the island’s most amazing national park and then move onto the next place, but my recommendation is to stay for four or five days and experience some of their incredible nature experiences like the bat tour run late afternoon, which for me personally was a life changing experience. Walking silently around the Jetwing Yala perimeter fence with Jetwing naturalist Chamara pointing out birds and lizards is a fascinating nature trail by day and even more exciting at night time when the Yala bats in Red Arrows formation start to appear over head and then vanish like ghosts into the night or maybe shape shifters that turn into the twinkling star constellation above.

Each bat I am told is key to our echo system both as pollinators and terminators of unwanted air born insects, which would become uncontrollable by us on the ground if they became extinct. Bats, formerly also known as flittermice, have fascinated humans for centuries and have, of course, been defamed quite seriously in the last century by fiction writers and media types like me. Blame it on Bram Stoker and his transmutation of the vampire bat into charming human form, blame it on Halloween when my kids like to dress up like bats to get sweets off the neighbours or blame it on the bat being the carrier of rabies to humans in over 80 per cent of all cases, often in a subtle and therefore fatal way – there are almost no survivors of this viral and hideous harbinger of the grim reaper.
Vampire bats may be the only mammals that feed off animal blood but this is just one species of over 1,100 species of bats worldwide, representing 20 per cent of all mammal species, of which 30 can be found in Sri Lanka. If you are not scared of their bloodlust, you might be scared of the very largest of them, the giant golden-crowned flying fox, which can have a wingspan greater than the average adult woman’s height. Then you might be unnerved by their being the only mammals capable of sustained flight and then by the fact that they are more adept than birds at changing direction, flying fast and flittingly, in and out of lit areas or whatever else may temporarily expose their dark, craggy and mysterious forms. If you’re still not impressed, imagine being able to visualise your environment in pitch blackness in minute detail, through echolocation at up to 200 pulses per second and then on top of that, acute hearing to further identify your prey’s faintest of movements and flutterings. You might not know also that none of them are blind, though many have poor sight and that they can breathe through their skin in addition to their lungs.
Chamara who has been researching bats for years believes that Sri Lankan bats are different from Indian ones and would like the academic world to look at why and for us to gain better understanding about why it is important to leave our bats in the Church belfry or where ever they are discovered. His eyes light up as he says in short they are amongst the most skilful and talented of natures creatures and still one of the most under-appreciated. 
 I had no idea until spending a most eye opening evening with Chamara that they play such a vital role in the ecosystem, with 70 per cent of species controlling massive swathes of insects with extraordinarily impressive headcounts per night – up to half their weight, thereby reducing the need for pesticides, which ironically cause the death of very large numbers of them.
They are also responsible for a great deal of pollination by the highly specialised microbats, dispersion of seeds by the fruit-eating megabats, and the provision of a very rich fertiliser, in the form of their excrement, harvested from caves.
I hope after reading this you are now thinking more about the great cricketer Sangakara and his megabat, and Batman, the skilful protector of people with a host of baddies trying to get rid of him instead of the fearful count Dracula. On a very serious note bats are becoming increasingly endangered and some species have been wiped out altogether owing mainly to unhealthy farming pesticides that accumulate in their prey, the fact that many people still eat roasted bats in places like Laos, the ongoing destruction of trees/habitat, the disturbance of roosting caves and the demolition of old houses a place bats love to hang out in and old plumbago mines. The protection of bats by relevant authorities in Sri Lanka and many other countries around the world is just the first step in controlling the decline of this most amazing of animals. By going on a walk and sitting in a group at the end under the stars to pick out the different species the General Manager at Jetwing Yala and Chamara hope every guest and reader of this piece will be the change we need in the world to protect these vitally important creatures that both pollinate and terminate unwanted air born insects.
