There will be no room for another Somarama or Buddharakkitha: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that his government would not leave any room for the creation of another Talduwe Somarama or Mapitigama Buddharakkitha among the Maha Sangha.
Joining the debate on agreements Sri Lanka entered with several other nations at the time of adjournment, the Prime Minister said that an unfortunate incident occurred in the country on January 26 at the Homagama Magistrate's Court where Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was remanded till February 9.
"This is a court order. We should respect the law and a court order. A group of monks staged a demonstration opposite the Homagama Magistrate's Court. It is not certain whether all of them were bhikkhus or posing as bikkhus wearing robes.The police acted on the instructions of the Magistrate. There is a law in the country and all are equal before the law. The law has to be implemented against all equally," the Prime Minister said.
A warrant was issued by the Homagama Magistrate's Court for the arrest of Gnanasara Thera on the charges of allegedly threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, at the court premises.
The Prime Minister said he had instructed the police to have a full scale investigation into the conduct of Ven. Gnanasara Thera and submit the report to the Mahanayakes of the Malwatte and Kotte Chapters for further action against Ven. Gnanasara Thera.
"I am a Buddhist and I am ashamed of what happened at the Homagama Magistrate's Court premises," he said. He added that the present government would not leave any room for the creation of Somaramas or Buddharakkithas again.
