Drive to wean men off smoking

A five-year programme was launched in Colombo yesterday to reduce the number of men who smoke, to less than five percent by 2030 as one in every two Sri Lankan men is reported to be smoking.
Addressing the programme launching, WHO Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said the government has worked well to control the use of tobacco, and especially by introducing legislation. Sri Lanka is the first among 15 countries selected to launch the five-year programme.
British High Commissioner James Dauris said the UK grants US $ 20 million for the five-year programme.
The commitment displayed by the government is a major fact considered when selecting Sri Lanka as one of the 15 countries to implement the five-year programme.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said part of the grant received from the UK will be used to assist 35,000 tobacco cultivators to abandon the cultivation and to commence another type of cultivation or another livelihood.
About 25,000 people die in Sri Lanka annually due to smoking. Five percent of them are children subjected to passive smoking, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka has implemented 80 percent of pictorial warning on cigarette packets and 90 percent of tax on tobacco which is the highest in the world. Laws will be brought to introduce plain packaging, banning the sale of single cigarettes and banning the sale of cigarettes within a 500 metre radius of schools and places where children gather, he said. <U+200B>
