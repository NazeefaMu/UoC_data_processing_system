Nations Trust Bank introduces  Flexi Deposit Scheme

Nations Trust Bank introduces Nations Flexi Deposit, a scheme tailor-made for fixed deposits with a flexible investment period of your own choosing to receive the benefits of high interest earnings.
This scheme enables you to choose a flexible investment period ranging from a minimum of 30 days to a maximum of 365 days for your fixed deposits with attractive interest rates relative to the investment period.
Flexi Deposit is specially designed for when you have realized significant sums of money and wish to hold these funds in cash for short periods before reinvesting them. Flexi Deposit accounts can be opened as individual or joint accounts by resident Sri Lankan nationals or resident foreign nationals holding a valid Sri Lankan resident visa.
Speaking about the launch of Nations Flexi Deposit, Sheahan Daniel, Head of Branches, Nations Trust Bank said, “Even when funds are not required immediately, customers are often reluctant to open fixed deposits because of the inflexible deposit periods. For example, if you want your money in a fixed deposit for 50 days, with normal fixed deposits in the market this is not possible.”
For more information on this service, customers can visit the Nations Trust Bank website www.nationstrust.com to learn more about Nations Flexi FD and other financial products and services or visit a Nations Trust Bank branch.
