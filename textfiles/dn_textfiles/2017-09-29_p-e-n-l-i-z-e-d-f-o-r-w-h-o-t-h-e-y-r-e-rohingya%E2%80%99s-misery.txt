P e n a l i z e d f o r w h o t h e y a r e: The Rohingya’s misery

It was most distressing to watch the news item on 26 September of the so called protest by some unruly monks and coarse looking men in front of the supposed refuge of Rohingya asylum seekers. This place I believe is in the bustling Colombo suburb of Mt. Lavinia. The protest was held on a busy weekday, causing much inconvenience to the general public.
From what we can gather, these refugees, having escaped from harrowing events in their native Myanmar, were afloat on a small boat in Sri Lankan waters when they were detained by our navy. The journey in the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal would have been testing, especially for the women and children who until now have lived in peaceful villages, occupied mainly in agriculture. Even on a straight line, the distance from Myanmar to Sri Lanka is approximately 1,400 miles. In the windy and choppy seas, a boat cannot sail on a straight line.
Legend has it that some two thousand e years ago,an errant prince and his companions were put on a boat and exiled from a land somewhere close to the starting point, perhaps present day Bengal. The father, the king, could not overlook the young man’s misdemeanours any longer. This was heavy punishment. Banishment over the ocean would mean never to see his son again.There were no reliable navigational aids then, and those in the water went where the wind and the waves took them.
It was a long and hazardous journey, and after a violent storm the young men were washed ashore on the sandy beaches of far-away Lanka, to face new adventures in the strange land. Those were happy days, before humans had invented inconveniences like national borders, passports and visas. The indigenous to the island at the time, had no appreciation of what this chance landing of strange men on their shore bode. In all probability, they had neither the will nor the capacity to do anything about it either. As they say, the rest is history.
In the intervening two thousand years humans have evolved so much that we may well be another species. We do everything differently now. Technology has brought food, clothing and creature comforts within easy reach. Religions have mellowed us. Science and education have enlightened us. Laws have disciplined us.Our concepts have become larger and broader.
But then, we encounter incidents like that of September 26, and the whole assumption of an advancing civilization comes into doubt. The primitive passions rise, the fanatic emerges and the savage takes charge.
Victims of circumstance
These Rohingya refugees were victims of circumstances, penalized not for something they have done (especially the women and children), but for who they are. They did not leave their hearths and homes for economic betterment. If that was the reason to brave the Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka would be a strange choice. It was a fear for their lives that emboldened them to embark on the dangerous voyage. They are human beings in distress.
This is not a situation for us to look at through eyes of politics or even particularities. These unfortunates have left behind everything they owned in order to save their lives. We need not look at the justice of the situation or the history of the problem. It does not matter what nationality, religion, politics or the colour the desperate refugees belong to. In such situations we do not ask for whom the bell tolls.
Sri Lanka should be proud to welcome them, give them succour and hope. True, we are a poor and over-populated country and cannot indefinitely support refugees on our soil. The country can work with the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and other countries to find a permanent solution. Perhaps we can be a transit point for the refugees. But as long as they are here, we have a duty of care. The world should see that while we have our own problems, we are not an ungenerous people and certainly not poor in human spirit. This is what being civilized is all about.
One cannot help but notice the few Buddhist monks at the protest, who stood out like sore thumbs. In the moral confusion of the day, it is not surprising that some of the clergy are pulled into matters far outside of a spiritual journey. We see several of them involved in political and other worldly matters; seeking rich and powerful patronage, succumb to the allure of creature comforts far above the average and indulge in the occult. The power of ‘Maya’ is immense indeed.
We can only observe that Buddhism is one of the profoundest ‘philosophies’ to have emerged out of the Indian sub-continent. Not everyone who can claim perfect understanding of its deep and difficult message. But anybody could act in its name.
That is a tragedy, and yet, like all things corporeal, a ‘Maya’.
The Misunderstood Roots of Burma’s Rohingya Crisis
Over the past month, a crackdown by Burma’s military has forced more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in what the UN human-rights chief has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” The military crackdown was prompted by an attack on August 25th by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Muslim militant group with reported links to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, on security outposts.
The international community has condemned the violence unleashed by the Burmese military on Rohingya civilians. It has also voiced sharp criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and de-facto Burmese leader, for, in the view of her critics, not doing enough to protect the Rohingya, who have been stateless for more than three decades. But where humanitarian groups and Western nations see the world’s most persecuted minority, the government of Burma (also known as Myanmar) and an overwhelming majority of its people see a foreign group with a separatist agenda, fuelled by Islam, and funded from overseas. It’s this difference in perception that will make any resolution of the Rohingya issue extremely difficult.
“It gets to this notion of ethnicity in the Myanmar mind that I think the West doesn’t quite understand,” Derek Mitchell, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Burma from 2012 to 2016, said. “We in the international community see the Rohingya as innocent people who just want to call themselves a name and who are uniquely abused for it. And, of course, it’s true they are largely innocent and uniquely abused. But to people in Myanmar, the name suggests something much more.”
Tensions between Muslims and Buddhists
Tensions between the Bengali-speaking Muslims and Buddhists in Rakhine state have existed for decades—some would say centuries—but the most significant inflection point came in 1982 when Burma’s junta passed a law that identified 135 ethnicities entitled to citizenship. The Rohingya were not among them, though they had enjoyed equal rights since Burma became independent from British rule in 1948. Almost overnight, they were stripped of their citizenship.
In the years since then, the Rohingya were persecuted, steadily lost their rights, and were the victims of violence. The worst of this violence erupted in 2012 following the rape of a Buddhist woman allegedly by Muslim men. That prompted massive religious violence against the Rohingya, forcing 140,000 of them into camps for internally displaced people. International pressure resulted in the military government agreeing to grant the Rohingya a reduced form of citizenship if they registered themselves as Bengali—not Rohingya. Although many Muslims in Rakhine state were previously indifferent to how they were labelled, the years of oppression, combined with the type of citizenship they were being offered, made the offer unpalatable.
“Activists and leaders in the [Rohingya] community are very protective of that name. They see it as protective of their identity and dignity after so many basic rights have been taken from them in recent years. The name has also been essential to their international campaign for attention,” Mitchell said.
For the Burmese government, the word Rohingya is particularly fraught. This is because if the government acknowledges Rakhine’s Muslims as members of the Rohingya ethnic group, then under the 1982 citizenship law—ironically, the same measure that stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship—the Muslims would be allowed an autonomous area within the country. And therein lies the crux of the problem: The Burmese fear a Rohingya autonomous area along the border with Bangladesh would come at the expense of Rakhine territory. The Burmese military, which has cracked down on Rohingya civilians, views this as a possible staging area for terrorism by groups like ARSA.
“This fear is very deeply felt and not understood in the West—and it comes from a real place rooted in Burma’s history,” Mitchell said.
Caught up in the crossfire
That “real place” dates back to the aftermath of World War II, when the forebears of the Rohingya appealed to Pakistan, which at the time included what is now Bangladesh, to annex their territory. Pakistan did not do so. Subsequently, many of the Muslims took up arms and fought a separatist rebellion until the 1960s, though vestiges of the rebellion continued until the 1990s.
“So when the Rakhine and others in Myanmar look at what’s going on with the name Rohingya, the desire for recognition as an accepted ethnicity, now this militant activity in their name, and calls by some for international intervention, including a safe zone, they see that as a separatist agenda by other means,” Mitchell said. “And those caught in the middle are hundreds of thousands of innocent Rohingya.”
The Rakhines themselves are an ethnic minority in Burma, though they are predominantly Buddhist, and so share the same faith as nearly 88 percent of the rest of the country.
Indeed, Maung Thway Chun, the editor of a news weekly for hard-line Buddhist nationalists, told Joe Freeman, a journalist based in Rangoon: “[W]e don’t want Muslims to swallow our country … They will not finish with attacking just Rakhine. They will also invade Chin State or Irrawaddy region,” he said, referring to two states located to the immediate South and North East of Rakhine. “Then this country will be a Muslim country. It is such a shame for us that the land we inherited from our former generations will be lost in our time.”
That may sound absurd in a country with a 4 percent Muslim population, but it’s an argument that many Burmese make, pointing to ARSA’s growing presence in Rakhine and surrounding areas. Bangladesh has watched with growing concern the group’s activity on its soil, and proposed military operations with Burma against it.
The Burmese government, under international pressure, has tried to come up with a solution to this issue, setting up a commission under Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary-General. The so-called Advisory Commission on Rakhine State issued a number of recommendations, including a review of the 1982 citizenship law. Suu Kyi, the country’s de-facto leader, embraced those recommendations made on August 25th. But just hours after that report was made public, ARSA carried out its attacks, prompting the military’s crackdown, and the subsequent allegations of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.
Suu Kyi condemned
Suu Kyi has been widely condemned for her controversial remarks about the Rohingya, as well as her perceived silence on the violence inflicted upon them. Several commentators have argued the Nobel laureate has lost her moral authority. Her fellow Nobel peace laureates Desmond Tutu and Malala Yousafzai have urged her to protect the Rohingya. Her speech this week was also condemned because she did not mention the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya.
Tom Malinowski, the Obama-era assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labour, told me he had warned Suu Kyi that “extremist groups will eventually provoke a confrontation as a means of recruiting fighters for violent attacks” and, when they eventually do, “Burma has no defence against groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS.” He said he also told Suu Kyi the Burmese military “will willingly fall for that trap [of responding with force against civilian populations], because it can use the ensuing confrontation to rally Buddhists to its side, and thus preserve its authority.”
But Mitchell said he found reasons for optimism in Suu Kyi’s remarks this week. The Burmese leader repeatedly appealed to the international community to work with the Burmese to find a solution.
“That’s an opening,” Mitchell said. “To me that’s an opportunity.”
