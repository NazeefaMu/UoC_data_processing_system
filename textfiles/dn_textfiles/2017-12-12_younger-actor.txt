Younger  actor

That Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan are BFFs in Bollywood isn’t any news. Farah has directed films like ‘Main Hoon Na’, ‘Om Shanti Om’ and ‘Happy New Year’, all of which have had SRK play the lead. The duo not only shares a great professional relationship but also a great camaraderie off the sets. They are often seen visiting each other and being part of each other’s parties and get-togethers.
However, rumour has it that SRK will not be a part of Farah’s next venture. Reports suggest that Shah Rukh doesn’t have the time and is also allegedly not too happy with the quality of the film dished out to him. So, now Farah reportedly plans to cast a younger actor in her next film and make changes depending on whom she is casting. TNN
