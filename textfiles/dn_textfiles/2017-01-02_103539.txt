Local Government Minister refuses to accept delimitation report

 
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha refused to accept the final delimitation committee report this afternoon, pointing out the report had not been signed by all five members that he appointed.
“I appointed five members to the Delimitation Committee. Now two members have not signed. I request the Chairman of the Committee Asoka Peiris to inform the other two members in writing, to explain their reasons for not signing”, he said.
A press conference was organized at the Local Government and Provincial Council Ministry today, and the media informed that Chairman of the Delimitation Committee Asoka Peiris would hand over the report to Minister Mustapha then.
However, at the given time, Minister Mustapha refused to accept the report, adding that he would have to look into the legal provisions of accepting the report without the signature of two members in a five member committee.
Delimitation Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris however contradicted the statement made by the Minister,  saying that the report can be accepted if it has been signed by a majority in the Committee.
“Last Friday, all five members of the Committee decided we would submit the report to the Minister on Monday. However, only three members signed the report on Saturday and we decided to submit the report to the Minister, as the majority has signed it. The other two members said that they need to go through the report again before signing it,” he said.
The Delimitation Committee is headed by the former commissioner-general of lands, Asoka Peiris, with four other members representing political parties: the United National Party’s A.S.M. Misbar, the United People’s Freedom Front’s K. Saliya, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna’s Upul Kumaraperuma and the Tamil National Alliance’s Professor B. Balasundarampillai.
According to Peiris, it is the United National Party's A.S.M. Misbar and the United People’s Freedom Front’s K. Saliya who have not yet signed the report.
