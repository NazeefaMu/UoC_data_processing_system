Australia’s Voges concussed after blow to helmet

SYDNEY: Struggling Australia batsman Adam Voges suffered concussion after he was struck on the helmet by a bouncer on Thursday, ruling him out of a domestic game and dealing a blow to his Test chances.
The 37-year-old needed runs in Western Australia’s Sheffield Shield clash with Tasmania in Perth to salvage his Test spot after a highest score of 47 in his last 10 innings.
But the sickening impact from a Cameron Stevenson bouncer saw him sink to the ground before gingerly walking off minutes later, with each arm wrapped around the shoulder of medical staff.
“Voges has been diagnosed with concussion. He is ok, naturally a bit groggy. Being monitored by medicos. Ruled out of rest of game,” the Western Australian Cricket Association tweeted.
The scare came just weeks after an inquest into the death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes, who died from bleeding on the brain in November 2014 after being hit on the neck by a rising ball during a domestic match in Sydney.
A coroner ruled Hughes made a “minuscule misjudgement” before he was fatally struck, attaching no blame to the bowler or the tactic of sending down short-pitched deliveries.
It was the second serious concussion Voges has suffered this year after being struck on the head by an errant throw while fielding for Middlesex in England.
Australia’s Test team has been thrown into crisis after five straight defeats, with chairman of selectors Rod Marsh quitting on Wednesday.
