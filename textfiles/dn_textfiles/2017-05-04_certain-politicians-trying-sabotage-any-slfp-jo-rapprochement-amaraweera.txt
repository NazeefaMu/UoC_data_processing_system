Certain politicians trying to sabotage any SLFP, JO rapprochement: Amaraweera

I tried my best to unite the SLFP and the Joint Opposition (JO) with the blessings of President Sirisena, but a few cocky politicians are trying to sabotaged it, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the SLFP wants to win the 2020 election and would be wonderful if the two groups join and work together. Discussions were held even at 2.00 am but a few who are having links to certain politicians sabotaged it. "But,it now seems that the SLFP can win the 2020 election on its own. It was amply proved after this year's May Day rally. I myself brought 6,442 persons to the SLFP May Day rally from the Hambantota district. Every year I obtain a list of names of participants and send a letter thanking each and every participant thanking them for taking part in the rally. But, I did not take them to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens nor did I provide them with liquor as stated on Facebook. This was done with the intention of slinging mud at me,"he said.
"We did not remove any of the SLFP organizers who worked hard for the SLFP. We just appointed new organizers to organize the SLFP. We had to do so because some of them were busy with organising their electorates. Eventhough President Sirisena has the power, he did not act like former Presidents and removed organisers overnight. A total of 500,000 people took part in all May Day rallies held by political parties,"he said.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the SLFP commenced a clean journey on May 1 this year with May Day celebration and hope President Sirisena will launch a programme to further strengthen the party. Over 375 buses with loads of people came to the SLFP May Day rally from the Kurunegala district alone.
Finance (State) Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the SLFP got rid of its racist face and a large number of Tamil and Muslim people took part in the SLFP May Day rally this year. Youth, women and all sections of society took part in large numbers. All organisers took part in it. The SLFP held a very successful May Day rally along with other sister political parties,"he said.
