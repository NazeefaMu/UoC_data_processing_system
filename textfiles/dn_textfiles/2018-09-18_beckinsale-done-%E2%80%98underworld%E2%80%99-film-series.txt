Beckinsale done with  ‘Underworld’ film series

Those who have been holding out hope for a new ‘Underworld’ movie may want to prepare for disappointment. At the very least, don’t expect Kate Beckinsale to suit back up as Selene in the future, as the actress has firmly ruled out a return to the franchise. Here’s what Beckinsale had to say about it when asked if she would do another Underworld in a recent interview.
“I wouldn’t return. I’ve done plenty of those.”
Not a lot of wiggle room in there for interpretation. Cut, dry and quite bluntly stated. Kate Beckinsale has starred in five movies in total as Selene, starting with 2003’s Underworld. She most recently returned to the role in last year’s ‘Underworld: Blood Wars’, which actually brought in a franchise-low $81 million at the global box office and wasn’t particularly well-received, to say the least. So, not only is Beckinsale not interested in returning, but it appears as though much of the desire to see these movies has dried up as well.
To date, the Underworld movies have grossed $540 million at the global box office, peaking with 2012’s Awakening, which made $160 million. Just because Kate Beckinsale is done, it doesn’t mean there can’t be another movie, it just wouldn’t have her in it.
