PM’s appointment is lawful - Senior Lawyer

The appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister is a decision by the executive and therefore, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe cannot move a No-Confidence Motion against him, senior lawyer Sisira Weerasuriya said.
According to him,a decision by the Executive could not be challenged by the legislature without consulting the Supreme Court.
He stated this in reference to the No-Confidence Motion moved by the Opposition against PM Rajapaksa saying that his appointment is illegal and inconsistent with the constitution.
He said neither the United National Party nor former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is in a position to move a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister without challenging his appointment in a court of law as well.
