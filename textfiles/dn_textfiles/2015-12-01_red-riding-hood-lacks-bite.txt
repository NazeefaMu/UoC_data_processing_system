Red Riding Hood: Lacks bite

Borrowing a plot from a well loved fairy tale and giving it a novel and dark twist was once a technique which almost became a trend in Hollywood movies. So it is no wonder that Catherine Hardwicke took Tim Burton's route. Burton tasted success via his smash hit 'Alice in Wonderland'. Thus Hardwicke decided to try her luck a second by bringing the 'Red Riding Hood' tale to life.
Dealing with her frowned-upon love for woodcutter Peter, Valerie also has to contend with a wolf stalking her medieval village home. As the tension rises and Gary Oldman arrives to whip up a literal witch-hunt around the village, the story gains speed. Friends turn on friends; family members begin to suspect each other.
Meantime Valerie comes face to face with the wolf and is shocked that she is able to communicate with it. This makes her suspicious of who the wolf is. Is it her true love or is it her creepy grandmother? Soon she is branded as a witch, This turn of events leads to more misty and thrilling scenes in the snow deep in the woods.
Medieval landscape
Hardwicke should be commended for her effort in setting the story in a fantastical medieval landscape where traditions hold strong. A sharp and somber visual style is the film's strongest asset. Hardwicke makes hay of that iconic red cape and believably building a medieval-ish straw-and-wood village haunted every full moon by a vicious werewolf.
With her keen visual eye and flair for the dramatic, she's conjured up a compelling world for Amanda Seyfried's headstrong Valerie to inhabit.
Valerie and her family
Seyfried, with her enormous eyes and fairy-tale pale skin, fits into Valerie's role with ease. Unlike her performances in some of her previous films Seyfried is bewitching. In one instance she is innocent and timid while during the next scene she is impish, flirty and strong. Seyfried transits into these emotions without a hitch in a convincing manner.
Love triangle
One of the minus points in the movie is the love triangle between Valerie, Shiloh Fernandez's workman and Max Irons' wealthier, more 'suitable' Henry. Once the scenes unfold it is clear that there is not much of a competition for Valerie's affections.
David Johnson's script somehow wrings no tension or dramatic stakes out of the many life-or-death situations. Hardwicke offers so much misdirection about who the werewolf might be that it's impossible to play along with the mystery.
The guessing game of werewolf is more fun than the actual creature itself, which really should have stayed in the shadows after such a long, dramatic build-up. Brief flashes of the creature attacking are effective, but later extended shots show a purely pixel-powered lycanthrope.
The legacy of 'Twilight' is impossible to miss in 'Red Riding Hood'. You get the same old drama between a damsel and a supernatural creature.
Add the fairytale element with a touch of the vampire element in the 'Twilight' series and that pretty much sums up what 'Red Riding Hood' is all about.
