Nominations for 93 LG bodies from Dec. 11-14

District Returning Officers will call for nominations for 93 Local government bodies from December 11-14, the Elections Commission announced yesterday.
The accepting of candidates’ deposits which began yesterday will end on December 13.
The 93 Local Government bodies include seven Municipal Councils, 18 Urban Councils and 68 Pradeshiya Sabhas.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government said that the Gazette Notifications that were subjected to amendments related to 40 LG bodies was presented to President Maithripala Sirisena to obtain his signature yesterday.
“The Gazette Notification will be re-issued with the President’s signature, Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said.
Election Commission sources said if the Gazette is published, then it was likely that polls can be held for 133 LG bodies on the same day.
The Court of Appeal on November 22 issued an interim injunction until December 4 preventing the implementation of the Gazette Notification which includes the number of members and the demarcations of the Local Government bodies.
The Appeal Court stayed the Gazette notice issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government in February and it refers to only 203 of the 336 LG bodies.
In the meantime, the Elections Commission Chairman proposed to hold the election for the 133 Local Government bodies which had not been affected by the Gazette. There were typos in the gazette in relation to 40 LG bodies and amendments need to do be done by re-issuing the gazette notification.
