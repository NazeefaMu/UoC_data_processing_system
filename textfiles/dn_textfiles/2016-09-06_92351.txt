Chris Hemsworth: the next James Bond?

Australian actor Chris Hemsworth catapulted to fame after starring as the Norse god of thunder in Marvel’s ‘Thor’ franchise, but this time, word has it that the hunky actor might just take the place of Daniel Craig as British secret agent James Bond.
“The buzz, and in my opinion, is that it’s Chris Hemsworth for Bond. He would be perfect. I am not being biased in any way,” Bobby Holland Hanton, award-winning 007 stuntman, told The Mirror.
“I think he would be perfect for it, and he has got a fantastic English accent as everyone knows from his performance in ‘Rush,’” added Hanton.
The stuntman, who previously worked with Craig for the “James Bond” movies, said that Hemsworth’s physical prowess is enough to land him the highly-coveted role.
When Hemsworth was asked about the prospect of becoming the next James Bond, the actor hinted that he would not turn down the role if it was offered to him, but noted that there would be a lot of competition for it.
“I don’t know many who wouldn’t jump at that. Would it be scary and daunting? Of course. But what isn’t?” he simply replied.
Aside from Hemsworth, rumor has it that ‘Victoria’ actor Tom Hughes might be offered the role as well, according to The Telegraph.
Meanwhile, Hemsworth is busy filming ‘Thor: Ragnarok’ in Australia, and he is grateful that his work is so close to home.
‘Thor: Ragnarok’ will be released on November 3, 2017.
