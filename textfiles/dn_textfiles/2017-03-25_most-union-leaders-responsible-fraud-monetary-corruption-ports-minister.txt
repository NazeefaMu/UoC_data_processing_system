Most union leaders responsible for fraud, monetary corruption: Ports Minister Ranathunga

Most of the Colombo Port's Union leaders are responsible for the financial irregularities and frauds and monetary corruptions, said Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga. These union leaders who crows loudly that they stand for the protection of the Colombo Port, have been engaging in various frauds and corruption relating to the port. Minister Ranathunga said so while addressing a batch of new security officers at their passing out ceremony yesterday.
The Minister said the country should be protected from people who ruin and destroy the country. “If we wish to make a better country for the future generation, we should render a honest service to the country and to the place where we work,” the Minister added. He further said that there was a saying that when a honest person enters the port as a new employee, he or she would become a corrupt person within a month. However, there was a truth in that since there was such an environment. Anyhow, the current management could change that situation and there is no such situation within the Port premises. “I don’t say that we could obtain our targets totally, but we could make a clear picture for the port. Under the moves taken towards stopping fraud and corruption, we could minimize them drastically. It is a significant achievement in my life,” the minister said. “I don’t say that there aren’t thieves in the country today. Thieves are there even today. But there should be a mechanism to protect the country from these thieves. Or else, the country could not be driven forward,” Minister Ranathunga added.
