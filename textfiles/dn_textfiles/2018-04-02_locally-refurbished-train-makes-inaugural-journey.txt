Locally refurbished train makes inaugural journey

A special train with nine fully repaired and refurbished compartments made its inaugural journey from Colombo Fort to Ragama on March 31.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe and several leading Ministerial and Railway Officials travelled on the train. It left Colombo Fort at 9 a.m. with a full complement of commuters on the route.
The nine compartments were repaired and refurbished under a project to repair and modernise 200 old and disabled 200 compartments launched by the Ministry in keeping with a government budget proposal to grant incentives to local industrialists and uplift them, a Transport Ministry release said.
The 200 compartments to be repaired and refurbished include 140 compartments imported in 1989 and 1992 and removed from use and 60 other compartments belonging to S08 type power sets imported in 1992 and set apart as derelict.
The exterior and interior of the compartments including seats, toilets and accessories were repaired by a local industrial firm named TANTRI, while bogies, brakes, automatic connections were repaired by the mechanical engineering factory of the Railway Department at Ratmalana.
Each compartment had cost nearly Rs. 1.4 to repair and refurbish compared to the expenditure of nearly Rs. 60 million involved in importing a single compartment.
The release said the Ministry and the Railway Department had to face criticism and brickbats from Railway unions when the project was launched to collaborate with the local private sector to upgrade the Railway.
The main accusation was that steps were being taken to privatise the railway. The new project had not only proved them wrong but also enabled the country to make a great saving which would have been otherwise spend on importing brand new compartments and wagons.
