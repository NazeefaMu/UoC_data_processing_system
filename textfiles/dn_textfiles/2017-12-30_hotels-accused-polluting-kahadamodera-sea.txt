Hotels accused of polluting Kahadamodera sea

The residents of Kahadamodera in the Tangalle DS area complain that hotels in the area release contaminated water to the sea. They complain that they cannot bear the bad smell emanating from the sea and the beach.
The Coast Conservation Department and the Coast Resources Management Department had already investigated the reason for the pollution.
The fisher folk in the area said the pollution has posed a severe problem for them as it has jeopardised the aquatic life. Tourists arrivals in the area now have reduced considerably as a result of the bad smell, they said.
