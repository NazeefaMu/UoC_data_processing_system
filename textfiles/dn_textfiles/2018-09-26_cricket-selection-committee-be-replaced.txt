Cricket selection committee to be replaced?

Following the sacking of one-day captain Angelo Mathews by the national cricket selectors comes the news that Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha has sent a letter to Sri Lanka Cricket’s (SLC) CEO Ashley de Silva instructing him to immediately remove the selection committee headed by Graeme Labrooy it is learnt.
Moreover the Sports Minister it is understood has also instructed SLC to include Mathews in the ODI squad against England.
According to sources the Sports Minister has scrutinized the role of the Sri Lanka team’s head coach Chandika Hathurusingha and held him responsible for the Asia Cup debacle.
Sri Lanka suffered heavy defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan to bow out of the Asia Cup in the first round.
Mathews in the meanwhile it is learnt has challenged the decision of the selectors to sack him on the grounds of being unfit and has demanded a fitness test from the selectors after he was told that he would not be picked for the England series over fitness concerns.
