The new location will help cater to many of the offices on High level road, students around the location, residential and walk in customers in Nugegoda, Kirulapone, Wijerama, Maharagama and Pepiliyana areas,” said Chinese Dragon Cafe (Pvt) Ltd, Managing Director, Naishadh Udeshi in a press release.
