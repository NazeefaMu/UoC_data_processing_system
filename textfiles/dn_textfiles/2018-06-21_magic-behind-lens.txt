Magic  BEHIND the lens

Ravindra Ranasinghe will hold his second solo local photographic exhibition “Visions beyond the frame - triumphant odyssey” on June 29 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. The exhibition will be open to public from June 30 to July 1. Most of the images on display at the venue have received international recognition and awards. A coffee table book with nearly 100 images will also be launched at the exhibition.

Ranasinghe has bagged many awards locally and internationally including the world’s most prestigious EFIAP Distinction - Excellence - Federation Internationalede’l Art Photographique.
He always loved photography as a hobby and not for fame or gain. His foray into the bigger world of photography began just seven years ago, when Athula Ranaraja encouraged him to submit one of his photographs for a competition, which won him a Gold Medal in the Amateur category. This spurred him to perfect his technique and augment his knowledge. He followed a Certificate Course in Photography conducted by the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka under Academic Director, Panduka De Silva. This drove him to persistently perfect his skills, not only as a photographer but as a pure artist who creates spellbinding images, with a style that is unique to him.
By 2018, he had not only been crowned with the photographic world’s most prestigious accolades but won the overall award in the Open category for the second consecutive year at the State Festival of Photography which accumulates to 23 national level and 59 international awards, 485 acceptances through 275 images in 105 competitions across 40 countries. Recently, he was appointed as the Assistant Membership Director - Sri Lanka for the Photographic Society of America.
Ranasinghe was inspired by award winning international photographers Steve McCurry, Terry Donnelly and RaulVillalba for their style and technique and by Sri Lankan photographers Henry Rajakaruna, Chandrasena Perera and MahindaJeevananda for the support they rendered.
