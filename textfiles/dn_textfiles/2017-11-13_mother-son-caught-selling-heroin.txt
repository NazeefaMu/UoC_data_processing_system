Mother, son caught selling heroin

A 47-year-old mother and her 27-year-old son were arrested by the Police in Kandy yesterday for selling heroin. The Police who raided a house in Haloya, Peradeniya arrested the mother and son after they found heroin stashed in several places in their house. Police said the mother and son were charged for selling and possession of the banned drugs previously as well.
The husband of the woman is serving a prison sentence for possession of heroin, police said.
Several other close relatives too have been caught with the banned drug on several occasions,” a Police officer said. The raid had been done by the recently established Anti-Vice Squad. During the last 30 days, the unit has arrested around 20 big time heroin dealers in the Kandy area.
