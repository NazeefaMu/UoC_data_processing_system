Colomboscope returns in September

Cinnamon Colomboscope is set to return this September with a promising mix of local and international artistes and an exciting line-up of interactive events.
The event, which is the only multidisciplinary arts festival of its kind in Sri Lanka, annually attracts a vast audience of media, travellers, art lovers, collectors, artistes and the general public to celebrate and witness some of the best contemporary arts seen in Colombo.
Themed Re/Evolution, the festival will bring the ongoing environmental crisis under the spotlight, in the hope of using the arts to inspire new ways of thinking and living in response to the situation. Cinnamon Colomboscope will be held at the former Colombo Terminus Railway Station in Maradana, rendering an unconventional viewpoint into metropolitan Colombo and its history along with the arts.
The key attraction of the festival is the arts exhibition which will feature an impressive mix of artistes from local and international backgrounds, whose work combine art with technology and new media. While the festival will present over fifty artistes including the well known and the emerging talent in visual, performance art, video installations, films, interactive art, photography and sound installations. Meanwhile, the international artistes hosted at Cinnamon Colomboscope include Ackroyd and Harvey from the UK, Eva Horn and Eva-Fiore Kovacovsky from Germany, Benoit Billotte and Karine Bonnewal from France and Elmas Deniz from Turkey along with many more from Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, India and Bangladesh.
With education and awareness being the central goal of the event, the programme also includes talks on waste management, conscious consumerism, deforestation and development, organic food produce and green technology. The popular talks by international and local artists on their work and process will also be part of the talk series. Taking into consideration the importance of engaging the younger generation, education and outreach programmes for children facilitated by Mind Adventures Theatre Co and Iridescence, plus a workshop programme for kids powered by the British Council Colombo, are also scheduled as components of the festival experience. This exciting and thought-provoking programme is curated by Menika van der Pooten.
The upcoming edition of the festival will be presented by Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts for the third consecutive year, in collaboration with EUNIC Sri Lanka (Goethe-Institut, British Council and Alliance Franc¸aise de Kotte) who are the original founders of the festival, and the John Keells Foundation along with state patronage extended through Sri Lanka Tourism.
