Mihin Lanka obtained Rs 1.9 bn ‘loan’ from BOC without collateral - Witness

When Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was Mihin Lanka Chairman, the then government had obtained a loan of Rs.1.9 billion from the Bank of Ceylon to repay a loan obtained from BOC and Lankaputhra Bank which was settled on March 31,2009.
Pradeep Wasantha Wimalasuriya, a senior BOC official submitted copies of the relevant documents to the the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate financial irregularities which had taken place at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka Airlines, yesterday to back his claim.
Wimalasuriya was cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana.
It was revealed during the hearing that it was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, then CEO Sajin Vaas Gunewardene and Roshan Mahesh Gunatilake who had authorised to obtain loans from BOC and Lankaputhra Banks.
Wimalasuriya also revealed that the loan was obtained not as an overdraft and also without any security for the debt.
When Rajapaksa was the Chairman, the director board comprised Sajin Vaas Gunewardene, Lalith Weeratunge, Surendra Ediriweera, Chandana Liyanarachchi and Samantha Samaratunge, the official said.
