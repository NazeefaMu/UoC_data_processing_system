OPPO launches all new Dashing  Blue Limited Edition

OPPO, The Selfie expert and leader, unveiled a Dashing Blue Limited Edition of OPPO F5. This striking new colour edition continues the success of the F5 series, OPPO’s first full-screen model featuring groundbreaking A.I. Beauty Recognition Technology designed to personalize beautification. OPPO F5 Dashing Blue Limited Edition will be available from February 16 through offline stores.
OPPO Sri Lanka Bob Li CEO commenting on this launch said, “I believe that the dashing blue limited edition will find favour with our young users. We constantly try to cater to their needs and the combination of innovative technology, attractive price range and the aesthetically pleasing device itself will satisfy their love of technologically advanced features and the sense of fashion,” commented Bob Li, CEO – OPPO Lanka.
As a brand for more young people around the world, OPPO F5 Dashing Blue Limited Edition symbolizes OPPO’s passion for fashion, beauty, and romance. Perfectly capturing the light with an eye-catching effect on the rear of the body, this special edition is finished with a glossy blue effect, above which streaks of lights appear gleaming and flashing when held to the light.
OPPO F5 Dashing Blue Limited Edition features a 20MP front camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a 16MP rear camera with F1.8 aperture.
OPPO F5 Dashing Limited Edition features a 6.0-inch full-screen FHD+ display, giving the user a vivid visual enjoyment without the need to increase the size of the phone. It offers a high-resolution screen with 18:9 aspect ratio while the sleek unibody offers a visually slim appearance without any cut-offs.
The flagship Octa-core CPU processor uses less energy, produces less heat while giving a higher performance speed (40% increased performance compared to the previous Color OS versions). With such powerful processing power, the transition between apps is smooth and gives an unprecedented mobile gaming experience.
The OPPO F5 Dashing Limited Edition battery life is longer thanks to the 3200Ah battery and the Continuous Optimizing Technology which manages the apps running on the device, allowing the user up to 12 hours of continuous use (simulated test). The Do Not Disturb function for gaming will display an incoming call in the form of a banner.
