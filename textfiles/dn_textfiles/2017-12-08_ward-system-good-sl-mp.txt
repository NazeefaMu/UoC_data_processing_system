Ward system good for SL - MP

Kalutara District UPLF Parliamentarian Vidura Wickramanayaka said, it is so good to have the Local Govt Election under Ward System ending political rivalry.
The voters must decide to elect honest local politicians who would not commit corruption and thuggery in the respective areas. Otherwise the voters have to suffer after the Local Govt Election. The elected Councillor have to take the responsibility of developing the area, if not the voters can remove him at the next Local Govt Election, said MP Wickramanayaka.
He said that an honest politician could do a lot of work to the society. He appealed to the voters to elect honest politicians to the wards of the Local Councils who could cooperate to uplift the economy in the areas.
