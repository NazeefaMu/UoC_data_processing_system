It’s a very slow wicket and it hasn’t changed much – Dilruwan

GALLE: Sri Lanka off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who top scored for his team with an immaculate 92 not out thinks the Galle Stadium pitch does not hold any terrors for the batsmen.
Speaking to the media at the end of the third day of the first Test Perera said, “I think the pitch is still behaving the same. There isn't too much turn, one or two balls turn but not always. This is not the typical Galle pitch. “Even tomorrow, I don't think we can look forward to that much of a turn. However, this wicket is very slow. When the ball was new yesterday, it was turning a bit. When the ball gets older, it's easy to score runs.”
Based on Perera’s assessment of the pitch Sri Lanka should not find it difficult to bat out the Test in the next two days unless there is a dramatic change to its condition.
India are already 498 in front with seven second innings wickets in hand and will declare sometime today setting Sri Lanka a stiff target. “We'll have to look at what the target we're going to get and then take a decision. We shouldn't think of the target but bat the way we can bat. However, we'll have to have a plan on that.”
Perera expressed his disappointment of not being able to reach his maiden Test hundred.
“It was not just a century but it’s a Test century so I am very disappointed to be honest. I was trying to get closer as much as possible to score it but I didn't have the opportunity.” Indian opener Abhinav Mukund who scored a fluent 81 painted a different picture of the pitch.
“There was turn towards the end of the day. There are a couple of balls that are skidding on and going. I think there will be a lot more assistance for Ashwin and Jadeja in the second innings than there was yesterday or today. The wicket is going to assist spin more often than not. Probably by lunch or tea tomorrow, I think there will be a lot more turn.”
