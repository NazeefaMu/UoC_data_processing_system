Cabinet nods to lift Glyphosate ban on tea and rubber

 
The Cabinet paper suggesting to lift the ban imposed on utilizing Glyphosate for tea and rubber was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said a short while ago.
The decision to lift the ban was made after Sri Lanka Tea Board complained that Japan had rejected a stock of Sri Lanka tea which contained chemical substance which is used as a substitute to Glyphosate.
Furthermore Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake affirmed that the decision was taken after considering scientific research which proved that this substance is not harmful to human health.
