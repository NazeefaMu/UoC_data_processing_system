Playing ‘pandu’ with Kusal Mendis’ career

Kusal Mendis is by far the next Aravinda de Silva or Mahela Jayawardene if his rare talent needs any comparison. But the manner in which this gem of a cricketer has been treated so far by the national cricket selectors defies logic.
With the 2019 Cricket World Cup barely seven months away we find this outstandingly talented player left out of the 15-member squad Sri Lanka has named for the five-match ODI series against England starting at Dambulla today. This is not the first time that Mendis has faced this fate with the present selection committee. He was axed for a tough Test tour of India in 2017.
Sri Lanka has only 13 ODIs (5 v England at home, 3 v New Zealand away and 5 v South Africa away) to prepare themselves for the big event and five of those matches are against England. So the big question is whether Mendis fits into the scheme of things. Is he good enough to play in the World Cup? Or according to the national selectors that includes the national coach are there players better than Mendis that he can be discarded in this manner?
The reasons given by the head coach for his exclusion from the England series is that Mendis had a poor Asia Cup where he collected two ducks in two matches and that his form has dropped and that he has been left out of the side to rectify whatever mistakes he has and to regain his form and confidence.
It is no fault of Mendis that he was dismissed without scoring in the two Asia Cup matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan because he was sent to bat in a position that he was not accustomed to - as an opener. He has never opened in ODI cricket until he was pushed into that position in the Asia Cup.
Poor Mendis’ talent was wasted by sending him to open the innings with Upul Tharanga whereas the best batting position for him is in the middle at number three or four. This is not what we have observed but it is also the view of legendary cricketers like Aravinda de Silva, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who have voiced their opinion on various occasions. These past batting greats who have brought glory and honour to the country with their unique brand of cricket know what they are talking about.
No praise can be too high for Mendis than the one from former head coach Graham Ford who has a keen eye for spotting talent.
“It’s not hard to back him at all. He’s such a wonderful talent, and he’s going to win a lot of games for Sri Lanka along the way,” Ford said of Mendis. “The worst thing we could do is to put too much expectation on his shoulders. We don’t want to put him under any pressure. He is learning and no doubt with his talent he will pay us back down the line. We never thought of dropping him - he’s just got too much talent. I am sure down the line, he is going to show everybody just how great he is.”
Ford said better shot selection - particularly early in the innings - marked Mendis’ path to improvement. His technique and attitude, Ford said, did not need much tinkering. “He is one player always supporting the guys that are doing well - he’s very happy for the other guys. He had a smile on his face the whole time when he didn’t quite fire as we know he can.
“He kept working as hard as ever. He loves his cricket he loves his practices. We have seen with a guy like that - with the amount of talent he’s got - it’s not hugely about technique. It’s just about making sure his decision-making and his shot selection is good. He probably is the first to admit that he was a bit extravagant early on and got himself out. He’s come home and done a lot of work on his own. Hats off to the fella he deserves the big score.”
We hope these views are taken seriously in the best interest of Sri Lanka cricket by the national selectors and the team management and saner counsel prevails and, Mendis be given his due place in the team and batting position despite his constant failures.
One has only to look at Mendis’ ODI career record and see which position he has been successful for his country. The readers can judge for themselves where the team management has erred in sacrificing Mendis by sending him as opener.
Batting at 3 Mendis has scored one century and 9 fifties and averages nearly 30 with a strike rate of 82; and at 4 Mendis has scored 2 fifties and averages 47.20 and has a strike rate of 100.
Did the selectors and the team management get Kusal Mendis mixed up with Kusal Perera. For Kusal Perera who is best suited to open the innings was sent to bat at number three and four in the Asia Cup where his contributions were 11 and 17.
Perera, a flamboyant player is best suited to open the innings and should be given the licence to attack the bowling as the legendary Sanath Jayasuriya once did with great success. His ODI career figures show that he has made the majority of his runs as opener – 1412 at an average of 30 and a strike rate of 93.8 and scored all three hundreds (inclusive of 7 fifties) batting in that position. Batting at 3 he averages 15 and at 4 averages 61.
Whereas the majority of the countries taking part in the World Cup have a settled batting order, Sri Lanka are still tinkering with theirs unsure of which positions their batsmen should play. This is the worst way to prepare for a mega event as the World Cup and a sure way to disaster which could be detrimental to the country’s cricket that at present is trying to grapple with an inexperienced administration, embezzlement of its cricket funds and allegations of corruption in Sri Lanka Cricket that involves past and present players and officials.
The decision to drop Sri Lanka’s best young batsman in years against the backbone of a brittle batting line-up that often struggles to post winning totals is an imprudent one. It’s not surprising when selections continue to be made on hunches.
