Mahinda’s challenge to Court of Appeal Interim Order

Filing a motion before Supreme Court, Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe sought a fuller Bench comprising more than five judges of Supreme Court to hear a Special Leave to Appeal application filed by Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa challenging the Court of Appeal Interim Order that restrained him from functioning as the Prime Minister.
Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghe, an original petitioner in the Quo Warranto petition filed in the Court of Appeal made a request from the Chief Justice to make a direction that these proceedings be taken up before five or more judges of the Supreme Court in terms of Article 132(3) of the Constitution.
He was of the view that the Special Leave to Appeal application before court is a matter of public and general importance in view of the Constitution read with the Parliament powers and Privileges Act.
Meanwhile, another motion filed on behalf of 122 Parliamentarians stated that they are reliably informed that Justice Eva Wanasundara had in an interview published in the Deshaya newspaper of July 6, 2014 had said that she was a very close friend of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who called her to meet him and offered her appointment to the Supreme Court Bench.
The respondents stated they entertain serious concerns pertaining to this matter being taken up by a Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara who is listed to sit on the only Bench on Friday (14). They moved that Chief Justice be pleased to make appropriate direction in respect of hearing of this appeal on December 14.
Through this appeal petition, Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa sought an order to set aside the Interim Order dated December 3 by the Court of Appeal.
