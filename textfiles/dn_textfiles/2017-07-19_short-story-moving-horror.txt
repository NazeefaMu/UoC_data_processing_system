SHORT STORY: moving Horror!

It was a rainy day in the usual sunny and humid city of Colombo. The rain usually brings in more chaos at after office time making the tired and the stressful to almost lose their minds. Admits the vast traffic in Rajagiriya, in a new Honda Vessel jeep, Kanishka was waiting anxiously to get home. It was Thursday, the penultimate day of the week where people are tired but also has hopes for a fast Friday and to a relaxing weekend.
Kanishka worked in the banking sector and was in the middle management. He recently got married to Navenka and it was an arranged marriage. Navenka was a newly passed out doctor and was attached to the Colombo general hospital. She too drove to work and was faced with the same situation with traffic and rain. They lived in Malabe down Welivita road passing a controversial private education institute.
The area has a unique pleasantness as it is a little further away from the busy activity of Malabe town. The newly married had just moved in to this area and it has been just a week. They were able to find a good looking house with three bed rooms and two bathrooms and had a small lawn as well. This was ideal as Navenka always had an idea of getting a pet dog.
Kanishka came home at about seven in the evening after battling it out on Colombo’s streets with ill-disciplined tuk tuks and bus drivers and exhaustion was very much evident on his face. To his surprise, Navenka had already come home. He found out that Navenka had left a little early today and had come home by five and also had prepared dinner. This made Kanishka feel a little joyful and he went off to have a well-earned wash after giving a kiss on the forehead of his wife. After dinner they wanted to watch a little TV but due to rain and lighting they couldn’t do that as well. Suddenly the lights went off startling the couple for a bit and then Kanishka cautiously walked from the dining table to find a torch. Just when he found it the lights came back on. Nevertheless he kept it close to him as there might be another power outage. The couple decided to turn in early today and they went to brush their teeth.
The master bed room was on the second floor and has an attached bathroom. Both of them, especially Navenka was a neat freak and kept the house in an immaculate condition.
They were brushing their teeth when the lights went off for the second time. But this time Kanishka had the torch with him and turned it on.
The light was unintentionally focused by him on the toilet mirror which reflected from it and beamed behind Navenka who at that time was about to reach for the sink. Suddenly she saw something dark moving in a blink of an eye from behind them. Navenka screamed and panicked which startled Kanishka as well. “What’s the matter?” questioned Kanishka in a loud concerned voice. “I... I… saw something moving behind us” replied Navenka in a shaky voice. Kanishka focused the torch to the back of them and didn’t see anything. At this point the lights came back on. “There’s nothing here dear” replied Kanishka while thoroughly examining the bathroom. “It’s probably my imagination” replied the wife while washing her face off. Kanishka took a peek outside the toilet and made his way towards their bedroom and grabbed a cricket bat. “What’s that for?” asked Navenka. “Just to be safe I’ll take a look and come. I locked all the doors as usual and we have iron grills on the windows and cctv cameras” responded Kanishka while gripping the bat with both his hands. “Don’t leave me here. I’m coming with you” said Navenka and both of them took a brief look at the house just to double check. To their relief there was absolutely nothing and they decided that it was a long day for the both of them and rest will make things right and went off to bed.
Next day the couple was getting ready to go to work and Navenka was packing two lunches for the both of them. Kanishka was putting on his tie when he witnessed through the reflection on the dressing table mirror a blackish green smudge on the wall behind. He stared into the mirror to comprehend what it was and then realized that it was on the wall behind him. He quickly turned back but to his amazement there was nothing there but only the white wall. With a confused look he turned back to the mirror which didn’t show nothing of the previous. “Kani” – Navenka’s pet name for Kanishka “are you ready?We are getting late” yelled the wife while getting in to the car. Today Kanishka will be dropping his wife at work.
The weather had subsided and left very thing wet and muddy. Kanishaka after combing his hair came out side to the car poach and realized that he had left his wallet and ran back inside to his house to fetch it. Navenka who had already gotten in to the car figured that her husband had probably forgotten something and took her eyeliner out to do some last minute touch ups in the car. She turned the rear view mirror towards her and started on the eyeliner and just as she was done she saw a faint outlining of a man standing behind the car. She abruptly looked back and it was Jayasinghe, the old beggar who wonders on their road constantly babbling. He was just standing their staring at the house.
