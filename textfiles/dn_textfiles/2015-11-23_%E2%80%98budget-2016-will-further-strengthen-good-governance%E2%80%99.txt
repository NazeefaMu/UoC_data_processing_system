‘Budget 2016 will further strengthen good governance’

The 2016 budget has intricately inked economic development with the concern of further strengthening of good governance and democracy, Provincial Councils and Local Government Deputy Minister Karunaratna Paranawithana said in Parliament on Saturday.
Radical and world-changing innovations in several fields should be made for long term development and reviving economy which was collapsed due to the mismanagement, corruption, massive volume of debts and corrupt tender procedure during the former regime, he said.
“We have presented several controversial proposals through this budget. But all of them are not to enhance government privileges but for the betterment of the country”.
The Deputy Minister was participating in the debate on the second reading of the Appropriation Bill (Budget) 2016. He said a new mechanism for systematise the public fund administration will be introduced to provide maximum benefits to the public.
“The government has no intention to privatize the any state property and it is not our policy,” he said.
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Noroshan Perera participating in the debate on the Second reading of the appropriation bill (Budget) 2016 said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently presented a set of policy guidelines for the government’s fiscal management and 2016 budget is based mostly on realising these objectives. The health sector has received a huge allocation with the aim of creating a healthy nation.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardene said instead of creating one million jobs the country is experiencing a situation where more jobs are being lost. The reduction of gas prices by Rs.150 is only a temporary relief and the people soon see it’s bad impact a little later.
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said even though the government promised many reliefs to the people through this budget no such thing has happened.
The nation building tax was introduced during the time of war and it is no longer need now.
“Why is the government not abolishing it?. This budget has imposed heavy penalties on vehicles. Rs.10,000 fine will be imposed in the case of accidents. If a dog collides with a vehicle there is a question whether the fine will be levied from the driver or the dog.
