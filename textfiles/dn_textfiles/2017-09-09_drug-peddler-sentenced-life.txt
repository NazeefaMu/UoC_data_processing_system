Drug peddler sentenced to life

A man who was found guilty for possessing and peddling 2.48 grams of heroin in 2009 was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judgment against the accused, High Court judge Piyasena Ranasinghe observed that the prosecutors have proved the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The accused Godakandage Nihal Perera of Modera had been arrested by the Police Narcotics Bureau in 2009.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted the accused under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.
