Upgrade for Kandyan Dancing as a profession

Scince, Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama announced that his ministry has initiated a programme to upgrade the professional standing of the exponents of the traditional Kandyan Dance.
The minister made this announcement while presiding over a function to affiliate the Nipunatha Arts Training Centre at Thiththapajjala to the Vocational Training Authority functioning under his ministry.
The minister said that all expenses of maintaining Kandyan Dance training centres that qualify for registration with the Vocational Training Authority will be met by his ministry. He said that his intention is also to give a measure of support through this initiative to the traditional schools of dancing in the Kandyan areas that have so far preserved this dance form amid many difficulties.
The minister recalled his close association with the famous exponent of Kandyan Dance, the Late Thiththapajjala Suramba Gurnnanse. The Minister paid him high tribute as a world-class artiste. He reminisced that the famous Niththawela Gunaya Gurunnanse came to Trinity College in his school days to teach dancing to the students.
He said that such famous dancers of yesteryear used to perform at prestigious theatres the world over to the acclaim of art lovers and thereby brought honour to the country. Minister Dr. Amunugama said that that the professionalisation of the art of Kandyan dancing will not only bring a steady income to talented young men and women practising it, but will also give a boost to the tourist industry because just as much as the beaches, the wildlife and the archeological ruins, Sri Lanka’s Kandyan Dance is also world famous and therefore would be a big tourist attraction.
Dr. Amunugama said that scholars of other countries have researched on the Kandyan dance and have written books on the subject and that places like the University of Virginia have on display much material relating to the Kandyan Dance. It is embarrassing that we do not have such a place in Sri Lanka, said the Minister. He declared that his intention is to make Thiththapajjala such a centre which could attract from the world over, scholars and art lovers interested in the Kandyan Dance.
