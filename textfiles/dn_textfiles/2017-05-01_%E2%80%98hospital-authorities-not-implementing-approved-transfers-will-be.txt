‘Hospital authorities not implementing  approved transfers will be investigated’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara to conduct investigations on all hospital authorities who do not implement approved transfers of nurses, Health ministry spokesman said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne gave the order during the Provincial Health Ministers’ Summit held in Colombo recently when the Provincial Health Ministers informed him that approved transfers of nurses are not being implemented by the hospital directors and authorities.
The hospital directors should submit a full report to the Health Ministry on the way they implemented transfers. All approved transfers should be implemented on or before May 1. Minister Senaratne instructed authorities to obtain the proposals and ideas of trade unions in this regard, he said.
Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara, Provincial Health Ministers and many others were present.
