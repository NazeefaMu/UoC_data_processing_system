WATER IN THE GREEN ECONOMY: LEGAL RIGHTS FOR WATERWAYS

Our current environmental laws have been largely unable to prevent over-drawn waterways, continued contamination of remaining waters, and disappearing species and habitats. Our legal and economic systems treat the natural world as property that can be exploited and degraded, rather than as an integral ecological partner with its own rights to exist and thrive. Environmental concerns are subsumed to economic growth, leading to dangerously unbalanced relationships among humans and the rest of life on Earth.
Solutions
Re-envision economic systems so that they serve “sustainable communities” a term which includes both human communities and the wider communities of the natural world; establish legal rights for ecosystems – including waterways – to exist, thrive and evolve. Elements of sustainable environmental communities similarly include healthy nutrients, clean water, biodiversity, restoration in the face of destruction, and thriving, connected habitats. The economy must be viewed as serving human and environmental communities, not the reverse.
Existing laws assume that waterways are to be manipulated for human economic benefit. Recognizing in law the rights of the waterways to exist, thrive and evolve will better guide our behaviour to protect waterway integrity, to the benefit of sustainable human and waterway communities.
“Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth,” adopted at April 2010 World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth; presented to UN April 2011 says, “Mother Earth and all beings” have, among other rights: the right to exist, the right to water as a source of life, the right to integral health, and the right to full and prompt restoration for violations of these and other enumerated rights.
Legal response: New Zealand and India in March 2017
A New Zealand river was granted the same legal rights as a human being. The local Maori tribe of Whanganui in the North Island has fought for the recognition of their river – the third-largest in New Zealand – as an ancestor for 140 years.
“The reason we have taken this approach is because we consider the river an ancestor and always have,” said Gerrard Albert, the lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi [tribe]. “We have fought to find an approximation in law so that all others can understand that from our perspective treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as in indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.”
The new status of the river means if someone abused or harmed it the law now sees no differentiation between harming the tribe or harming the river because they are one and the same.
Chris Finlayson, the Minister for the treaty of Waitangi negotiations, said the decision brought the longest-running litigation in New Zealand’s history to an end. “Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person,” said Finlayson in a statement.
Two guardians will be appointed to act on behalf of the Whanganui River, one from the crown and one from the Whanganui iwi.
Uttarakhand High Court accords status of 'living entities' to Ganga, Yamuna
The Uttarakhand High Court last week accorded the status of "living human entities" to the Ganga and Yamuna, two of India's most sacred rivers.Exercising extraordinary jurisdiction vested in the court, a division bench of Justices Rajeev Sharma and Alok Singh of the High Court said, "Holy Rivers Ganga and Yamuna have been declared to be treated as living human entities."
Giving the "legal status" of living humans to the holy rivers, the court ordered that the Director, Namami Gange project for cleaning and rejuvenating the river, the Chief Secretary and the Advocate General of Uttarakhand will act as the "legal parents" of the holy rivers and work as a the human face to protect, conserve and preserve them and their tributaries. These officers will be bound to "uphold the status" of the two rivers and also promote their "health and wellbeing", the court said.The matter related to mining and stone crushing along the banks of the Ganga.
On a PIL filed by Haridwar resident Mohammad Salim, the court ordered the Dehradun District Magistrate to remove encroachment from the Shakti canal of the Ganga at Dhakrani within 72 hours. It ordered that the DM be suspended if he failed to comply with the directive. The court also ordered the authorities to work out the division of various properties between the neighbouring states under Uttar Pradesh Re-Oganisation Act, 2000, a matter pending since the inception of Uttarakhand in the year 2000. The court also directed the government to form a Ganga Management Board within the next eight weeks in accordance with an earlier order of the court in December 2016.
Earlier this month, the Uttarakhand high court came down heavily down upon the Union and the state governments for doing “nothing concrete” to clean the Ganga.
The world’s third largest river, the Ganga is the holiest Hindu river and also among the dirtiest in the world, with toxic industrial waste and untreated sewage reducing it to a dirty trickle at several places. The 2,500 km river originates from Gangotri in Uttarakhand and criss-crosses several states before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.The Yamuna is its largest tributary and originates from Yamunotri in Uttarakhand.
Earlier this month, the Centre cleared projects worth Rs 1,900 crore for Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Delhi under the Clean Ganga campaign. Of the 20 projects, 13 are in Uttarakhand and will involve setting sewage treatment plants and upgrading the existing ones.
