The battle within

‘The Battle is Within us’ says Head Girl of Buddhist Ladies’ College, Pradeeni Don Manuel whose attribute of endurance is her strength. Perfect Prefects features Don Manuel who looks forward to tomorrow’s opportunities.
“The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated” __________ Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhi’s belief has great relevance to the times we live in. One needs to only log onto FB and see stories about the vicious way animals are treated. For Don Manuel tomorrow is an opportunity to do something for them. For those like Don Manuel practices like trophy hunting and cruelty to animals is particularly detestable.
Better version
“The battle is within us. We should learn to fight and be someone better tomorrow than we are today, not someone better than someone else. We should be a better version of ourselves. That is what really keeps us going. I am interested in wildlife conservation and environmental conservation. In today’s society, there is a lack of love for nature within most people. They simply do not respect life. I think we need to take up the cause of endangered species and protect them. We need to understand that animals have the right to live as well. People can be heartless,” explained Don Manuel.
Endurance is her strong point. This is because tomorrow will always have the potential for positive results and a better life. If you can endure till tomorrow, you will always have a chance for happiness. Tomorrow should be looked forward to.
“When you live in the society you face a lot of pressure and tension. So if you can bear all that, that is ideal because bearing it is important. You have to learn to get along with different people because no one is the same and you need to cope with life’s situations,” said Don Manuel.
Catalyst
She outlined the need to be noble, humble and genuine, saying that you don’t need to be like the rest of the herd. She pointed out that anyone can be a catalyst in society.
“When facing problems in life we need to be properly organized. The skill of organizing is very important in anyone’s life. When facing problems it is important that we don’t fall down. We should not be stressed out and encumbered and impeded by pressure. We should learn how to strike a certain balance in our lives. I play the piano, sing and cook because that helps me cope with the pressure. I go on the net and find new stuff to cook! I also get the advice of my teachers and parents and that helps me out a lot,” stated Don Manuel.
Meeting students from all walks of life has given students of Buddhist Ladies College a positive attitude and a willingness to live in harmony with one another.
“I have been at Buddhist Ladies College since Grade 1. It has done a lot in making me who I am today. I am what I am today because of the love given to me by my parents. They gave me the gift of education. I cannot forget my Alma Mater and my teachers. Meeting students from all walks of life, we all learn to respect each other,” added Don Manuel.
Moral values
Family life is important to Don Manuel. Families with good values coming together are what forms a nation that is progressive, forward thinking with solid moral values.
“One leader in history I admire is Barack Obama. I admire how he balanced his political life with his family life. He was a loving and devoted father and I feel one can learn something from the unity in his family,” said Don Manuel.
Her concern for children is evident from her choice of vocation.
“I am interested in child psychology and education. I am also interested in interior designing. I hope to balance those two and carry on. I want to convince people to be more eco- friendly. Even at school, we are implementing nature-friendly projects. For example, Polythene is controlled with children bringing less polythene to school. We have separate dustbins for organic materials, polythene, cardboard and paper. We have also initiated planting projects in school and we have started a little garden. Starting small is important. You should start small and then accomplish something noteworthy,” pointed out Don Manuel.
A die-hard Harry Potter fan, she is fascinated by the story of Harry Potter which appeals to both adults and children alike. Rowling’s masterpiece has enthralled readers around the world. Though a work of fiction it offers very good advice.
Wonderful reading
“I love the Harry Potter series. I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time since I was a kid of 10 years. I still read the books and I never get tired of it, because I really love it. I love how J.K. Rowling weaves the plot. She has linked the stories together in a wonderful way. Her imagination is magical,” stated Don Manuel.
She perceives life as an opportunity not to beat others but an opportunity to be the best that she can.
“I have been hit down hard many times, but through that, I have realized the real competition is within us. When it comes to life I don’t believe in running a race with those around me. My greatest inspiration in life is my parents because they have done a lot for me. Their strength is what I have,” said Don Manuel.
