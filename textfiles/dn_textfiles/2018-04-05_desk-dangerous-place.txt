A desk is  a dangerous place

His subject is spying. His obsessions are secrecy and betrayal. He is an Englishman of a certain background, compared often to Graham Greene, Joseph Conrad, and Somerset Maugham. You know him. You know him not. On his birth certificate he is called David John Moore Cornwell. But to the rest of the world, he is John le Carré.
An expert on secrets, a former spy himself, and the author of over two dozen books, virtually all of them best sellers, John le Carré currently lives in a corner of England so remote it’s known as Land’s End. Nestled on a cliff in Cornwall, is his safehouse. He says he loves being in Cornwall because the Cornish don’t care about celebrities. “If they even know what I do they haven’t read it. Or if they have read it, they make a point of not being impressed by it. And that is enormously soothing. Not a head turns in the street when I walk by,” says Carré in a recent interview. It’s here, in the home he fashioned out of three derelict cottages more than 40 years ago, that he weaves together the threads of memory, experience and research into his tales of intrigue. The solitude, no doubt is his stimulation.
Born in Poole, England, on October 19, 1931, le Carre had a gloomy childhood, thanks to the disruptive motions of his father, an erratic businessman who kept the family moving from place to place. “I grew up in a completely bookless household. It was my father’s boast that he had never read a book from end to end,” le Carré said some years ago in an interview with the Paris Review. “I was entirely dependent on my schoolteachers for my early reading with the exception of The Wind in the Willows, which a stepmother read to me when I was in hospital...the big explosion in my reading occurred in my late teens when I was seduced by the German muse. I devoured the whole of German literature alive, as it seems to me now. I have probably read more German literature than I have English. Today my pleasure is with nineteenth-century storytellers: Balzac, Dickens, and the rest.”
After attending a series of private English schools, le Carré was called upon for national service and spent several years in Vienna with the Army Intelligence Corps. When the term expired, he returned to England and enrolled at Lincoln College, Oxford. Graduation was followed by a procession of odd jobs, including one year in which he taught at Eton.
In 1960, he resumed his intelligence career with the Foreign Service. During this time he began writing novels, the first entitled Call for the Dead. His second book, A Murder of Quality, appeared in 1962 while le Carré was stationed at the British Embassy in Bonn. Two years later he resigned from the Foreign Service to devote himself entirely to writing. He achieved international fame as the author of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. His later books include A Small Town in Germany,Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,Smiley’s People,The Little Drummer Girl,A Perfect Spy,The Russia House, and Our Game, almost all of which have been adapted for movies and television.
Even today, a sense of loyalty prevents him from talking of his days at the intelligence service. But he recalls how he went to his employers after he wrote his first novel, while working as a ‘foreign servant’. “They read it and said they had no objections, but even if it were about butterflies, they said, I would have to choose a pseudonym. So then I went to my publisher, Victor Gollancz, who was Polish by origin, and he said, My advice to you, old fellow, is choose a good Anglo-Saxon couple of syllables. Monosyllables. He suggested something like Chunk-Smith. So as is my courteous way, I promised to be Chunk-Smith. After that, memory eludes me and the lie takes over. I was asked so many times why I chose this ridiculous name, then the writer’s imagination came to my help. I saw myself riding over Battersea Bridge, on top of a bus, looking down at a tailor’s shop. Funnily enough, it was a tailor’s shop, because I had a terrible obsession about buying clothes in order to become a diplomat in Bonn. And it was called something of this sort—le Carré. That satisfied everybody for years. But lies don’t last with age. I find a frightful compulsion towards truth these days. And the truth is, I don’t know.”
John le Carré, however, is a name he does not answer to. It is an abstraction that exists in his writing studio, and on the cover of his books, like a spy’s name on a phony passport.
Of his life in the intelligent service he is willing to reveal that for his military service, he went to Austria. “One of my jobs was trolling through the displaced-persons camps, looking for people who were fake refugees, or for people whose circumstances were so attractive to us from an intelligence point of view that we might consider returning them, with their consent, to the countries they came from. For a person of, as I was then, barely twenty-one, it was an immense responsibility at an extraordinary moment in history. Afterwards, after teaching at Eton, I went into the cold-war setup properly. In all I don’t suppose that I spooked around for more than seven or eight years, and that’s forty years ago, but that was my little university for the purposes that I needed later to write. I think that if I’d gone to sea at that time I would have written about the sea. If I’d gone into advertising or stockbroking, that would have been my stuff. It was from there that I began abstracting and peopling my other world, my alternative, private world.”
When asked if there is any space between the real, David Cornwell and the false John le carre, he says, “Yes, I think a lot really. David tries to be a good dad and a regular guy with difficulty, many flaws. And John takes off into the ether. He’s the man of imagination. And I can take John for a walk, let him loose on the cliffs. And he has a good time and he populates the empty cliffs with the people of his imagination. And then I come back and help with the washing up.”
It was “The Spy Who Came in from the Cold” that made John le Carré, a famous and much in-demand author back in 1963. The book spent 34 weeks as No. 1 on the bestseller list and was made into an acclaimed motion picture starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom. It is said that both the novel and the film served as grey, gritty antidotes to the fantastical world of James Bond, and were accepted by critics and the public as an authentic portrayal of the scruffy business of espionage.
But for months after the first books were published only British intelligence knew who and where John le Carre was. And then, the Sunday Times blew the whistle. “The whole investigation of my person, as you might say, came up. Was I a spook? Was I not a spook?” says le Carre.
In his eyes, he is not a spook. Of course. There’s nothing special at all in what he writes. Everything is so simple. “I look around, I collect bits of people. I assemble them. I pitch a story.”
Explaining why he has not stopped writing now that he is eighty-six, he laughs, “Each book feels like my last book. And then I think, like a dedicated alcoholic, that one more won’t do me any harm.”
