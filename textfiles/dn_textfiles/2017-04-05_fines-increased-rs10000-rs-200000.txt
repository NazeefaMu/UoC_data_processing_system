Fines increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs. 200,000

The fine for long distance buses plying without valid permits has been increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs.200,000. Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday in Parliament presented the National Transport Commission (Amendment) Bill to give effect to this revision.
The minister said the new fine is only related to inter-provincial buses coming under the purview of the NTC.
He said a set of new criteria in issuing long distance route permits has also been developed.
He said as of now a total of 3,219 permits including 459 semi-luxury permits, 603 luxury permits and 94 super-luxury permits have been issued for long distance buses.
The minister further pointed out the integrated time table for private and SLTB buses has not yield successful results as both parties do not comply with the time table. He said private bus owners have not allowed even a single SLTB bus to ply on the 103 Narahenpita-Fort route.
He pointed out the Treasury provides Rs.1.3 billion monthly to the SLTB to cover its expenses.
