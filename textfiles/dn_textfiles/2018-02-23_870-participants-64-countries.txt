In the Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia Ironman 70.3 Colombo Triathlon we have some unity teams created with athletes from the North, South and East, there are multiple visually impaired athletes, a Vedda (an indigenous person from Sri Lanka) by the name of Punchi Banda; all these people are true spirits that show us anything is possible.
