Out of the web and into the fire!

Adapted from James Dashner’s second book of the young adult triology, ‘The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials’ follows the success of its predecessor in a much more surefooted manner than expected.
The action picks up right where it left off in ‘The Maze Runner’. Thomas, Theresa and the other Gladers are on the run from the World Catastrophe Killzone Department aka W.C.K.D. Having escaped from their lab the teenagers find themselves in the Scorch. The outlook is beautiful but in reality this is a world ravaged by diseases and one that any being has only little hope of escaping.
Leaving the maze far behind him director Wes Ball has taken a unique approach to the sequel. Imagination is at its height in almost every scene. One beautifully captured shot shows the group making their way over a sand dune in silhouette when a distant gunshot halts and freezes them in their places. Another shot involves a zombie attack in a mall. The director has shot the scenes in such a manner that it is almost like watching a video game at play. The action is truly gripping but it is a pity that the script is not up to the standard of the action scenes. The narrative is too hollow for ‘The Scorch Trials’ to truly shine through.
Minor differences
On the down side ‘The Scorch Trials’ needs a better sense of developed mystery. Character relationships too need to be developed as well. Some of the characters in the tale too need to be developed for their personality to shine through.
The movie also seems to be a bit too identical to ‘The Hunger Games’ series. The only minor differences here are that the characters realize only later that they are in yet another game zone.
Thomas has replaced the fiery Katniss Everdeen while W.C.K.D. is present instead of the Capitol. You even get a rather cold looking female heading the action in almost the same manner that President Snow witnessed the downfall of the competitors in ‘The Hunger Games’.
Bogus gravitas
ylan O’ Brien makes a significant impact as Thomas. Though he is no match for Jennifer Lawrence O’ Brien does well to capture the audience’s attention. Thomas keeps his priorities straight by staying true to his band of younger brothers, and O'Brien grows into the role of leader without succumbing to bogus gravitas.
He's buoyant and urgent enough to hold his own in a cast full of scene-stealers, especially Thomas Brodie-Sangster's hyper-alert Newt, and Salazar's sly, sexy Brenda, who might be a better match for Thomas than his sometime soul mate, the distant and troubled Teresa.
Individual skills
The drawback here is when Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden) are reduced to expository sounding boards for Thomas and other dialogue-heavy characters rather than capable heroes who possess individual skills necessary to the group’s survival. They mostly hand around waiting for Thomas to call the next shot. Bigger and more ambitious ‘The Scorch Trials’ is an exciting ride that you would not want to miss. It covers more ground that the franchise’s first installment. It also sets the stage for the third chapter of the series.
