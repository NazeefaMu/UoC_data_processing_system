Roshanga Wickremesinghe launches book on growth and competitiveness

Management Consultant Roshanga Wickremesinghe, with fourteen years in delivering high impact consulting, training, facilitation and coaching solutions in 17 countries, launched his book on ‘How small countries can compete and grow - a case for Sri Lanka’ on February 16.
“The idea of writing this book came to me as a way of documenting the observations and many discussions which I have been a part of as a facilitator, trainer, coach and management consultant, working across many sectors since 2002,” Wickremesinghe said.
His strategising includes working with major international organisations such as The International Development Research Centre, Union Network International, South Asian Federation of Accountants, South East Asian Press Alliance and Health Action International to name a few as well as major corporates in Sri Lanka.
The launch was attended by Directors, CEO's and senior managers of leading corporates as well as researchers from academia.
The easy to read and well articulated book enables even a lay person to understand the critical issues faced by Sri Lanka and the importance of enhancing its capabilities in order to survive in a highly competitive global environment.
Wickremesinghe uses his analytical skills combined with practical solutions to complex situations, he advocates a research backed scientific development approach to solving impending issues and urges policy makers to initiate early action that would help Sri Lanka to compete and grow. In her foreword, Dr Ranee Jayamaha says “I am, confident that this book would serve as an important reference for policy makers, regulators, local and foreign investors, the academia, students and the general public”.
Wickremesinghe set up R & R Associates Consulting in 2002 as an International Management Consultancy and Training practice in Sri Lanka. Categorised as a sector independent strategic planning specialist, R & R Associates Consulting, have delivered services to governments, bilateral organizations, private sector companies, non governmental organizations (in Sri Lanka and overseas), as well as international foundations and associations.
