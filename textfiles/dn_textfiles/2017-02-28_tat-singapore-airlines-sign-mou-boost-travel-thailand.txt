TAT, Singapore Airlines sign MoU to boost travel to Thailand

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and Singapore Airlines (SIA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Tourism Cooperation to jointly promote travel to Thailand from priority markets including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa.
Yuthasak Supasorn, TAT Governor, said: “This MoU signing ceremony marks a major new drive on tourism cooperation between TAT and strategic partners in key source tourist markets from around the world, all of which are under the objective of promoting travel to Thailand.
This MoU with Singapore Airlines in particular, will allow us to strategically attract more travellers from the four specific markets to enjoy the unique Thai local experiences here in Amazing Thailand.”
Effective from today until 31 March 2019, the MOU between TAT and SIA will cover a series of joint activities including brand advertising and promotional campaigns, tactical and digital marketing, familiarisation trips, joint road shows and product development. The joint activities are expected to help boost visitor numbers from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Singapore to Thailand.
Yuthasak said, “Australia and New Zealand markets have long been important source markets for Thailand while the South Africa market has been growing in recent years, so this strategic MOU will certainly help boost visitor numbers to Thailand.”
SIA and its subsidiary SilkAir currently operate 89 flights per week to Thailand. SIA operates 35 weekly flights to Bangkok, while SilkAir operates 35 weekly flights to Phuket, 14 weekly flights to KohSamui and five weekly flights to Chiang Mai.
Yuthasak added, “Singapore Airlines offers high-quality service and with their help under this mutually-beneficial MOU, we look forward to welcoming their passengers with impressive Thai hospitality.”
Gohhoonhong, Singapore Airlines CEO, said, “We look forward to working with TAT on many exciting activities to promote Thailand as an attractive tourist and business destination to the world. Combined with Singapore Airlines’ wide global network and dedication to excellent customer service, we are confident we can increase visitor arrivals into Thailand.”
In 2017, TAT has set a target of 34.5 million international visitors, generating an estimated 1.81 trillion Baht (US$50 billion) a 10 per cent year-on-year increase – in international tourism receipts.
