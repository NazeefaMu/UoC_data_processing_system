Abu Dhabi Harlequins hold Kandy SC to 29-all draw

Abu Dhabi Harlequins Rugby Football Club have improved immensely and proved they still remain the benchmark in the West Asia Champion Club tournament when they produced an enthralling 80 minutes of rugby to hold host Kandy Sports Club, the Sri Lankan rugby champions to a 29-all draw at Nittawela yesterday.
After a nervous first half riddled with errors and dropped balls the game came to life in the second half in front of Kandy’s rugby fans. In a physical first half where both sides tried unsuccessfully to gain the upper momentum, the Quins went into the half time break with a 17-10 lead over the hosts.
The Nittawela boys knew they needed to attack from all areas, but with a depleted squad ravaged with injuries and some on national duty, fatigue began to set in and they made a few mistakes, but fortunately in the last ten minutes managed to gain reasonable possession and territory to hold the Quins to a 29-all draw.
Kandy SC’s points came off three goals, one penalty goal and a try to Abu Dhabi Harlequins RFC’s three goals and a try and a penalty.
For Kandy Sports Club Anuruddha Wilwara scored two tries, and Lavanga Perera one, a penalty goal and the kicking part by Thilina Wijesinghe and for the Visitors Ben Bolger, Johan Marshal, Lewis Matherson, Christy McCormick scored the tires and Andrew Semple made the kicks at goal. So it was a nailing biting rugby match defending champions had be satisfied with a draw. It was a hotly contested draw-29 all.
Referee: Norman Drake (Dubai), Assistant Referees (1): Priyantha Gunaratne, (2): Rohan Fernando.
