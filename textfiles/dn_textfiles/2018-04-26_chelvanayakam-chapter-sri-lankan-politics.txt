S.J.V. Chelvanayakam’s 41st death anniversary:
The Chelvanayakam chapter of Sri Lankan politics

S J V Chelvanayakam was born on March 31, 1898, and departed his life on April 26, 1977. On April 26 falls his 41st death anniversary. His political vision of federalism was misinterpreted yet its embers will continue to burn till the mission is achieved.
The political wheels of Sri Lanka would have definitely moved in a different way had S.J.V. Chelvanayakam played a pragmatic politics in 1968 rather than adhering to the Christian faith of honouring a promise. He strictly adhered to the Christian faith of honouring his promises. He considered his word as bond.
Failure to play politics rather than practising Christian faith foiled many such opportunities where Federal Party held the political scale to make and unmake governments were lost forever. No such opportunity ever arose but coffined for good.
FOUR DEMANDS OF FP
In the 1960s the Federal Party advanced four demands to support a UNP Government under Dudley Senanayake but Dudley Senanayake refused to accept any one of the demands put forward by Chelvanayakam.
The demands were to (1) stop State Aided Colonization, (2) grant citizenship to Plantation Tamils, (3) making Tamil Language parity with the Sinhala Language, and (4) establishing Regional Councils with powers devolved.
As Dudley Senanayake did not accept any one of the demands and consequently the Federal Party refused to form the UNP Government.
STRATEGY OF CO-OPERATION
In the year 1965, Chelvanayakam said: “Since the 1960s we have experimented a new strategy of co-operating with the Sinhala Political Parties. First, we supported SLFP in March 1960 and the years thereafter to defeat UNP because SLFP came to an agreement with FP to implement the BC Pact but they never honoured the solemn promise and agreement.”
SLFP made it clear that SLFP would honour its promises and agreements even if the SLFP was returned to power with the overall majority and even SLFP did not have to depend on the FP’s support to run a government.
FP SUPPORTS SLFP
In the political scenario, SLFP wanted the support of the FP to mobilize Tamil support for its candidates in the Sinhala Provinces. With the clear understanding of the political implications, the FP helped the SLFP to achieve its political gain by its organizational network and openly canvassing for SLFP
SLFP has let FP down very badly. They even ignored to acknowledge the receipt of letters sent by the Federal Party.
BC PACT
The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact had in Part B eight clauses. The first three clauses are illuminating. They are:
(1) Regional Areas to be defined in the Bill itself by embodying them in a Schedule thereto.
(2) That the Northern Province is to form a Regional Area whilst the Eastern Province is to be divided into two or more Regional Areas.
(3) Provision is to be made in the Bill to enable two or more Regions to amalgamate even beyond the provincial limit and for one Region to divide itself subject to ratification by Parliament. Further, provision is to be made in the Bill for two or more Regions to collaborate for specific purposes of common interest.
FP REFUSED TO SUPPORT SLFP
When in the year 1965 move was made for the UNP and FP to form a National Government, Dr. N.M. Perera Anil Moonasinghe made their last effort to get the support of the Federal Party to enable Sirimavo Bandaranaike to form the government. They promised to implement the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact in toto. Chelvanayakam reminded them that they had given such solemn promises many times but all were dishonoured after the hour of victory and he refused to support them any longer.
DC PACT
The Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was signed on 24.03.965. It stated as follows:
1. Action will be taken early under the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to make provision of the Tamil Language of Administration and of Record in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Senanayake explained that it was the policy of his party that a Tamil speaking person should be entitled to transact business in Tamil throughout the island.
2. Senanayake stated that it was the policy of his party to amend the Language of Courts Act to provide legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil.
3. Action will be taken to establish District Councils in Ceylon vested with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between the two leaders. It was agreed, however, that the government should have power under the law to give directions to such councils under the national interest.
4. The Land Development Ordinance will be amended to provide that citizens of Ceylon e entitled to the allotment of land under the Ordinance.
Senanayake further agreed that in the granting of land under colonization schemes the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces:
a. The land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces should in the first instance be granted to the landless persons in the District.
b. Secondly, to the Tamil Speaking Persons residing in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
c. Thirdly, to other citizens in Ceylon, preference being given to the Tamil citizens in the rest of the island.
DUDLEYGE BADE MASALA VADAI
After the formation of the National Government the Coalition Parties, SLFP, LSSP and CP went on the way of an offensive against the National Government. On the Joint May Day Procession, they marched with the slogan “Dudleyge bade masala vadai”.
It meant that the stomach of Dudley had masala vadai, an item of Tamil food which the Sinhalese too tasted.
JOINT OPPOSITION
Regulations were framed to give the use of Tamil in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The Bill was presented in Parliament on January 8, 1966. The Coalition Parties organized a protest demonstration. The demonstrators became violent and were acting unruly. Then, the Minister of State, J.R. Jayewardene ordered the Police to disperse the demonstrators. The Police used tear gas but the demonstrators were acting very violently. The Police opened fire, killing Ratnasara Thera, a Buddhist Bhikku.
DC PACT ABANDONED AND DUDLEY OFFERED TO RESIGN
The Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was not a strong-willed person. He became cold feet as the Buddhist Priest was killed by the action of the Police and dropped the DC Pact like dropping down as hot plate.
Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake told the Federal Party Leader, Chelvanayakam he could not honour his word and he would resign as Prime Minister for his failure to implement the DC Pact.
Chelvanayakam did not ask Dudley Senanayake to dissolve the government or asked him to resign the premiership but Chelvanayakam asked Dudley Senanayake not to resign. Chelvanayakam asked Dudley Senanayake to continue as Prime Minister and that he would give his support for the entire period of four years as promised.
CHELVA WANTED DUDLEY TO CONTINUE
Had Chelvanayakam accepted the offer of resignation of Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister, JR Jayewardena would have succeeded as Prime Minister as Sir John Kotelawala succeeded as Prime Minister upon the resignation of Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister in 1953.
JR Jayewardena was a strong-willed person. Had he succeeded as Prime Minister he would have implemented the DC Pact fully or partly. In that event, it would have certainly alleviated the rigours of the several anti-Tamil Legislation.
JR WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY
Besides the above benefits, JR Jayewardene would have been the Prime Minister for the next two years and during the aforesaid period of his two years reign, he would have definitely changed the political scenes of the country and would have averted the political episode of 1970 and subsequent development of political theories. Chelvanayakam had pursued his political vision with religious mission and favour. He had fixed principles, not intransigent but unswerving in pursuit of his religious faith.
TERRIBLE PRICE
It was a terrible price the country and, more so, the Tamils had to pay. A careful political move would have avoided the horrors of communal programmes, economic and political mess that Sri Lanka was pushed into the mire.
