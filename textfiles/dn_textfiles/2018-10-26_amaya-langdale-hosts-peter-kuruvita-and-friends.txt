Amaya Langdale hosts Peter Kuruvita and friends

Amaya Langdale, one of the 9 resorts under the Amaya Resorts & Spas umbrella hosted the international famed Sri Lankan born celebrity chef, the one and only Peter Kuruvita recently.
Peter Kuruvita has been a patron guest of Amaya Langdale for years and this year, he made two trips to this beautiful 13 roomed Small Luxury Hotel in the Tea Capital of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya. The team at Amaya Langdale welcomed him and the 14 guests who were travelling with him to a lovely English High Tea at the new Observatory Room.
This was later followed by a cooking demonstration by Peter in garden terrace
in which he prepared a Tea Country Pork Curry with Carrot sambal on a traditional clay pot and wood fire, which was enjoyed by everyone.
Speaking to us, Peter added “they had to the place all to themselves and that was a special feeling. Our walk in the morning took us all around the mountains behind the property. It’s one of the must do things when you come to Sri Lanka.
Amaya Langdale is located in the most scenic locations in the Nanu Oya disctrict nestled comfortably on a tea hill with a 360 degree endless view of Tea Valleys and mountains.
