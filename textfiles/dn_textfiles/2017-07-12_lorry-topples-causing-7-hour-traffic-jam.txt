A lorry transporting a stock of refuse tea toppled on the Hatton - Colombo main road at Woodland causing a seven-hour traffic jam at the spot around 1 am on July 11, Hatton Police said.
Police said the stock of refuse tea weighed 26,730 kilos. The lorry had gone out of control due to heavy fog which blocked visibility according to the statement made by the lorry driver, Police said.
He said during the blockade, only three wheelers and motorcycles were able to pass through the spot.
