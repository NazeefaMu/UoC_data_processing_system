UN Chief assures solidarity and cooperation with SL

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres assured solidarity and cooperation with Sri Lanka to re-build a prosperous and reconciled nation.
The UN Secretary-General expressed these views at a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on September 23 to coincide with the 72nd sessions of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
The UN Secretary-General pledged the UN’s fullest support to build Sri Lanka as a prosperous and reconciled nation with the participation of its citizens.
He commended President Sirisena’s firm commitment to implement the Paris Accord.
The UN Secretary-General recalled his visits to several places including Sigiriya, Dambulla and Polonnaruwa in 1987 and once again visited Sri Lanka as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
President Sirisena invited the UN Secretary-General to visit Sri Lanka to access the country’s progress in its development and reconciliation process.
