Vandersay spins Sri Lanka ‘A’ to series win

Promising right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay roared back into form after injury with a match-winning bowling performance taking six wickets for 47 runs off 21.2 overs to bowl Sri Lanka ‘A’ to a series clinching 138 runs win over West Indies A on the fourth and final day of the third and
final unofficial test played at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
The win gave Sri Lanka A the three-match series 2-1.
West Indies ‘A’ set a target of 333 to chase were bundled out for 194 after Sri Lanka A had declared their second innings at 257-6 at the fall of Roshen Silva’s wicket 44. Dasun Shanaka remained unbeaten on 33.
West Indies ‘A’ began their run chase well with an opening stand of 63 and one stage were 171-4 before Vandersay took control of the game with a six-wicket haul that saw the last six wickets crash for 23 runs.
Vandersay had been laid low by a broken finger sustained at practice in May and returned to competitive cricket in the second unofficial test of the current series.
It was the spinners who did the damage to the West Indies A innings with Lakshan Sandakan picked for the tour of Zimbabwe returning figures of 3 for 61 to follow his three wickets in the first innings and Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka picking up the wicket of first innings top scorer Shimron Hetmyer for 18. Kieran Powell (44) and skipper Shamarh Brooks (46) were the only batsmen to offer any resistance as the Lankan spinners swept the rest of the batting to achieve victory in the first mandatory over. The two teams will now clash in a three-match unofficial one-day series starting on October 24 at Dambulla.
