Centre Against Private Medical Colleges files against Medical Council

 
The Centre Against Private Medical Colleges (CPMC) has filed a case against the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) at the Human Rights Commission for registering private medical degree holders, CPMC Convener Dr. Jayantha Bandara told the Daily News.
Dr. Bandara said if unqualified, inexperienced and unsuitable persons who hold medical degrees obtained from private medical collages come into the Sri Lankan health service, the people's right to life will be violated because people can die due to wrong medical treatment and advise.
“There is a possibility that the SLMC may register private medical degree holders as doctors enabling them to practice in Sri Lanka which will be a pure violation of Sri Lankan people's basic right to safe health service and the right for life.
That is why we filled a case,” he said. “There are many poor students who got through G.C.E Advanced Level with flying colours but failed to enter into state medical faculties.
They do not have money to obtain private education. But unqualified students who failed G.C.E Advanced Level Examination obtain private education and try to become `doctors’”, he charged.
