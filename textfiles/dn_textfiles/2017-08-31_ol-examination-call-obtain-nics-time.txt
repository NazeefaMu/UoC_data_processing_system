O/L examination: Call to obtain NICs on time

The North Western Province Education Ministry instructed school heads of Kurunegala and Puttalm Districts in a circular that early steps should be taken to get the NICs of students who are to sit for the G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination - 2017 in December this year.
The Department of Registration of Persons too has informed school heads to forward applications of students to obtain the NICs in advance to avert an undue rush at the last moment.
However, most school heads had not responded to the request positively, W. M. Balasooriya, senior Director of Education, Kurunegala told the Daily News.
“School heads have to take responsibility if school candidates face obstacles at examination centres,” he said. About 126 school candidates faced such problems over the issue at the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination 2017 in August this year, Balasooriya added.
