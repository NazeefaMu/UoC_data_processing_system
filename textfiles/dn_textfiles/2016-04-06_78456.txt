Amaraweera positive of joint SLFP May Day rally

 
Fisheries Minister and United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera is positive of the harmonisation of party members on one stage at the upcoming May Day rally.
The minister said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had taken a decision to hold the May Day rally in Galle at the request of party members although Colombo and Badulla were also nominated.
"As far as I know, no decision has been taken by the Joint opposition to hold the May Day rally separately and I hope that the party would not be split into two while holding the May Day rally. If a party member claims that SLFP members in the Joint Opposition are planning to do so, that would be considered as his personal opinion, as a majority of the party members have agreed to hold the rally united under one single party," Amaraweera said.
The minister added that if a party member wants to hold a May Day rally separately, it would directly benefit the United National Party (UNP).
"Hence it would be considered as a statement made with some other intention which is not supportive of the party. No true party member would initiate such an act, " Amaraweera added.
"We have also conducted 12 unofficial discussions with leaders of other parties under the UPFA including Communist Party leader D.E.W. Gunasekera and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena. They have agreed to get on stage during the May Day Rally," Amaraweera said.
