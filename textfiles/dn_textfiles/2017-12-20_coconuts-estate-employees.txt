Coconuts for estate employees

The State Plantations Corporation has made arrangements to supply coconuts at reduced prices to all employees attached to its estates as a relief measure for the Christmas and New Year season.
Coconuts will be provided at a price much below the controlled price of Rs. 75 each under this programme, said the Corporation's General Manager, Nishantha Jinadasa.
Under this programme implemented on the direction of Minister Kabir Hashim and Chairman Tilak Mahanama, each employee will be entitled to a bundle of 10 coconuts, he said.
