People-friendly global exposer

The combination of Sri Lanka’s geographical proximity and multifaceted ties with the People’s Republic of China which spans over six decades of diplomatic relationship creates an unprecedented development opportunity. Sino-Lanka economic ties were given a major boost during President Xi’s visit to Colombo in July 2016 and the Chinese leader has become the first President to visit Sri Lanka since former leader Li Xiannian in 1986.
His visit assumes significance in the context of strengthening ties between the two countries, with China investing heavily in the island nation. This will inevitably generate new opportunities for Sri Lanka as well.
Very recently Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianling expressed the importance of the investment in Sri Lanka industrial Focused on Hambantota zone on the topic “One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative”. “I already persuaded 10 CEOs of big companies to invest USD 3-5 billion in the next two to three years. Most of them belong to the 500 Fortune companies. I am confident that the corporation between Sri Lanka and China will be a success in the future”, he said.
This poses the question as to what would be the most conducive framework for maximizing the benefits from the China. In this connection, it is very much in Sri Lanka’s interests to develop its economic relations with China with a Free trade Agreement. ‘Sri Lanka – China FTA: The Jewel in the Crown,’ the FTAs with the two countries provide a useful framework for pursuing the maximization of the commercial benefits of bilateral relations with these two countries. These agreements should cover trade in goods and services; investment; trade facilitation; trade remedies; technological cooperation; tourism; and human resources.
One Belt One Road Initiative
There is enormous potential to increase tourism from China. The latter is already the largest source of tourists into Sri Lanka and Chinese arrivals are growing very rapidly. As tourism is the sixth pillar of the government’s hub-based strategy, tourism promotion should be an important component of the partnership agreements with China. Human resources are likely to be the binding constraint holding back an ambitious vision based on the partnership agreements. In the long-term, education, training, and skills development should be better aligned with the country’s dynamic international comparative advantage.
China and its neighbouring countries are of the developing world and share geographical vicinity and common interests, and Chinese people and peoples from neighbouring countries have been enjoying a long-standing traditional friendship and fruitful cooperation. As I mention before the One Belt One Road Initiative offers a great opportunity for China and countries along the OBOR including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Sri Lanka to deepen economic trade and cooperation, cultural and personnel communication and connectivity. However, the security risks could impact the implementation of the Initiative, and even the regional peace and stability at large. Meanwhile, the Chinese leadership and leaderships of all above-mentioned countries interacted frequently, which injected new impetus into the friendly bilateral relations. Importantly, people-to-people exchanges could serve as a cornerstone for bilateral relations between China and these countries. Therefore we need to strength contact, relationship and human interest of every citizens. The path is open. With the social media technology and lot of tourism activity speedily filling the gap. Government, Media, NGO’s and peoples association could be the organise activity and develop the understanding of peoples capacity.
The Pathfinder Foundation in Colombo carried out a productive business and people friendly promotion mission to China with establishment the Eminent Persons’ Advisory Council comprising senior personalities from the both countries. This mission was organised at the invitation of the Chinese People’s Association of Peace and Disarmament, a Beijing based think-tank with signing the Memorandum of Understanding in October 2013.
The council is set up technical sub-committees to realize the spirit of the MoU in such areas as strengthening economic, political, strategic and cultural relations. Given such a favourable background, the CPAPD is to be sponsor a NGO exchange programme first week of March this year.
International security
Pathfinder foundation, Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies and Institute of National Security studies will be participate this valuable forum with representative including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Philippines for promoting exchanges, friendship and cooperation between Chinese people and peoples, thus making contributions to bilateral relations, regional peace, stability and common development. The theme of the programme is “how to promote people-to-people bond within the OBOR” and suggestions for Chinese NGOs to conduct more activities in foreign countries.
The joint delegation consists of various leaders of research institutes, think tanks, media and other social organisations, which is conducive to provide a comprehensive overview over the people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between China and its neighbours.
With the exchange event all six country represent the session call Wanshou Forum is an open platform for think tanks, NGOs and other relevant organisations to discuss hot topics of common concern. In this forum open Theme is to be: Current International Security Situation and Its Features. Shall the discussion cover the following aspects including the current international security situation and China should do for stabilizing or improving the international security situation? In addition forum will focus what’s the role for NGOs in this regard, Solutions or suggestions for international community to improve security situation.
Discussion is scheduled with scholars from a leading Chinese think tank, youth leaders and representative of governing members. Security situation in South Asia and Southeast Asia: reality, features, challenges and approaches. Chinese NGOs would like to do more cooperative programs in foreign countries so as to lay down firm social and public foundation for the development of bilateral relations, so they need to get more information and suggestions from the people and NGOs in relevant countries.
Ambitious reform programme
End of the day we have to propose that under the cooperation of think thank of Wanshou Forum is to establish a deeper understanding among the NGOs and peoples of member countries. With the objective of developing and strengthening deeper relationships among the NGOs, Exchange of academics, the practitioners of traditional medicine, up and coming businessmen, as well as journalists would be an excellent and very effective way to promote and strengthen NGO relations.
This is an important opportunity for us, and member countries. For all of us cannot sweep without unity.
We as a Global society cannot run away from our issues. We must face them, and come to terms with the consequences of our past collective actions. We look forward the successful in finding solutions with Suggestions to Strengthen NGO exchanges and Cooperation in Asia-Pacific Region. China has embarked upon an ambitious reform programme. It will transform its economy and social activity is a significant impact on the rest of the world. Above all, China’s relationship program provides important insights for countries like Sri Lanka regarding the merits of pressing ahead with new era of global exposer. - Pathfinder Foundation
