One person died and five policemen were injured in a clash that occurred at a gambling den when a group of police officers raided the place at Karuwalagoda, Uragaha, in Karandeniya, on Saturday, Galle Division DIG’s office said.
The person who died was identified as Hewa Hakuru Jayawardana of Samagipura, Karandeniya. The injured police officers were admitted to Elpitiya Hospital.
