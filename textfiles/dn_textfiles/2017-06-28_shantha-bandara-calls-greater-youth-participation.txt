Shantha Bandara calls for greater youth participation

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) Chairman, Shantha Bandara yesterday, urged the government to create a legal background to ensure at least 25 percent youth participation in Local Government bodies.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, the Chairman said that Local Government level is ideal for a person to start his or her political journey.
He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena had directed to submit the Bill to amend the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2012 as soon as possible.
“The election date would be gazetted once the bill will be passed in Parliament. After the Speaker signs the Bill, the Commission will do the necessary preparations for the elections. Hence, it will be at least mid September, when we can hold the election,” he said.
