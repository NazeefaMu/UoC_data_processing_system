Sangakkara scores 71 as Surrey open season with innings win

LONDON, Monday: Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara hit a fluent 71 in Surrey’s opening county match of the season against Warwickshire at the Oval.
Sangakkara’s half century coupled with M Stoneman’s knock of 165 saw Surrey reach 454.
Warwickshire were then bowled out for 91 with M Footitt taking six wickets for 14 runs. Forced to follow-on Warwickshire were spared the blushes by England batsman Jonathan Trott as his excellent unbeaten 141 helped the Bears fight back to take their game into a fourth day closing on 322-7.
However Surrey took less than an hour on the final morning to wrap up a season-opening victory over Warwickshire by an innings and one run on Monday.
After resuming 41 behind, the Bears’ hopes of saving the game pretty much rested on Trott.
But Tom Curran broke through, trapping Jeetan Patel lbw - and Trott added just 10 to his score before holing out off Mark Footitt for 151.
Chris Wright was then bowled by Curran as Warwickshire were all out for 362.
Having opened up with a 23-point haul, Surrey’s next game is also at home against Lancashire, starting on Good Friday.
