Garbage collection stalled due to workers’ get-together

Residents in Kandy city faced great inconvenience due to the stalling of garbage clearance work on June 24 and 25 as a result of municipal workers keeping off work to attend a get-together organized by their welfare union.
 
Municipal Commissioner Chandana Tennakoon, when inquired, said the get-together was an annual event attended by municipal workers and as such garbage collection was held up on June 24 and 25. However, garbage collection work resumed yesterday as usual.
