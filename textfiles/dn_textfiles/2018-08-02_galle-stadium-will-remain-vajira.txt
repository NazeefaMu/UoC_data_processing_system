Galle stadium will remain - Vajira

False news articles published in certain newspapers regarding the Galle International Stadium, caused an upheaval in the country, recently. The need of the hour was for the media to act in a responsible manner, without spreading misinformation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said.
Abeywardene said certain individuals had altered a recent speech he had made and published it to mislead the nation.
Minister Abeywardene was addressing Samurdhi officers at an awareness programme held at the Galle Four Gravets Divisional Secretariat, on July 30. Minister Abeyewardene said there were about 80,000 schoolchildren in the Galle city, adding that the time had come for everyone to look into their future welfare.
The Galle International Cricket Stadium was closed for almost 350 days a year, and that was a major problem, he said.
The government, which had filed cases against 30 middle-class families in Galle Fort for illegal constructions, had been using several buildings it had built illegally at the Galle stadium, the minister said, adding that it was wrong as the law should be applied equally to all.
