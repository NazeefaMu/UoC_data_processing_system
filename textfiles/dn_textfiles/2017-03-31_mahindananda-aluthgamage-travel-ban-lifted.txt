Mahindananda Aluthgamage travel ban lifted

 
Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court today temporally removed the travel restriction imposed on former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage, allowing him to travel to Singapore for three-months.   
 Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara made this order following a request made by defence counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC.
Accordingly, former Minister’s passport was ordered to be released on June 30.
 Former Minister’s passport was impounded regarding a corruption case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption.
 The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption filed a corruption case in Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court against former Sports Minister, Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, and another official at the Sports Ministry, over a Rs. 53.1 million fraud said to have taken place, when importing sports equipment to sports clubs.
The case was fixed for trial on July 13.
Deputy Solicitor General Shanil Kulatunga appeared for the Bribery Commission.
