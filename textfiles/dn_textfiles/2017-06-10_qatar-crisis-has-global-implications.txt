Qatar crisis has global implications

It came like a bolt in the blue. Five Gulf nations broke diplomatic relations with Qatar last Monday without any forewarning. There was not even a hint of such a move at the recent Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting or at the America – Islamic and Arab Nation Summit attended by US President Donald Trump. However, the move was pre-meditated and well planned.
Saudi Arabia could not have taken it without prior consultation and approval from the United States, especially because it happened on the heels of a high profile visit of President Trump to Riyadh at which the United States concluded an arms deal worth over US $ 100 billion. Actually President Trump in a Twitter message hailed the move and apparently sided with Saudi Arabia and other nations in their dispute with Qatar, despite the presence of the largest US military base in Qatar which is used for daily operations in the region.
Qatar is a small country with a population of 2.3 million people of which over 2 million are foreigners, mostly from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Philippines. It has a GDP of 334.5 billion US dollars and its per capita GDP is the highest in the world. It is the world’s largest natural gas exporter. It shares the world’s largest underwater natural gas deposit in the world with Iran. Though rich it imports over 80 percent of its food.
Diplomatic solution through consultations
The States that broke diplomatic relations with Qatar are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen. Four other countries followed suit. They are Maldives, Mauritania, Mauritius and Senegal.
They demand that Qatar stop aiding terrorism and severe its relations with 12 entities including Hamas, and the Muslim Brotherhood. They have also named 59 individuals also as terrorists receiving Qatar support. Israeli Foreign Minister has hailed the move against Qatar. French President Macron, President Donald Trump and Kuwait’s Emir Al Ahmed Al Salah have all promised to mediate to find a diplomatic solution through consultations.
Qatar has declined to accede to these demands. Its Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman Al Thani has said that “We are not ready to surrender and will never be ready to surrender our foreign policy”. The intervening countries had the audacity to call for a policy change by Qatar, in an open affront to its sovereignty.
Terrorist attacks
What is ironic in this situation is that it is not Qatar but Saudi Arabia that is alleged to be openly supporting terrorism. On could recall that 15 out of the accused in the 9/11 attack were Saudi citizens. Bin Laden was also a Saudi national. The recent bomb attacks in Teheran on the Majlis (Parliament) and the Mausoleum of Imam Al Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran was attributed by Iran to terrorists funded by Saudi Arabia. The incidents killed 17 and wounded around 50 others. It may also be recalled that Saudi Foreign Minister is reported to have said in an oblique reference in May about the need to “take the battle to Iran”.
Iran has taken measures to supply Qatar with food requirements and Turkey has expressed its solidarity by ratifying a deal to train the Qatar military. This diplomatic offensive by Saudi Arabia and its allies is sure to destabilize the entire Gulf region. It has already breached the unity in the GCC. With it the hope of establishing a Sunni NATO against Shia Iran will also will fall unless Qatar surrenders. In the latter case it will have a negative effect throughout the world for the United States would be tempted to exert pressure to subjugate even developed allied countries to ensure world domination.
Since considerable numbers of South Asians including 650,000 Indians live and work in Qatar, India and other countries that have expatriate workers there will be unable to overlook it in their dealings with the United States.
Though the dispute seems to be prima facie based on political differences the underlying factors are economic and are far distant from terrorist activities. Iran and Qatar are jointly harnessing the huge underwater natural gas reserves in the region. Economic interests compel them to keep this cooperation intact.
US supremacy
The consolidation of the Assad regime or a pro-Moscow regime in Syria with the defeat of the Islamic State would ensure the passage of Russian natural gas to the European market via Syria and would favour cooperation and not confrontation between the gas producers Russia and Qatar. In fact Qatar has already invested US $ 2.7 billion in the Russian State company Rusneft. Russia – Turkey relations have improved dramatically in the recent months and have stabilized.
Relations with Iran have been an important aspect of Russian foreign policy in West Asia and the Mediterranean. Thus the present Qatar crisis has the potential of developing a Russia – Turkey- Qatar –Iran alliance in the future. Such an outcome would have great geo-political implications and undermine US supremacy in the region.
South Asian nations including Sri Lanka would not be able to stand aloof or toe the US line as the crisis develops. There are 650,000 Indian nationals living and working in Qatar. India will have to take their interests in defining its relations and aligning its policies with that of the United States.
