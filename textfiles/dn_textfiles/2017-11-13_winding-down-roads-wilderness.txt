Winding down The roads of the wilderness

In a place as naturally lush and dense with wildlife as Sri Lanka, it only makes sense that tourism emphasizing the outdoors would be on the rise. And indeed it is, with new eco-tourism outfits popping up regularly, encouraging both locals and foreign travellers to spend their time in Sri Lanka outside.
An increasingly popular way to do this is to take advantage of the safaris offered all around the country in national parks such as Yala, Udawalawe, Wasgamuwa, and Wilpattu. These safaris offer patrons the opportunity to traverse the parks by Jeeps and get up close and personal with an array of animals in their natural habitats.
One organization leading the way forward in this field is EcoTeam Sri Lanka, which has been around since 1998 and bills itself as a “one-stop shop for adventure activities and camping in all national parks and nature reserves in Sri Lanka.” One of their main ventures is the Mahoora Tented Safari Camps, which aim to mesh the thrill and nature-immersive experience of camping and a safari with some of the luxuries afforded by a hotel. Last week, a group of reporters got a chance to check out Mahoora’s recently renovate Tented Safari Camp in Wilpattu National Park.
The authentic feeling
Wilpattu National Park is Sri Lanka’s biggest—over 130,000 hectares—which means it’s also the least crowded. According to Channa Jayasundara, a consultant for new projects and development for EcoTeam, this makes it the perfect place for a safari.
Our group left Colombo early on a Thursday morning, and around four hours later we pulled up to the entrance of Wilpattu. Since buses aren’t allowed inside, there was a group from Mahoora there to transport us in two Jeeps—giving us our first taste of the experience of the safari to come. From there, it was a short ride to our campground located on the edge of the nature reserve, a mere ten minute drive from the entrance to the national park.
Upon arrival, we were greeted initially by members of the Mahoora staff in a welcome tent, who served us a welcome drink of fresh coconut water, and next by the first sign of wildlife we would see on our trip: the Sri Lankan jungle fowl. Endemic to the country, the colorful jungle fowl peppered the campgrounds, adding to the authentic feeling of the experience.
Rain had started to come down hard at this point—a karmic effort, it seemed, to make the camping conditions as unsuitable as possible. And yet it put little damper on the tour. We were provided with umbrellas that behaved in an almost fortified manner, just like the tents we were next directed to, behaved themselves.
Stepping inside the tent, one would not be blamed if she forgot—for a second—that she was technically outdoors. While the tents lack many amenities currently expected from higher-end hotels, such as air conditioning, internet access, and hot water, the rooms themselves would fit right in at any five-star hotel, with plush beds, couches, a full bathroom, and tasteful decor containing much elephant iconography. One piece of advice, however: if you can’t sleep through the sound of rain, you might have a problem.
natural setting
After dropping our belongings inside our tents, we had a hearty lunch of rice and curry, some of the best I’ve tasted in Sri Lanka yet, before heading out on the highlight of our tour: the safari through Wilpattu.
Jeeps need to be out of Wilpattu by 6 pm, so according to Jayasundara, most safari tours begin at either 5.30 am or 2.30 pm. Given our afternoon arrival to the campground, our tour began at the latter time, give or take an hour or so. We were warned beforehand that the likelihood of seeing the two specific animals which draw most people to Wilpattu—the Sri Lankan leopard and elephant—was low, given the rain which had still not stopped coming down. And much to our chagrin, we didn’t see either of them.
Yet the safari was hardly bereft of wildlife to observe. As our Jeep winded its way through the park’s rocky dirt roads, accompanied by a trained naturalist from the area, wildlife surrounded us at every turn, at which point we’d stop the vehicle and observe.
Over the course of the next few hours, we saw evermore jungle fowl, barking deer, sambar deer, spotted deer (there were a lot of deer), peacocks with soaking wet feathers, freshwater crocodiles, eagles, tortoises, snakes, and even one mother sloth bear protecting her cub. But even as our safari tour came to an end at the 6:00PM park-exit deadline, our opportunity to immerse ourselves in the natural setting surrounding us had only just begun.
knowledgeable and charismatic
As with all meals at Mahoora, dinner was served under an open-air dining tent. Lit by a campfire and torches along the camp’s many winding paths, the meal was far more indulgent than one would expect to eat when going “camping.” Served in multiple courses, the meal consisted of soup, garlic bread roasted vegetables, barbecued chicken and pork, some flan-type dessert, and fresh fruit.
As Jayasundara explained, the skilled chefs at Mahoora can accommodate any dietary restriction, and have previously cooked for guests who are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free, among others. Most of the meal’s ingredients are sourced from the locality in which the park is based, which means that in a way, eating with Mahoora is a means of invigorating the local economy.
Then it was time for our night walk. Venturing into the backwoods of Mahoora’s campgrounds, we were directed by flashlight around the area for thirty minutes or so, led by two EcoTeam naturalists who were both knowledgeable and charismatic. On the hunt for nocturnal creatures, we spotted birds, bugs, and even a snake, which we were less than thrilled to realize had been crawling on a branch above our heads.
Sleeping in the tents at night, one is keenly aware of the fact that she is in nature. The sounds of rain falling and birds chirping are far from quiet. But as Jayasundara says, this is all part of the experience.
Camping—even at its most luxurious—is not for everyone. There will always be people who complain without hot water, insist on air conditioning, need to sleep in silence, and fear the occasional bug crawling up their leg. But with its newest Mahoora Tented Safari Camp in Wilpattu, EcoTeam has made a tremendous effort, and a successful one at that, in ensuring that the safari concept is an accessible one which allows everybody a chance to experience a wilderness setting.
Even in the pouring rain, and even without seeing the elephants and wild leopards, the experience in Wilpattu is one I would repeat in a heartbeat and one I will not soon forget.
