DP wants Wijayadasa removed from ministerial portfolio

The Democratic Party urges the President, the Prime Minister and the government to remove Wijayadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial portfolio as his conduct is not fitting for the Good Governance Government, party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
He said the party would urge President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to remove Rajapakshe who is acting with a hidden agenda before he defames the good governance government and damages its image. Field Marshal Fonseka made these observations at a press conference at the DP headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
"Wijayadasa Rajapakshe is attempting to cross over and join the Rajapaksa gang," he said.
"This is why he has suddenly begun praising the Rajapaksas."
Field Marshal Fonseka said Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said that there were no computer gimmicks at the 2010 election.
He said Rajapakshe was the only UNPer who said the 2010 election was fair.
