Programmes for disabled children to be augmented

Social welfare programmes for disabled children of low-income families in the Matara district, were planned to be augmented recently.
According to project coordinator and Director of Institute for Development of Community Strengths Conrad Ranawake, the basic needs and requirements of these children would be given top-priority.
Eleven selected children belonging to low-income families had been provided with financial assistance of Rs. 5,000 each under the welfare scheme. A total of 60 children were expected to be provided with financial aid within the course of this year.
The institute had anticipated to increase the said number up to 100, while also increasing the financial assistance up to Rs. 6,000 each by next year, Ranawake said.
In addition, another 100 children were to be granted scholarships at the beginning of next year. Helping Hands is funding the said programmes, he added.
