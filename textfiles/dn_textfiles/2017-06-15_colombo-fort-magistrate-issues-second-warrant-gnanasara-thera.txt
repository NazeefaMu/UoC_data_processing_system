Colombo Fort Magistrate issues second warrant on Gnanasara Thera

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate issued a warrant against Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera for the second time, today.
The warrant was issued since Gnanasara Thera failed to appear before courts for two consecutive times.
He is alleged to have behaved in an unruly manner inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court on January 25, last year.
