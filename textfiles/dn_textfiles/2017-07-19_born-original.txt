Born original

She being an engineer, teacher, mathematician, violinist and above all a singer has chosen to remain a housewife attending to her daily chores at home as a mother of four. But 2016 is a special year for this busy housewife, as Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri emerged as the Gratiaen winner for her work, Stories. Beloved wife of Bingu, mother of Dinindu, Amandi, Nethmi and Adithya, daughter of the late artiste Dr Tissa Abeysekara and Pushpa Meewella, Charulatha was educated at Visakha Vidyalaya and the University of Moratuwa.
Q: Why do you confine yourself to home?
A: I had two of my four children while I was still at the University. I didn’t have the heart to leave them to a nanny to pursue a career.
Q: What inspired you to be a writer?
A: I have always written poetry since childhood, inspired by my author parents. But I began fiction to deal with the shock of my father passing away. I was used to having long conversations with him about everything. I badly miss those talks with him. I began to put my thoughts on paper. That was the start of a book.
Q: What is your employment record?
A: After my A/Ls, we had a two-year wait until University entry, and I was employed for about a year at a fledgling bank (that sadly never opened) called National Enterprise Bank. That was my first job. After obtaining my degree, I became a mathematics/physics teacher, first at British School in Colombo and then S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia. Now I’m at home doing the most fulfilling job of all – being a mom and wife!
Q: The award cannot be an overnight achievement. What do you think moulded your creativity?
A: During my school days, I wrote poetry and short stories, which my friends and parents enjoyed. These were never published anywhere, and I’ve lost nearly all of them. The little verses I wrote to my boyfriend (my husband now) are all safely filed away in a box-file by him. Now when I read them, I feel really embarrassed!
Q: And the birth of ‘Stories’?
A: I am thankful to Lalitha Somathilaka and Siri Almeida for insisting that I submit my first book for the Gratiaen award. I was encouraged as a writer when that book got shortlisted.
My first book ‘Autumn Leaves’ was shortlisted for the Gratiaen Award in 2011.
Q: How did you fare at the school?
A: I was a member of the school choir and we won the ‘All Island Singing Competition’ three years in a row – 1987, 1988 and 1989. Other than that, I used to get the Applied Mathematics prize every time, and for my A/L results in 1994, I got the prize for ‘Best results – Mathematics section’ and also co-won the Clara Motwani Shield for Applied Mathematics with a classmate.
Q: How did you come across the theme of your book?
A: This book was written in Mauritius, which is as beautiful as Sri Lanka, but in a different way. It made me think of the environment of my childhood, of the times I spent in my aunt’s walauwa in Pattiyagodella, Amithirigala, Ruwanwella. Nearly all school holidays were spent in that estate, watching the birds, wandering in the woods amidst sounds of animals. The setting for the story comes from those memories.
I was assisted by my friends and husband in many ways. Their comments and criticism as well as praise were invaluable in developing the plot.
After the book won the award, the panel, consisting of Prof Sasanka Perera, Chandana Disanayaka and Ruhanie Perera, made a valid point. A book written in English should not be limited to this island. And their insightful remarks about ‘fleshing out’ the story for the benefit of the international reader were invaluable in polishing and perfecting the manuscript.
Q: What are the preparations underway for that mission?
A: It was quite a lot of work. To make a foreign reader grasp the depth and flow of the story, certain background information (relevant, of course) had to be provided, within the context. This is the sort of information we take for granted when writing for local readership.
For instance I mention Ratnapura in the story. A foreigner will not know what sort of a place it is or its significance to the storyline. So I had to say… “Ratnapura, the City of Gems, is, in many ways, a meeting place, a gateway or a link between worlds. It lies at the foot of the sacred mountain Adam’s Peak, bordering the virgin rainforest Sinharaja, some hundred kilometres from Colombo. It is the rendezvous point of the central hills and the southern plains.… Adam’s Peak, also called Sri Paada kanda– sacred footprint mountain - carries a footprint sunk into rock; a footprint believed, in turn, to be that of Buddha, god Shiv, Adam and St. Thomas by the four major religions. The peak, believed to be the point where Heaven is most easily accessible from Earth, is called Svargarohanam– the stairway to Heaven - in Sanskrit.”
I had to explain why a local boy would have a certain way of speaking… “…his funny mixed-English speech when he was excited. Being born to educated and cultured parents, growing up in Colombo suburbs with shows like Knight Rider and MacGyver on TV, and associating with friends from different ethnic backgrounds, his speech was a rich mixture of British, American and Ceylonese English.”
I’m very grateful to my family for creating the space for me to do this and have the manuscript ready for publishing. My daughter did a painting for the cover. H D Premasiri and everyone at Sarasavi Publications has been very kind and helpful to me. The book will be published in August.
