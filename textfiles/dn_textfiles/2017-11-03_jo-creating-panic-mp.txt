JO creating panic: MP

The Joint Opposition which follows the tradition of opposing everything that the government does is now creating an unnecessary panic among the ordinary people over the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly, UNP Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Thushara Indunil Amarasena said.
“To do that, they have selected some sensitive topics such as religion, nationality and patriotism. Everybody loves their country, religion and race. So they are trying to fulfill their narrow political purposes by levelling baseless allegations regarding this Interim Report,” said the MP.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha, yesterday.
“Some leaders who raise their voice against this report outside Parliament, have not yet spoken a single word at the debate which is ongoing in Parliament,” he charged.
He said the UNP is confident of victory at the upcoming local government election and there is no need to join another party to compete the election. Commenting on a statement made by Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara at this week’s Cabinet media briefing, claiming that the SLFP had not yet taken a decision to compete the local government election jointly with the UNP under one symbol, the MP said the UNP does not want to form any ‘Hansa Puttu’ (Pair of Swans) hereafter.
He further charged that Minister Susil Premajayanth is now acting a double role with the intention of getting his son free from corruption charges.
