SLMC should clearly outline minimum standards for medical education: Kiriella

Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has not clearly outlined the minimum standards for medical education although it accuses the private medical college in Malabe of failing to maintain minimum standards.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo, the Minister said the Government was looking forward to gazette the minimum standards in medical education and added the SLMC has the sole responsibility to decide on the minimum requirements.
“The Government has no power to establish minimum standards in medical education. We have been requesting SLMC to establish minimum standards even during the previous regime but we still have not received any favourable response regarding that from SLMC. It is a barrier for the Government to proceed further to solve the issue related to granting provisional registration for medical graduates of SAITM,” the Minister said.
Kiriella also said that Government has no right to close down SAITM since the legal system of Sri Lanka had accepted SAITM.
