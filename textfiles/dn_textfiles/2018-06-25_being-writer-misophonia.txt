The world is too loud
On being a writer with misophonia

A: “What’s the apple doing on the sink?”
B: “I was going to eat it earlier but then I thought it would be too noisy.”
A nods, appreciatively. Returns to laptop. Inserts earplugs. Puts on headphones. Googles “rainy jazz.”
It was all over the news a few years back: people who get extremely distressed by specific repetitive noises—notably mastication, respiration, keyboards clicking, cutlery scraping—may suffer from a newly discovered condition called misophonia, or decreased sound tolerance. Something to do with salience networks in the brain going into overdrive, producing strong emotional responses that differ distinctly to the mere annoyance non-sufferers experience at the same noises; prompting a fight of flight response (aka: hyperarousal) in sufferers.
That is to say: my brain processes your pen clicking as a threat to my survival. The overwhelming urge to punch someone in the mouth and/or to flee is typical.
Undiagnosable conditions
Misophonia sounded to me like one of the many undiagnosable conditions plaguing the species, such as “picky nose syndrome” or “bigotty mouth disease.” Only a few small studies had been carried out, but the media did its amplification trick turning my family WhatsApp into an echo-chamber of suggestions that perhaps I wasn’t just a tetchy feck and I had this thing all along!
But I was a tetchy feck, and a sceptic. If only two or three studies had shown correlations in the neurobiology of self-professed misophonia sufferers*, then dozens of studies with negative results would either have never made print or would have been published in low-tier journals that responsibly publish negative results and, for their service to science, go utterly ignored.
No, no. Keeping ear-plugs to hand as a diabetic keeps insulin is merely a writerly quirk. Escaping my house in a robe and slippers because of a ticking extractor fan shows my respect for Edgar Allen Poe. Getting off buses and trams and trains mid-journey and fleeing restaurants mid-meal is mad-hat creative spontaneity! Dreaming about being able to afford soundproofing only to wake up because my partner’s heart is beating uncivilly loudly is … passion?
Forcing the orchestra to pause the rehearsal until my laughing fit is under control (a chronically flat pizzicato is all it takes to set me off, weeping) is because we sound either hysterical or intolerable! Besides, all genius-types are prone to such irascibilities. Marcel Proust lined the walls of his bedroom with cork to dampen the noise! … until he developed an allergy to cork. …
Responsive relationship
So how does having this hypochonhypersensitive ear effect my writing life? What habits have I developed on account of or in response to this relationship with the aural?
I Like the Sound of Orange, Which Rhymes with Nothing
Whenever I teach, I play “background noise” soundtracks during all reading and writing exercises. At first, students think this is weird and even rude and contrived, potentially fascist, and it is … in that it’s non-negotiable.
They’ll be less conscious of the silence before their pen finally hits the page, I promise. There is truth in that.
(Another truth is that writing begets pen-clicking and knees jiggling beneath desks, chaffing jeans). Carefully modulated ambient noise, I tell them, is scientifically proven to enhance concentration, cognition and creative processes.
I don’t cite the one article I know, as it’s from the Journal of Consumer Research, and creativity can be consumed but it cannot be manufactured. I quote the abstract to sound authoritative:
Results from five experiments demonstrate that a moderate (70 dB) versus low (50dB) level of ambient noise enhances performance on creative tasks … Process measures reveal that a moderate rate (vs. low) level of noise increases processing difficulty, inducing a higher construal level and thus promoting abstract processing, which subsequently leads to higher creativity.
