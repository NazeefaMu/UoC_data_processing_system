Kandy SC unconvincing in first outing

It is usually difficult to draw any conclusions from the result of the first game at any major tournament because it does not prove a true indication. Any way reigning league champions Kandy Sports Club did everything possible to beat CH & FC winning 23-6. Rugbywise It was a disappointing game for both teams. The Kandy fans who filled the stands in their numbers, expected a better performance, but they would have been much happier to see their club winning by a bigger margin. Last season in their opening game against CH & FC they scored a 96-0 victory.
The match ended as it began, with Kandy SC maintaining their favorites tag but had to toil to record this win. Kandy SC players under the leadership of Gayan Weeraratne entered the field with vigor and determination writ on their faces. The game's first points came within the first 34 minutes with a penalty. The second half was expected to be exciting but to the surprise of spectators it was once again sloppy rugby by both sides and the game ended in victory for the visitors who were searching for a try in what seemed to be a very long final minutes as the game was played in semi darkness. The match was called off seven minutes before the long whistle. In the last quarter of the game, few players forgot their rugby rules which resulted in unwanted brawls and two yellow cards shown by referee Dinka Peries to Mohammad Rifkhan of CH&FC and Heshan Silva of Kandy SC. There was a spectator who invaded the field wanting to sort out the brawl. Sad that the host team had not taken measures to stall spectators from invading the field which could have led to ugly incidents. Earlier in the second half of the game Nigel Ratwatte of Kandy SC who came in mid of the second half of play was the first player for the season to be shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle.
The game started with the teams being introduced to the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, a keen rugby fan and whose son was captaining the host team. Seated next to the former President in the grand stand was Kandy Sports Club Trustee 'Mr. Rugby' Malik Samarawickrama, CH & FC president Shammi Silva and two Kandy SC committee members Mahesh Weerasinghe and Janaka Pathirana. Being the season’s opening game, Kandy should have been better attuned particularly as reigning champions and added strength and confidence to the team.
In the entire match, Kandy SC dominated possession and territorial advantage but failed to convert all this possession into points. However they are sure to do well in the rest of the matches. Although Kandy SC did improve on line-outs, as they knew they had to, winning there share and even stealing a two or three from the CH & FC, Kandy SC should certainly be looking to improve on ball handling in their next outing.
The Kandy SC recorded 10 ball handling errors, three of which came from the backs and rest by the forwards, the handling errors all seemed to come within CH & FC territory and stalled the Kandy SC from breaching the defence and scoring more points. Altogether, Kandy SC missed nearly seven scoring opportunities that came their way. The speed and strength of the CH & FC allowed them to keep continuous pressure on the Kandy SC side and, in the end, the defending champions didn't have enough juice left in the tank to motor to a more convincing victory.
