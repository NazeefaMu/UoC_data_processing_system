The winners’ UK visit coincides with the launch of the Study UK Alumni Awards 2019 – open to recent alumni of UK universities living in any country outside the UK.
The Study UK Alumni Awards celebrate and showcase the impact and value of a UK higher education and raise the international profile of UK alumni, their former universities, and the whole of UK education. Award winners and finalists are leaders in their fields who have used their experience of studying at a UK university to make a positive contribution to their communities, industries and countries.
