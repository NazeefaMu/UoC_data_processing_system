New type of petrol in experimental stage: Minister Ranatunga

A new type of petrol will be introduced to benefit three wheeler drivers and motorists, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
He said experiments are being conducted in this regard.
“We reluctantly increased the price of fuel. I’m aware of the problems caused to the public by this. We are carrying out new experiments to provide benefits to the public in another way. We decided to introduce a new type of petrol for trishaws and motorists. We hope the experiments would be successful,” the minister said.
He was speaking at a ceremony to handover 13 appointment letters to engineers, at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) premises, recently.
“The CPC is like the heart of the country. Our country has a 50-year-old refinery. We are still able to maintain it because of the engineers. We are carrying out a cleaning process in the refinery once in every three years. We need everyone’s co-operation for the betterment of the CPC by using new technology and new thinking,” CPC Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said.
Petroleum Resources Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe and CPSTL Managing Director Neil Jayasekara participated.
