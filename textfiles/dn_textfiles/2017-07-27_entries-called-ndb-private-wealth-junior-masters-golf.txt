Entries called for NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf

Registrations are underway for the NDB Private Wealth Management (PWM) Junior Masters Golf Championships 2017.
Hosted by expert financial planner NDB Wealth, this tournament is now in its third year. Over 80 junior golfers of all ages signed on to participate in 2016.
Scheduled for August 18, the NDB PWM Junior Masters Golf Championships 2017 can be entered in person by visiting the tournament's registration desk at the Royal Colombo Golf Course, which will remain open from 7.00 am daily until entries close on August 14. Entries can also be facilitated by calling (0714308017) or emailing ([email protected]) Shehani Dharmakirti at NDB Wealth.
Categories at the NDB PWM Junior Masters Golf Championships 2017 will mirror those applicable to the National Junior Golf Rankings, which is an initiative of the SLGU in partnership with NDB Wealth.
The National Junior Golf Rankings foster junior golf in Sri Lanka, with junior golfers ranking being based on their performance at prior designated tournaments. These rankings comprise a Gold age group of 15 to 17, a Silver age group of 12 to 14, a Bronze age group of 10 to 11 and a Copper age group of 9 years and below.
Commenting on this increasingly popular tournament, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, "The perfect mix of commitment, planning, foresight, calculation and ambition, junior golf embodies the discipline and precision vital for exemplary financial planning. For the third year running, NDB Wealth will host a large group of junior golfers at the PWM Junior Masters Golf Championships, offering them the opportunity to improve their
game by competing against the very best young local talent. We encourage those from Sri Lanka, and abroad, to sign up and see how they fare against Sri Lanka's finest junior golfers.”
