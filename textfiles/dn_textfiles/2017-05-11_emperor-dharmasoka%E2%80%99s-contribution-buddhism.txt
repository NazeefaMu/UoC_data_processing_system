Emperor Dharmasoka’s contribution to Buddhism

King Dharmashoka was an ancient Indian Emperor who ruled the entire Indian Sub continent from 268 BC to 232 BC.In about 240 BC Asoka waged a relentless and bitterly contested war against the State of Kalinga which he captured with the military acumen and immense skills he possessed.
The Kalinga war took place 8 years after his coronation. The battle caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and about 200,000 people. He earned the name Chanda Ashoka as he was a ruthless king who spared no pains in inflicting torture against those who defied. When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest rejoicing in, he was mentally shaken and wanted to appease his mind from the atrocities unleashed during this war.
Discussion
He was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved. After seeing the pious figure of Bhikku Nigroda( who was already an “arahant”) who was going about looking for food as usual with his bowl, the king was moved by the serene gait of the bhiKku and invited him to the palace. Bhikku Nigroda who had already attained the state of “Arahantship” at the age of seven ,visited the palace for his morning “Pinda Patha” with the bowl in his hand not knowing why the king beckoned him to the palace.
The discussion he had with Nigroda “Samanera “was the turning point for the transformation of his psyche from one of hostility to compassion for the humankind..He was enlightened about the meaningless wars he waged and the untold misery he brought upon the people at large. The king decided that he should henceforth lead a riotous life and dedicate himself to the spread of Buddha Dhamma.
Beginning about 263 BC he embraced Buddhism and provided state patronage for the propagation of Buddha Dhamma across Asia and established monuments referred to as famous Asoka pillars marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. He regarded Buddhism as a doctrine that could serve as a vehicle to usher in peace around the world which will ultimately lead to political and cultural unity and stability.
kindness
One of the more endearing legacies of King Ashoka was the model he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and state and he was seen as a role model to leaders with in the Buddhist community. The edicts of Ashoka inscribed in the Ashokan Pillars indicate the faith he had in Buddhism. In one edict he condemns rituals and Vedic animal sacrifices. In another he proclaims himself as an “upasaka”bereft of mundane desires and expressing kindness and well being for all.
As a Buddhist Ashoka believed that Buddhism is beneficial to all human beings fauna and flora. So he embarked on a programme to build Sangaramayas, viharas, chetiyas and temples for the Buddhist monks all over south and Central Asia. He had ordered the construction of 84000 Asokan pillars to coincide with the 84000 Dhamma sermons of the Buddha. Asoka also sent many prominent emissaries to modern Kashmir, Afganistan, Syria, Persia, Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Turkey, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam to spread the message of Buddhism.
His devotion to Buddhism is amply demonstrated in banning the killing and hunting of animals for food.
The above meritorious acts of king Asoka towards the cause of Buddhist revival are ample evidence for the faith he developed for the Buddha Dhamma and this background only propelled him to send his son and daughter to Sri Lanka to propagate the noble Dhamma. Questions may be asked if King Dharmashoka declined to send his son and daughter at that time what would have happened to the religious awakening that followed.
His cordial relationship with King Devanam Piyatissa would no doubt have been a binding force to send the two children. Nevertheless we must not forget that King Dharmashoka’s kind and magnanimous gesture only paved the way for Mahinda Thera followed by his sister with a Bo sapling to land in this country.
