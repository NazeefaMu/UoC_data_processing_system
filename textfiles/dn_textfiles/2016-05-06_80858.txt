Seevali Samarasekera was an outstanding ruggerite

 Former Trinity skipper Seevali Samarasekera, (better known as Sam) first came into limelight when he scored a match winning try for Trinity against Royal in 1969 in the Bradby Shield Rugger match played at Longdon Place, Colombo. He made a 50 yard sizling run beating a host of defenders to get that match winning try. In the same year he was invited by Kandy Coach Denzil Kobbekaduwa to play for Kandy against Havelocks which consisted of players like Glen Vanlangenberg, Japana Jayawardena, Jeff and Dan Rutnam, Mark Sunderalingam, Tyronne Holdenbottle, Jeyer Rodriguesz, Royden de Silva, Gogi Tillekeratne and Mazahir Sourjah a virtual national team. Sam scored the only try after receiving a pass from No. 8 Gamini Udugama to beat Havelocks 11-8 In the Clifford Cup semi Finals which enabled them to come to the finals. Kandy lost to CR and FC 6-12 in the finals. He captained Trinity in 1970 in which year they won both Bradby Shield matches against Royal by 19-3 and 16-12.
Sam was selected to the Sri Lanka team under Hadji Omar along with players like Y. C. Chang, Didacus de Almeida, Anton Benedict, Daya Jayasundera to name a few. He played as Centre against ‘Bosuns’ and Paris University. He played Club Rugby for almost a decade and was known for his scorching runs and terrific Tackles. He was a tower of strength to all the sides he played and a master when it comes to tactics and statistics.
He said that he learnt a lot from his Coaches, Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Kavan Rambukwella, Mohan Sahayam and Maurice Perera. He was all praise for players like Anton Benedict, Didacus de Almeida, Charles Wijewardena, Daya Jayasundera, Michael Jayasekera, Y. C. Chang, Priyantha Ekanayake, Nalaka Weerakkody and Indrajith Bandaranayake.
Sam was in the Police as Sub Inspector from 1972 to 1977 and was in the Clifford cup winning team for a number of years. After leaving Police he joined Kandy Sports Club again in 1978 and played for Kandy SC under Irwin Howie in the president’s Trophy final against Havelcoks which they lost 4-10. He wishes both Royal and Trinity teams best of luck for this year’s Bradby Shield return match on May 14.
