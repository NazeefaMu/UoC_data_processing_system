“This award validates our efforts in making JIT a great employer. We continuously aim at igniting and empowering the company spirit to create a high performance organization as part of our strategic objectives. Excellence in the organizational objectives and stimulating people to achieve high performance, where individuals realize they have accountabilities and obligations to themselves as well as the organization is fundamental to company growth and being resilient in the face of continuous change. This is our mantra for success,” said Sherene Goonetileke, Head of Legal and Human Resources.
