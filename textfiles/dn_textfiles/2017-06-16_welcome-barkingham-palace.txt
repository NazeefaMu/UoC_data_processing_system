Welcome to Barkingham Palace

A British design company has launched the world’s most luxurious dog houses which cost as much as a staggering £170,000. The fancy handcrafted ‘dog manors’ have smart technology fitted to allow owners to adjust the temperature as needed and even come with treat dispensers, televisions and a conference calling system.
Each house is split into two rooms, a living room and a bedroom, and is constructed using high quality woods, marble and aluminium.
It takes Cheshire-based design company Hecate Verona almost four months to build each dog manor from their range, which includes the Colonial Villa, Roman Imperial Mansion and Spanish Palacio.
The luxury dog properties are built with the size of the dog that will live there in mind, including having the windows positioned depending on their height to allow them a clear view of their territory.
Prices start from around £30,000, with fully-equipped and high-end models costing up to almost £170,000.
Miss Williams said dogs are considered a part of our families and as such deserved a home as grand as their owners.
She said: “I started working on my dog manors after I began asking myself why a dog house shouldn’t be as elegant and beautiful as its owners’.
“Our objective now is to create majestic and royal looking homes for dogs, while seeking to compliment the garden and surroundings it stands in.
“The customers we have worked with typically have their dogs living indoors, but we see the dog manors as a way of providing their pets the comforts of indoor living while making the experience of being outside more enjoyable.
“It leads to the dog enjoying being outdoors even more and staying more active, which is highly recommended by vets.” Mirror
