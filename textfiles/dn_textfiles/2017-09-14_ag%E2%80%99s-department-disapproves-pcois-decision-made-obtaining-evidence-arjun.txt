AG’s Department disapproves PCoIs decision made on obtaining evidence from Arjun Aloysius

 
Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said that the Attorney General’s Department does not agree with the decision made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) regarding obtaining evidence from former Perpetual Treasuries Director Arjun Aloysius.
The PCoI observed yesterday that if Aloysius is unwilling or refuses to give evidence; his counsel is entitled to make an application to the commission to the effect that an accused cannot be compelled to give evidence.
The PCoI made this decision yesterday after summoning Arjun Alloysius to record a statement.
However earlier today, Arjun Aloysius’s council submitted an application refusing to be compelled to provide evidence.
