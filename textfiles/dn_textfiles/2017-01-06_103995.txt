Economy was at ICU, can be transferred to OPD soon: Ravi

The country’s economy was at the ICU when we took office, but it has been recovering over the past two years and it can be soon transferred to the OPD, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister made this comment with reference to a recent comment by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy that ‘the country’s economy was not in the ICU, but at the hospital’.
“Yes, the economy was at the ICU when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the country to us. The Central Bank Governor was an attendant at the ICU then. With the prudent economic policy of the government, we will soon restore the ailing economy. The country’s development should be carried forward the way the President, the Prime Minister and the government want, and not the way the Central Bank wants. Our fiscal policy is a success. The monetary policy should be handled by an independent body to support what the government wants,” he said. “I am surprised of what the Governor had said, but I think most of the media distorted his statement,” Karunanayake noted.
The minister also vowed to expose the shady deals in the Central Bank by a handful of close associates of former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal before long, stating that some of those officials were still at play.
