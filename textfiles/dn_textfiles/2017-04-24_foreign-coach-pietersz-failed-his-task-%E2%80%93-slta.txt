Foreign coach Pietersz failed in his task – SLTA

The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) said that the foreign coach Eric Pietersz, whom they had got down to form and train a national pool had failed in his task and they had decided to terminate his contract.
“We started in February, 2016 with 36 players who were the three top seeded players of U-12, U-14 and U16 but within three months only 24 players were left in the program,” revealed SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick.
“We amended the program and gave him 63 players (U-10, U-12, U14 and U16). The new group included SL no. one Janali Manamperi (U-16), Vibudha Wijebandara (U-16), Tania Doloswala (U-12) and Apna Perera (U-12) to restart in May, but Pietersz failed again to produce the expected outcome,” he said.
“All four top seeded players left the program and by October 31, 33 players deserted the program. So as the national governing body we decided to terminate Pietersz’s services. There was no point in wasting so much money on a program that does not produce good results.
“We were promised money for Pietersz’s coaching package by the Sports Ministry before we started the program, but we did not get a cent from the Ministry. Thereby SLTA and the parents had to bear Pietersz’s monthly package of Rs. 800,000. If our need is not fulfilled, it is an utter waste to keep him.”
Patrick alleged that there are some influential parents who want to keep the coach just because his coaching is good for their children.
“They took this matter to the Sports Minister and we were told the minister will grant some money to carry on with the program. For this we had to provide two courts. Anyway Pietersz’s contract will end in April. We are going to convince the Sports Minister with all the stats on this matter and stop this waste of money and time,” Sohan explained.
