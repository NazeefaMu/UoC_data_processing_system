The case was to be taken up for trial yesterday, but President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty withcounsel Hafeel Farisz appearing for Aluthgamage, moved court that the case be fixed for a new trial date since the defence was yet to receive a copy of a written complaint made by the third witness Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Counsel Hafeel Farisz appearing for Aluthgamage, moved court that the case be fixed for a new trial date since defence was yet to receive a copy of a written complaint made by the third witness Wasantha Samarasinghe.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing for the Attorney General told court that defence was asking a document which had not been listed in the indictments. He said that there is no legal basis to consider this request and complained that the defence is attempting to postpone trial.
Accordingly, High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne decided to commence trial proceedings from next date and the Attorney General was directed to submit documents at issue prior to the trial. The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,000,000, misappropriated Rs. 1,900,000, and misappropriated another Rs. 1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October 2012 and April, 2013. The Attorney General charged that Aluthgamage had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code, listed 13 persons as witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
