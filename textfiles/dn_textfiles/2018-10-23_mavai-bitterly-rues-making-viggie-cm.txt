Mavai bitterly rues making Viggie CM

Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) leader, the main partner of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Parliamentarian Mavai Senathirajah said he and his party (ITAK) has undergone suffering for nearly five years because the TNA had made C.V. Vigneswaran the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council.
Addressing a meeting held in the Mullaitivu District, Senathirajah said they had committed a sin by bringing Vigneswaran into politics from the TNA. Senadhiraja said he himself was largely responsible for committing that sin.
Senathirajah said that Vigneswaran had made an allegation against the TNA in the last few days. It was Vigneswaran and Gajendra Ponnambalam who told them to reject the interim report on the new Constitution.
That was because Vigneswaran did not wish to see the TNA resolving this problem. Although Vigneswaran claimed to be a former Judge, he himself had a contempt of court case against him. However, they would soon announce their political course of action regarding Vigneswaran and he would request the people to have patience till then.
