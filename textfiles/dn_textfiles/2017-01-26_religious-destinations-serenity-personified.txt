Religious Destinations: Serenity personified

Branching off from the Colombo - Galle Highway, a few yards away from the Dehiwala Municipality, located in a central position is Pinwatta Purana Viharaya.
The 'Pinwatta Pinbima' as the name suggests, is a well-known temple beaming with religious fervor where Sinhala Buddhist culture is kept alive and continues to nourish.
This is a well-renowned ancient temple, rich in tradition making a valuable contribution to Buddhists in and around Dehiwala. It continues to be greatly admired today for the service it renders in diverse ways. All the requisites of a temple are found within its premises. The solidly constructed decorative entrance with a sense of cultural identity and the Buddha statue in front invites you to an atmosphere of worship.
Wave of change
The present Nayaka Thera Ven. Walhaputenne Nandasumana has created a wave of change, adding essential requisites for the functioning of the temple which has grown tremendously popular in all aspects.
Within the premises, it has a multitude of buildings. As you enter, on the right is the Dhamma Salawa replacing the old one. The foundation was laid by late Ven Kuruwita Padumasiri Thera. The planning was later continued by the Ven Nayaka Thera retired from Ananda College, Colombo, where he rendered a great service in organizing Buddhist activities. He went ahead with the completion of the building replete with a well ventilated and spacious hall for the comfort of devotees for their monthly sil campaigns and other religious events. Upstairs is utilized for the Dhamma School and for offering alms to sil observers on Poya days. His next attempt was the construction of the Sanghawasa.
A few yards away from the Dhamma Salawa is the newly built Sanghawasa – a remarkable achievement. Devout Buddhists rose to the occasion and gave financial assistance to the Nayaka Thera to carry out this great mission. With their donations, he was gloriously successful in constructing this honoured place for the Sangha. The Saghawasa, built combining the old and new styles merging with the landscape is the residence for monks who focus their attention to the religious welfare of the people under the guidance of the Ven Nayaka Thera. The other places are the chaitya and the sacred Bo Tree. The age old chaitya is set in the centre of the temple compound. The only thing missing was the 'Ranveta' encircling the historic Bo Maluwa to the left of the ancient Vihara Geya.
Bodhiya with Ranveta
His next task was to put up a Ranveta (a golden fence) around the Bo maluwa with the support of the Dayaka Sabha and well-wishers. The Nayaka Thera performed the honoured task. The Buddha statue which was already there behind the Bodhiya with its branches spreading out is stunningly serene. The Ranveta is built surrounding the sacred Bo tree. The lower wall of the golden railing is decorated with sculptures including scenes of events from the life of the Buddha. A serene statue of Sanghamitta is also found there. Finally, the most striking feature is the neatly and solidly built seating provisions for the devotees to perform Bodhi Poojas, at their convenience. The other important feature is that the entire premises is kept meticulously clean.
Dhamma school
The historic temple also plays a vital role in making a tremendous contribution to religious education. The temple is of special significance as an ideal Dhamma school attracting parents as a place for their offspring to be good citizens with excellent discipline. One can ensure that the future generation who come under the influence of the Sangha here, will uphold religious values and human dignity.
Sri Upananda Daham Vidyalaya, named after the founder is said to be one of the best Dhamma schools in Dehiwala renowned for its standards. At present, the school headed by the Nayaka Thera with a large, qualified staff, renders a great service to a large number of students in and around Dehiwala. The prize giving held annually is an outstanding event put into action in perfect order. They perform perfectly exhibiting their talents. The commemoration of the 60th anniversary at its annual prize giving was held on January 25, 2015. It was a historic event and an important milestone.
Pious Pirivena
Named after the founder Ven Sri Sumanatissa Thera in the mid 20th century is the other most important institution, the pirivena. The creation of a true Buddhist monk is the ultimate objective and this is home to many a pupil who comes from distant areas. The Nayaka Thera has played a unique role in inculcating Buddhist moral values in the Sangha. Foremost is the discipline, care and sympathy towards the Bhikkus-to-be, especially the younger Bhikkus. The temple provides a vast array of benefits in a serene atmosphere. Senior Bhikkus who have received ordination give much support and strength to the Nayaka Thera in all Dhamma activities.
One can see how the temple progressed under different Theras. The founding of the temple is attributed to Ven Upananda Thera and his pupils, late Ven Kahawatuduwa Hemasiri Thera and Ven Kuriwita Padumasiri Thera, the steadfast monks who continued to upkeep the place as best as possible since its inception.
