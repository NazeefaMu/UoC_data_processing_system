Parliamentarians’ angst with a new edge

Worldwide, it appears that parliamentarians are struggling to meet the ever growing expectations of citizens. Data suggests that citizens hold parliamentarians to account principally for the services that they are able to deliver outside parliament, not for their law-making role or their ability to oversee the Executive.
Constituency service is the general term for what parliamentarians do to serve and represent the interests of their constituents. Constituency service exists in many different forms, both in constituency-based electoral systems and also in list-based systems. Discussions with parliamentarians show the extent to which their capacity to deliver is being stretched to the limit, and might be taking them away from their parliamentary duties.
On the contrary, it’s a pity to see that some of the honourable Members of Parliament elected by the people do not make use of the August Assembly to speak good and bad of the government.
They make it a stage outside parliament to speak the same matter and entirely different and contradictory points then. It is to mislead people who elect them or are they thinking people are not brave enough to understand what calibre they are?
There are so many to do and speak of the burning agonies to solve when they meet their kith and kin, the loyal voters, instead of talking rubbish.
