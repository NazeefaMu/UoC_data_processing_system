Navy apprehends six men harvesting sea cucumbers

Navy personnel attached to the Northern Naval Area arrested six men while they were harvesting sea cucumbers by employing illegal fishing methods in the seas off Point Pedro yesterday.
The Navy personnel seized 280 sea cucumbers, six diving masks, five pairs of diving fins, five regulators, four diving torches, 20 oxygen bottles and two FGDs along with the suspects.
The arrested and the seized equipment were handed over to the Fisheries Inspector, Point Pedro for further action, the Navy media unit said.
