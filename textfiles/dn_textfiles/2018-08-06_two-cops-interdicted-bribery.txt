Two cops interdicted for bribery

Two constables who were alleged to have taken a bribe of Rs.5,000 from a foreigner were interdicted, Galle Police Superintendent’s office said.
The Constables who were attached to the Habaraduwa police had been on duty at Palutagaha Junction, Talpe, in Habaraduwa on August 1, when around 4.30 pm they stopped a motorcycle ridden by a foreigner.
Officers had found that the foreigner was without a valid riding licence and claimed a bribe of Rs.5,000 to release him without a fine to which the foreigner had agreed and paid. He had informed this incident to the manageress of the hotel he was staying. She had told the police officer that the foreigner was prepared to settle the case without complaining to the police provided the money taken would be returned.
The constables had returned the money taken as a bribe from the foreigner at the hotel. Hotel’s CCTV camera’s had recorded the constables handing back the money. The footage was given to a TV channel which telecast it over their news bulletin.
