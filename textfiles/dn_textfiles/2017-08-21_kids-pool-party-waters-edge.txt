Kids Pool Party at Waters Edge

The “Kids Pool Party” will be held on August 27 at the Waters Edge poolside. The event is sponsored by Velona Cuddles.
A host of fun, water-based activities and games are being put together by Party Fun Entertainment. Waters slides, bouncers and air-filled floaters will keep your kids occupied for hours splashing around in the pool. There will even be kid’s jet skis for an added thrill. The fun will only increase with music, pool games and swimming competitions. Don’t forget to send lots of sunscreen, a towel and dry clothes.
All that fun in the water can work up quite an appetite and the award-winning culinary team at Waters Edge will pull out all stops to ensure that the kids are well-fed. An extensive buffet with party food like hotdogs, chips, burgers and tons of sweet goodies will be available to tuck in to all evening long. Kids and adults can also savour treats from many live cooking stations.
