Uva Chief Minister defends himself

Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Dassanayake declared that he would resign from his post if anyone is eligible enough to disprove the statement he made yesterday that a majority of graduate posts are granted by the Uva Provincial Council.
The Chief Minister revealed information about the issue that has emerged due to a complaint made against the graduates who passed an examination held by the Public Service Commission of Uva Province refraining them from getting posts by the graduates who did not pass the examination.
“The Uva Province had been able to secure good results with a record of island’s fourth place in the Grade Five Scholarship examinations this year. It is an achievement for the entire Uva Province. Today, the education of Thanamalwila, Siyabalanduwa and Sewanagala areas had been nourished. Also, we have been able to attain 180 Science Faculty posts,” said the Minister.
“A new principal has been appointed for Amilagama School which was closed for a long period. Now at least five students are participating in the scholarship examinations and four of them have managed to pass the exam. Soragune School which was also a school with insufficient facilities is now an active school and had been able to obtain 13 passes at the Grade Five Scholarship examinations with good results in the Ordinary Level Examinations as well,” he said.
“I have been to about 600 schools in both Badulla and Moneragala districts and know of the problems that the schools, students and the teachers face. Not only agriculture, but also the economy of the villagers is equally important to us. But to keep it balanced, it is mandatory that teachers are appointed to village schools. There are certain schools without teachers in Uva Province. The appointed teachers ask for a change of workplace right after they are appointed to schools in Haldumulla, Kumarathanna or Velanvita. Therefore, I request ministers not to accommodate this,” he added.
“If the graduates who have passed the examinations are given the chance to be appointed, I am ready to appoint them anytime and I highly appreciate if the complaint would be taken off by the other graduates who were did not pass the examinations,” the minister further stated.
He then pointed out that he had appointed development officers and posts for graduates for the last two years and stated that the focus should be on solving legal matters and granting graduate posts furthermore.
