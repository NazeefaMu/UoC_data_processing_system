Maldives International  Education and Career  Expo begins March 30

The Maldives International Education and Career Expo will be held for three consecutive days on March 30, 31 and April 1, 2017 in Male.
The event is the only exhibition focused for the education sector in Maldives and will be patronized by keen students who have clear intentions on furthering their education in Sri Lanka or overseas.
A highlight at this edition will be the offering of over 50 scholarships for students to study overseas. Scholarships ranging from 50% to full free scholarships will be offered by the participating institutes and organizers.
Maldives International Education & Career Expo 2017 is seen as a central platform by students to pursue their education. There will be over 50 exhibition stalls displaying and informing the general public of various courses, student programs, higher education options and job opportunities.
The exhibition is jointly organized by Maldives Exhibition and Conference Services together with Asaree Services of Maldives. Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services will be strategically involved with its Maldivian partners. This joint venture will enhance the image of the exhibition to be a “must attend” event for all.
The event is the best opportunity for students who are looking for immediate opportunities to further their education.
The three day education fair is set to feature specific pavilions for visiting universities and will include special sessions focused on students and their career decisions with the participation of a host of top Professionals.
Education is indeed the bedrock for the future success of a youth, a country and a generation. It is an undeniable truth that a sound secondary and tertiary education would most certainly pave a path of greater success for the individual and society at large.
This truth has been ingrained in citizens of Maldives to whom education is considered of prime importance.
