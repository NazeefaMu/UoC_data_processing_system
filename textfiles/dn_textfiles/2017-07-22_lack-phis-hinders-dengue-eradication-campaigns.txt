Lack of PHIs hinders dengue eradication campaigns

The Puttalam district has only 49 Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) but the district needs over 86 PHIs. The Kurunegala district has a shortage of 14 PHIs.
The inadequate public health officers is a main reason for aggravating the dengue menace and other mosquito-related diseases in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts.
At present the NWP deploys PHIs from other districts to cover up the shortage. Sri Lanka PHIS’ Association President Upul Rohana said the shortage of PHIs has created severe problems in dengue eradication programmes in many districts.
