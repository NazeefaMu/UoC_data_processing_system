SriLankan wins  ‘Innovation in Commercial  Airline Cabins’ Award

SriLankan Airlines added yet another prestigious award to its impressive list of recent global airline industry accolades when it won the ‘Innovation in Commercial Airline Cabins’ award at the In-flight Asia Pacific Awards in Singapore on 1st November.
Siva Ramachandra, SriLankan's Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We are delighted to win this award, which recognizes excellence in innovation of passenger cabins. This award is an extremely valuable one since the highlighted cabin / seat design was developed using our in house talents.”
The nominated cabin design highly impressed the panel of judges comprised industry experts who are well versed with all of the aspects of aircraft cabins.
The innovative features of SriLankan's cabins included A330-300 Business Class flat-bed seats, A330-300 Economy Class seat fabric design and bulkhead designs inspired by the natural beauty of Sri Lanka.
The Sinharaja rain forest, a world heritage site in Sri Lanka is home to endemic and endangered flora and fauna which are woven into the Economy seat fabric design in shades of blue and aquamarine.
The cabin ambience is further enhanced with the mood lighting, recreating a beautiful tropical sunrise, flowing from the back of the cabin to the front to wake up before breakfast is served. For evening flights we emulate a typical Sri Lankan “fairy sky” sunsets which transcends to sleep with the sparkling of stars in the night sky creating a unique passenger experience.
