Hasrath Munasinghe receives CMO Asia council felicitation for marketing

Senior marketing professional and brand builder Hasrath Munasinghe was presented a special felicitation for contributions made to the Sri Lankan marketing discipline at the Sri Lanka Marketing, HR and CSR Leadership Awards presented by the CMO Asia Council at a gala event in Colombo last week.
Munasinghe, currently Deputy General Manager Marketing at Commercial Bank of Ceylon, counts 23 years in the fields of marketing, sales, sustainability and CSR, 14 of which have been in senior management positions.
He is a Trustee of the Commercial Bank CSR Trust, which is responsible for an extensive and multifaceted portfolio of nationally-scaled community initiatives.
“I have always believed that it is important for marketers to have their feet on the street and have the pulse of the people. They must be versatile, agile, deeply intuitive and passionate about what they do, and be genuinely committed to responsible and ethical brand building,” Munasinghe said.
“I am honoured to receive this award as an acknowledgment that my contribution to the sphere of marketing has been meaningful and worthy of recognition.”
The holder of nine professional and academic qualifications including two masters degrees from the Universities of Moratuwa (MSc in IT) and the University of Southern Queensland, Australia (MBA), and a Post Graduate Diploma in Marketing from the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) UK, Hasrath Munasinghe has the distinction of being the youngest Sri Lankan to achieve both FCIM-UK and FSLIM status.
His career as a marketer and brand builder has encompassed diverse sectors such as electronic media, advertising, personal care and mobile telecommunications prior to his current position in banking.
