Hawaii judge blocks Trump's latest travel ban

 
A federal judge in Hawaii has blocked President Donald Trump's revised travel ban one day before it was set to take effect.
Judge Derrick Watson said the travel ban -- Trump's third version of the policy -- "plainly discriminates based on nationality.
" The President's executive order "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States,'" Watson wrote.
The second version of the travel ban, issued in March, had barred residents of six Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
The new restrictions that were set to take effect Wednesday cover eight countries -- Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen. Tuesday's ruling does not impact the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the ruling "dangerously flawed."
"The entry restrictions in the proclamation apply to countries based on their inability or unwillingness to share critical information necessary to safely vet applications, as well as a threat assessment related to terrorism, instability, and other grave national security concerns," Sanders said in a statement.
Judges turn to extreme remedy to block Trump administration Judge Derrick Watson said the travel ban -- Trump's third version of the policy -- "plainly discriminates based on nationality."
The President's executive order "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States,'" Watson wrote. The second version of the travel ban, issued in March, had barred residents of six Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
The Justice Department will "appeal in an expeditious manner," spokesman Ian Prior said.
"Today's ruling is incorrect, fails to properly respect the separation of powers, and has the potential to cause serious negative consequences for our national security."
Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin celebrated the order. The state has been fighting each version of the travel ban.
"This is the third time Hawaii has gone to court to stop President Trump from issuing a travel ban that discriminates against people based on their nation of origin or religion," Chin said in a statement.
"Today is another victory for the rule of law. We stand ready to defend it."
