Star-studded dual drama!

Last week, political circles buzzed with the news that Galle district parliamentarian and famed actress Geetha Kumarasinghe was declared ineligible to be a Member of Parliament, as she was also a dual citizen. This followed a decision by the Court of Appeal, where a petition was lodged challenging her election to Parliament.
It is well known that Kumarasinghe, though elected from the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) is loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Many interpreted the legal action against Kumarasinghe as one more instance of sniping against the JO by the government.
Kumarasinghe’s ouster from Parliament is a sequel to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which, ironically, was finally endorsed by the JO as well and was passed with a two-thirds majority in the legislature.
Article 91 of Sri Lanka’s Constitution specifies disqualifications for election as a Member of Parliament and lists under clause 91 (1) (d), twelve circumstances under which individuals may be disqualified from functioning as a Member of Parliament. The 19th Amendment added a thirteenth, “a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country”.
Kumarasinghe, who is also a Swiss national, maintains that she had revoked her Swiss citizenship by writing to the Swiss embassy. However, the Court of Appeal held that revoking citizenship is a far more complex process than merely writing a letter to the embassy of the relevant country and disqualified Kumarasinghe of her parliamentary seat.
More drama was to follow. Kumarasinghe, known for defiant, outspoken roles on the silver screen was equally rebellious in real life. She proclaimed her innocence and maintained that she will continue as a Member of Parliament for the Galle district.
This was Kumarasinghe’s second attempt to enter Parliament. She first contested the general elections in 2010 nursing the constituency of Bentara-Elpitiya, when fellow actress Malani Fonseka entered Parliament on the SLFP National List.
Court of Appeal verdict
Kumarasinghe however was not as lucky as she did not poll sufficient preference votes, despite the UPFA electing seven out of the ten parliamentarians from the Galle district. In Kumarasinghe’s own constituency of Bentara-Elpitiya, the UPFA polled 68 per cent of the vote. At the time Kumarasinghe cried foul, saying election irregularities deprived her of a win.
At the 2015 August general elections, Kumaratunga was more fortunate. She polled 63,955 preference votes and was placed fifth, second only to Chandima Weerakkody, Ramesh Pathirana, Nishantha Muthuhettigama and Manusha Nanayakkara. However her citizenship issue has now led to the current controversy.
After the verdict of the Court of Appeal was announced, more drama was to follow. When the matter was raised in Parliament by United National Party parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was to declare that he had not been officially informed of the court decision.
However, Speaker Jayasuriya also said that he would act according to the court decision when it was conveyed to him. Kumarasinghe attended Parliament that day, met with Speaker Jayasuriya and informed the latter that she would be lodging an appeal in the Supreme Court. Kumarasinghe was planning to do so within the forty two days which is stipulated as the time period to lodge such an appeal.
That was when Kumarasinghe and the JO missed a trick. Perhaps caught up in the euphoria of its success in attracting a large crowd for its May Day rally, the JO was found napping, not lodging an appeal against the Court of Appeal verdict. That was because the verdict had then been conveyed to the Speaker and Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dissanayake had consulted the Attorney General for advice on the most suitable course of action.
Having received advice to the effect that a vacancy had been created in Parliament, Dissanayake then communicated this to the Elections Commission. That was when the mainstream SLFP swung into action and announced that Piyasena Gamage would be nominated instead of Kumarasinghe.
Holding a media briefing, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera made the announcement. Supporting him was Chandima Weerakkody, a former Deputy Speaker and also a candidate from the Galle district at the last general elections. Weerakkody was to explain that, when the Secretary General had conveyed to the Elections Commission that there was a vacancy in Parliament, Kumarasinghe had not lodged an appeal. Hence the UPFA was obliged to fill the vacancy, he said.
Kumarasinghe’s dual citizenship
Kumarasinghe rushed to lodge papers for an appeal in the Supreme Court and then hurried to the Elections Commission in Rajagiriya to inform the Commission that an appeal had been lodged but how the issue unfolds remains to be seen. Legal analysts say she may have to seek an injunction preventing the appointment of Piyasena Gamage until the determination of her appeal, if the government presses ahead with Gamage’s appointment.
As the drama over Kumarasinghe’s dual citizenship played out in courts and in Parliament, there were other concerns. There was speculation that there were other Members of Parliament who were also dual citizens. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna parliamentarian Vijitha Herath raised the issue in Parliament requesting a list of names of the dual citizens who were parliamentarians. There were reports that a government minister and another JO parliamentarian were dual citizens, he claimed arguing that the law should be equally applied to all parliamentarians and not only to Kumarasinghe.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila went one step further and formally requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of parliamentarians who held dual citizenship. Gammanpila made the request under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
The first to react to these claims was Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who emphatically doused speculation that he was a dual citizen. Samarasinghe declared that he was not a dual-citizenship holder and invited those who make such allegations to request the Foreign Affairs Minister or the Speaker to check who among the parliamentarians held dual-citizenship certificates.
“I’m 61-years-old now and never in my life ever thought of applying for dual-citizenship. I personally believe it’s immoral for a politician to be a dual citizen because a person has to pledge to uphold the Constitution of another country,” Samarasinghe stated at a media briefing.
However, for most political observers, the real impact of the verdict against Kumarasinghe is not the fate of the Galle district MP or even that of other legislators in the current Parliament. The most significant fallout from the court decision is the fate of the Rajapaksa brothers - Gotabhaya and Basil, both of whom are dual citizens, holding citizenship in the United States. Indeed, there have been accusations that the dual citizenship clause was introduced to the 19th Amendment to specifically target the Rajapaksas.
It will be recalled that, in the lead up to the 2015 Presidential Election, the then opposition made it clear that the dual citizenship clause would be introduced. It was argued that it would prevent individuals leaving Sri Lanka after corrupt practices and avoiding justice by seeking refuge in another country.
19th Amendment
With Mahinda Rajapaksa now aged seventy one and in any event debarred from running for President again because of the 19th Amendment reinstated the two-term limit for an individual, the JO’s campaign relies on another leader to take it forward. Many feel that either Basil or Gotabhaya are contenders for such a role- but the 19th Amendment effectively nullifies those prospects.
In fact, Basil Rajapaksa, the former all-powerful Minister of Economic Affairs in the previous government was asked about this. He categorically stated that he would remain a dual citizen as his family were all United States citizens and he did not wish to renounce that citizenship. He was more ambivalent when asked about Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s plans, stating they “remain to be seen”.
Thus the dual citizenship has created a conundrum for the JO it could have done without in a week where it was elated after the large turnout for its May Day rally. There will, no doubt, be many more episodes to this drama- which could well be as entertaining and memorable as the many movies Geetha Kumarasinghe has starred in.
