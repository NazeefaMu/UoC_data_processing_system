Simply-Fi  your life with Candy

Softlogic recently introduced two new products from Candy - the watch and touch oven and the Bianca washing machine to Sri Lankan consumers.
The Candy Simply-Fi Series, namely the Bianca Washing Machine and the Watch and Touch Oven are designed for today’s homes and today’s lifestyles. For the Candy Group, connectivity and continuous search for innovation are not just an opportunity for being the leader in the household appliances market, but a philosophy that has driven the strategy of the Group since 1945, when it produced the first Italian washing machine. In 2014, Candy introduced on the market Simply-Fi, the world’s first range of major, single-application, Wi-Fi connected household appliances.
“At Candy we believe in Smart innovation, but only when it’s really useful, that’s why we’ve created the smartest, most intelligent and intuitive appliances ever, namely the Candy Bianca washing machine and the Candy Watch and Touch oven,” Candy Asia Pacific, Export Area Manager - South East Asia, Massimo Poma said.
“With a strong focus on technology and innovation, the Italian based Candy Group is the only household appliance company in the world with the entire range of fully-connected next-generation products; a record that is rooted in its own DNA, that is actually simplifying the life of its consumers by providing them more and more user-friendly, innovative products” said Trade Candy Asia Pacific LTD, Marketing Manager, Joan Wong.
Wong explained that Watch and Touch oven “is indeed ‘the kitchen ‘game-changer’ and is the only oven with an all-Touch Total Control Screen door, an integral HD video camera, exclusive video recipes and 4 different cooking modes. It has even won the Red Dot Award for Product Design this year, considered to be the most important international design award, given over the years to companies of absolute excellence such as Apple, BMW, Google, Bose and the Italian Pininfarina”.
Bianca washing machine is the first washing machine with intuition and advanced features. “It is oh-so-easy to use as Bianca listens, understands consumers’ needs, and performs the most effective and most suited washing program to their specific needs. For the first time ever, you can talk to your washing machine with your smartphone, thanks to the ‘Talking Bianca’ function” Wong said.
