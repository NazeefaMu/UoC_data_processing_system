Gamamapila’s FR fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila seeking an interim order directing the Colombo Fort Magistrate to release him from remand custody, will be taken up for support before the Supreme Court on June 27.
Through his petition, Gammanpila had sought an interim order to release petitioner enlarge on bail over an inquiry relating to purchasing of shares using a Power of Attorney.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate on June 18 issued an order to remand Gammanpila till July 1.
Gammanpila had cited Inspector M.D.C.P. Gunathilake of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), SSP Mevan Silva of SIU, IGP Pujitha Jayasundara, Brian John Shaddick of New South Wales in Australia, Lasitha Indeewara Perera of Rajagiriya, J.C.P. Jayasinghe and the Attorney General as respondents.
According to the petition, the 4th respondent Brian John Shaddick is the complainant who made a complaint to the police against the petitioner.
The 4th respondent was Joint Managing Director of Australia Lanka Group along with 6th respondent J.C.P. Jayasinghe when the petitioner was the Chief Executive Officer. The 5th respondent Lasitha Indeewara Perera is the purported Power of Attorney holder of the 4th respondent.
The petitioner states that this petition relates to the arrest of the petitioner by the SIU, based on a false complaint allegedly made against the petitioner by the 3rd and 4th respondents on several transactions that took place between 1997 – 2000, in a bid to politically harass the petitioner, at the behest of the petitioner’s political opponents.
