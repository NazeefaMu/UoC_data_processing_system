Nippon Maru visits Colombo

The Nippon Maru which is deployed on a youth exchange programme, will call over at the Colombo Port today together with 242 youth from various countries.
Nippon Maru which marks its 29th visit to the country this year, sails around the world with a view to exchanging cultural values, goodwill and friendship between youth of different countries.
This programme was initiated in 1980 by the Japanese government. Sri Lanka has been a participant in the Nippon Maru programme from the inception, along with Japan, Australia, India, Mexico, Mozambic, Poland, South Africa and others. The youth aboard the ship will take part in many events and programmes in the country until Friday.
The youth will join a study tour with students of the Colombo University; 10 field visits have been scheduled. There will be a cultural show at the Maharagama Youth Centre on Friday.
