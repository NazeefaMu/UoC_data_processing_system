Cyrus working on next album

Singer Miley Cyrus has started working on her next album, before the last one, 'Younger Now' has even released.
The 24-year-old musician's sixth studio album is set to release at the end of the month but she already is busy writing the follow-up LP.
"I've been holding on to it. I wrote (the album's first song) 'Malibu' in June of last year and then put it out April/May this year. It's time. I've been holding on to it for too long!"
"I'm already working on the next one. I'm already two songs deep on the next one. I'm over this now. I want to figure out what I want to do next. Hopefully I can take some time - chill with the dogs, hand with the pigs a little bit more, take some time off. But just keep writing," Cyrus told in a radio show.
