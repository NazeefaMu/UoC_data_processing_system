Two VLGC new buildings join BW LPG’s fleet

Singapore’s gas carrier owner BW LPG Limited has taken delivery of the final two of four very large gas carriers (VLGCs) in its new building program from South Korean Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME).
The two vessels, BW Mindoro and BW Messina, feature 84,000 cbm and each have a market value of around USD 66.9 million.
Following delivery, BW LPG said that it concluded a sale and leaseback agreement for VLGC BW Messina.
The first two vessel from the batch, BW Magellan and BW Malacca, joined the company’s fleet in October 2016.
BW LPG now owns a fleet of 45 vessels, comprising 40 VLGCs and five LGCs.
In addition, the shipping firm has two VLGC new buildings under construction.
