'Strategic depopulation' of Syria likely cause of EU refugee crisis - Assange

UK: The flooding of Europe by countless waves of refugees may be the result of the "strategic depopulation" of Syria carried out by opponents of the country's government, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has suggested.
Transparency organization WikiLeaks has looked through its diplomatic cables and unearthed "an interesting speculation about the refugee movement," Assange said in an interview with Geek news site, ThePressProject.
"So, the speculation was this: Occasionally opponents of a country would engage in strategic depopulation, which is to decrease the fighting capacity of a government," he explained.
The whistleblower pointed out that "it's predominantly the middle class that is fleeing" Syria on account of having "language skills, money, some connections." Engineers, managers and civil servants are "precisely, the classes that ...[are] needed to keep the government functioning," he said.
Syrian people are encouraged to flee their country "by Germany saying they'll accept many-many refugees, and by Turkey taking nearly three million refugees, thus significantly weakening the Syrian government," Assange stressed.
Syria isn't the only case of migration being used as a weapon in recent history; during the Iraq War, Sweden told the US that "the acceptance of Iraqi refugees was part of its contribution," according to cables.
The WikiLeaks founder said that it's a "disgrace" that the US refuses to take in Syrian refuges because it's Washington who should be held accountable for the hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Europe and making EU states close its borders with one other.
