President inspects kidney hospital  construction in Polonnaruwa

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday visited the construction site of the National Kidney Hospital in Polonnaruwa to inspect the progress of work.
The proposed hospital, costing Rs. 12,000 million, is an outright gift from China in response to a request made by President Maithripala Sirisena. It will be the largest such hospital in South Asia, equipped with the most modern laboratory and high technology facilities and will cater to kidney patients in the whole country, a press release from the Presidents Media Unit said. The project which will take 24 months to complete will be ready in July 2020.
The President, who spoke to the officials present, highlighted the need to expedite the completion of the project for the benefit of innocent kidney patients in the country.
Thereafter, the President visited the Parakrama Samudra area and spent some time and proceeded to the historic Polonnaruwa sacred area to interact with the devotees present, some of whom presented their problems to him.
On June 27 night, the President undertook an observation tour of Pulathisipura Poson festivities and the Poson zone at the Kaduruwela Agro Economic Centre jointly organised by the Presidential Secretariat, Armed Forces and Police, the release said.
