PREMASARA EPASINGHE - an all rounder of our times

Rarely is a cricketer presented in such an elegant package – cricketer, coach, master-in-charge, writer, selector, commentator and author. In PREMASARA EPASINGHE we have all this rolled in and he has deservedly become legendary for his varied talents delivered with finesse. Tony Greig the former a South African and England captain and world famous cricket commentator paid PREMASARA EPASINGHE a glowing tribute calling him ‘Voice of cricket in Sri Lanka.’ No one will begrudge that.
This Old Nalandian shone in inter-school cricket debuting as wicket keeper opening batsman under one of the best batsman produced by one of the leading Buddhist institutions in the country Chandrasiri Weerasinghe, a solid and heavy scoring right hand batsman. Weerasinghe has a rare record of reeling off four centuries in a row in the 1957 inter-school cricket season. EPASINGHE remembers as a child how he fashioned his cricketing career. He say he used to throw a tennis ball against the back wall of his home and then face it, which helped take him to higher levels of the game. His cricketing idols were the greatest batsman the world has seen Sir Donald Bradman and Len Hutton, Godfrey Evans, Don Tallon and Neil Harvey.
Two of the best opening batsmen
He enjoyed a successful inter-school cricket season opening batting with two of the best opening batsmen produced by that school right handed Mithra Siriwardena and left handed Sarath Silva where he made some good scores with the highest being 79 against Dharmaraja College.
EPASINGHE was associated with Siriwardena in grand opening stand of 236 with him making 79 and Siriwardena notching up an eye catching century.
In club cricket for the University, Bank of Ceylon, Saracens and Nationalized Services, his happy hunting ground was the Colts CC ground at Havelock Park. The knock he remembers most was the 136 which he made for the Bank of Ceylon against Ceylon Insurance.
Excelling in studies
Excelling in his studies at Nalanda he passed out to the University and sported UNI colours in the same batting position and left his mark with good scores and some fantastic catches and stumpings. EPASINGHE passed out of the Vidyodaya University in 1966 obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sinhala, English, Education and History---all rolled in one!. His Professor was Dr.Clarence Noise of the Wisconcin University USA. He managed to get back to his old school Nalanda as a teacher where he acted as assistant cricket coach to the famous Gerry Gooneratne who was his coach at school and was also the Prefect of Games, especially in charge of cricket from 1966 to 1970.
His cricketing products
In that era he helped produce cricketers of the calibre of Bandula Warnapura, brothers Jayantha and Palitha Seneviratne, Leslie Narangoda, Nandadeva Perera and Daya Sirisena. Warnapura went on to become the first Sri Lankan captain when the country attained Test status in 1982. EPASINGHE also served on the Interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket.
As school cricket selector from in 1968 and ’69 he was on the school's Indian tour in 1969. He brought in the left arm spinner from Dharmasoka, Ambalangoda Ajit de Silva who joining Ananda excelled as one of the finest left arm spinners who sported the Sri Lanka cap. He also served as media consultant at Sri Lanka Cricket on the invitation of the then President Thilang Sumathipala. EPASINGHE was also associated with the late Gamini Dissanayeke who was cricket’s big boss who he considers as ‘YUGAPURUSHE’ – man of the era of Sri Lanka cricket.
Spotting Anura Ranasinghe
But what EPASINGHE will most treasure was the spotting of Anura Ranasinge when he was a tiny tot showing his immense talent playing softball cricket at the Kirulupone Park. He was quick to get Ranasinghe admitted to Nalanda and then showed him to that coach who had produced outstanding school, club and country cricketers Gerry Gooneratne.
Gooneratne’s first glimpse of Ranasinghe was enough to convince him that here was an uncut gem and what he needs was a bit of polishing to become a batting prodigy. EPASINGHE remembers what Gooneratne told him after having a first look at Ranasinghe: ‘EPA, this fellow is like Sathasivam. A naturally gifted batsman.
Don’t change his style’. To those not in the know, Sathasivam was the greatest batsman produced by the country. Gooneratne’s prediction about Ranasinghe came true when he made it to the Sri Lanka team as an all rounder.
Ranasinghe’s career that promised records for the game was cut short and nipped in the bud when he was lured to tour Apartheid Land – South Africa with a set of rebel cricketers. His suspension called finis’ to career that promised a lot.
Commentating legend
However EPASINGHE was A LEGEND for his cricket commentating in Sinhala and even in English where he held listeners spell bound with his excellent command of the language and his credibility and the many aspects of the game.
We recall one of his finest moments in commentating in describing the country’s epic World Cup victory against Australia in 1976 from Lahore, Pakistan. He was nominated for this assignment by Nandasena Liyanapatabendi.
He also toured many Test playing countries – India, Pakistan, England, South Africa describing the action has it happened out in the middle and also did updates from Lord’s, Trent Bridge, Manchester, London Oval and also Sharjah. He is one of the pioneers in commentating on cricket in flawless Sinhala.
Stroll down memory lane
EPASINGHE taking a stroll down memory lane would recall that he was first introduced to Radio Ceylon by Mrs. Nanda Jayamanna who was in charge of SANDAYASEWYA. She in turn introduced him to the famous Livy Wijemanne who was a household name in broadcasting. It was they who wanted him to have an innings in cricket commentating which spanned a career from 1970 to 2015. He surely will remain thankful to Bandula Waturegame and Soma Rodrigo who were in charge of the Sports Service at Radio Ceylon.
In addition to his prowess in sport, he won the following titles – In 2007 he was awarded the KALASURI title by President Maithripala Sirisena for the services he rendered as a Buddhist writer ‘kotte kalyani samagri dharma sabawa’. Kotte chapter of Siamese sect bestowed on him the title ‘DHARMASA WEDANA SURI DHARMAPRIYA’.
Authored three books
EPASINGHE authored three books on cricket that were best -sellers. They were – MA DUTU CRICKET LOVA – BRADMAN YUGEYA in Sinhala and English and DHAMASARA in Sinhala and English.
EPASINGHE married Swarna Seneviratne a teacher at STAFFORD Ladies College and says she is the wind behind his wings and they were blessed with a son Bhagaya who opened batting for STCML, and daughter Apasara. It was a rare occurrence to see father and son play the role of opening batsmen for their respective schools – Nalanda and STCML.
Having associated with the great unassuming man for well over three decades as Sports Editor of the ‘Times of Ceylon’ and ‘Daily Mirror, and finally ‘Daily News’ publishing his wonderful descriptions of the player and game I make bold to describe him as a man in a million and an all rounder of our times.
