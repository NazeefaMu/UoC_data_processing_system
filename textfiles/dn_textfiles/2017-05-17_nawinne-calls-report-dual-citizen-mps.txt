Nawinne calls for report on dual citizen MPs

Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B.Nawinne has instructed Immigration and Emigration Controller General to submit a report furnishing details of the Parliamentarians holding dual citizenship.
Nawinne told the Daily News that he requested the report in his capacity as the subject minister. He also said he asked the Department to peruse the records of 20 to 25 years to find out the details of MPs who are dual citizens.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila last week placed an RTI request with the Immigration and Emigration Department requesting details of MPs with dual citizenship. He expressed his intention to take legal action against MPs with dual citizenship for the offence of providing wrong information to the Elections Commission.
The move comes in the wake of Appeal Court decision on May 3 disqualifying Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding the Parliamentary Seat on the grounds that she holds dual citizenship- in Sri Lanka and Switzerland. However, the Elections Commission decided to wait until the Supreme Court announces its ruling on the appeal filed by Kumarasinghe against the Appeal Court decision.
Consequent to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, dual citizens are barred from contesting the national elections and they cannot represent Parliament.
