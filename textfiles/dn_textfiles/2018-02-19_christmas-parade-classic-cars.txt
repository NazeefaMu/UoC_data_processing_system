Christmas parade with classic cars

The Classic Car Club of Ceylon (CCCC) held its first classic Christmas parade recently with a total of 55 classic cars consisting of such esteemed marques like Mercedes Benz, Alfa Romeo, Jaguar, Volkswagen, MG, Rolls Royce and others.
The Christmas parade was hosted with the support of main sponsor Hatton National Bank, together with event partners Mobil, DIMO, Wurth Lanka, and Gold FM.
CCCC members assembled at the HNB car park on Vinayalankara Mawatha, where the automotives were on display from 2.30 pm to 4 pm for invitees as well as the general public.
A colourful parade travelled from Darley Road passing Dharmapala Mawatha, Independence Square, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Galle Road, and Galle Face, making its way to its final destination at the Kingsbury.
The open-top Colombo Tour double decker bus with Christmas music was a highlight of the parade. The parade was followed by a Christmas get together at The Kingsbury. The festive atmosphere was made all the more glamorous with the classic cars once again on display for 150 participants that included members, guests and invitees.
Christmas Carols performed by the CCCC’s own choir of club members and their spouses was a high point of the evening, which concluded with a Christmas themed high-tea buffet.
CCCC President Ramani Ponnambalam said it was great to see a family atmosphere and close bonding thrive among the club’s membership. The main sponsor of the event was Hatton National Bank and event partners were Mobil, DIMO, Wurth and Gold FM.
