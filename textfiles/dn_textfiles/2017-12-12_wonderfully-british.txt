Wonderfully British !

Paul Topping launched his first book ‘The Whinging Pome’ recently at the Barefoot Garden Cafe. The term ‘pome’ stands for ‘Prisoner of Mother England’, a term used for a British national who often complains (or whinges) about the state of affairs in other countries. A variation of this term, ‘whinging pom’, was used liberally on British nationals who moved to Australia following World War II and complained continuously of the conditions there. Topping explained that the title of his book derived from the term which has been used by his wife to address him.
The book covers the many experiences Paul has had during his travels, listing 18 of his favourite countries in the book. Here are a few moments from the launch.
