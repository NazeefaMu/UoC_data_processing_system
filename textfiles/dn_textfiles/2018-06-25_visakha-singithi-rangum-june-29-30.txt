Visakha Singithi Rangum on June 29, 30

Singithi Rangum, the annual concert of the primary section of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, will be held on June 29 and 30 at the school hall.
Singithi Rangum is a part of Principal Sandamali Aviruppola’s endeavour to provide an all-round education to the school’s students, encouraging them from their childhood to allocate time to activities apart from studies.
The school had earned a name for having high achievements all ‘round, in both academic and extra-curricular spheres. Being a school which starts from Grade 1, the academic achievements are unparalleled with the highest number of 9 As at O/Ls and highest number of university entrants almost every year. Visakha had sent a large number of students to the Colombo University and Sri Jayewardenepura University Medical Faculties, apart from considerable numbers to other faculties. The school also had the highest cut-off rates for the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, making it the most sought-after school in the country.
During the tenure of Principal Aviruppola, students had received numerous national awards in music, dance and sports, also gaining international recognition for numerous events. The importance of the English language is well-recognised by the administration, giving extra attention to English education by employing well-trained English instructors to provide English medium education.
“Principal Aviruppola has taken a keen interest to improve the quality of education, both academic and non-academic. With the assistance of the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls’ Association (VVOGA), she has improved facilities and engaged the services of special teachers, qualified coaches and dramatists to encourage students to excel, giving special attention to students’ discipline.
The VVOGA has also undertaken the responsibility to set up ‘smart class rooms’ in the near future with her guidance,” a senior VVOGA official said.
