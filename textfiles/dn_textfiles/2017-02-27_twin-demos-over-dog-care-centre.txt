Twin demos over dog care centre

Unawatuna area was tense on February 24 due to two demonstrations over a dog care centre maintained in the area .
One group was in favour of the dog care centre while the other, whose demonstration was bigger in numbers that included the Maha Sangha, was against the centre.
The bone of contention was the seizing of a collection of chains and bracelets with symbols depicting the head of the Buddha from the dog care centre at Metaramba, Unawatuna by the Habaraduwa Police recently. The dog care centre is maintained by a German expatriate.
Those participating in the two demonstrations dispersed after the Maha Sangha addressed them and pledged to get the dog care centre removed from the area before the next full moon Poya Day.
