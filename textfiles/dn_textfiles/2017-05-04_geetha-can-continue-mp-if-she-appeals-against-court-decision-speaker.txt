Geetha can continue as MP if she appeals against court decision: Speaker

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday told the ‘Daily News’ that Geetha Kumarasinghe could continue to remain as a Member of Parliament if she appeals against yesterday’s court decision to unseat her.
Jayasuriya said that she could function as an MP until Court delivers a verdict, if Kumarasinghe appeals against the ruling.
The Speaker also said that Court has not informed Parliament as yet about its decision on Geetha Kumarasinghe being disqualified to be a Member of Parliament.
