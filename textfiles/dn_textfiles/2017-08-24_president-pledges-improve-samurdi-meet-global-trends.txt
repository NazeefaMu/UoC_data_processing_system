President pledges to improve Samurdi to meet global trends

President Maithripala Sirisena said the Samurdi movement should be developed as a broad economic and social movement, which is capable of steering the country towards prosperity.
Accordingly, the Samurdi movement will be subjected to several timely changes to meet the present day trends of the world to get the best outcome of the movement, he added.
The President made these remarks while addressing the National Convention of the Samurdi movement at the Nelum Pokuna theatre, under the theme ‘Samurdi Praja Shakthi,’ yesterday.Addressing Samudhy officers who represented the entire country, the President said the government will provide leadership to the movement to further strengthen it.
Under these measures, small village producers should be empowered to reach the global market.
“The quality of small village products should be increased with the assistance of modern technology and methodology aiming to reach the global market. Small level village producers will be supported to reach national and international levels. The aim of the government is to uplift these small scale producers to a global standard and make way for small scale producers to send their products to the international market,” he said.
The President highlighted that the Samurdi movement is the brainchild of the 1994 government. With the leadership of Minister S. B. Dissanayake, the movement is progressing, he said.
The President said of the nine provinces, the Samurdi movement is functioning in seven provinces. It was noticed that the movement is not properly progressing in the North and East provinces, affected by terrorism.
