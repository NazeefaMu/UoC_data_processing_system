Former Chief Minister seeks to hold North Central Provincial Council elections

 
Former North Central Provincial Council Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith today filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Order directing the Election Commission to forthwith take steps to conduct elections for the North Central Provincial Council which stood dissolved on October 1, 2017 by operation of Article 154 E of the Constitution.
In his petition, the former Chief Minister had cited Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, two members of Election Commission, the Speaker and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the decision of Election Commission to refrain from taking steps as provided in Section 10 of the Provincial Councils Elections Act No. 2 of 1982 to conduct North Central Provincial Council which stood dissolved on 27-09-2017 by the operation of Article 154E of the constitution, is violative of the constitution and is illegal, completely arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and motivated by extraneous considerations and political expediencies of the government, and constitutes an infringement of the Fundmental rights guaranteed under Article 10, 12(1), 14(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution.
