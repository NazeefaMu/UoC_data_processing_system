Batticaloa people keen to celebrate the New Year

In preparation to celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Batticaloa town has become a hive of activities with traders and customers filling the streets.
Temporary traders from Kurunagala, Habarana, Down South and other parts of the island too have come and are busy selling their merchandise such as clothes, exotic plants and coloured fish at very cheap prices along the pavements.
The people of the Western Sector of Batticaloa are very eager to purchase their clothes from the pavement hawkers at Bar Road that are seen to be very enthusiastically trading their merchandise at the Batticaloa Municipal Market and textiles shops which are overflowing with customers.
