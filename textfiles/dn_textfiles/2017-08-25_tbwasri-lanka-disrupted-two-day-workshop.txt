TBWA\Sri Lanka 'disrupted' at two-day workshop

TBWA\Sri Lanka was disrupted by Robin Nayak, Chief Strategy Officer, Singapore and South East Asia at a recently concluded two-day workshop, in Colombo.
The Sri Lanka team was rejuvenated on ‘Disruption’ using a live local brief and other simulated cases at the workshop making it hands-on and practical.
The workshop also marked the launch of ‘Disruption Live’ in the Sri Lanka office where the emphasis was placed on being in line with the TBWA\ Collective’s best practice.
With ‘Disruption’ being the common philosophy and way of working that binds the TBWA\ Collective together, it is also the one thing that differentiates a TBWA office from other players in the market.
With the premise of ‘Disruption’ being that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity, ‘Disruption’ creates a focal point for a brand.
At its simplest, it is a way of looking at the conventions that operate within a category and finding a way for the brand to behave differently to accelerate its growth.
The Managing Director of TBWA\Sri Lanka, Renuka Marshall commented, “What is exciting is that Disruption is not limited only to advertising or communication.
Anything and everything can be disrupted. The challenge is to know when and how to disrupt.
This paves way for exciting times ahead.”
“The hallmark of TBWA is that we don’t follow cultural and market conventions – we overturn them. We anticipate future trends to determine what could lift a brand,” said Robin Nayak.
TBWA\Sri Lanka Chief Creative Officer Subhash Pinnapola said, ”Disruption has been very much a part of our success. We take pride in developing business-changing, culture defining and effective ideas for brands. The international and local recognition as well as brand success stories reconfirm this”.
TBWA\Sri Lanka is ranked as the second most awarded creative agency Sri Lanka’s and 65th in Asia as per Campaign Brief Asia 2016 creative rankings. The agency has a mix of MNC, blue chip and local clients across varied product categories including finance, insurance, food and beverage, snacks, property, health care, vehicles, etc.
TBWA\Sri Lanka takes pride in building iconic brands in Sri Lanka that generate results for their clients as well as taking Sri Lanka to the world and bringing honor to the country through the numerous awards at international creative awards shows.
