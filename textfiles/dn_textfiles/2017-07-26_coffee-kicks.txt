Coffee kicks in

Coffee was once a thriving cultivation in Ceylon. The British began large scale commercial production and by 1860, the country was amongst the major coffee-producing nations in the world. Decades later “coffee” is being revived and at the forefront of is the Colombo Coffee Company.
Sri Lanka’s premier total coffee solution provider the Colombo Coffee Company (CCC) holds the franchise for Italy’s favourite Lavazza Coffee and recently was the “Official Coffee Partner” for the 12th Hotel Show 2017 which was held at BMICH from the 30th June – 2nd July. The Hotel Show is one of the largest gatherings of the hospitality sector in South Asia and draws many buyers from hotels, restaurants and cafes in the region. It also serves as a platform for suppliers to display the latest and best of their products and services.
New identity
CCC, the preferred coffee partner for the best known hotels in Colombo also introduced a 100% locally produced coffee brand at the event. “Toscana Ceylon” is roasted to an Italian recipe and strives to give “Sri Lankan Coffee” a new identity. This venture supports more than 50 families directly involved in coffee cultivation, and hundreds of others involved indirectly. It also strives to empower women entrepreneurs and educate children in these plantations to uplift their living standards.

Among the key highlights showcased at the Hotel Show, in addition to world famous Lavazza coffee were leading machine brands such as La Cimballi, Nuova Simonelli, WMF and Gaggia etc. Not limiting themselves to coffee alone, some of the new products also included freshly brewed bulk iced-tea for a refreshing break to Sri Lanka’s wavering heat and an Italian Gelato machine that makes home-made ice cream a breeze.

Skill and expertise
Six world-class Baristas chosen from the cafes, hotels and restaurants in Sri Lanka for their skill and expertise, used Colombo Coffee Company’s high quality coffee and machines to show-off their skills.
