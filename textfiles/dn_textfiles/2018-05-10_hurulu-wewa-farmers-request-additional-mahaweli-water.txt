Hurulu Wewa farmers request additional Mahaweli water

Hurulu Wewa farmers had urged the government to provide additional Mahaweli water to the Hurulu Wewa reservoir throughout the year, especially during drought seasons similar to that which currently prevails throughout the country.
They had added that they would be capable of producing paddy worth around Rs. 15 million yearly, provided the necessary water facilities were available. The cultivation landscape coming under the Hurulu Wewa is around 11,000 acres. In addition, there are 13 small tanks located near the reservoir.
Hurulu Wewa Irrigation Engineer Athula Wijewardana said that out of the usual water capacity of the Hurulu Wewa; that is, 55,000 acre-feet; only 8,000 acre-feet is available at present, which is adequate only to cultivate around 1,000 acres of land.
“As the reservoir’s water levels are dwindling, we have requested the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to release a minimum volume of 36,000 acre-feet of water to it. However, so far, we have not received any favourable response,” Wijewardana said.
“As per our agreement, under normal weather conditions, we receive 10,000 acre-feet of water from Bowatenna to Hurulu Wewa along the 60-km long feeding canal. At present, not even one-fourth of this water quantity is received as water is unnecessarily blocked and stored at the Habarana, Talkote and Hiriwadunna medium-size tanks by the Agrarian Development Department. Furthermore, certain hoteliers and businessman engaged in large-scale cultivations along the banks of the canal, illegally tap into the water supply,” he said, adding that such acts prevent the necessary water quantity from being received.
Galenbindunuwewa Divisional Secretary Margret Kumburage said that Hurulu Wewa settlers had been undergoing hardships since they lost cultivations during the previous cultivation seasons due to the scarcity of water caused by the prevailing drought and added that they too, had requested the Irrigation Department Secretary to release 30,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water for the 2018 Yala season.
However, Kumburage said she had not received any response regarding the matter as well. Meanwhile, it was learnt that drought-stricken Galenbindunuwewa farmers are being denied the Rs. 5,000 worth dry food rations as a result of the criteria indicated in the recently issued circular by the Disaster Management Ministry.
Rajangane farmers would also not receive the said rations under the Ministry’s latest categorisation of drought-affected families.
The Hurulu Wewa Farmers’ Organisation had brought the matter to Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake’s attention in order for the programme to be re-assessed.
