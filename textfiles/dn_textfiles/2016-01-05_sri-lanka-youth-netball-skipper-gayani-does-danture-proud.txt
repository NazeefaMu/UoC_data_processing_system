Sri Lanka Youth netball skipper Gayani does Danture proud

Gayani Dissanayake from the remote village of Danture in the electorate of Yatinuwara did her village proud when she captained the Sri Lanka netball team which won the Asian Youth netball championship for 2015.
She stands at 6 feet two inches having the ideal height for a game like netball where high passes could bemuse the defence in addition to the advantage of shooting or collecting the rebounds. Her dedication to the game is so much that she even shifted from a Kandy school to a Colombo School to continue her netball and also to attend national practices as she found travelling from her village to Colombo very tedious.
Gayani Dissanayake is just 21 years and took to netball when she was attending Girls High School and caught the eye of the selectors as in school matches she towered above the rest. She felt that she had a future in netball. At the age of 15 she attended Visakha Vidyalaya which won many schools netball titles and she played a key role in them.
While still at school she had to play for the junior and later for the Senior National team. She humbly admitted she was not the tallest in the team and there was others like Tharijini Sivalingam standing at 6 feet 8 inches who did the shooting. She also did the shooting at times. Shooting is not only height. You will have the most important at all- football and she paid more attention to this. Our girls have the speed and skills to upset any opponent. Regional we are one of the best or if not the best.
Just see me I am from the village of Danture and I made the mark because I attended schools in Kandy and Colombo and of course my coaches honed my skills and the credit should go them as well. There is talent in the villages which must be tapped to fill our larder.
Gayani Dissanayake plays in the dual position of Goal Keep and Goal Defence in netball parlance it is known as GA and GD. Playing as goal defence she defends her territory by stopping the high passes and also collecting the rebounds.
She played for the national team from 2010 onwards including the World Cup 2015 played in Sydney, Australia. Some of her other national representations are Asian Championship played in Singapore in 2012 and 2014. She has played in 3 Junior Asiads – 2012 in India, 2013 in Brunei and 2015 in Hong Kong. The year 2015 was an unforgettable one as under her captaincy won the championship title.
She also represented Sri Lanka at the Nations Cup netball championship from 2010.. to 2013. This was when she was preparing for GCE O/L and A/L Examinations. At the 2013 Nations Cup she was adjudged the Most Valuable Player. Fully immersed in netball she rose higher and higher and produced some sparkling displays and she was awarded World Ranking No 4 in Defence at the Conclusion of World Cup 2015 in Australia.
Just imagine a village girl from the remote village of Danture getting a World ranking. This means if there is a world team she could make it. She is very young and agile with age and height on her side she has the potential to bring more honours to mother Lanka with the passage of time.
