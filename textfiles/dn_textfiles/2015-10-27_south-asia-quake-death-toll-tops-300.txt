South Asia quake death toll tops 300

AFGHANISTAN: The death toll from the earthquake that shook parts of South Asia has risen above 300.
The number of dead in northwestern Pakistan has risen to 229, disaster management officials said, bringing the overall toll for Pakistan, Afghanistan and India to 306.
In one northern Afghan town, 12 schoolgirls died in a stampede as they tried to evacuate their school during the quake.
The girls, between 10 and 15 years old, were crushed in their Taluqan city school's stairwell, between the first and second floors, local police spokesman Abdul Khalil Asir said.
Monday's magnitude-7.5 earthquake was similar to a magnitude-7.6 quake in nearby Kashmir that killed more than 70,000 in 2005. But unlike the quake 10 years ago, this one happened deep inside the Earth, some 223 kilometres (139 miles) below the surface.
Earthquakes at this depth typically cause less damage on the surface than shallower quakes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The epicenter of the earthquake, near the Afghan city of Jarm, is a rural and sparsely populated area. Many people in this region live in mud brick buildings prone to collapsing. The mountainous region and poor infrastructure make assessing the aftermath difficult.
First responders scrambled to the affected areas. Many of the villages most violently shaken by the quake are not easily accessible. Additional reports of fatalities and damage are expected to continue trickling in.
Afghan broadcaster Tolo TV showed images of collapsed structures. Photos showed collapsed houses and buildings turned to rubble.
According to Wais Ahmad Barmak, Afghan state minister for disaster management affairs, about 4,000 houses were either severely damaged or destroyed.
The USGS issued an orange alert on the quake.
“Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,” the USGS said.

Taliban vow to help Afghanistan after deadly quake
AFGHANISTAN: The Taliban Tuesday urged charity organisations not to hold back in delivering aid to Afghan victims of a devastating earthquake, saying militants in the affected areas were ordered to provide “complete help”.
Rescuers are battling to access some of the worst-affected areas across multiple provinces that are effectively under militant control, a huge challenge to any official aid efforts.
But the Taliban on Tuesday promised to pave access for aid organisations. “The Islamic Emirate (Taliban) calls on... charitable organisations to not hold back in providing shelter, food and medical supplies to the victims of this earthquake,” the group said on its website.
“It similarly orders its Mujahideen in the affected areas to lend their complete help to the victims and facilitate those giving charity to the needy.”
