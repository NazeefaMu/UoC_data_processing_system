Wounds of Healing: An Easter Chorale Reflection

The Prestantia Chorale in collaboration with Chraft (Christian Arts Foundation) will present “Wounds of Healing,” a choral reflection for the fourth consecutive year to celebrate the Lent and Easter season. The program will be held at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Colombo 7, on Sunday, April 2 at 7pm. The music is directed by Dr. Priyeshni Peiris Perera and the original script is adapted from Steve Moore’s narrative based on the human struggle of Thomas’ refusal to believe and experience the inner healing which comes through Christ.
The chorale wishes to raise funds through a “Free will love offering” for the Deaf and Blind School in Rathmalana.
As in the past years, this event is free and open to both young and old with an interest in music. The Prestantia Chorale promises an evening of reflective, spirit-filled choral music to celebrate the season as witnessed in the past years by attendees.
At present, the choir consists twenty two passionate singers who devote their precious time to sing in four-part (SATB) with the Prestantia Chorale. They are Pavithra Madapatha, Ranthilini Fernando, Sudarshi Nonis, Sunara Ranasinghe, Praveeni Fernando, Prashanthi Perera, Privanka Fonseka, (Dr) Amal Shehan Perera, Janaka Fernando, Melantha Fernando, Wasantha Kumara Geekiyanage, (Rev)Upul Fernando, Shavan De Mel,Pabasara Jayarathne, Tharaka Peiris, Dave Fernando and Shamal Fernando, Michelle Refuge, Sanduni Perera, (Dr) Sanuri Pandikorala and Siroshni Illangage,. The group consists professional and amateur musicians who areBankers, Medical Doctors, Lawyers, Clergy, Software Engineers and Music Practitioners by profession.
The Prestantia Chorale has performed at Church Services, Weddings, and on National Television and the “MTV Good Morning Show” at various occasions. The presentations of Easter Musicals such as “The Borrowed Tomb” by David Clydesdale (2014 & 2015) and “On Wings of Angels” (2016) by Dhanan Senathirajah has functioned as musical underpinnings of Prestantia Chorale’s evolution as a leading choir in the country. The highlight for the Chorale was the presentation of the National Anthem sung SATB in both Sinhala and Tamil languages probably for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2015 to an original SATB arrangement by Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera.
The chorale has appeared as invited guest performers at the“PrestantiaMusica2014 & 2015,”the “Throne of Praise” and “The Priests in Concert” atthe Holy Emmanuel Church among others. Subsequently upon requests that were made, the musicals were re-presented at the Methodist Churches as fundraisers.
Wounds of Healing plays a prominent role towards communicating a variety of emotions through songs ranging from Classical to Contemporary Repertoire.With the energetic and lush choral harmonies of Thomas Rutter, David Clydesdale, Steve Townsend and Keith Getty and selections from “The Messiah” by G.F.Handel combined with the creative writing abilities of Steve Moore, this Easter musical dramatically portrays the story of Christ’s death and resurrection through the eyes of three symbolic characters namely Thomas, Peter, and Mary Magdalene.
The audience will experience the emotions of how the death and resurrection of Jesus affected their lives. It will portray the inner tensions the disciples walked through during this period because of their expectation of a king to heal their wounds, the self-inflicted emotional turmoil behind Peter’s denial of Jesus, and the doubt that Thomas had to overcome to be ultimately healed through the resurrection of Jesus.
The Junior Choir of the Prestantia Music School will join-in with the Chorale this year too.
The instrumental ensemble will consist of (Dr.) Priyeshni P. Perera(Piano), Christopher Prins (Drums), Nimalka Marian (Keyboard Synthesizer), Saranga Cooray (Cello,) Sachiththa Fernando (Violin) and Tironi Rathnayake (Flute). Sound Engineering Support by Navin Fernando, Janaka Fernando and MadhawaPerera.
