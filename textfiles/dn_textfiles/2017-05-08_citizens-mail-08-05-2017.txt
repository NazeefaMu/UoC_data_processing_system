Private Medical faculties, a dire need
The doctor population ratio in Britain (Developed country) is 1 - 20 in Sri Lanka (under developed country) it is 1-1,000. We have around 20,000 doctors to over 20 million population. The WHO insists that this must be reduced by half to 1-500. This means we require 20,000 more doctors immediately. How can we produce them? There are 8 State faculties producing around 1,300 doctors per year. In addition, around 300 foreign graduates join the service yearly. Thus around 1,600 doctors are added to the cadre each year. The population in the country is increasing by around 300,000 per year. Which means we require an additional 600 doctors yearly for the increase in population. The state is hoping to start two more faculties which means there will be 10 faculties. It is obvious that the state cannot provide enough doctors for the country even after 50 years. Thus the only hope is to have Private Medical Colleges on a Private Public Partnership basis, throughout many cities of the country.
In Sri Lanka only 20 percent of those who qualify in the A/L enter the universities. So 80 percent are left out. Fortunately in most of the other professions like Law, Accountancy, Engineering, IT, HR, Management etc, there are enough openings in the country for the students who don't enter the State faculties to get their training and degrees. In my opinion this is the only country in the world where no Private Medical Colleges are allowed to be established by the GMOA and Medical Students.
To produce 20,000 more doctors the 10 State faculties will have to produce at least 2,000 doctors per years. The state will have to put up more buildings to accommodate this number. We will require a minimum of 10 Private Medical Colleges immediately producing another 2,000 doctors. If we do this in five years time we can produce 20,000 doctors. To meet 21st century's challenges in Medical Education, this country will require both State and Private Sector participation, if we are to make Sri Lanka a developed country.
