USAID water project benefit 100,000 in disaster prone areas

The United States Government joined State Minister Sudharshini Fernandopulle and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena on January 5 to launch an approximately Rs. 150 million programme to provide safe disaster-resilient drinking water to local communities.
This programme expands upon several previous USAID projects since 2012 that have provided sustainable access to drinking water to those areas in the South, East and North prone to droughts and floods. “The United States is committed to help Sri Lankan families who face daily struggles with reliable sources of clean drinking water,” said U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.
The project’s scope includes building rainwater harvesting tanks, providing pipe-borne drinking water facilities, and renovating local infrastructure to reduce the effects of floods and droughts. Locations of rainwater harvesting tanks will be prioritised for families and hospitals affected by the rising challenge of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), supporting the efforts of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Sri Lankan government to address this critical health concern.
The programme will support national and regional-level policies to minimise the impact of such disasters, while helping local communities adopt sustainable solutions for disaster-related water and hygiene needs.
Over 100,000 people are expected to benefit directly from this project.
“I also take this opportunity to thank USAID for the excellent support provided to Sri Lanka in promoting rainwater harvesting and improving new technologies,” said City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Sudharshini Fernandopulle at the launching ceremony.
This project will target communities in the North, East, and Uva province exposed to frequent natural disasters. Since 1956, the U.S. Government and USAID have worked in Sri Lanka to improve the lives of Sri Lankans, investing over $2 billion in agricultural and business development, education, health, energy and natural resources, good governance, and humanitarian assistance.
