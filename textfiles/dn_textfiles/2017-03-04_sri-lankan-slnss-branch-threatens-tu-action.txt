Sri Lankan SLNSS branch threatens TU action

The SriLankan Airlines Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya (SLNSS) branch said that they would resort to Trade Union action if they are not updated as to the latest developments on the sale of SriLankan Airlines and that they be given an appointment to meet President Maithripala Sirisena.
SLNSS president Janaka Wijayapathiratne told the Daily News that they want this meeting with the President because conflicting messages are being given by Ministers and top decision makers of SriLankan Airlines.
He said that the SriLankan Airlines Chairman says that he does not know anything about these developments.
“Over 5,000 out of nearly 7,000 employees are our union members. They inquire from us as to what is happening about this alleged sale and we need to have the facts to answer them. In addition, though this government said transparency would be maintained during this deal, now it seems that there are a lot of under currents moving behind closed doors. We want to know the truth,” Wijayapathiratne said.
He said that they had also wanted to meet the Prime Minister but this too had failed. “We have now contacted the President through our mother Union Secretary Leslie Devendra and if an opportunity for a meeting is not granted to us before the end of March, we will launch a major strike at the airline.”
“The Colombo International Airport is now closed only in the day and if this trade union action goes ahead, it might cause a further shutdown in the airport from April,”he said.
In March, it was announced that Sri Lanka was looking for foreign investors interested in taking over their beleaguered, debt-laden national carrier. In July, the government began taking offers for a 49% share and management control of the airline and three bidders, Peace Air, TPG and a Maldivian company were short listed.
