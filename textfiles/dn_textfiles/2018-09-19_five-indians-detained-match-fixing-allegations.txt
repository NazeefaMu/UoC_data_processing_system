Five Indians detained on match-fixing allegations

Sri Lanka Cricket had detained and later removed five Indian nationals from the stadium, who were witnessing the 3rd ODI match played between the Sri Lanka and India Women’s teams, last Sunday (September 16), at the CMG in Katunayake.
Issuing a statement, Sri Lanka Cricket said that the SLC Anti-Corruption Unit; with the help of the police; removed the five individuals from the stadium, when they observed that these individuals were behaving suspiciously and using their mobile phones excessively.
The SLC Anti-Corruption Unit had also taken measures to notify the International Cricket Council of this incident.
