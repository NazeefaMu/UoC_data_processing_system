Sampath Bank partners with Colombo International Book Fair

Continuing to help nurture the habit of reading, Sampath Bank joined hands with the Colombo International Book Fair as the event's official banking partner for the 13th consecutive year.
President Maithripala Sirisena paid a visit to the Sampath Bank stall at the Book Fair during the inauguration ceremony on September 15 and reviewed the services being offered there by the Bank. Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank PLC presented a personalized MyBook Club card to President on this memorable occasion.
He also handed over the Bank’s sponsorship cheque to the organizers, Sri Lanka Book Publishers' Association, in the presence of President and other dignitaries.
MyBook Club is a novel initiative aimed at nurturing and promoting the habit of reading amongst all Sri Lankans.
This programme was launched at last year’s Colombo International Book Fair by Sampath Bank in partnership with the Sri Lanka Book Publishers' Association.
Book lovers can register for MyBook Club membership at the MyBook Club counter adjoining the Sampath Bank Branch at the Colombo International Book Fair or at selected Sampath Bank Branches. On registration, members are presented with a MyBook Club card which offers them a host of benefits including free entry to the Book Fair and discounts at partner bookstores, all year round.
Going beyond discounts on books, members can also use their MyBook Club cards for a wide array of banking services including deposits, withdrawals, payments and more at any Sampath Bank branch. This is made possible by Sampath MyBank which seeks to bring in greater financial inclusion by offering selected banking services to under banked and unbanked consumers in remote areas of the nation through a network of Agents.Taking the Bank’s services closer to all Sri Lankans, this helps promote financial inclusion and encourages the habit of savings.
Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank PLC said,“At Sampath Bank, we are committed to adding value to the lives of all fellow Sri Lankans. We are delighted to partner with the Colombo International Book Fair for the 13th consecutive year and support the organizers in promoting the habit of reading.Unlike reading up on a subject on the web, reading a book provides one with much needed focus and concentration. This year, we had the honor and privilege of welcoming President Maithripala Sirisena to our MyBook Club, an initiative launched with the same objective. Offering further impetus to read and seek knowledge, it is also linked to Sampath MyBank to boost financial inclusion by taking banking services closer to all citizens.”
Sampath Bank invites book lovers across the nation to avail the privileges on offer by registering with MyBook Club and increase their reading habit and enhance their knowledge through it.
