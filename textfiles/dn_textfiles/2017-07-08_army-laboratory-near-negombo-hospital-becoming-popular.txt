Army laboratory near Negombo Hospital becoming popular

The Army established medical laboratory near the Negombo Hospital premises for free screening of blood samples for Dengue have so far tested blood of more than 1500 civilians who volunteered, Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps (SLAMC) said.
The Army with the support of Navy personnel with funds, provided by the Presidential Secretariat within three days erected this makeshift laboratory to assist medical authorities at the Negombo Hospital as incidence of Dengue has dramatically increased in the areas.
The President during a sudden visit he made recently to the Negombo Hospital found that facilities for Dengue patients were not adequate and requested Army support for enhancement of laboratory and ward facilities.The Army and Navy Commanders within four days set up two extra wards in the premises and instructed the Corps of Engineer Services (CES) and SLAMC troops to equip the wards with medical accessories, nurses and all other paraphernalia.
The opening of a separate laboratory took place immediately after construction of the two new wards. The unit has become popular as more and more civilians with symptoms of fever were now seeking the free of charge service on a daily basis.
