TEC Global Campus is not yet another tuition campus but a futuristic learning center that has identified the needs of the future.

For school leavers, job seekers and professionals TEC Global Campus has introduced professional diploma courses specializing in IT, Computer Hardware, Networking and English Language. All these courses are accredited by the relevant professional body. Students get to learn from the best resources and platforms that are even used by corporations like IBM! These courses and material are used by renowned universities and corporations to simulate the theoretical learning to practical applications. At the end of the courses, students are prepared to sit for certificate exams like Microsoft Office Specialist.
The TEC Young Innovator Program is a specially designed program for kids between the ages of 5-7 years 8-11 years & 12-15 yrs. Purpose of these courses is to introduce kids to a ‘Maker Generation’. The present generation is too engaged in ‘using’ technology and hardly anybody take initiative to invent new technology. This trend is not very healthy. Hence TEC Global Campus has identified that it is important to shift the ‘User Generation’ to a ‘Maker Generation’. At Kid Young Innovator Program kids will use different materials to invent their own working models of different appliances, putting their creative and analytical skills to work. They will be guided and supported by an experienced panel of staff. Step by step kids will be introduced to technologies like robotics too. They will be designing their own robots using algorithms and coding. This is different from the formal classroom schooling but it is more practical and a fun way for kids to learn and practice. These types of programs are testes and used in countries like Canada, USA and Hong Kong.
