Govt does not violate people’s right to protest: Ashoka Abeysinghe

The Government does not violate the right of persons to engage in trade union action, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha, the United National Party (UNP) Headquarters yesterday, he said petroleum trade union members temporarily called off the strike after a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday.
Referring to the declaration of fuel supply as an essential service, the Deputy Minister said the decision was made to cease the inconvenience caused to the public. Abeysinghe said the Government would continue to safeguard the freedom of the media. The Government aims at building a country with a booming economy, he said. The Deputy Minister said the Cabinet approval had been received to develop the Hambantota port with Chinese aid under a bilateral agreement.
