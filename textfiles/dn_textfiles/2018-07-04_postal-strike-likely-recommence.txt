Postal strike likely to recommence

The postal trade union alliance would commence another postal strike if the Postal Department is unable to pay the salaries of workers for the month of June, said convener Chintaka Bandara.
“We held discussions with the Posts Minister, Postmaster General and the Postal Secretary, but they have failed to respond to our demands,” he said. According to the convener, 26,000 workers are facing difficulties as they have not received their salaries. Therefore, he said, a strike would be called if the demands are not met by today. When the Daily News inquired about the previous demands which led to the previous postal strike for 16 days, the convener said authorities had acted on it. However, they have not been able to solve the issue with regard to the expectations of the postal trade union alliance.
“Our strike to be convened on July 4 would only be with regard to salaries.” He added that the posts, which were halted during the strike, were distributed.
