Citizens' Mail

Harm in place of healing
I live behind the Castle Street Hospital for Women, down Model Farm Road. My house overlooks the back compound of the hospital.
For the past several years the Castle Street Hospital has been burning hospital waste intermittently, along the wall that borders their property from ours. I have complained by telephone many, many times to no avail. Recently, in April 2017, they began burning every single day.
When I telephoned them they said it was because the CMC was not picking up their waste. I filed a complaint with the Director of the Castle Street Hospital Dr. Gamini Seneviratne and copied it to the Central Environment Authority, the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, President Maithripala Sirisena and the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senarathne.
All of them replied with copies of letters sent to the Castle Street Hospital to stop burning their waste lest they face legal consequences.
Apparently, these letters and direction given by the ministries and from the Secretary of the President himself, holds no sway with the hospital as they continue to burn hospital waste, polluting the neighbourhood and endangering my family.
The latest episode was on July 13, 2017. They have been burning waste, despite the directives almost every day this month, even burning at night and sometimes for two to three days at a stretch.
I look after my mother who is 89-years-old and who has had cranial surgery over one year ago. She has difficulty breathing when inhaling this polluted smoke from the hospital premises. So do I, and all the other persons living in my house. We have had to call in the emergency doctors at Medi Help several times over this.
One day the fire was so high it burnt the mango tree, the Kithul tree and the Kathuru Murunga tree on our side of the wall. Doctors and other staff members had to rush in with buckets of water to stop the blaze lest it spread to the houses located on our side of the wall. In the meantime, we are inhaling toxic fumes on a daily basis-emanating from the hospital.
Is it right for a hospital of all places, to be causing harm to people instead of what they should be doing healing people?
What message are they sending to the public when they thumb their noses at directives sent by the Ministries and the President himself? Who is running this country? The Castle Street Hospital, this is shameful and needs to stop immediately.
