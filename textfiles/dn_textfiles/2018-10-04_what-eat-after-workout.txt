WHAT TO eat  after a workout

Here’s the secret to getting a killer body. But first, answer these questions. Do you feel tired and worn out after working out? Do you think eating post workout is going to nullify your efforts at the gym?
Then, know this. Post-workout foods/meals are key to getting an enviable svelte figure. Because they help heal and rebuild your energy sources and muscle protein. But you must know which foods are best for you, and in what quantities. So, give this a read to know what to consume and why post-workout foods/meals are important. Swipe up!
When you workout, glycogen (glucose stored in muscles) is used up as a source of energy.
The repeated contraction of the muscles also leads to muscle fiber wear and tear. That’s why, right after working out, your muscles feel weak, and you feel like resting for a while. It’s your body’s way of telling you that you have no energy and need to refuel. This is precisely why you need to eat after working out. The nutrients from the good foods will help in the following ways:
 
Dark Leafy Greens 
Dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, radish greens, Swiss chard, lettuce, broccoli, collard greens, mustard greens, and arugula are loaded with dietary fiber, vitamins C, A, E, and K, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and other phytonutrients. These will not only help you replenish the glycogen stores but also protect you from a host of diseases, aid weight loss, and boost your immunity.
 
Oatmeal 
Oats are popular among those who want to lose weight. But did you know that the good carbs present in oats also make them an amazing post-workout food, especially if you make oats smoothie? Loaded with vitamin E, antioxidants, and other phytonutrients, oats help increase satiety, lower bad cholesterol, and also fight cancer.
 
Fruits and veggies 
Fruits and veggies like apple, banana, pear, peach, plum, watermelon, muskmelon, dragon fruit, passion fruit, carrot, tomato, beetroot, scallions, and peas are great for your post-workout meal. And that’s because they help boost your energy levels and flush out the toxic free oxygen radicals. They also help fight heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. The WHO recommends consuming 4 to 5 types of fruits and veggies per day. You can easily blend a banana, spinach, and carrot to make a quick post-workout meal.
 
Sweet potato
Sweet potato is the best substitute for white potato. It is low in calories, great for replenishing the glycogen stores, and keeps you satiated for a long duration. This instant energy source also has cancer-fighting potential, helps in weight loss, and flushes out toxins from the body. If you are on a weight loss mission, have boiled sweet potatoes instead of the baked ones as baking causes a spike in the GI of sweet potatoes.
 
Eggs 
Like rice, eggs have quite a mixed reputation. Many people prefer eating only the white because they do not like the texture of the yolk or it smells odd. But many healthy eaters avoid having the yolk as they consider it to be unhealthy. However, that is not true. Whole eggs are excellent sources of water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and most importantly, essential amino acids and proteins. They are great for your post-workout meal as they are loaded with proteins and other nutrients that help protect you from various diseases. Having 2 whole eggs per day is ideal. Do not exceed the limit of 4to 5 eggs per week.
 
Cottage cheese 
Cottage cheese is a milk product that is enjoyed in salads, wraps, pizzas, and sandwiches. It is a good source of protein, calcium, and other nutrients that help increase the satiety levels. Some commercially available cottage cheese is also fortified with vitamin D, an essential nutrient for overall well-being. You can have it with a few slices of avocado and a slice of whole wheat bread for your post-workout meal to rev up your energy levels and help your muscles recover from the wear and tear quickly.
 
Greek yogurt 
Greek yogurt contains more protein than regular yogurt and helps improve satiety levels. It is one of the best snacks, and consuming it post your workout is a great way to keep your hunger pangs in control for an hour or so. You can add it to smoothies or have it with some fruits.
 
Tuna 
Tuna is a great source of protein and healthy fats. One ounce of canned tuna contains about 7.1 g of protein and 78.7 mg of omega-3 fatty acids. It also contains a selenium-containing compound, selenoneine. It helps protect the hemoglobin and myoglobin from oxidation and also helps decrease mercury toxicity.
Consume a piece of fish with some dark leafy greens and some healthy fats for a filling and yummy post-workout meal. Style Craze
