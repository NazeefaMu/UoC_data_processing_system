F&B industry
GMP certificate mandatory from 2019

The Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) is going to be made compulsory for all food and beverages products, by early 2019.
According to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA), the GMP certification should be obtained by all producers of food and beverages (F&B). However, food and beverage producers who have already obtained SLSI certification such as ISO, HACCP and FSSC need not obtain the GMP certificate.
The CAA said food and beverage producers and those selling foods and beverages can apply for the GMP certificate by either visiting the Sri Lanka Standard Institution office or obtaining an application form online.
According to the CAA, the rule will be enforced from March 1, 2019. The CAA will take strict action against food and beverages producers who do not obtain the necessary certification from the SLSI.
