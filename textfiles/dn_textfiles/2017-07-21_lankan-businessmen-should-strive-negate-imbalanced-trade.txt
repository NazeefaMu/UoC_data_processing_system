Lankan businessmen should strive to negate imbalanced trade

Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah invited the Sri Lankan business community to further explore emerging trade and investment opportunities to make Malaysia as a preferred export destination for Sri Lanka or as an ideal source of imports for local needs.
High Commissioner noted that existing trade and investment ties between Sri Lanka and Malaysia must be further enhanced since the contribution of Sri Lanka’s exports to Malaysia compared to Malaysia’s exports to Sri Lanka is getting imbalanced.
He was speaking at the 23rd annual general meeting of Sri Lanka-Malaysia business council, held in Colombo. “It is the objective of the Malaysian government to deepen trade and investment opportunities in potential sectors in Sri Lanka, and to this end, the Malaysian High commission in Sri Lanka is committed to promoting Sri Lanka as a potential investment destination among Malaysian business community.”
In 2015, total trade between Sri Lanka and Malaysia has grown by 12 percent compared to year 2015.
Sri Lanka’s textile exports to Malaysia have declined in the recent past and gem and semi precious businesses are also not marketed well in Malaysia.
The High Commissioner further noted that Sri Lankan government as well as the relevant authorities in the field of tourism industry should come up with a well -planned marketing campaign to promote Sri Lanka as a preferred designation among Malaysian travelers.
