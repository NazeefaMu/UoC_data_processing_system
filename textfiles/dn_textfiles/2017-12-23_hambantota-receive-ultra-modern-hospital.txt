Hambantota to receive ultra modern hospital

An ultra modern hospital will be built in Hambantota at a cost of Rs. 7 billion funded by the Netherlands. It will comprise 900 beds.
The hospital will have facilities to accommodate family members of warded patents and serve residents of Moneragala, Hambantota, and Ratnapura, the project director said.
Hambantota boasts an international sea port and a modern airport and the new 10 storey hospital to be set up on 10-acre land would bring the city to a modern era of development, he said.
