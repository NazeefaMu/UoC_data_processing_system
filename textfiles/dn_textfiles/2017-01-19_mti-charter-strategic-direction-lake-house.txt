MTI to charter strategic direction at Lake House

The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL) has selected international consultants MTI, to conceptualize, research, develop, deliver and help implement a comprehensive three year (2017-2019) strategic plan for ANCL Sri Lanka - covering all the different publications (current and planned) of the entire group.
“Given the fast paced changes taking place in the way news and entertainment is ‘consumed’, the Lake House publications needs to respond to the consequent challenges and opportunities. This requires a strategic assessment based direction for the entire group and we look forward to benefitting from MTI's international and local experience in strategising,” ANCL General Manager Abhaya Amaradasa said.
MTI CEO Hilmy Cader said “ MTI's 8S (r) - an internationally proven strategic planning model will be customised and used as the master model for the ANCL Strategic Plan Development. Initially, developed in 1999, MTI's 8S (r) has continuously improved, benefiting the robust experience of over 120 strategic planning projects - covering diverse categories, countries and business challenges. Each sub-module has a strong bottom-line focus and is supported by tools to ensure a bias for implementation”
A key feature of the MTI Consulting approach that will be applied to the ANCL project will be the focus on implementation. For each of the Strategic Initiatives in the ANCL Strategic Plan - an action plan (known as ‘Straction’) will be developed. This will address the key questions of: What needs to be specifically done?, How will it be done?, Who will do it?, When will it be done?, and a check on ‘If it has been done and How well it has been done? Post handing over the 3 Year Strategic Plan and Implementation Plans, MTI will carry Implementation Audits and report back the progress on how well ANCL is implementing it and recommendation on any corrective actions.
