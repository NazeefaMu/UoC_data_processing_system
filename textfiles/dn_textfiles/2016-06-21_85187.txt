Epic movie of the year is here

Ceylon Theatres once again gets ready to premier ‘Independence Day: Resurgence’ , an upcoming 2016 American Science fiction disaster film and a sequel to the 1996 film Independence Day. It stars Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Vivica A. Fox, Brent Spiner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Jessie Usher, Maika Monroe, Angelababy, Sela Ward and William Fichtner.
Two decades after the first Independence Day invasion, Earth is faced with a new extra-solar threat. But will mankind’s new space defenses be enough? We always knew they were coming back. After Independence Day redefined the event movie genre, the next epic chapter delivers a global spectacle on an unimaginable scale. Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program Earth Space Defense (ESD) to protect the planet with some military forces assembled on the Moon, Mars and Rhea. But nothing can prepare us for the aliens’ advanced and unprecedented force. The aliens were able to send a distress signal to their other battalions before their final defeat while others went into hiding elsewhere around the world. The aliens in deep space received the signal and sent a larger and more powerful battle fleet, threatening the human race once more. Only the ingenuity of a few brave men and women can bring the world back from the brink of extinction.
Independence Day: Resurgence in 3D will be screened at Majestic Cineplex. Show times 10.45 am / 1.45 pm / 4.45 pm / 7.30 pm Fri/Sat 10.30 pm and at Empire Cineplex at Independence Arcade at 10.30 am / 1.30 pm / 4.30 pm/ 7.30 pm Fri/Sat 10.30 pm
