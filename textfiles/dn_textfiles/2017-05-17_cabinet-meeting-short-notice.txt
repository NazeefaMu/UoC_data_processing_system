Cabinet meeting on short notice

President Maithripala Sirisena convened the weekly cabinet meeting yesterday amidst reports that it would not be held this week.
A minister speaking to Daily News said though they had been informed that there would be no meeting this week, a meeting had been called for under short notice.
Media had earlier reported that the meeting this week would not be held as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is attending China’s ‘One Belt One Road’ Forum in Beijing and the President had not set the date for the meeting this week at the last meeting; though it was the norm to do so.
The meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat is reported to have started at 10am and lasted for over 1.5 hours.
