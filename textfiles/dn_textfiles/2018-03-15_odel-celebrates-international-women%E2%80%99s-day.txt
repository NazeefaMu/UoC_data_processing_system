ODEL celebrates International Women’s Day

“Every Woman is a Queen” sang Queen Latifah, and on March 8, ODEL rolled out the right royal treatment for all women customers visiting its flagship store at Alexandra Place, to celebrate International Women’s Day with the élan and extravagance the store is reputed for.
Every woman entering the portals of the grand mansion on that day was greeted with a courteous bow and a gift of a branded cushion in purple, the colour associated with royalty, nobility and prestige, atop which sat a glittering tiara.
Themed ‘Feel Royal,’ the day’s programme included a throne at the Atrium with the expected accoutrements for photographs; discounts on all purchases of ladies’ wear; a gift of a necklace with every purchase at ‘Backstage’; discounts on food at the ‘Promenade’ food court; tea tasting with Dilmah at ‘Blend’ and purple coloured cupcakes at ‘Delight.’
“ODEL has always been a favourite rendezvous point for women because we offer everything they desire -- clothing, accessories, footwear, cosmetics, home ware and lifestyle products in an ambience that allows them to relax and enjoy a shopping experience that is unmatched in Sri Lanka,” a spokesperson for the store said.
“On International Women’s Day we raised the bar even higher with our ‘Feel Royal’ programme to recognise and celebrate women.”
