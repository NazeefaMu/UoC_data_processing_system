Over 400 killed in train accidents last year

A total of 405 persons were killed due to train accidents last year. During the past eight months, over 300 persons were killed due to train accidents, Railway Security Department officials said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, they said two persons died during the past 24 hours. One person committed suicide and the other died due to an accident. More than one death is reported, daily. Schoolboys travel on the trains’ footboards and insult railway security officers when warned, officials said.
Train commuters are more interested in catching a seat than safeguarding their lives. They try to get on to moving trains, fall and die.
This kind of accidents is now being reduced by narrowing the gap between the rail track and platform. However, passengers still behave in a reckless manner, they said.
Train commuters die due to various accidents when they travel between two compartments.
They walk on rail tracks located along the beach while using mobile phones.
They do not hear the sound of the train due to the call and the sound of the sea.
They are often run over by trains. Sometimes, they change the track and jump to the other track to escape from one train and get run over by the other train that comes on the other track, they added.
