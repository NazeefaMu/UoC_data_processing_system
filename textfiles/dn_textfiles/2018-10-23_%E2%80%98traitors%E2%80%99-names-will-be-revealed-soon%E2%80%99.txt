‘Traitors’ names will be revealed soon’

The names of traitors who try to destroy the unity of this government will soon be revealed, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said the President and Prime Minister should keep their promises made to the people on January 8, 2015 when establishing this ‘good governance’ government.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the `Seva Piyasa' at Horampella in Minuwangoda, recently.
Minister Senaratne said he always stood for good governance.
“Two good individuals were appointed as leaders of the country in 2015. But certain sections are trying to interfere with their decisions. Some did not know about the 2015 revolution and joined the government after the revolution,” he said.
“There are some who use politics to earn money. Some work to establish their names. People should take a decision about them. Some are trying to destroy the good governance. While one person goes to prison for keeping a gun, another gets bail after keeping 3,000 guns. This situation should change. Law should be implemented against all culprits,” he added.
