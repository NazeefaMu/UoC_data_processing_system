“Paintball”? It may soundbit nouveau in comparison with the other popular games in contemporary society. But it’s a fast growing new gaming concept, whichembarked in Sri Lanka nearly a decade agoespecially among youth.
In the 1980s’ paintball emerged in USA and if one says the game has its roots in the military, they would be correct. It was initiated with the intention of training military personnel. With the passage of time it embedded itselfin to society as a form of a game specially, among fun loving younger generations. While playing, the players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with paintballs. Today the game’s popularity has gone beyond borders and paintball competitions have become another popular worldwide event.
While speaking to us Gayan Wijetilake, Business Development Manager of Scan Products of C.W. Mackie PLC-the pioneering company who introduced jumbo peanut to the local market nearly 18 years ago, said “We always encourage emerging concepts, weare pleased to be the event organizer of this Paintball competition,we launchedit as an online campaign mainly via social media networks and I must say the responses were very satisfactory.
