Merkel risks all for refugees

GERMANY: There is a word for the relief many across Germany must have felt as Chancellor Angela Merkel missed out on a Nobel Prize for her stance on refugees: Schadenfreude.
The bookmakers’ favourite to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, Merkel lost out to a group dedicated to building democracy in Tunisia. The award saves her detractors the discomfort of seeing international honor bestowed on the chancellor for an open-door policy that is causing a storm at home, alienating political allies and a skeptical public.
Merkel’s approval ratings, already in decline after this year’s standoff with Greece, have plunged by a third since April to the lowest in almost four years. With her coalition partners openly querying her stance, Merkel looks to have lost her sure political touch, and has begun to attract comparisons with her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder.
He also took on his party and pushed through a socially divisive overhaul that was credited with turning the German economy around, only to be voted out for his troubles.
“For the first time, Merkel doesn’t care about the polls,” said Andrea Roemmele, a political scientist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “It’s about her chancellorship, it’s about her legacy.”
Having grown into Europe’s dominant leader over her decade in power, Merkel is testing the limits of public acceptance by rejecting calls to seal the border and saying Germany needs to set an example. The chancellor sees no alternative, won’t reverse course and accepts declining approval ratings as the price to pay, according to a person with direct knowledge of her views who asked not to be named. She is staking her political future on it, the person said.
With Volkswagen AG embroiled in an emission-cheating scandal, Deutsche Bank AG posting its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade and German exports declining the most since 2009, Merkel also faces growing economic headwinds as she tells Germans the country can handle 800,000 or more refugees this year.
“This is by far the biggest challenge during her chancellorship,” said Jan Techau, director of Carnegie Europe in Brussels. Merkel “clearly underestimated the pressure posed by the refugee crisis” and is pursuing a policy “which drives large parts of her party up the wall,” he said. “She’s risking a lot.”
By taking a stand based on humanitarian principles, Merkel is departing from the cautious, coalition-building approach that has served her well at home and in Europe. This time, she said in an hourlong interview on national television, her call for Germans to present “a friendly face” to the world’s refugees comes “from the heart.”
The Lutheran pastor’s daughter also draws a parallel with the changes that swept Europe after the Cold War and dealing with the stream of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria. Closing borders in Europe might sound like the answer, but is unrealistic — Merkel is not willing to build another wall in Europe, the person familiar with her thinking said.
Critics say Merkel is ignoring the day-to-day strains on ordinary Germans, the challenge of integrating Muslims and the risk of a political backlash in Germany, where no anti-immigrant party sits in the national parliament. Warnings have come from Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a Merkel confidant who is the top federal law-and-order official, and Joachim Gauck, the nation’s president, said the country’s ability to absorb refugees is limited. Merkel’s Social Democrat coalition partner is pressing her for stronger measures, including a cap on arrivals.
