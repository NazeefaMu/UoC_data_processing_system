Model musings

 
He swam against the tide and had not only survived it but had come out in top form. Treading into an industry which is mainly considered as a female dominant zone 23 year old Isanka Pramuditha Amarasinghe managed to clinch the ‘Face of Asia’ male award at the Asia Model Festival held in South Korea recently. He competed against around 62 contestants from 24 countries across the world to bag the win.
Put together with the goal of exhibiting Asian models and businesses related to the fashion scene, the Asia Model Festival has been developed as the core icon of Asia’s culture industry and a global culture platform. The winners of the competition get opportunities to brush up their modeling talents and grow up as globally renowned models.
Pramuditha and a female model named Deshani Liyanaarachchi were selected to take part in the Asia Model Festival from a mini pageant held at the Dutch Hospital in March. The models who competed at the event were trained by Gihan Dasanayaka. Face of Sri Lanka in association with Korea Model Association (KMA) organized the event as a means of promoting cultural relations between Sri Lanka and Korea.

“The finale comprised of three rounds: the traditional costume, face of Asia introduction and evening wear. We had a dancing competition in one of the earlier rounds and another mini pageant which selected the most photogenic contestant. There were 20 sponsor awards and I got the Panasonic Korea award and Lui and Lei best photo award,” he said.
He notes that the whole competition which ran from April 25 to May 6 was no walk in the park.
“Everyone was striving to present the best versions of themselves. Deciding on how to outshine them was a challenge. I believe that my appearance and catwalk was the key to success,” Pramuditha opined.
Apart from bagging the title of ‘Face of Asia’ male model, winning the Lui and Lei best photo award at the event has been the most memorable moment at the competition for Pramuditha mainly because it was the first mini pageant which kicked off the competition.
“That was held on the first day. We also had commercial shootings and photo shoots from various sponsors. They were all renowned international companies. We were given the opportunity to be the face of their products. How to pose with various types of products and how to present oneself in the best manner for commercials were some of the new things I learnt at the event,” he recalled.
He says that the Korean, Indian, and Chinese models were the toughest to beat as they not only possessed good looks but also had oodles of talent.
Pramuditha’s personal style is simple but elegant. He says that eveningwear suits him best because of his height and body shape. He has played cricket during his school days and has obtained colours for rugby at Kelaniya University.

Pramuditha is an old boy of Sri Jayawardanapura Maha Vidyalaya and Isipathana College, Colombo. His father, Prasad Amarasinghe, is employed as a security officer at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo. His mother, Priyanthi Amarasinghe, is a housewife. He has one brother, Sasanka Dulanjana, who is an undergraduate at Sri Jayewardenepura University. Pramuditha is currently in the final year at Kelaniya University.
“I started my modeling career once I turned 21. That was in 2016. I took part in the inter university modeling competition called Stylish Marketer which is conducted by the future marketers association of Kelaniya University and won first place. Brian Kerkoven choreographed the event and he trained me,” Pramuditha explained on how he got into the runway.
Pramuditha opines that height really matters for a male model. He is 6 feet 3.2 inches.
“That is one of the biggest advantages I possess and that got me the break I needed to get into modeling. My height and looks come from my genes. My parents have also been very supportive of me ever since I chose this path. My brother too has been my pillar of strength,” he said.

Unlike in the past years the industry has opened up more for male models to make their way to the ramp and photo shoots. Sri Lanka too has seen more male fashion enthusiasts making it to the limelight.
“It is true that there are many more opportunities for male models in various sectors now. However female models are still more in demand than males. I believe that holding male beauty pageants and male modeling competitions will change this aspect in the future,” he mused.
His advice to budding young models is to identify their strengths and weaknesses and work towards reducing their minus points.
“Concentrate on whatever you take up and give it your best shot,” he said.

With the ‘Face Of Asia’ male award
Winning the ‘Face of Asia’ male award and the Stylish Marketer title are not the only feathers on Pramuditha’s cap. He was the Hiru TV Aurudu Kumara in a competition organized by Hiru TV last year.
Winning the ‘Face of Asia’ male award is the biggest achievement in Pramuditha’s life.
“I feel so motivated by the feedback. I want to continue in the field as a professional model after my studies and get another international prize for Sri Lanka. My sights are set on winning the Mr World title in 2020. So fingers crossed!” he added with a smiled.
