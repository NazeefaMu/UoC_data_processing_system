Fielding and fitness levels criteria for selection

With the standard of Sri Lanka’s fielding being the talking point during the recently concluded series against Bangladesh the brain centre behind the team’s fitness and performance have drawn strict lines for selection to the national team.
“We have already put some plans for the players when it comes to fielding and we want certain things happening with fitness and fielding,” said Sri Lanka team cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
“Chairman of selectors, trainer and myself we are looking at certain things. We believe if the players are fitter, they will field, bat and bowl better. There was a clear message from the chairman of selectors and myself. We are not going to select players simply because they have scored heavily in domestic cricket. They need to achieve certain standards in fielding. Fitness has to be a certain standard as well,” he said.
“When you are playing games at higher intensity level, that’s where they struggle. When the Provincial tournament finishes, we will start training from May 2. We have to select the Champions Trophy side by April 25. So from May 2 we have time till May 17 before we go and we will have training sessions which are specific with fielding. Next week or so we will finalize our support staff to England and beyond. I have heard about Nic Pothas and we want the best support staff to go to England with us and beyond.”
The Sri Lanka players who are participating in the ongoing IPL tournament in India have also been given deadlines to return home and train with the national team prior to their departure to England for the Champions trophy.
“We have told the IPL players that they need to be back by a certain day. We are selecting the team by 25 April. The Board told them when they need to get back. They have to train with the team and get ready to go to England. We have given him Malinga permission,” said Gurusinha.
“Even if a player is not contracted, he is bound to come by the day the board tells him. Even Kumar Sangakkara when he wants to go and play for Surrey, the board has to release him.
"If there is no tour, we give permission to play full series, but otherwise they need to come back. Shakib Al Hasan for example has to return by May 4 as Bangladesh are playing a series. We have told our players to return a little later,” he said.
