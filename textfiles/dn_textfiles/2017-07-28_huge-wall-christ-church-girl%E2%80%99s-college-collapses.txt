Huge wall of Christ Church Girl’s College collapses

Due to uprooting of trees when clearing of mountainous areas for three storied school building:
A highly precipitous area having a protective wall of great height had been cleared using heavy machinery for the construction of a three storied school building.
As a result, a huge land area comprising boulders and rocks and the age-old protective wall constructed over the edge of the precipitous mountain in close proximity to the school building collapsed posing great dangers.
The motorable road to the Christ Church College had been closed due the risky location.
There are several residential houses in addition to water pumping tanks adjoining the damaged area of the Christ Church mountain. Cracks could be seen in the remaining part of the road leading to the church. Huge boulders, rocks and soil are visible at the location. Rev. Father Palitha who is residing in the Church, said the engineers attached to the Building Construction section of the Galle Education Office and private contractors who had undertaken the construction of the school building, should be held responsible due to their utter negligence and inefficiency in clearing the mountainous terrain.
