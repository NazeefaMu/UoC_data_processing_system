Methodist College Principal commends HASL awareness programmes on elders

Methodist College, Colombo, Principal Hiranya Fernando admired the series of educational seminars conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) to create the awareness for schoolchildren on elders and the importance of caring for them without sending them to elders' homes during the latter stages of their lives.
Principal Fernando made these remarks to over 1,000 students who were present at the Methodist College auditorium after their morning religious observances.
'Caring for elders and to create an environment for them to live with dignity' was the theme of the seminar.
Principal Fernando also urged young students not to isolate their parents and grandparents and to keep them within their family circle, considering the invaluable services rendered by them in the past.
HASL Youth Education Programme Director Geethal Mendis highlighted the value of caring for elders and reminded several stories related to elders and children. He said these awareness programmes could motivate the minds of children on the value of elders.
“Although there are many elders' homes in the country, according to statistics, it is happy to say that 98 percent of elders are still living with their families and not in Homes,” Mendis said
He also quoted few eminent personalities and said how they treated their parents without considering it as a burden during their twilight days.
Commenting on the programme, HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said HelpAge always promotes the close rapport between children, parents and grandparents and do not promote the concept of building elders' homes.
He said it is the paramount duty of children to look after elders with love, protection and care .
