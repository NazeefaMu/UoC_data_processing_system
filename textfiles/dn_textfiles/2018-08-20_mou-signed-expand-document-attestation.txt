MoU signed to expand document attestation

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry on August 16 to expand the document attestation services provided through the Electronic Document Attestation System (e-DAS) of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to Divisional Secretariats.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam and Home Affairs Ministry Secretary S.T. Kodikara signed the MoU in the presence of Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena during the Government Agents’ Conference held at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) recently. The MoU will enable expanding the Electronic Document Attestation System initially to 19 Divisional Secretariats in the Galle District. The facility will be extended to 332 Divisional Secretariats island-wide thereafter.
Connecting the Divisional Secretariats island-wide to the Electronic Document Attestation System will allow the public to have their required documentation processed at the nearest Divisional Secretariat without visiting the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo. People in the Northern Province who visit the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna for the purpose can have document attestation through their nearest Divisional Secretariats. The Canadian Government has donated equipment worth Rs. 6.8 million through the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the pilot project. Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena thanked the Canadian Government for the donation of equipment and requested all Government Agents to support to implement the Electronic Document Attestation System at the Divisional Secretariats in all districts. Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said the functioning of the Electronic Document Attestation System at the Divisional Secretariat level would effectively serve the migrant workers who annually remit foreign exchange here.
