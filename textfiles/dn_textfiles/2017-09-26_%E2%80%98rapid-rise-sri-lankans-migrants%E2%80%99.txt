‘Rapid rise in Sri Lankans migrants’

Sri Lankans leaving the country for employment, studies, settlement and other purposes shows an increasing trend over the past few years, the Senior Registrar in Community Medicine and the Head of the Health Care Quality Unit of the Department of Health in the Southern Province, Dr. Amila Chandrasiri said.
“Around 500,000 people undergo migrant health assessments every year. But in most instances, this is done as a requirement of destination country and not linked with referral and treatment services. Therefore, it doesn’t bring any benefit for the person and the country of origin,” he said.
The International Consultation on Pre-Departure Health Assessments “Migrant health assessments as a global public health good” will be held from September 26 to 27 at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka, he said. According to Dr. Chandrasiri, the Sri Lankan Health Ministry is finalising the National Guideline on Pre-Departure Migrant Health Assessment Services with the technical support of International Organization for Migrant to strengthen the pre-departure health assessment services in the country and provide optimum care for the state health system.
"But this opportunity will help Sri Lanka to detect previously unknown disease conditions, refer them to proper medical care and ultimately reduce the disease burden in the country and in world as a whole. "Therefore, it’s high time to incorporate this Pre Departure Health Assessment to the national health service and respective disease control programmes.
