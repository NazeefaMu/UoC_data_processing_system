EXPLORING CREATIVE FREEDOM

Sensuality, beauty, intimacy, freedom, courtship, women and village scenery were some of the themes featured at ‘Sri Lankan Art’ the annual exhibition of the George Keyt Foundation held recently at the J. D. A. Perera Gallery, University of Visual and Performing Arts.
The works of art captured the diverse moods of the artists who used a combination of brilliant hues along with contours of the human body to create artwork that had depth and meaning to it. Some paintings captured the beauty and vastness of the ocean, another touched on architecture. The majesty of the feline was depicted in one painting. The crowd gathered witnessed something special that day as they saw works that were both personal and inspired by society. There was a sense of freedom in the paintings depicting sensuality, as these artists did not adhere to convention.

George Keyt Foundation, Chairman and Board of Trustees, Michael Anthonisz said the importance of art in any society cannot be stressed enough and it must be acknowledged. The interest in art is always appreciated by the George Keyt Foundation.
“The Chief Guest Bangladesh High Commissioner, M. Riaz Hamidullah is very much involved with the arts. He follows and promotes arts and shows great interest and keenness in this field. We have been having discussions with him to have a joint show of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh art because people in Sri Lanka need to see Bangladeshi Art. He is very keen on this. I am sure the High Commissioner will like what he sees and will appreciate it,” said Anthonisz.
Bangladesh High Commissioner, M. Riaz Hamidullah, pointed out that art connects Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lankans will be pleased to know that last September around four Sri Lankan artists were in Bangladesh for a whole month for the Asian Art Biennale. This event has been happening for quite some time and Sri Lankan artists have been going to Bangladesh. In art we have so much in common. So we must really take this connection seriously because Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have a lot to share in art. Art is something that liberates the artist’s mind and that is how it should be viewed. That is the power of art,” said Hamidullah.
NTB, Head of Cards, Niluka Gunatilakecommented that art is a discipline that defines a society and that Nations Trust Bank is proud to sponsor this year’s exhibition once more.
“We are old friends with the foundation and we greatly value their service to Art in Sri Lanka. This is platform for local artists to develop themselves and get valuable exposure. George Keyt Foundation is doing something commendable promoting our local artists. The exhibitions have all been of high standard. NTB is always willing to sponsor arts in Sri Lanka and has done so by getting involved in a number of art events in Sri Lanka over the years. We are always willing to enrich the field of arts in Sri Lanka. Through events like this we are able to play a role in shaping our country,” said Gunatilake.
George Keyt Foundation Trustee, Nihal Rodrigo, called George Keyt a man who attracted much interest due to his interesting personality. Rodrigo pointed out that this exhibition is a gold mine.
“We were friends of old to each other. He was a talented painter and this is his legacy. This event is very commendable because of the advantages it gives to the local artists. The younger artists get much experience and are able to sell their paintings. It is encouraging and they are able to join prestigious companies. They can have an excellent future. They get a better appreciation of people and how to conduct themselves. At the end of the day they have a positive experience. Some pictures depict life in Sri Lanka, and foreign dignitaries and foreigners love to purchase these pictures. It is important that people see these events,” said Rodrigo.
Artist Feroza Rafeek’sabstract painting, oil on Canvas features three layers of work that took her three weeks. “Here I portray a busy life. You can see the people are very busy on the street. The meaning is hidden and you have to think a lot when contemplating what it is. I hope people will like this. I am a huge fan of abstract and oil paintings. You can sense the emotions here,” said Rafeek.
Artist Charita Lay’s, beautiful painting was of her daughter. Lay feels that the painting has been done really well due to the fact that so many people are giving her positive feedback.
“People really love it and I am so happy about it. My daughter is coming here to know what other people think of the painting. She is really keen on hearing what other people think. I dressed her up because I have done bridal dressing and I was a hair dresser. I have experience in dressing the bride and dressing a woman and I can do it on the canvas. The place where I created it was in my house, I know how to make the light and shade work for me,” said Lay.
The eyes are the gateway between your soul and creation. They capture creation and remember it. They draw creation deep into you where it mingles with the soul and what comes out is Art – the offspring of the soul and creation. The George Keyt Foundation are worshippers of this ancient form of expression.
