The hybrid court riddle

Nearly a week after the release of the much talked about OHCHR report on alleged war crimes during the final stages of war in Sri Lanka, the UNP and the SLFP, the two mainstream parties in the political sphere of the country, are still discussing about its outcome. The SLFP, which had ultra-nationalist leaning during the tenure of its former Chairman Mahinda Rajapaksa, appointed a top level committee, headed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, to study the reforms and come up with recommendations on the path the party should take when it comes to the Geneva issue. The very appointment of former President Kumaratunga, a politician who has a liberal mindset when it comes to ethnic and religious matters, shows that the party is ready to come out of the ultra-nationalist cocoon under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Geneva issue was raised at the UPFA Parliamentary group meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday evening. However, the MP group collectively decided to defer the matter as the report was still being studied by the committee headed by former President Kumaratunga. At the same time, the party has decided to seek the assistance of a group of top level lawyers to study the concept of “hybrid court”, an alien term to the Sri Lankan judicial system. From the media statements issued by some senior parliamentarians of the SLFP over the past few days, one can assume that the SLFP is willing to work with the UNP to find a solution to the Geneva issue. That was, to a great extent, a result of President Maithripala Sirisena’s moves to consolidate his power in the SLFP, sometimes at the expense of his own popularity.
The UNP, on the other hand, discussed the OHCHR report, inter alia, at the party’s Working Committee meeting held on Monday evening. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaking at the Working Committee members, that there was no reason to worry about the Geneva issue as the international community had faith in the Sri Lankan government and its commitment to genuine measures towards accountability and reconciliation. He indicated that there would be a “consensus” of some sort among international community over the domestic inquiry mechanism initiated by the Sri Lankan government.
“Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe saved the former President from the “electric chair”, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe quipped at the UNP Working Committee meeting, summing up the outcome of the initial stages of the UNHRC session.
“Maybe because they too hail from the Southern Province, like Rajapaksa,” a jovial Prime Minister told his party colleagues who attended the second Working Committee meeting after the Parliamentary election. He said the outcome of the 30th session of the UNHRC was a victory for the Sri Lankan government as the international community was arriving at a common ground on a domestic inquiry mechanism, compromising on their call for an international investigation. “Some people are only clinging to one term – the hybrid court. There is no decision as such. What we will do is a domestic inquiry and there should not be any doubt about it,” the Prime Minister explained.
Wording of the draft resolution leaves space for negotiations, compromises
Over the past few days, there were extensive discussions among top echelons of the government over the manner in which Sri Lanka should tackle the call for a “hybrid court”. On Saturday morning, they were relieved to see the early draft of the US sponsored resolution which did not use the contentious term “hybrid court”.
The first draft of the US sponsored resolution said,
“Encourages the new Government of Sri Lanka to respect its positive commitment to bolster and safeguard the credibility of these justice processes by engaging in broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, from all affected communities that will inform the design and implementation of these processes, as well as assistance from international experts and the international community throughout the process, and to ensuring strong and effective witness and victim protection measures are in place;
Welcomes the government’s recognition that accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka in the justice system, takes note with appreciation of the Government of Sri Lanka’s proposal to establish a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, as applicable; and affirms that credible transitional justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for integrity and impartiality; and calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka, to involve international investigators, prosecutors and judges in Sri Lanka’s justice processes;
Encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to review and, where required, reform domestic law to ensure that it allows for prosecution of the full range of crimes under domestic and international law involving violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law;”
The key policy makers of the government, over the weekend, extensively analyzed the ‘wording’ of the first draft of the resolution and its connotation. They were of the view that the non-existence of the term “hybrid court” in the draft resolution was a key indication on the international community’s willingness to cooperate with the Sri Lankan government on this particular matter. The early draft of the resolution, though it referred to the “involvement of international investigators, prosecutors and judges in Sri Lanka’s justice processes”, remained vague on the level of that involvement. That provided a wide opening for the Sri Lankan government to work its way into a consensus.
On the other hand, the early draft is expected to undergo several changes within the next one and a half weeks. “First version of the draft is a “maximalist version” of the resolution. It usually leaves space for negotiations and compromises. Therefore, Sri Lanka’s response to the draft resolution will play a key role in the final resolution which will be presented to the UNHRC session,” a senior retired diplomat told the Daily News on Monday.
Aryasinha’s response to draft resolution on SL
Sri Lanka’s official response to the draft resolution was given by Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha, in his opening statement to the first informal consultation on the draft resolution on Sri Lanka. Aryasinha said the draft resolution’s text is reparative, judgmental and prescriptive and not in keeping with the spirit of the process of reconciliation and reform underway in Sri Lanka.
“It was also pointed out that all these mechanisms will be evolved and designed through a wide process of consultations involving all stakeholders including victims, communities, political parties, civil society representatives, the military, the High Commissioner and his office, bilateral partners, relevant international organisations as well as members of the diaspora who wish to be consulted. It was also explained that we expect the mechanisms to be designed in a manner that they would have the necessary freedom to obtain assistance - financial, material and technical, from our international partners including the OHCHR.
Taking office following the elections on January 8, has clearly demonstrated, through a series of actions, the intention to ensure meaningful culture and society based on the rule of law and good governance, promote and protect human rights, uphold democracy, and the universal values of equality, justice and freedom. I do not, on this occasion, endeavor to list out the many measures that have been taken since January 8, including legislative measures. I am sure that all of you, who have watched Sri Lanka closely, are aware of all these details.
In this context, what we urge from our friends in this room and beyond is understanding, patience, assistance, encouragement, support, trust, goodwill and faith. At a time when we have a new Government that is adopting a calmly different path to that which was followed in the era before January 8, the expectation is, naturally, that there would be a similar change in tone, tenor, and even strategy on the part of the Council as well.
As you are aware, the government, on its own volition, and conviction that it has to do right by all her people, has already commenced taking steps to address many of the concerns in the previous resolutions and reports as well.
Further, given that both the HCHR’s report (A/ HRC/30/ 61) and the Report on the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) (A/HRC/30/SRP.2) recognizes that the report represents a ‘human rights investigation’ and not a ‘criminal investigation’, emphasizing excessively on the criminal justice aspects, makes the resolution imbalanced. It would be more helpful to have a holistic approach when making recommendations in this resolution on promoting reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
We also remain concerned regarding the formulations provided in several of the Operative paragraphs. Certain terminology used such as ‘verification’, is new and intrusive language to be presented in a human rights resolution, especially when the country concerned is engaging with the international community including with the OHCHR,” Aryasinha said in his speech.
It does not require a lot of wisdom to understand that Aryasinha, towards the latter part of his speech, is referring to the part that calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka, to involve international investigators, prosecutors and judges in Sri Lanka’s justice processes. It can be assumed that ta compromise will be reached on “international prosecutors and judges” participating in Sri Lanka’s judicial process. There is a possibility that Sri Lanka may accept an international panel of judges and legal luminaries acting as “observers” overseeing the entire process, without actively taking part in it. That is an arrangement to which Sri Lanka can agree without ‘upsetting’ the majority’s sentiments back home!
It is crystal clear that the Sri Lankan government and other member nations of the UNHRC do not want to go for a want on the resolution on Sri Lanka. Therefore, Sri Lanka’s position on the domestic inquiry mechanism is likely to be accepted by the UNHRC, probably with an assurance of its engagement with international stakeholders.
Zeid playing “bad cop” and US playing “good cop”?
Meanwhile, former Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to Geneva and a vociferous critique of the new government, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, commenting on the draft resolution of the US, said that while UNHRC Chief Prince Zeid is playing the role of the ‘bad cop’ with regard to Sri Lanka, the US is playing the role of the ‘good cop.’
In an interview journalist Michael Gregson on Tuesday, Jayatilleka said that while Zeid is urging a hybrid court, the US is apparently coming to the rescue saying a domestic mechanism with international component. Jayatilleka added that this is an old known tactic of the US. However, the Sri Lankan government seems to be going along with this, he argued. Sri Lanka's support for the US proposal will prevent countries which are against such a systems from taking any step against it, Jayatilleka also said.
Sri Lanka’s closest neighbour India is likely to play a key role in the whole process. India’s support, needless to say, will work in Sri Lanka’s favour when it comes to watering down of the resolution and determining the outcome of the Geneva session. It is in this backdrop that a high profile Sri Lankan delegation, led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, visited India last week for bilateral discussions. It was Prime Minister Wickremesinghe;s first visit to a foreign nation after assuming office as the Prime Minister for the fourth time. Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who was attending the opening session of the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council is Geneva, left for India to join the Sri Lankan delegation visiting New Delhi.
Highly placed diplomatic sources told the Daily News that India was unlikely to support a resolution supporting an international investigation in Sri Lanka or a “hybrid court”, as suggested by the UNHRC Chief. Instead, India will support a credible domestic inquiry mechanism initiated by Sri Lanka’s law enforcement bodies, with the assistance of international stakeholders.
India’s stance over “hybrid court”
“India is unlikely to digress from the statement it made over US sponsored resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council session in 2014,” a top diplomatic source told the Daily News.
Explaining India’s position at the last year’s UN Human Rights Council session where the majority of member nations gave a mandate to the OHCHR to conduct an inquiry into alleged war crimes during the final phase of war in Sri Lanka, the Indian delegation to the session it was not in a position to support an inquiry mechanism that was “intrusive.”
The delegation, in its statement explaining the abstention from voting said, “as the closest neighbour with thousands of years of relations with Sri Lanka, we cannot remain untouched by developments in that country. Since the end of the armed conflict, India remains engaged in a substantial way in the relief, resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction process in Sri Lanka. We have extended substantial assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka in its efforts for resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons, de-mining, education, connectivity, livelihood restoration, economic revival, etc. This has contributed towards return of a modicum of normalcy to the Northern and Eastern provinces.
In asking the OHCHR to investigate, assess and monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, the resolution ignores the progress already made by the country in this field and places in jeopardy the cooperation currently taking place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the OHCHR and the Council's Special Procedures. Besides, the resolution is inconsistent and impractical in asking both the Government of Sri Lanka and the OHCHR to conduct investigations simultaneously.
India believes that it is imperative for every country to have the means of addressing human rights violations through robust national mechanisms. The Council's efforts should therefore be in a direction to enable Sri Lanka to investigate all allegations of human rights violations through comprehensive, independent and credible national investigative mechanisms and bring to justice those found guilty. Sri Lanka should be provided all assistance it desires in a cooperative and collaborative manner.
It has been India's firm belief that adopting an intrusive approach that undermines national sovereignty and institutions is counterproductive. Any significant departure from the core principle of constructive international dialogue and cooperation has the potential to undermine efforts of this Council for promoting universal respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Moreover, any external investigative mechanism with an open-ended mandate to monitor national processes for protection of human rights in a country, is not reflective of the constructive approach of dialogue and cooperation envisaged by UN General Assembly resolution 60/251 that created the HRC in 2006 as well as the UNGA resolution 65/281 that reviewed the HRC in 2011.”
One has every reason to assume that India’s position has been further strengthened by the new government of Sri Lanka as it repaired ties with India during the post-January 08 period.
Another key issue that drew the attention of Sri Lankan authorities was the necessity of new laws to conduct the domestic inquiry process. Some sections of the legal fraternity argued that the new laws might need to have “retrospective effect” as the domestic mechanism was investigating into alleged war crimes perpetrated before May, 2009. In the opening statement made by Sri Lankan Foreign Minister at the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council last week, there were strong indications that new legal measures would be introduced to strengthen the domestic investigation.
According to the present constitution of the country, Parliament does have the right to make laws including laws having retrospective effect and repealing or amending any provision of the Constitution or adding any provision to the Constitution (Art.75), the only restriction being that there can be no ex post facto criminal statutes under the Constitution unless the law is based on general principles of International Law recognised by the community of nations. A well-known example of ex post facto criminal legislation was the Offence against Aircraft Act of 1982 passed by the Parliament pursuant to Art. 18 (6) of the Constitution to incorporate international criminal law of hijacking of planes into Sri Lanka domestic law to convict Sepala Ekanayake of a crime that was not a crime in Sri Lanka at the time of the hijacking.
In this context, it is important to understand that the two thirds majority in Parliament will be a key factor in this regard. Therefore, any action taken in this regard will have to be approved by the UNP and the SLFP, the two largest parties in Parliament which are presently working together within the framework of a national unity government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
