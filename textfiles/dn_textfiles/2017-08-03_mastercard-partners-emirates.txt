“We are delighted to partner with Mastercard on this promotion that offers added value to our passengers. We believe that this will give Mastercard cardholders yet another reason to traverse the world with Emirates,” said Devika Ellepola, Emirates’ Regional Sales Manager. “With the steady rise in the number of Sri Lankans traveling abroad for business and leisure, we are excited to partner with Emirates and offer discounts on their Mastercard cards.”
