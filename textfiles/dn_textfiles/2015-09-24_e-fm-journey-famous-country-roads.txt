E FM to journey the famous Country Roads

Sri Lanka's Lifestyle station E FM recently announced its sponsorship of the 2015 edition of the highly respected Country Roads concert for children, South Asia's longest running concert series, now in its 27th year, which is known for donating all its proceeds to children's charities in Sri Lanka.
To be held at the Main Ballroom of the Mount Lavinia Hotel on Sunday, October 11 from 6.30pm, 2015's Country Roads concert for children features a stellar line-up of Sri Lankan acts, including the locally popular Flame along with Cosmic Rays and Mariazelle, while Folk singer Astrid Brook from the UK and Country and Western band the Mavericks from Germany will also perform.
Additionally, children's charities partnered in 2015 include the Meth Mihira School of Special Education, Koralawella, Moratuwa, run by the Sisters' Of Charity - the Children's Heart Project of Sri Lanka, currently supporting the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital and donations of musical equipment to Kudaligama Central College, Kalutara, with charitable contribution also accepted via www.help.lk for the very first time.
"Sri Lanka's Lifestyle station E FM is proud to come forward and support the well respected Country Roads concert series, now in its 27th year. As well as always being happy to assist any worthwhile music project, especially one where all proceeds go directly towards children's charities locally, we see this as an added opportunity to highlight local bands and even diverse areas of music, which may prove interesting to our loyal fans", EBC Radio Chief Operating Officer Chalaka Gajabahu said on the partnership.
