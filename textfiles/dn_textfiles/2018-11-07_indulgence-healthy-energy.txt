Indulgence in healthy energy

If you walk or make a visit to the cities of the Western Province /or places close to your abodes or residences, you will see massive name boards displaying one specific word or eye-catching term SPA in big, bold letters in a very competitive and crisscross fashion.
It is very attracting and at the same time, inviting the general public to experience at least for once the SPA -Ayurvedic treatment, a body massage to keep oneself fit.
Although down the ages, there had been a number of traditional ways and means of keeping oneself physically fit, now in the technically advanced world, despite the advancement of science and technology, there is a tendency to go down the memory lane of yesteryear searching the past, the age-old systems of keeping human body and mind healthy.
Researchers in this vital field of healthy living, leave no stone unturned and make all efforts to surface to get the best of those systems, buried with the passage of time and mix them, with the modern trends and make the massage centres popular around the world.
A word about Sri-Lankan Ayurvedic resorts before the now famous Spas come into operation will not be out of place.
The Sri Lankan Ayurvedic resorts for decades remain among the best in the world. The westerners are very much attracted to them, due to its more holistic approach in place of conventional medicine.
Sri Lanka Ayurvedic resorts are centres of healing as they are based on the Ayurvedic principle of balance body, mind and soul.
Ayurveda, one of the world's oldest forms of healing, and its origin in India go back to ages well over 3,000 years or more. The Sinhalese kings lost no time in embracing and pioneered in establishing Ayurveda Treatment Centres in the ancient cities of the kingdoms like Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa they ruled.
Sri Lankans who run Spas of the day, in the towns and the cities, a money-spinning, lucrative business, could run the centres with their heads held high with just pride being intact with their roots, and by introducing some of the indigenous treating methods as a novelty to the body massage.
The local SPA centres, it is said, should stress on the importance of following the Ayurvedic process, methodically to fit in with the Asian climatic conditions, akin to Sri Lanka.
Gazing at the word or the term SPA, when I saw it first, with the troubled mind I was trying to pronounce it and understand the meaning it conveys.
My inquisitive mind was not at rest until I found what stands behind the word or term SPA.
The word SPA comes from the name given to the Belgium town Spa.
The town SPA claims to be famous for its range of mineral water exports worldwide and is the cynosure being very closely knit to the world-renowned Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps which hosts the world acclaimed Belgian Grand Prix (an automobile race) annual.
It was here in Spa, the very first world beauty pageant Concours de Beaute was held on September 19, 1888, and it hosted the stage two, of the year 2010 Tour de France on July 5th of that year.
Perusing the notes I have collected during the past few decades on matters related to Western and Eastern Philosophy as a student of Philosophy, and keenly interested in knowing the role Ayurveda play in promoting Eastern and Asian medicine and health patterns during the times of Maha Bharatha or Greater India, I came across phrase in Latina Lingua for term SPA bringing solace to my worrying mind.
While you keep guessing what the meaning of SPA is in Latin, I want to say that by browsing the internet, I learnt that SPA, which now seems to be very popular here, is the name for one of the towns found in Belgium from the times of Romans.
Thus the SPA, which is very popular among locals (although they may not know why Sri Lankans call massage centres SPA) originates, makes reference to a Belgium town, a healing site of fame, the cold spring, frequented by many, as a watering-place as early as the 14th century.
The SPA, the Municipality of Liege Province in Belgium is situated within a valley, in the Ardennes mountains 22 miles or 35 kilometres to the Southeast of Liege and 28 miles or 45 kilometres to the Southwest of Aachen.
SPA, the oldest, iron and steel centre created around the year 1335 in Belgium, within the border of the Province of Liege, is one of the main tourist cities of fame. This was owing to the fact, of water found here was of very high therapeutic value with medicinal properties and the Romans knew about it.
This spring called espa, in Walloon, a word for fountain, dialect spoken by the people in Wallonia in South Belgium.
This location where the natural mineral waters with curative power springs is an attracting site for tourists. Hence it is called Aquae Spadaanae and the term SPA indicates the availability of mineral water necessary for body massage.
It is on record that the Greeks were responsible for introducing and in opening bathing regimens, which laid the foundation for, now world famous Spa process and procedures.
Human society from the prehistoric times, or from the times of its origin had a strong belief that spring water has curative powers for ailments from which humans suffer.
Based on this belief there are SPA towns and SPA resorts including hot spring resorts, run offering typical heath treatment varieties and there one special treatment, and it is known as balneotherapy.
It is a therapeutic use of bathing agents such as mineral and thermal waters, mud and gases.
It is very popular across the globe but in a very special way it has caught the minds of the polity living both in Europe and Japan.
These centres provide quite a popular Day Spas variety, ensuring personal care treatment.
The term or the word SPA, taken in itself means fountain and also means to gush forth.
Some are of the view that the word Spa comes from Latin spagere means to scatter, sprinkle and fountain.
The SPA, our readers by now are very familiar with, said to stands for good Health Through Water.
Some claim that the SPA is an acronym (a word formed using the first letters of various words) of Latin phases like Salus Per Aquam ( as used by Dr Jeffrey Rosenberg). Translated that into English it means health through water.
Spas Research Fellowship uses the term “sanitas per aquas”- ‘health through water’. The British Spas Federation says ‘senare per aqua’.
Of course, there is no historical background to this lengthy Latin phase and some holds the view that this Latin phrase came into use in the 20th century.
Whatever it is, one must on guard, and be careful in entering the SPA whether they are Ayurvedic or not, as the tendency is there to turn massage centres into brothel houses by brushing the vital body parts for immoral acts.
The searching eye of the lawmakers and the police are around the corner to arrest those brothel houses run under the SPA screen.
