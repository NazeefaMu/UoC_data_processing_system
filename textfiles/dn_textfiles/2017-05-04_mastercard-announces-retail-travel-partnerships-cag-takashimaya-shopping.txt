Mastercard announced that it is now the preferred card partner for the number one airport in the world, Changi Airport (CAG), as well as leading shopping destination in Singapore, Takashimaya Shopping Centre.

With the introduction of Mastercard as the preferred card partner for Changi Airport and Takashimaya Shopping Centre, Mastercard continues to build on its road-map of fostering strategic collaborations in the travel retail segment.
In line with its commitment to bring cardholders closer to their passions and deliver the best that Singapore has to offer, Mastercard plans to captivate existing cardholders and attract new customers with exclusive rewards and benefits.

“Our goal is to ensure that all our travelling, visiting and local cardholders have access to a stellar line-up of Mastercard rewards and benefits. From purchasing gifts and souvenirs at Changi Airport to buying a new outfit or dining at selected restaurants at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, we would like to provide our cardholders with incredible deals, compelling offers and rewards for their loyalty," said Deborah Heng, Country Manager, Mastercard Singapore,"We are very excited to have partnered with two of Singapore’s iconic shopping and tourist landmarks, Changi Airport Group and Takashimaya Shopping Centre and look to develop more strategic partnerships with leading brands to deliver priceless retail, lifestyle and travel experiences for our customers."
James Fong, Changi Airport Group’s Vice President of Landside Concessions, said, “We are delighted to embark on this partnership with Mastercard, which has helped us to create even more value for our visitors and travelers. With an exciting pipeline of exclusive events and promotions curated for Mastercard cardholders, shoppers and diners at Changi Airport will certainly be in for a treat.

Shuichi Hidaka, General Manager, Shopping Centre Management, Takashimaya Shopping Centre, said, “We are dedicated to providing world-class services and products to all our customers. This partnership with Mastercard will enable us to deliver even more value to our shoppers. We are committed to strengthening our partnership network to foster stronger and more engaging relationships with our customers.”
As the preferred card partner for Changi Airport, both overseas (business and/or leisure travelers) and local cardholders will have access to all available benefits and rewards. The partnership also allows for all Mastercard cardholders to enjoy benefits for in-airport promotions and events if they sign up for the Changi Rewards membership program, which is an added bonus to all cardholders.
