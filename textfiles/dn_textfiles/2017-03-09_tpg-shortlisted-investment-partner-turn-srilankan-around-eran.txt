TPG shortlisted as investment partner to turn SriLankan around: Eran

The American Private Equity firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) has been shortlisted as the main investment partner to turn SriLankan Airlines around,Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Wickramaratne who addressed a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday, said they had chosen TPG to continue with negotiations which are expected to last a minimum of six months.
Apart from TPG, two other companies; PeaceAir Pvt Ltd and the Maldivian Company Super Group Partners were also chosen from the original nine bidders for SriLankan Airlines.
“TPG is a famous private equity fund and it has experience turning airlines around,” explained the Deputy Minister and added that TPG had also come forward to bid for Sri Lankan in 1997 when the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga government was looking for a buyer for the airline. At the time, the government chose to go with Emirates which ran the company at a profit for 10 years until it was kicked out in 2008.
The Ministry however has also indicated that it was open to work with other airlines in managing SriLankan Airlines in addition to negotiating with TPG. Though TPG has a sound financial background, there are worries that as an equity firm, it would be looking for short term gains unlike an established airline which would look to invest and develop the ailing national carrier on a long term basis.
