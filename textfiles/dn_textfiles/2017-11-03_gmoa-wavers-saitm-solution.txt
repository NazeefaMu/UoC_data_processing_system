GMOA wavers on SAITM solution

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) does not accept the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue as the final solution, GMOA secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that responding to the proposals, the GMOA pointed out the possibility of finding a final solution through the set of proposals presented by the Government.
He said the proposals have both plus and minus points. There are commendable proposals and confusing proposals.
That is why the GMOA made a request from the President to discuss the unclear areas of the proposals and the GMOA’s stand on the proposals.
GMOA does not accept the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue as the final solution, he added.
