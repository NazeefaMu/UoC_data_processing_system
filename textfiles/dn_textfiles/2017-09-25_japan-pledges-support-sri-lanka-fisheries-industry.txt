Japan pledges support to Sri Lanka fisheries industry

 
The Japanese Government has pledged to extend its fullest support to develop Sri Lanka's Fisheries Industry and also to strengthen Japanese market opportunities for Sri Lankan seafood exports, Fisheries Ministry sources said.
This was confirmed by Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Masahisa Sato during a discussion held with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who is currently on an official tour to Japan.
During the discussion held between the State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan and the Sri Lankan Fisheries Minister, attention was drawn to the development of the fish processing industry of Sri Lanka.
Accordingly it was discussed as to how the Japanese government can extend their further assistance to boost the production of traditional Japanese raw-fish products of Sushi and Sashimi.  
Sri Lanka is currently manufacturing Japanese traditional meals such as sushi and Sashimi which is made out of Tuna fish and they pay around Rs 30,000 per kilogram of these processed Tuna fish products.
During the discussion, Minister Amaraweera said that Japan is purchasing around 12 percent of Sri Lankan fisheries exports and they purchase around 700 metric tons of Tuna fish annually, Ministry sources said.
