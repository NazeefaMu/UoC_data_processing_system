Uncapped pace bowler Duanne  Olivier  to replace Abbott: Third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday

JOHANNESBURG, Monday : Uncapped pace bowler Duanne Olivier has been included in South Africa' squad for the final Test against Sri Lanka starting in Johannesburg on January 12 following the axing of Kyle Abbot, who quit international cricket in favour of a Kolpak deal with Hampshire.
Oliver, 24, is the leading first-class wicket-taker for the season with 28 wickets at 21.60 in the Sunfoil Series. Wayne Parnell has retained his place in the squad, and there is a chance South Africa could consider an all-pace attack at the Wanderers, a venue which is likely to further challenge Sri Lanka's vulnerabilities against pace and movement, after they conceded the series with a 282-run defeat in Cape Town.
Uncapped Theunis de Bruyn also keeps his place as the reserve batsman, although there are unlikely to be any changes in that department unless injuries occur. The match will mark Hashim Amla's 100th Test.
Meanwhile, AB de Villiers and Morne Morkel will play for Northerns next week with a view to them being available for selection for the final T20 against Sri Lanka ahead of the one-day series.
De Villiers, who quit the Test captaincy prior to the Sri Lanka series, has not played since the CPL in July due to an elbow injury.
Morkel has been recovering from a back injury which has limited him to one first-class outing this season.
South Africa squad: Faf du Plessis (capt), Duanne Oliver, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Theunis de Bruyn, Quinton de Kock (wk), JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Keshav Maharaj, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada.
