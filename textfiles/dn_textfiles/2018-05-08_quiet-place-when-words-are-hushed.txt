A Quiet Place: When words are hushed

Contrary to tranquillity and calmness apparently evoked in the title, ‘A Quiet Place’ is placed under horror genre. The movie does not entertain a ghostly figure in a white robe. Instead, it transports you to the Jurassic Park plane of fright. The difference unfolds as the creature is scarier and uglier than the colossal reptiles of the Steven Spielberg adventure movie.
You have to come to terms with this alien. It is so colossal. It is so strong. But it is blind. Beware though, for the blind alien can strike you at the slightest hint of a sound. The blind alien rests somewhere close to your living quarters. You are free from danger as long as you do not make any noise.
What could such a world be like? If you happen to picture a world without sound for a second, John Krasinski is there to show you how one whole family managed to beat the odds for one and half hour on the wide screen without sound.
A family of five communicates with each other in sign language almost throughout the film. A soundless phenomenon enhances the visual effect of the cinema medium. Doing without the sounds, however, comes with a tough challenge for the director and the scriptwriter.
They both overcome this hurdle with a carefully crafted script. The script walks the viewer through a powerful imagery of a timer, a pregnant mother struggling to hush down her labour pains and her fight to keep herself silent amid the pain caused from an exposed nail on the stairs. This imagery comes in handy especially when the sequence reaches a state of boredom occasionally.
The sound is a dangerous phenomenon especially when blindness lurks behind. With that recurring element, the movie moves on to another premise: disability. The alien is blind, that is open to view. But a little later, we are introduced to another with a disability. Regan, the daughter of the family, is deaf. While the people with no disabilities struggle to survive, the two disabled creatures roam carefreely. When one faculty is impaired the other faculties tend to improve. That is so in the case of the blind alien who reacts to the slightest noise albeit with an exception. It cannot bear blaring noises.
As the family moves about silently flanked by the sign-language communication, the viewer enters a rich plateau of mindfulness. You need to be extraordinarily careful about your own movements when you are in a vulnerable zone. Make a trivial sound come out, and the danger is right behind you! That awareness installs you in a deeper plain of concentration.
Necessity is the mother of invention, according to an English proverb. The character of Lee, the father of the family played by the director, brings it home. The trauma of a blind alien on one hand and a family to protect on the other hand compels Lee to sacrifice his free time for research. His findings hung on the wall – if not for the trivial spelling errors – turn out to be remarkable. Over time, he manages to explore the Achilles heel of the mighty alien.
As the battle between sound and sight embroils, the movie plot meanders to other themes. Therein roams a protective and affectionate family man. Despite his fully bearded face, Lee is not short of subtle expression. That expression epitomises the parental love which goes unnoticed and misunderstood in most cases. For instance, Regan misunderstands her father following several incidents.
But that misunderstanding has never been reciprocal. Even at his final moment, Lee expresses his love to the daughter in the sign language and later makes use of the rarely used sound to sacrifice himself for the sake of his family.
The first to sacrifice was the littlest member of the family. Ironically he invents the remedy to escape the catastrophe.
Whether ‘A Quiet Place’ can be considered a masterpiece remains a puzzle. Nevertheless, the themes and elements stand out subtly. The simple, yet profound, script and direction together elevates the movie to a plane philosophically higher than most Hollywood movies.
