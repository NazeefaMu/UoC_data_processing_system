Second CCC to fly to Mali

The army's second contingent consisting of a 260-strong Combat Convoy Company (CCC) will fly to Mali for UN peacekeeping assignments.
Once there, the troops will engage in the United Nations Multi-dimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission (MINUSMA).
This contingent, which has 20 officers and 240 other rankers, will replace the first CCC in December.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake had directed the Army General Staff Branch's Director-General to hold mock field training exercises (FTX) for the contingent before their departure.
The exercises will be conducted in the North, North-central, and Eastern provinces between October 18 and 21, under the supervision of 55 Division General Officer Commanding and former Army Headquarters Director Operations Brigadier Jayantha Gunaratne.
The field training exercise will be called ‘FTX - Harmattan - 2’ and it will be comprised of 10 regiments with mechanised infantries and combat support elements.
The exercise will simulate threats and challenges similar to those in Mali.
A separate headquarters (HQ-EXCON) will simultaneously monitor the applicability of standard drills against varying scenarios and will recommend improvements to make the CCC more efficient.
The ‘FTX - Harmattan - 2’ will be carried out in Chundikulam, Manalkadu, Pooneryn, Veditalativu, Mannar, Oyamaduwa, Mahadiwulwewa, Panmadawachchiya, Therunamaranwadiya, Mullaittivu, Paranthan, and the Kuweini junction at Iyakkachchi.
The CCC will be commanded by Lieutenant Colonel K.L.I Karunanayake, with Major P.G.J Suriyasena as his second-in-command. It is comprised of Army personnel of the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR), Sri Lanka Armoured Corps (SLAC), Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE), Sri Lanka Signal Corps (SLSC), Mechanised Infantry Regiment (MIR), Corps of Engineer Services (CES), Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (SLEME), Sri Lanka Army Service Corps (SLASC), Sri Lanka Army Ordnance Corps (SLAOC), as well as members of the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps (SLAMC).
Nineteen thousand soldiers had served in UN peacekeeping missions either as Combat Troops, Military Observers, Staff Officers or as Assistants to Staff Officers in several parts of the world. As of today, 150 soldiers in Lebanon are serving the UN Interim Force (UNIFIL), 66 are in the UN Mission in Sudan with a Level-2 hospital in South Sudan (UNMISS), 65 soldiers are in MINUSMA (Mali), 26 officers are in UN Staff Officer Missions and a group of 18 Officers, including two female officers, are in the Western Sahara, Congo, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Abyei and New York. During their overseas duties, three Sri Lankan peacekeepers laid down their lives between 2005 and 2007 and were honoured with the UN Dag Hammarskjold Medal. Sri Lanka is globally recognised as a United Nations Troop Contributing Country (UN-TCC).
