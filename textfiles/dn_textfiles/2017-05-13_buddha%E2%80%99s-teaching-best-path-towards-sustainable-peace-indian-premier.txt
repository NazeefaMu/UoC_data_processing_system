Buddha’s teaching: best path towards sustainable peace: Indian Premier

The Buddha's teaching is the best solution for the biggest challenge to sustainable world peace today, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said yesterday.
He was addressing the gathering at the commemoration of the 14th United Nation's Vesak Day Celebration at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
"The biggest challenge to sustainable world peace today is not necessarily from conflict between the nation states," Indian Prime Minister said.
"It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence. The Menace of terrorism in our region is a clear manifestation of this destructive emotion," he said.
The Indian Prime Minister said it was a matter to be sad that those ideologies of hate and their proponents in the region were not open to dialogue and open only to causing death and destruction.
"I believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to the growing arc of violence all over the world," Indian Premier said. "The Lord Buddha preached two and half millennium ago that 'No higher Bliss than Peace'," he said.
He said Buddha's teaching was relevant even for today and Buddha preached about tanha or greed. He said the same greed had driven the mankind to dominate and degrade their habitats. He said the universality of the Buddha's teaching; the middle path, is striking.
"The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage," Indian Prime Minister said. "Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate the unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism. A heritage that connects our societies across generations and through centuries," he said.
Prime Minister Modi said Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
He said Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy. "Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings,” Modi said.
He said India and Sri Lanka’s friendship is etched in time by the great masters and same is spread across many layers. He added that the friendship of two countries lies in the hearts of people and the fabric of society.
"Most grateful to President Sirisena, PM Wickremesinghe and to the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honour of being the Chief Guest at the function," he said.
He also suggested that on the blessed day of Vesak, "let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth.
And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world".
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the gathering.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, former Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa participated.
