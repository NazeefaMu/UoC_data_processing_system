Rathupaswala Shooting : The predicament prevails

 A few metres from the Belummahara junction, on the main Kandy-Colombo road, lies Suresh Perera’s grocery shop. He minds the shop while his boss is away and most of his days are spent weighing and selling basic groceries. In his spare time, he is the convener of the Siyane Environment Protection Movement (SEPM), the environmental organization which was central in fighting for the water rights of the residents of Ratuhpaswala and surrounding areas.
Over three and a half years after the brutal killings in Rathupaswala, the area which was once an intense battlefield between government forces and villagers who were demanding for clean drinking water; is quiet and yet, unsettled.
1Perera, last week, came to fisticuffs with one of his neighbours, “He has read the book which recently came out about Rathupaswala. The book thanks my boss for his efforts in keeping the fight going. This man was on the side of the factory, so he was quite angry with that. The struggle split our village in two,” said Perera.

Almost 23 years after the Hayleys Group Dipped Product Venigros Factory first came into Nedungamuwa in the Gampaha District, it has left Nedungamuwa and the surrounding villages divided, the religious institutions shaken, its people sick and environment destroyed.
“The fight is not yet over. The sludge from the factory still remains on the fields and other areas. As long as the sludge remains, the groundwater cannot completely recover,” he said as he struggles to motivate the people to continue the fight for clean water.
The majority of those who followed him on to the streets of Welliweriya on August 1, 2013, however, are tired of the struggle today. “People no longer track the pH of the water in their wells. They have got used to the pipe-borne water,” said Perera, who has found, at times, to be fighting a long battle to keep the memory of the injustice alive in the minds of his people.
Waiting for water
The actions of the rubber glove factory had affected the groundwater of 28 Grama Niladhari divisions, but thus far, only 12 have been provided with pipe-borne water at a concessional rate of Rs. 3000—this was done in 2014.
“Those who are lucky to get water have to wake up at 1-2am to stock up on it. The water then stops at 4am. During the drought, there was hardly enough water and even the wells had dried up,” said A.U. Adhikari, who lives less than a kilometre from the factory and a member of SEPM. Adhikari played a key role during the struggle; a well-to-do businessman with political clout in the area, he helped get bail for many villagers who were unjustly arrested by the Police.
“When we complained to the Water Board, they said that there wasn’t enough pressure to send water continuously here and that Kadawatha was not giving us an extra supply,” he said.
Adhikari, along with many people who have to make do with a poor water supply or a lack of it, have gone back to their old wells for water. They stressed that their water quality had improved vastly ever since the factory shut down in 2013.
“The pH in my well was at 2.8 at one time. When the water splashed on to our body, it used to burn and cause rashes. I used to travel to my wife’s home in Ganemulla once a week to bring a van full of water for us to use. I could not wear trousers at one point. It is much better today, but we are still too scared to drink it,” said Gamini Waragoda, a retired accountant and treasurer of the SEPM.
Waragoda added that while their water no longer burns, there were many wells in the surrounding areas which were still badly affected, “We let those who have no water connections to come and take water from our well because they are quite desperate; they can no longer rely on their own wells and they don’t have access to pipe borne water,” he said.
Jude Perera, a resident of Uruwala in Nedungamuwa, was shot in the back during the protest in 2013. A three-wheeler driver by profession, he complained that he could no longer drive for long periods of time without taking regular breaks. He is among the several hundreds of villagers yet to receive pipe-borne water, “We have gone back to drinking water from our wells now. What other choice do we have? When we asked the water board for water, they said, ‘you don’t even have a pipeline, how can you apply for a connection?” said Perera as he explained that only the villages closest to the factory were given pipe-borne water in 2014 and since then, no new connections were built.
They have also not measured the recent pH levels of their water. “We don’t taste the difference anymore, but it is drinkable,” he said.
Compensation
In April of this year, the government paid Rs 4.8 million in compensation for 33 people who were shot by the army in 2013. Jude Perera received Rs. 50,000 for his injury. “I do not think I have been paid enough. I have spent more than that in hospitals and I still cannot fully bend. Those who cannot work at all got Rs. 500,000, but I think I should have got more as I can no longer earn as much as I used to,” he said.
The government also paid Rs. 1 million each to the families of the three youths who were shot dead.
Suresh Perera, however, believed that the compensation was fair, “I know many have complaints, but the government did the assessment based on their injuries,” he said.
Justice
This year also marked a major breakthrough in the cases of shooting in Rathupaswala—the arrest of Brigadier Anura Deshapriya by the CID in May for having led the attack on the ground. In the villages in which the shootings took place, however, the reaction to the arrest was mixed.
“There has been talk that perhaps we should let things go now that the factory is closed and people have got compensation. They do not like ‘war heroes’ being arrested,” said Suresh Perera, who was also a former member of the Navy and served in the Global Multi-National Forces from 1997-2005.
But Perera was of the strong belief that justice needed to be served, “If we are really going to respect the title of ‘war hero’, we must apply the law to all those who use that name to fulfil their own political agendas. If the army is to regain their credibility, they need to take action against the wrongdoers of the army. When we are given a gun, we are also told when we can shoot, but we cannot shoot innocent civilians," he said.
As the villagers protested at the Weliweriya junction, Deshapriya had led an army contingent to attack unarmed protesters. On the night of August 1, 2013, the town of Weliweriya was under shutdown and according to the book ‘Jana Aragalayaka Diya Salakuna Rathupaswela’ (The Rathupaswela Water Mark On a Peoples’ Revolt) published by Tharindu Jayawardena on the attack, the army pursued the protesters with their guns thereafter launched a campaign to erase all evidence of it. “They washed the blood off the streets and cleared the bullets from the area,” stated the book. Investigations into the incident were buried until 2015 when the new government came into power. In March, 2016, the investigation was handed over to the CID by former IGP N.K. Ilangakoon. The CID, by March, 2017, arrested three army personnel in connection with the shootings. Two years since the investigation, however, the CID is yet to resolve the question as to who really gave Brigadier Deshapriya the order to shoot.
‘Our government’
“Gampaha is an SLFP stronghold and we are all party supporters, but the problem was that our leaders did not look at the people’s problems,” said Suresh Perera, having pondered as to how an environmental issue became the beginning of the end for the government in power at the time. “This was not the North. We were all supporters of the government; I have been to May Day rallies. We initially thought that if we simply told our leaders of the problem, they would resolve it. We did not expect the government to attack us. When we cast our vote at the 2015 Presidential elections, it was a vote against the government,” he said. “Water is a fundamental right and our request was fair. Through this, I wanted to inform the politicians that the people are not the slaves of a government; the government is here to serve us,” said the ex-serviceman turned activist.
His thoughts are echoed by Adhikari, who is a local organizer of the party who found out that he did not have much clout against the all-powerful ‘factory.’
"The factory bought over so many people. They shut down opposition from the local school through CSR projects. People who first found out about the connection between the water and the factory were given money to stay quiet. Even the local politicians did nothing," recalled Adhikari.
His biggest disappointment, however, lay with the local Buddhist temple (Sabhawe Pansala) coming under the influence of the factory where he was the main patron. “I used to do a lot for this temple but after the water issue, the monk took the side of the factory and went against the people. The owners of the factory, together with the monk, even had a thovilaya to protect the factory. That was the first time the villagers attacked the temple,” he said.

Adhikari, together with the other villagers, had complained to the Mahanayakas regarding the corrupt practices of the monk, but instead of taking action against him, he was given a promotion. He further lamented that it was not only the water, but also the environment, which suffered due to the factory. “This area used to be lush with cashew and jack fruit trees. But the factory got all the poor people to cut down their trees and sell it to the factory. We don’t have cashew in this area anymore,” he said.
The factory would, in many an instances, use ‘profit’ as a powerful tool to influence many in the village over the years. Adhikari also noted that their sludge was given to farmers to be used as fertilizer while their unused chemicals were sold to villagers to make moonshin. “Many paddy fields had to be abandoned as the farmers were getting rashes and fever because of the sludge. At the time, people thought it was rat fever. And the moonshine led to many losing their eyesight,” he said.
A 20-year struggle
While many environmental movements struggle to see the light of day, the Rathupaswala struggle has been one of the few to achieve at least some success. The man who started it all was the founder of SEPM Sampath Samarakoon, who in 1997, wrote to his local government politicians and the CEA over the environmental pollution the factory was causing. He also sued the factory over it, “My house was covered in some kind of dust. It was tested to be unburnt carbon. They also sprayed this strong chemical into the air making it difficult to breath for us,” he said.
Samarakoon continued to write to authorities regularly and over the years, sent in many a petition. One time, he managed to convince over a hundred villagers to sign on to it, but the issue really caught hold of public when their water became no longer drinkable in 2013. “People did not believe me at the start. When the people finally got their wells tested, the public health officer asked them not to drink the water,” he said.
Still in denial?
The CEA, however, is yet to admit that the factory was directly responsible for the contamination of the groundwater in the area. In February, 2016, the CEA informed the Court of Appeals that the “release of contaminated water by Venigros factory in Rathupaswala had not caused an impact on the qualitative nature of underground water around the Rathupaswala area.” They, however, added that the water samples in the area were not under ideal pH level recommended by Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) Institution.
“If the factory had no connection to the pollution in the water, how is it that the water has been improving since the factory shut down?” said Samarakoon. His sentiments are similarly echoed by all SEPM members who have filed a writ petition against the CEA, the Board of Investment and Venigros (Pvt) Ltd, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
This report by the CEA also means that the residents of Rathupaswala cannot sue the factory for the damages caused to their water. This continued apathy on the part of government institutions has made Samarakoon a tired and disillusioned man. “This struggle resulted in us losing our village temple. The village, today, is divided. Some have called me a traitor. People are quick to forget; those who fought against the injustices of the monk now go to the temple. I am not going to come forward if there is another environmental issue,” he said.
“Recently, people asked me if I wanted to join a campaign to resolve the garbage crisis, but I told them I was no longer interested,” added Samarakoon.
He said he did not believe that true justice would be served to those in Rathupaswala as long as the system remained corrupt. “The government, school, temple and even some of our supporters, succumbed to the power of money. And they turned our people against each other."
"I don’t expect other factories to learn from this incident. Business will go on as usual,” he added. “However, we came this far because in the end, we all stood together regardless of our backgrounds and political beliefs.”
“It is ironic as reports stated that the factory only needed to spend Rs. 150,000 a month to send their waste to the Holcim Factory in Puttlam to be disposed of in a proper manner. If they had done that, we wouldn’t have had all these issues,” said Samarakoon. Adhikari, in the meantime, said, “I think it would take at least 20 years for our water to be back to normal, but our people have short memories.”
