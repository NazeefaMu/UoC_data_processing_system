Stokes treble rocks Windies as Anderson awaits 500th wicket

London: Ben Stokes took three wickets in quick succession as West Indies were reduced to 119 for seven at tea on the first day of the third Test against England at Lord's on Thursday.
James Anderson, who had made the initial double strike before lunch, was unable to add to his tally in the second session, with the Lancashire swing king still a tantalising one away from becoming the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets.
But all-rounder Stokes kept England on top, taking three for 22 in an unchanged 13-over spell spanning nearly two hours.
West Indies captain Jason Holder, who had taken the bold decision to bat first after winning the toss on a green-tinged pitch, and Devendra Bishoo were both nine not out.
Holder's side upset the odds by chasing down a target of 322 to win the second Test at Headingley by five wickets and level the three-match series at 1-1.
But they struggled in overcast conditions and only when Kieran Powell and Shai Hope -- fresh from Headingley scores of 147 and 118 not out, his first two hundreds in Test cricket -- were sharing a partnership of 56 did West Indies look like getting back on level terms.
Anderson, wicketless in the second innings at Leeds, should have had his 498th Test wicket when he took Kraigg Brathwaite's outside edge with the opener, who made 134 and 95 at Headingley, on three.
But Alastair Cook, who floored two first-slip catches during that victory charge last week, dropped a seemingly routine chance. It was not a costly error as Anderson, however, squared Brathwaite up on 10, and wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow made no mistake to leave West Indies 18 for one.
Rain then stopped play for 40 minutes and when the match resumed Anderson had Kyle Hope out for a duck when the batsman, trying to withdraw his bat, was well caught by a diving Bairstow.
Anderson had taken two wickets for no runs in 12 balls and West Indies were 22 for two.
Hope's exit brought in younger brother Shai Hope. The 23-year-old, carrying on from where he left off, marked his first ball by punching Anderson through the covers for four.At lunch the West Indies were 35 for two, with Powell 17 not out and Shai Hope unbeaten on eight. AFP
