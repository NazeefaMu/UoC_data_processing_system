People who rode to power on the back of SLFP now trying to defeat it: Former Moratuwa Deputy Mayor

People who rode to power on the back of the SLFP and amassed massive amounts of wealth through political deals are now trying to defeat the SLFP. These people have turned former President Mahinda Rajapaksa into a puppet and made him dance to their tune, former Moratuwa Municipal Council Deputy Mayor Sujith Pushpakumara said.
Pushpakumara said that President Maithripala Sirisena has given unprecedented freedom to SLFP members to engage in the type of politics that they prefer. Therefore, they should not misuse this generosity, but, rather use it to strengthen the party.
Addressing the media in Katubedda, Moratuwa yesterday, he said the President is keen to get all factions of the SLFP together in order to win the next election.
“We urge former President Rajapaksa not to destroy the SLFP which is getting stronger by the day and instead focus his energies on strengthening the party. MP Wimal Weerawansa has said that his party, the National Freedom Front (NFF) wants to get away from the UPFA and work as an independent party. We urge him to vacate the MP post that they got through the SLFP votes and leave the UPFA gracefully. We can recall how the NFF went it alone at the last Uva Provincial Council election and lost very badly,” he said.
“President Sirisena who addressed the SLFP electoral organisers recently said that the SLFP is in a position of winning any future election. When he was SLFP General Secretary, the party never suffered a defeat. Therefore, we are ready to vouch with our own blood that the SLFP will emerge victorious at the next Local Government election,” Pushpakumara added. Former Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman A.D. Kumarasiri said the very people who tried to defeat former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2005 Presidential election are now backing his comeback campaign. But,we know all those who left the party have become political destitutes.
Colombo District SLFP Organiser M.H. Mansil said that former President Rajapaksa who came to power with the SLFP votes later neglected their voices and opted to go for an election two years prior to the scheduled date which left most party supporters destitute. It was former President who destroyed the party by getting together with various UNP factions. He chased out our own organisers and appointed organisers who parachuted from the UNP. But, President Sirisena entered into a formal agreement with the UNP without affecting the rights of the true SLFP members.
Former Kalutara Municipal Council Mayor Nalin Mahesh Perera said both Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila are responsible for turning the SLFP into a communal minded political party.
