‘President shows good governance traits’

President Maithripala Sirisena has shown the characteristics of good governance by appointing a Muslim as the SLFP organizer for Puttalam District, said Puttalam District SLFP organizer Naina Mohamed Ajnas Khan.
He was delivering his maiden speech at Puttalam Town Hall, on Sunday. The event was organized by Puttalam District Sri Lanka Freedom Party to welcome the newly appointed SLFP organizer for Puttalam District Naina Mohamed Ajnas Khan.
Khan added that a Muslim has never been appointed as the SLFP organizer for the Puttalam district. “For the first time, our President has provided such an opportunity to Puttalam. Through this action, the President has shown that Muslims who live in Puttalam should also live up to their fullest. This also shows that Sri Lankan Muslims will be treated equally under the ‘Good Governance’ government. The veteran members of SLFP have supported this,” he said.
“This is a great opportunity for me to solve the prevailing problems in the district. Therefore, I assure that I will contact the President directly, and will provide immediate solutions for problems related to education and the health sector in the district,” he said.
Puttalam District SLFP Leader Milroy Fernando, SLFP Co-organizer for the Puttalam electorate Victor Antony Perera, SLFP Co-organizer and the North Western Provincial Councillor N. T. M. Thahir, SLFP organizer for Anamaduwa electorate Ananda Samarakoon, former member of Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha Thatchana Moorthi and others participated.
