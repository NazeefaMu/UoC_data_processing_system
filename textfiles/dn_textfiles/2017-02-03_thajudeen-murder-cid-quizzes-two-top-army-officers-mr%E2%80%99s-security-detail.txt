Probe into telephone calls that originated from Presidential Secretariat Office phones:
Two higher ranking Army officials who were assigned for the security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have been questioned and their statements recorded in connection with the murder of former Havelocks rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen, the Attorney General informed Court yesterday.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the CID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa said that the CID detectives had extensively recorded statements from two higher ranking security officials of the former President based on the investigation into telephone calls that originated from the phones at the Presidential Secretariat Office on the night of Thajudeen’s murder.
He further submitted to Court that the CID had also commenced an investigation into the telephone calls given by former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake to the Presidential Secretariat on the night of May 17, 2012.
DSG Ratnayake further informed Court that they were yet to receive an analytical report from the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) pertaining to a video footage containing a suspicious vehicle that followed former Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s vehicle on the night of Thajudeen’s death.
On a previous occasion, the prosecution informed Court that an individual who was inside the vehicle that followed former Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s car on the night of his death had been identified through the CID investigations. Meanwhile, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the Thajudeen murder were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by Colombo Additional Magistrate.
