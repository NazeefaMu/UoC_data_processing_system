No one should sabotage the Central Express way project: Malwatte Anunayake

Nobody should attempt to sabotage the Central Express way project, said Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhamma Thera.
Wimaladhamma Thera stressed the necessity of constructing a Central express way for the development of the central province.
“Several industries are scheduled to be established in the city and the Central Express way would be very helpful for the functioning of these industries,” said the Thera.
He said the historical Kandy city is the second largest city of Sri Lanka and it takes around four and half hours to reach Kandy.
This is a massive waste of time. Therefore, it is very essential to have an express way from Colombo to Kandy. Measures should be taken to complete construction of Central Express way as soon as possible.
Significant places of worship such as the Temple of the Tooth Relics, Malwatte Temple, Asgiriya Temple, Peradeniya Botanical Garden and the University of Peradeniya are situated in this historical city.
Hence, nobody should attempt to sabotage this express way project. It is our right, he said.
Wimaladhamma Thera further said the present government must do its best for the betterment of the country within the five year duration of its term of office, if not they would not be able to come in to power again and nobody should oppose the good things they do.
