Karting at its best at Round 2 of Pulsar NS150 Karting

The cream of Sri Lanka's go-karters fought it out at the Pulsar NS150 Karting Championship 2016 (Round 02) which took place at the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit in Bandaragama recently. Organized by the Bandaragama Go Kart Racing Club, the event was sponsored by David Pieris Motor Company Limited.
The invitation races were conducted under Novices and Senior categories, under three weight categories (55 Kg, 75Kg and 90 Kg and above) along with a Ladies Open event.
Vinusha Sanjula, Ishan Udara Munaweera and Shakthi Anuradha Gunasekara emerged victorious in Novices A, B and C categories respectively, showing skillful driving capabilities against stiff competition from many new drivers. The Ladies Open event was won by Ashvitha Wickrama who reached the checkered flag ahead of Maryse Navarathne with Gayani Wasana taking third place. Jason Carron raced with skill, consistency and precision to keep the lead he held in all the pre-qualifiers and went on to win the Senior Class 'D' event while seasoned campaigner Brayan Perera emerged victorious in the Senior Class 'E' category.
