Beware of lightning: Meteorology Department

The public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning since wave type atmospheric disturbance is expected to affect the weather over the country and surrounding sea area these days, the Meteorology Department said.
Under its influence showery and windy condition are expected to continue over the country and adjacent sea areas.
Showers or thundershowers will occur over most parts of the island. Very heavy showers (around 150mm) are possible in the Eastern part of the country and heavy showers (more than 100mm) are likely at some places elsewhere.
Fairly strong winds at times (about 40-50kmph) can be expected over the country.
The island will experience temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
