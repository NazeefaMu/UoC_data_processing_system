Awareness programme on usage of drone mounted cameras

A workshop organised by the Government Information Department to create awareness among journalists and other technicians on the ethics and laws and regulations to be observed when the cameras mounted on drones in covering public events will be held at the department premises on January 31. The workshops will have two sessions. It is held with the Civil Aviation Authority.
Since a limited number will be accommodated, those wishing to attend it are requested to register themselves through the websites www.new.lk or www.dgi.gov.lk.
A department release said the workshop has been organised since the technology of video photographing using unmanned aerial vehicles has proliferated in the country.
