No Confidence Motion against Wigneswaran

A No Confidence Motion against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran was handed over to Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray last night with the signatures of 21 Provincial Council members, a Northern Provincial Council member told the Daily News under anonimity.
Meanwhile, Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran yesterday called for the resignation of two Provincial Ministers at the Council meeting over corruption and fraud allegations.
He asked NPC Education Minister T. Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P. Aingaranesan to hand over resignation letters by noon today.
The Chief Minister made this request when the NPC took up a debate on the report submitted by three-member committee which investigated corruption allegations made against NPC ministers.
The Committee appointed by the Chief Minister last year comprised of two retired judges and one retired GA. Its report submitted last week has found evidence on the charges made against the above mentioned two Provincial Ministers.
