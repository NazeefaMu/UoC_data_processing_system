FFSL annual report and final accounts approved unanimously

The Annual Report and Final Account Report of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) for the year 2015 were unanimously approved by the FFSL membership during the Special General Meeting held at the Football House recently. The meeting did not last long as the proceedings were concluded within 45 minutes.
Due to investigations over many complaints of monetary transactions of FFSL, the Audit Report by the Auditor General’s Department has not been issued as yet for 2015.
The Special General Meeting was held after president of Negombo Football League and FFSL Monitary Committee chairman Ranjith Rodrigo requested FFSL to do so as they must clarify its situation to its members before someone takes legal action against the body.
“After considering this situation FFSL decided to distribute the Annual Report and Final Accounts amongst its members,” said FFSL president Anura de Silva. He also said that this action will prevent FFSL being exposed to allegations and legal action by any member, so the federation will save money on unnecessary legal expenditure.
“FFSL faced many judicial cases in the past. We spent a lot of money over them. The Financial Committee president and federation worked foresightedly. We want to develop football, we are not afraid of baseless allegations, we will initiate many projects to uplift the sport and make it a success,” De Silva further said. “Five new football academies will be formed in Galle, Matara, Hatton, Badulla and Kelaniya. These projects will receive international aids. These facilities will meet international standards and will include boarding facilities, educational assistance in Maths, English and IT subjects, soccer training under expert coaches. The International Football Federation has increased their aid this year and we can fulfill our targets,” the FFSL president added.
