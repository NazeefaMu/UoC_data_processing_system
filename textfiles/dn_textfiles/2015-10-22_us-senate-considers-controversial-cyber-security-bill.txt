US Senate considers controversial Cyber Security Bill

US: The US Senate on Tuesday began debating a long-delayed bill that would make it easier for corporations to share information about cyber attacks with each other or the government without concern about lawsuits.
Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate could pass the bill within days. "We intend to pass the cyber security bill," he told reporters, "hopefully by early next week."
The House of Representatives passed its version of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) in April with strong support from Republicans and Democrats. Dozens of industry and business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, back the legislation, saying it will help encourage companies and the government to share information that might help thwart high-profile cyber attacks like those on Sony Pictures Entertainment, Target and Anthem.
But a few lawmakers - including Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden - have come out against it. Several big tech companies also oppose it, arguing that it fails to protect users' privacy and does too little to prevent cyber attacks. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group representing Facebook, Google and other major tech firms, said last week it opposed CISA as it is currently written. Twitter said on Tuesday it could not support CISA in its current form.
Apple Inc also said on Tuesday it opposed the current proposal, according to the Washington Post, which quoted a company statement as saying: "The trust of our customers means everything to us and we don't believe security should come at the expense of their privacy." - AFP
