Shastri says India ‘taking no prisoners’ in Australia

BRISBANE: Coach Ravi Shastri vowed Sunday India will “take no prisoners” in their quest to win a Test series in Australia for the first time, but cautioned against underestimating the struggling home team.
India play four Tests and three one-day internationals from early December, with three Twenty20s before that, starting in Brisbane on Wednesday.
Despite Australia’s form nosediving since the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March resulted in bans for Steve Smith and David Warner, the former spin great doesn’t believe they have lost their aura.
“I don’t think so,” he said. “I always believe no team is weak at home.
“We might have three or four players not playing when a team comes to India but God forbid if anyone says it is a weak Indian team because you will be surprised.” Shastri didn’t want to be drawn on Australia’s new “friendlier” approach to playing cricket under Justin Langer, which has seen them tone down the confrontational style that brought then so much success.
