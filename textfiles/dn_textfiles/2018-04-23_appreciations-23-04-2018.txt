[APPRECIATIONS - (23-04-2018)]

H. V. Perera
Legal genius
H. V. Perera was born to a middle-class family in Moratuwa. His father was a licensed surveyor. Perera received his primary education at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa and was said to be a backward and mischievous child. Later, he was transferred to Royal College, Colombo, where he received his secondary education.
One day, a teacher was on sick leave and the then College Principal Hartley, took the class. He questioned the children as to why they attended school, to which a student had said: to learn English, while another said; to learn arithmetic. In response, Principal Hartley had said that one comes to school in order to learn how to think; words that inspired young the H. V. It was the turning point in his school career, leading him to win many prizes at the college. Mathematics was his specialty.
He later commenced his higher education at the University of London. However, after his final examination, he had walked out of the examination hall a dejected student as he had only managed to answer one question, whilst his peers had answered three to four. However, there was pindrop silence at the prize-giving when it was announced that the gold medal for mathematics was awarded to H.V. Perera.
The mathematics professor had announced that the prize was awarded to Perera as he had solved the complex mathematical problem using a new method, whilst the others had simply mimicked their textbooks. The professor had said that he had been on the lookout for such an individual.
Upon his return to Ceylon, he provided private tuition classes in mathematics to students. At that time, the principal's post at Ananda College fell vacant and subsequently, was offered to him. However, he declined the offer as it would have been a purely academic career thereafter. At the time, his father had insisted that he should become a civil servant (a career highly regarded at that time). However, young H. V. had disagreed with his father, saying he would take to law as his profession; a decision which led H. V. to leave his home.
During his career in law, he had an analytical approach to problems. I would like to mention the Bracegirdle case in particular, where Englishman Mark Anthony Bracegirdle with leftist ideas, came to Ceylon and agitated the plantation workers who were living under poor conditions. The British Governor at that time, had obtained a deportation order for Bracegirdle, to which Bracegirdle appealed against with H. V.'s assistance and won. In another case, H. V. had highlighted the importance of the independence of the judiciary, executive and the legislature, which are the three pillars on which a government rests. However, we have had instances where the executive interfered with the judiciary.
H. V.’s day always commenced with a 15-minute exercise before entering his office room and attending to routine correspondence.
He also used to advise junior lawyers who consulted him during his free time at courts. On returning home from Hulftsdorp, he always relaxed in his armchair and read newspapers whilst having tea. At 7.00 pm, he would go to his consultation room in order to meet clients and at 9.00 pm, he would have dinner with his wife and two sons, while listening to classical music on his radiogram. At times, he used to meet his mathematics professor to solve complex mathematical problems.
H. V.’s intellect was of high calibre, such that the then Prime Minister, Governor General and others used to consult him regarding matters of the state. One day, late D. S. Senanayake had visited H. V.’s residence at Torrington Place, Colombo 7. The purpose was to invite him to join his Cabinet as the Justice Minister. However, H. V. had declined the offer. He once confided in me and said, “Politics is a dirty game, I will have no part in it.”
H. V. was appointed Commissioner of Currency (1944 to 1950) and was a founder director of the Bank of Ceylon. Later, he became the chairman of the bank. His annual report of the bank, which was looked forward to, gave a resumé of the state of the country's economy, which at that time, depended solely on the export of tea, rubber and coconuts. The Ceylon Rupee at that time, was valued at Rs. 13.36 to the Sterling Pound. During his tenure at the bank as it’s chairman, the post of General Mananger fell vacant. The post was advertised and prospective candidates were interviewed. H. V.’s choice was C. Logonathan. The other directors, however, had other ideas. Then H. V. had explained that a person’s ethnicity should be no bar to selection and the person whose curriculum vitae was the best, should be selected. They subsequently caved in and Loganathan was selected.
H. V.’s 50 years at the bar, was celebrated at the Taprobane Hotel in 1966. Prominent lawyers of the day had attended the function. It was mentioned that H. V. Perera would be an adornment to any bar in any country, in any age. “The maestro of Hulftsdorp, a phenomenon of legal firmament” H. W. Jayawardene said about him. “Ceylon’s Greatest legal genius,” Sir Lalitha Rajapakse said, while G. G. Ponanbalam called him a grand master and an undisputed leader. “Ceylon has had great lawyers, but H. V. is the greatest of them all,” Dr. Colvin R. De Silva said. “It would be impertinence for an ordinary mortal to attempt a reasoned assessment of H. V.’s qualities as a lawyer and an advocate,” E. F. N. Grantien had added.
Dr. P. R. Anthoniz was by H. V.’s bedside during his last moments. Even though he was semiconscious at that time, he was heard arguing a case.
I could do no better than quote the inscription on the tombstone of H. V. Perera which stands at the Borella Cemetery: “Herbert Victor Perera. Born 31/10/1890. Died 16/4/1969. But though the voice is still, the echoes still remain. May he rest in peace.”

Dr. Ariyasena U. Gamage
Doctor par excellence
My dear friend Ari is no more. He breathed his last recently, following his battle with cancer. His passing away revealed to all of us, the impermanence of our lives and everything within this world. He was a compassionate and decent human being, a loving family man and above all else, a sincere friend. Ari was 65 years old when he met his demise.
Dr. Ariyasena U.Gamage was a general practitioner, a consultant in community medicine and an outstanding communicator. He was a writer who had penned books mainly on medical topics and was also a participant in television programmes. In fact, the popular TV programme Yatharupa aired last Thursday, featuring scientists and rationalists including icon of modern western medicine Prof. Carlo Fonseka. Prof. Carlo remembered Ari and his wife Manel when they were medical students at the Colombo Medical Faculty. Ari too, had been a rationalist and taken part in a few of its programmes. I was honoured by him when he requested me to write the foreword for his book Mata Diyawadiyawa Dan Hondai.
It had been said that a doctor should be able, available and approachable. Ari possessed all these and more and used his inherent communication skills when dealing with patients. He listened to them and showed empathy and kindness, which drew thousands of patients of all communities towards him. He never treated serious patients on his own and always used to get a second opinion from a consultant.
The news of his death was first conveyed to me by a Muslim patient of mine from Mawanella. In present times of ethnic turmoil, Ari was a shining light to all. When minor ethnic riots erupted in Mawanella a few years ago, he was able to quell the conflict to some extent with the assistance of a group of Buddhist monks.
He had a short stint at the Community Medicine Department of the Peradeniya University Medical Faculty. He utilised his skills in community medicine and conveyed messages on preventive medicine to society. Dr. Gamage was also an office-bearer of the Sri Lanka Diabetes Association (Kandy branch) and organised several programmes in Mawanella.
He was connected to leading politicians, but never used their influence. He used to talk at length about his life, family and future plans when I accompanied him to participate in TV programmes. He used to visit his ageing parents residing down South, regularly, at least once a week. When I visited him at the hospital a few months ago, I noticed that he had lost all his hair following chemotherapy. Ari, despite his illness, was his usual jovial self and when I inquired whether he had planned any future TV programmes, he jested saying why not when he regained his hair.
He used his suffering and experience to educate people on how to cope with cancer. This was the basis of his other book Rajek Unath Ledek Nam. Someone who wrote on late Prof. Stephen Hawking said, "Those who live in the shadow of death are often those who live the most." Even though Ari did not live that long, he certainly lived the most.Ari leaves behind his loving wife, Manel and two daughters and sons-in-law.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

Nihal S. Dissanayake
Man for all seasons
It was with profound sorrow that I came to know of the passing away of one of my mango friends for over half a century.
The situation was made worse, as true to his beliefs and character, there had not been any funeral as such since he had decided to donate his remains to the Jayawardenepura Medical Faculty. I came to know of his passing away after all these formalities were complete.
I initially came to know Nihal in 1962 when both of us were enrolled at Aquinas University College for the B.Sc(Econ) Degree programme of the University of London. At that time, I was employed at the People’s Bank.
However in 1964, I was transferred to its Talawakelle Branch as its Assistant Manager, thereby compelling me to relinquish my study programme. By this time, the University of Peradeniya commenced its own external degree programme and my friend moved over to this newly established study programme and eventually passed out as one of its graduates.
Upon passing the Government Clerical Service Examination, Nihal commenced his career with the Land Settlement Department.
After a brief spell there and after having passed the London A/L Examination, he joined a Education Department as an Assistant Teacher, which gave him time to concentrate on his degree programmes. Upon successful completion of his degree, he joined the academic staff of the Junior University Colleges of Polgolla and Dehiwala.
Around 1975, he proceeded to France to pursue his MBA studies with the Universite des Sciences Sociales, in Toulouse and upon its completion, returned to the country and was absorbed by the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) as a Lecturer. After a brief spell there, he joined the Bank of Ceylon as a Consultant and was a member of the team formed for the setting up of the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka (MBSL); the first merchant bank to be set up in the country.
From 1981 to 1991, he was employed by the MBSL as a Consultant until the first unit trust company was formed in 1992 which was National Asset Management Ltd., popularly known as NAMAL.
He became its first Marketing Manager and shortly thereafter, its CEO; a position he held until his retirement in December, 1997.
During his career life, he remained a conformist and a perfectionist. Due to this reason, he found it quite easy to get along with his peers as well as subordinates. There is no doubt that he acquired a unique combination of experiences which was demonstrated during his career's progression.
He was a clerk, teacher, lecturer, marketing consultant, trainer, merchant banker, CEO, researcher, editor of a business journal and finally, an author. It is due to this reason that I call him a man for all seasons.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

M. H. Mohamed Careem
A pillar of strength
The demise of Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed Careem of Ehuthar Hajiar street, Kinniya, occurred on the April 4, 2018 and the janasa took place at the Kinniya burial ground on the same day, around 8.00 pm.
He was born on December 28, 1936 and was educated at the Batticaloa Shivananda Vidyalaya. He was a self-motivated, proactive and enthusiastic person who performed his duties with utmost care and attention. He was known as a kind and friendly gentlemen with a large heart among the public.
He was boarded at the Kamalalayam Hall of the Shivananda Vidyalaya hostel. I had the privilege of associating with him for well over 20 years. I had always seen him calm and composed during any crises or unexpected situation.
He was a pillar of strength to his family and during the final stage of his life, while knowing full well of his deteriorating condition, he never lost his composure and passed away peacefully.
He was a special-trained teacher of the Palaly Teacher College of Education from 1959 to 1960, having passed the G. C. E. (O/L) and G. C. E. (A/L) examinations creditably well. He was a sportsman who won several prizes at the Annual Sports Meet at the Shivananda Vidyalaya.
Late Careem possessed a great sense of humour and was never without a smile; even during the darkest of hours, his presence shone a light upon everyone who knew him. He had brought much prestige to his college with his excellent work. His death is a great loss to all of us, particularly to Shivananda Vidyalaya.
Although he has parted from us, his name will be engraved in the hearts of all who knew him and in the institutions at which he worked.
He secured a BA degree and a Diploma in Education at the University of Peradaniya. His spared no pains in working for the betterment of the underprivileged people of the area. He took interest in the reorganisation of his alma mater's Past Students' Association.
Having passed the Sri Lanka Educational Service Examination, he was appointed the Deputy Education Director for the Mutur, Thampalakam I and Tincomalee areas from 1987 to 1994. He was also the Kinniya Pradheshiya Sabha Chairmen from 1994 to 2000 and was later appointed Quazi Judge for the area from 2007 to 2010 by the Judicial Service Commission.
Careem was an admirer of Swami Vipulanantha and Swami Nadaraja Anandaji. He was responsible for organising the death anniversary of Swami Nadaraja Anandaji at Shivananda Vidyalaya.
My deepest sympathies go to the bereaved members of his family. May he rest in peace.
