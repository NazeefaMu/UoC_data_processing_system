A. C. M Lafir a cricketing legend

Last Week's St. Anthony's - Trinity Centenary Cricket celebration had one distinguishing feature. It was about a record set by Antonian A.C.M Lair in making 1086 runs in the 1954 inter-school season and breaking Jack Anderson's record that has stood the test of time. His batting feat in making big runs stands like a monument towering over the picturesque hills of Kandy. Unconqured.
ABDUL CADER MOHAMED LAFIR commanded great respect as he strode the cricket fields. With willow in his hands runs flowed in avalanche style in school, club and at national level and not international level because his heroics were in the pre Test playing era.
LAFIR was born before the pre Test era, where many other champions were born like Mahadevan Sathasivam, C.I. Gunesekera, Sargo Jayawickrema, Mahes Rodrigo, Bertie Wijesinha, Vernon Prins, Stanley Jayasinghe, Michael Tissera and Dr. H.I.K. Fernando to mention names that come to mind. It is said that the country should been made a full member of the then Imperial Cricket Council in 1948 when the country had magicians with the willow and the ball. What we lacked was the infrastructure and the political and will to make a bid for inclusion.
Born in 1935 Lafir grew up as a talented cricketer destined to rewrite the school cricket’s record books and later that of the country. Opening his career as a 14 year old for St. Anthony’s College, Kandy which he had the fortune of captaining the school in its centenary year. He had extraordinary talent, spotted by that great mentor and coach who had no equal in that era --JOHN HALLANGODA who is still spoken in awe by Lafir.
Hallangoda's immaculate coaching
Lafir says Hallangoda’s immaculate coaching is still vivid in his memory and still reveres him. It was Halangoda, a Trinitian himself, who made Anthonian Lafir one if not the best of opening batsmen of the country in that era – the 1950s and 1960s. He is also grateful to former Peterite Maurice Perera who coached him in latter years.
Born with a simple demeanor, which he still carries, he was a fierce competitor. Like a gladiator with bat in hand as he led by example the 11 men he took to the field against all opponents. He played for SACK as a 14 year old from 1950 to 1955 for 5 years and captained in 1954 and 1955. He was a captain who would not ask or give any quarter.
He was a strict disciplinarian and led by example. His team mates would rally round him and the bottom line that mattered to him was winning, not at any cost but by playing in the spirit of the gentleman's game and according to the rules. It was unlike today where winning is not the thing but the only thing.
Lafir was tall and nicely built. He was the envy of all schoolboy batsmen of his time. It is said that school coaches and the bowlers would over work their brains finding strategies to get Lafir out early, because to let him ride was to do a lot of leather chasing. Lafir in 1954 scored 1000 runs that season.
Broke Jack Anderson's record
It was a record considering that unlike today when school batsmen score 1000 runs playing about 20 games, during Lafir’s time the maximum number of matches played were 7 or 8. In making 1086 runs in 1954 at an average of 108.6 he broke the record of that illustrious Antonian batsman, the great Jack Anderson.
In the match against Ananda he made a 100 in just 60 minutes. In that record breaking season he scored 4 centuries with the 176 in the big match against Trinity being the highest. His opening stand of 276 with Ronnie Stevens in the 1954 ‘big match’ against Trinity still stands the test of time.
As a right hander Lafir was an elegant batsman. He was quick of eye and packed a wide repertoire of strokes with the off drive being eye catching and exquisite. His footwork was a lesson and strokes blessed with rare timing. His defence was impregnable.
After a dream inter-school cricket career, Lafir donned pads in big time cricket, the ‘Sara’ trophy and in his first year playing for Kandy United against Saracens he made a double hundred (206 not out) and would have broken the highest score in ‘Sara; cricket that was to the credit of former Josephian and Moors cricketer Makin Salih which stood at 237 if not for captain Hugh Fernando declaring the innings.
Moon among the stars
That was the memorable knock that launched his career to stardom to shine like the moon among the stars. But Lafir was determined to break that record and had the opportunity of doing so against the University in a final round ‘Sara’ trophy clash making 276 not out for Nomads which University team team was led by that wonderful all round cricketer H.S. Mevan Pieris who was then known as ‘the king of swing’.
I remember Lafir's feat when in that game when he made 9 runs off a single delivery. He was attempting the 5th run. The over throw took the ball to the boundary line and the fielder he alleges kicked the ball purposely to the fence. Umpire Allan Felsinger awarded an additional four runs as a penalty.
Lafir says his best inning in the big league was the 186 he scored against SSC which team had cricketers of the calibre of F.C.de Saram, Bertie Wijesinha, C.I. and Channa Gunesekera, Stanley de Alwis, Lasantha Rodrigo, Neil Chanmugam, and Ben Navaratna.
Lafir had the distinction of representing the country against England’s Len Hutton’s team as a schoolboy and made a gutty 26 facing the bowling of Frank 'Typhoon’ Tyson, Brian Statham and spinner Tony Lock. Playing for Ceylon against Polly Umriga’s Indians he made 55 facing the wiles of two of India’s best tweakers Gulam Ahmed and Subash Gupte. In the Gopalan Trophy series he has two centuries to his credit.
Holds no grudges
He says he could have played for the country for 10 more years had it not been for some selectors of that era who penalized him for no faults of his. But being an Amighty Allah fearing man that he is Lafir holds no grudges against them. One incident that should be mentioned was when he was bating against England with a very senior player.
The senior player would hit the ball and scamper two runs, but when Lafir hit the ball to an open space he would respond by running only a single. Lafir decided to respond and when there were two runs he ran only one. When the senior batsman questioned him, Lafir unafraid said he was returning the compliment. Ken Barrington the England stone waller who heard the conversation, sided with Lafir.
Lafir’s other batting records will require reams to mention. He probably holds the record for the most centuries, half centuries scored in local cricket. I had the opportunity of capturing Lafir’s prized wicket when I playing for BRC and he for Saracens. I forced him to lunge forward to a viciously turning leg break that took the edge of his bat before he settled in and went to slip where former Carey College and C.W.Mackie left arm spinner Noel Lutersz, now domiciled in Australia , gulped the catch. I still treasure that wicket and Lafir still reminds me of how I dismissed him whenever we meet.
Lafir was always equal to the task before him. In his own words he would face great bowlers fearlessly and they in turn accorded him much respect. He recalls FAST BOWLERS like Sonny Yatawara, T.B. Kehelgamuwa, Mevan Pieris, Dooland Buultjens. SPINNERS -Gamini Goonasena, Abu Fuad, Neil Chanmugam, Daya Sahabandu, Anura Polonowita, D.S. de Silva, B.W.R. Thomas and Elmo Rodrigopulle. FOREIGN BOWLERS – Frank Tyson, Brian Statham, Allan Davidson. SPINNERS – Subash Gupte, Ghulam Ahmed, V.V. Kumar, Tony Lock, David Allan and Richie Benaud whom he terms as the greatest spinners in world cricket in that era.
ACM Lafir, in his happy and content retirement will always be remembered as one of the excellent crickets of all time in Sri Lanka. No surprise that the "L" in his name stands for LEGEND.
