Sri Lanka hoping to put up  a good contest against India

Sri Lanka captain for the under cricket series against India Nipun Dananjaya said that his team was hoping to play good cricket with India and secure a win in the two-match 4-day Under 19 test series which begins at the NCC grounds today.
“We are entitled to play some good cricket in this series against India whose side is well put together. We are hoping to secure a successful win in the series,” said all-rounder and skipper Dananjaya at a press conference held at Hilton Colombo Residencies yesterday.
Hemantha Devapriya, manager of the Sri Lanka under 19 team spoke of players being included from every district in the squad. “Cricket has begun to evolve during the past provincial tournament matches that were an eye opener for the selection committee to observe young talent from every district. We are obliged to take this ambitious step and give our players the opportunity to represent the national squad,” Devapriya said.
“We are confident of the preparations that we have under undergone with comprehensive training in all three departments. We are hoping the three week period we had would produce sufficient results,” he said.
