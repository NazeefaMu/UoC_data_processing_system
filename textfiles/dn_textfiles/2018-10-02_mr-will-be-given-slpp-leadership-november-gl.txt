MR will be given SLPP leadership in November - GL

The leadership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will be handed over to former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa in November, said former External Affairs Minister and SLPP Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at the SLPP office in Battaramulla, Peiris said the SLPP completes two years in November and the annual general meeting will be held after the return of former Minister Basil Rajapaksa to the country because Basil Rajapaksa was committed to the formation of the SLPP.
Peiris said that the SLPP hoped Mahinda Rajapaksa will accept the SLPP leadership without any reservation. “Just after 16 months, the SLPP made a world record by winning 71 percent of the electoral divisions at the Local Government polls.
Peiris said that the party’s women and youth policy frameworks have been completed and will be unveiled at the SLPP AGM.
He said that they plan to form branches of the SLPP regional societies throughout the country including in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
