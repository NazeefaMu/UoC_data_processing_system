These two schools are hoping to build a good friendship and continue annually this first major cricketing event.
At Mahanama the initial stepping for cricket was laid by the M.I.C. and the junior coach Ravi Jayawardhana in 2011, his good work helped the school buds to bloom.

Dharmatilake oldest Rajan sportsman
One of the oldest living Dharmaraja College Sportsman D.M.Dharmatilake, who gives a big hand for all sports, is the happiest man, after the Rajans won the Winston Hoole Trophy in the one day game. This was the 30th encounter, where they first played in 1989, and out of the 30 games Rajans have won 14, Kingswoodians 13 and 3 games have ended in no decision.
Schools are finding it difficult due to ground problem
Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most ruggerites, At present schools are finding difficult to play their matches, only Trinity has their own grounds, other schools have to pay a big packet for the ground, and in the same way the ‘gates’ are also too high. Today rugby is undoubtedly the most popular and champion sport with Kandy Sports Club being the king makers. Today most of the schools do not have their school fixture card due to ground problems.
Sampath says good bye to Antonians
St. Anthony’s College, Katugastota cricket coach Sampath Perera and the former Trinity College coach who molded the Asgiriya school into a champion outfit for several years took off to Malaysia on Wednesday night to take up a coaching assignment. He took the flight after his school, St. Anthony’s College lost to St. Anne’s in the K/O semi-final.
The former D.S.Senanayake College captain and wicket keeper with all the requirements was a good coach and helped both Trinitians and Antonians.
Tuany Amidon needs a helping hand
A great footballer form Kandy, Tuany Amidon a product of Midland College, (Gandhi College) to come out as one of the giants of local football is badly in need of financial help to purchase his medicine. A giant during his time he started his football by kicking a tennis ball around on the Municipal playground at Katukelle. His first club was Young Wanders FC Katukelle. He played as a left inside and was one of the best dribblers the country has seen. He joined the Army and served them for 20 years. After joining Army he played rugger as a fly half.

Badly in need of a right place for walking and jogging
Kandy’s young and old sports lovers are badly in need of a proper place to do their walking and jogging. In the good old days, there was a big crowd at Bogambara but today for some purpose the gates are locked.
Earlier they used the Kandy Lake round for it but today it is in a mess as the surface is not in perfect condition, and there is too much traffic.
Kandy needs a public cricket ground
Today most of the schools in Kandy are without a proper cricket playing field, and they have to go out of Kandy to play the game. Except Trinity, Dharmaraja, St. Anthony’s all other schools are without grounds.
This deprives some of the top schoolboys from displaying their talent.
Antonians out
St. Anthony’s College were shown the exit door by St. Anne’s College in the semifinal of the schools under 19 Division II inter schools 2 day knockout cricket tournament. This win gives the Kurunegala school promotion to division one.
After a long spell, the Antonians had a good season, and were the champions in their group Division II
Vidyartha-Sylvester’s T20 held up
The annual Vidyartha vs St. Sylvester’s T20 game, which is one of the most looked forward to sporting event for the old boys of the two schools, may not take place this time due to it being postponed during the recent unrest in Kandy.
They are finding it difficult to get a ground.
