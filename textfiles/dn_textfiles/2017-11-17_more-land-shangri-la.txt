More land for Shangri-La

The Hong Kong based luxury hotel chain Shangri-La, which opened its doors to the public yesterday, will be given an additional three and a half acres of land adjoining its hotel facing Galle Face Green. This land has been leased on a 99-year agreement for Rs. 13.1 million a perch, based on a reassessment of the land value carried out by the government.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday, explained that while the previous regime had leased out 10 acres to the hotel at a cost of Rs. 8.5 million a perch, the incumbent government had insisted that the value be reassessed and updated.
In 2014, the hotel chain had approached the government at the time for an additional 3.5 acres adjoining the hotel and submitted an Expression of Interest for its acquisition, said the minister.
The land which belonged to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development at the time, was assessed by the authorities to value Rs. 6.5 million a perch, he added.
“On June 8, 2016, Shangri-La made another appeal for the land to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by the Prime Minister. He in turn submitted a proposal to the Cabinet asking that a new assessment of the land value be made as the 2014 value was too old,” said Minister Jayasekara.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka who was also involved by then had informed the Cabinet in July that he was not against the reassessment.
Thereafter, in August 2016, then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had proposed that the reassessment be done according to the ‘Swiss challenge’ method. A Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) was appointed for the purpose.
This resulted in the Cabinet on May 17, approving the assessment carried out by Perennial Holdings as per the recommendation of the CCEM, said the Minister. He added that they had also taken the decision to fast track the process and handover the land to the Board of Investment, so that it would come under foreign investments.
“It is wrong to say that this was pushed by one minister. It was all done in a transparent manner.
As the land initially belonged to the Defence Ministry, the President insisted that the whole procedure should be transparent,” explained Minister Jayasekara.
