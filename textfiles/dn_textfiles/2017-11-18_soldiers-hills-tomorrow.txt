KANDY SPORT ROUND UP
Soldiers up in the hills tomorrow

Tomorrow, Kandy SC will be looking to secure their third win in a row when they face Army SC in their third game, at Nittawela. Coach Sean Wijesinghe has worked hard to get the best out of his players. The soldiers coached by a Kandy product Nilufer Ibrahim will go all out to give Kandy SC a tough time. Taking rugby fans back to a memorable rugby match that was played at Longden Place in 1977 Kandy SC led by Sunil Munasinghe put up a brave show against the soldiers before losing 31-7 in a knockout quarterfinal game. It was schoolboys from St. Anthony’s. Dharmaraja, St. Sylvester’s, Vidyartha, Kingswood and Sri Rahula who contributed 12 players out of the fifteen for KSC. Kandy had two easy chances of scoring had not Nihal Viper Gunaratne not dropped the ball in front of the line on each occasions.
The man who helped the soldiers to do well was S.P. de Silva who scored a try, goaled three tries and put over a penalty. Kingswoodian Jerome Gray, scored KSC’s solitary try. Gamini Fernando refereed the game. In that year, the Clifford Cup was awarded to the league champions and the knockout was played for SLRFU President's Trophy.
Kandy Rugby Fans
The Kandy fans are very much concerned about the decision taken by the Rugby Union to suspend Shehan Pathirana for four matches.
If the video clip is checked it is evident that the infringements were never intentional.
The incident that was cited by the CMO occurred when a CH player broke away from the back of the scrum and was going to cause an issue in the Kandy defence when at the same time Pathirana attempted to clear the ball. Under the World Rugby regulation 17 Sub - Section 22 with regulation to appeal - Section 17, 22, 2, (a) may appeal to the appeal board committee. The fans request the SLRU to reconsider the ban, whilst regretting the injury caused to the CH player.
