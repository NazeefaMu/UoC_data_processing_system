Geopolitics and Security, the view from South Asia

The following is a lecture delivered by the Director General of the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka, Asanga Abeygoonasekera at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.
It is indeed a privilege to speak on the topic of geopolitics at the prestigious LKY School named after Lee Kuan Yew who is considered a guru of geopolitics and also called the “Kissinger of the orient”. According to Dr. S. Jaishankar “after being a driver of development and serving as an example for the continent, Lee Kuan Yew evolved in the eyes of the world to be sort of a geopolitical guru, guiding Asia and explaining the continent to the rest of the world”.
The “great game” in the Indian Ocean
According to Harsh V. Pant, “The ‘Great Game of this century will be played on the waters of the Indian Ocean. Though India’s location gives it great operational advantages in the IOR, it is by no means certain that New Delhi is in a position to hold on to its geographical advantages. China is rapidly catching up and its ties with Sri Lanka, are aimed at expanding its profile in this crucial part of the world. Indian policymakers realize that unless they are more proactive they might end up losing this ‘game’ for good”. “Colombo matters because the Indian Ocean matters”
Former Secretary of State John Kerry’s report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009, urges the US government to forge closer ties with Sri Lanka to prevent it from drifting into the “Chinese orbit”. Fast forward to this year, a visit by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs - Alice Wells - to Sri Lanka, in September 2017, saw her tout the Trump foreign policy that: the US was seriously concerned over the “unsustainable debt burden on Sri Lanka due to non-concessional loans from China”.
According to Robert Kaplan, Sri Lanka is a geostrategic hub. He considers “Sri Lanka part of the new [maritime] geography”. He also explains the geo-political symbolism of Sri Lanka’s location. “It’s part of China’s plan to construct a string of pearls – ports that they don’t own, but which they could use for their warships across the Indian Ocean”. In this regard, Hambantota Port is centre stage due to its geographical position and its Chinese-led development. Situated at the southern tip of Sri Lanka, Hambantota is adjacent to the busiest shipping lanes of the world.
Most western scholars alike see China’s posturing in the IOR for military strategic reasons. However, Sri Lanka and China continue to emphasize the fact that the Sino-Lankan partnership is for “economic reasons and not for military reasons”. Currently, not many ships dock at Hambantota, the Chinese built port in the South of Sri Lanka and it is not as busy a harbour as the Colombo Port. Yet, this position will change with the development of the Gwadar Port and CPEC in full operation.
Sri Lanka’s Geographical position
The Indian Ocean covers approximately 20 percent of the water of the earth’s surface - 70,560,000 sqkm. The IOR is surrounded by the land masses of Asia, Africa and Australia and Antarctica. The Indian Ocean is named after the Indian subcontinent and has several choke points such as the Bab-el-Mandeb, the Strait of Hormuz, the Lombok Strait, the Strait of Malacca and the Palk Strait.
14.6 percent of the world’s fish stock is caught in this region, according to the FAO. Around 36 million barrels per day - equivalent to about 40 per cent of the world’s oil supply and 64 per cent of oil trade - travel through the entry ways into and out of the Indian Ocean, including some of the aforementioned straits.
The land masses surrounding the region are densely populated with over 2 billion people.
Many Sri Lankan governments from time to time promote Sri Lanka as a hub. Actually this is not necessary, since we are already a hub geographically from ancient times.
In ancient libraries of Alexandria, the island was called Taprobane, mapped in an oversized proportion by Ptolemy, the Greek-Egyptian cartographer. Sri Lanka was elongated on Ptolemy’s map due to its rich civilization and trade relations with the rest of the world.
After the discovery and mapping of the Cape of Good Hope and the subsequent discovery of the Indian Ocean, Henricus Martellus’s world map (c.1489) also clearly depicts Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka could be defined as Sir Halford Mackinder’s outer crescent touching the rim land. Two other nations which have similar geographical positioning are the islands of Britain and Japan, having access to the Atlantic and to the Pacific oceans respectively, close to the continent, but separated by the ocean.
Since Mackinder’s land-based-pivot-area strategy, the pivot area has veered towards having control of the oceans. In the same vein, Alfred Mahan’s statement that “whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia, the destiny of the world will be decided on its waters”, has never been more apparent.
Chinese Sphere of influence in IOR - Sino-Lankan Relations
The Sino-Lankan relationship is one that dates back to the Chinese mariner - Zheng His visit to Sri Lanka in 1405, a century prior to Vasco Da Gama’s visit to this region in 1498. This confirms the Chinese interest in the IOR and Sri Lanka in particular, before the colonial period. The Sino-Lankan relationship has moved to a strategic relationship after the visit of President Xi and the resurrection of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative.

Today, China is Sri Lanka’s second largest trading partner, surpassing the US and just behind India. Sino-Lankan trade remains at more than US $ 3 billion. Our economic partnership will only grow with the Chinese economic zone and Hambantota Port in full operation. By 2025, China will become Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner due to the significant investments in the island as well as in the region.
Nevertheless, caution is being touted that, “Sri Lanka will not have the negotiation capacity and the economic strength to deter China when it wants a military base in the future”. The foreign policy of the Sri Lankan government is explicitly clear in the face of such conjectures: “The Sri Lankan Government does not make its bases available to foreign forces”.
It’s also important to consider China’s geo-strategic disadvantages in the Indian Ocean when examining this point. According to Dr. David Brewster, “China’s strategic vulnerability is reinforced by the scarcity of overland transport connections between Chinese territory and the Indian Ocean.” He further states that China currently has no ability to exert control over the choke points nor has it any regular naval presence in any of the IOR ports.
China’s presence on Land and Sea
According to Abhijit Singh, “Despite denials by their regional leaders, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh are poised to witness a substantial expansion of China’s maritime footprint. The expansion of PLA Navy submarine activity in South Asia is quite in keeping with a powerful navy’s need to familiarise itself with alien operating conditions. The pattern of Chinese submarine visits reveals that the PLA Navy has been incrementally raising the complexity of its deployments, sending both conventional and nuclear submarines to learn more about the Indian Ocean’s operating environment.”
Indian observers fear that Sri Lanka’s reluctance to allow basing facilities for PLA Navy warships and submarines immediately, will lead Beijing to consider Gwadar, Maldives, Chittagong (Bangladesh) or Kyaukphu (Myanmar) as alternative options. For New Delhi, China’s growing maritime involvement with these states, indicates a tightening strategic hold over the South Asian rim, a traditional Indian sphere of geo-political influence.
This cautious atmosphere has been trumped up by the recent Chinese submarine encounters in the IOR that have arguably created a few ripples in the geopolitical context. According to Prof. Shen Dingli at Fudan University, “it is wrong for us to believe that we have no right to set up bases abroad”. He argues that China needs not only a blue-water navy but also overseas military bases to cut the supply cost.
In the South China Sea Abijith Sing warns that “China itself has plans to build its own “Great Wall” under the South China Sea, through which 30 percent of the world’s trade passes. On the surface too, China has been increasingly assertive, having built a string of installations that include airstrips and other military facilities. To listen to underwater battle, India and Japan plan to install a sea wall of “hydrophones”—microphones with sensors, placed on the seabedbetween southern India and the northern tip of Indonesia.”
The One Belt one Road Initiative (known commonly as OBOR) was a construct of the scholar - Wang Jisi’s strategic thinking, to have a significant Chinese footprint in Eurasia, especially to recalibrate the existing world order. The OBOR is the “project of the century”, according to President Xi Jinping. This trillion-dollar initiative aims to integrate Eurasia through the development of infrastructure. It is unquestionably the most ambitious project ever launched in recent times, which seeks to revisit and resurrect the Ming dynasty’s - admiral Zheng He’s global legacy. Thus, the OBOR, when it comes to fruition, will symbolize what I have been talking about in this section – the twin powers of China’s economic and military strength in the IOR.
According to the World Economic Forum, by 2030 the US will no longer be the only superpower and China will be well placed among the many countries to become one of the great powers. The OBOR is the medium through which China envisions this new world order. Sri Lanka, with its geostrategic position at the centre of the Maritime Silk Road, is a ‘super-connector’ linking the east-west sea lanes. Therefore, as a nation we have a choice in how we calibrate our foreign policy based on this strategic advantage.
Not all nations support China’s OBOR, India recently was absent from the OBOR Summit. According to LKY Prof Kanti Bajpai the real reason for India’s absence from the OBOR are quite different and it’s not the CPEC. It is galling to New Delhi that the entire world is lining up to do business with a rampant China and no one is paying India much attention. Envy apart, there is the strategic worry that China will ‘encircle’ India. That China with an economy five times the size of India, needs the BRI and an encirclement of India to deal with its weak neighbour is unlikely, but clearly this assumption motivates Indian strategic thinking.
