New economic growth prospects among nations in Asia

As pointed famously by the great master. Albert Einstein that – compounding is the greatest mathematical discovery of all times, there is indeed a magic in compounding, when applied to Gross Domestic Production (GDP). Its enabling possible welfare impact on human population is what this magic can finally enlighten us. Let us see how it is expected to work.
The magic of compounding rate of growth of GDP
According to compounding the rate of increase, using the old rule of the thumb call rule 70,if a quantity increase at 1 per cent per annum, it takes 70 years for that quantity to double itself. Then if the rate is 2 percent per annum it takes 35 years to double itself, i.e 70/2 and so on, 70/3, 70/4 ... 70/x where x is the annual percentage increase of a quantity. If then a country-s GDP increase likewise, one can easily visualize what can be the outcome of that to the country-s GDP if the rate of increase is 7 per cent per annum, then its GDP would double itself in ten years. If the rate is 10 percent per annum, it will double itself in just 7 years. Take an example, assume Sri Lankan GDP is US dollars 85 billion and it increases at a rate of 7 per cent per annum, steadily each year, then Sri Lankan economy would be 170 billion in a decade and if we can up it to 10 per cent, then in just 7 years Sri Lankans would experience the impact of doubling the country-s GDP, thus taking the high road to high income status within a few decades, to enjoying high living standards, provided of course , we can manage the environment and other possible issues related to rapid economic changes in several areas of production and distribution. People at different income levels and employment would experience a rise in their level living standards, by being able to consume a wider range of quality goods and services, generally satisfying conditions of life and work. This is how a stable political condition, under a strong political leadership to manage the country’s political economy and its strategy for long term transformation can work, countries like Malaysia and Singapore are good examples. This 70 rule of compounding rate can be stated as 2 Q= 70/X p,c. Where 2 Q is the doubling quantity, seventy year rule compounding and X is the rate of percentage increase. The magic of compounding is obvious. However, two important implications for the magic to work itself and show its power are , first the rate of increase must be substantial, e.g 7 to 10 per cent annually in order to get short-term substantial growth, without having to wait for long to reap a rise in incomes, consumption and satisfying living standard in work and life and secondly the increase must be sustainable over time, the economic growth must be on a high level upward path, without serious break or fall. This implies a crucial requirement of an appropriate strategy and economic management, underlining undoubtedly a strong and stable political leadership which is committed and development and steady change.
The success stories of Far –East and South-East are there for one to learn for managing affairs of a state. The economic history of the 1980s and 90s show many instances and settings to illustrate this aspect. For example Japan and South Korea have had steady development and growth to reach the status on high incomes within short period of time and both countries are today members of OECD the rich country club.
Economic development and growth
Many factors are responsible for the size and growth of GDP over time. These factors are obviously – the human resources and their quality (human capital), the natural resources, land and water plus minerals and the stock of capital, which includes machines and tools, the infrastructure and finally the technology deployed. Given these factors which are vital for development and growth of the economy of a countries, there are other enabling factors or facilities which help the economy to move upward steadily over time. These factors include institutions relating to law and order, property rights and legal environment facilitating enterprise, technology and education, research and development efforts in industry and trade. Perhaps the most crucial factor is the government strategy and policy in economic management and its consistency and sustainability, politically. It is in this context that political stability and good governance come in to play enabling conditions for the steady growth and development of the economy.
Long run consequences of growth among states
Different growth rates and growth prospects matter very much when we consider world view and what can possibly follows in future. It is noted that in the last 300 years developed, what is now considered as global division of labour and its intensification, identified by economic historians as industrial revolution and related expansion of commerce and trade among nations in the west initially. Following this, led by UK and other West- European states and later joined by USA developed, what came be called the Atlantic Economic core area, while Asia, Africa and Latin America as the periphery, to be much exploited for raw materials, labour, initially as slaves, later as cheap labour and finally the whole region to become the markets for mass produced goods of the of the developed core area.
This was the pattern of development and growth in the last two centuries into what came to be called European hegemony in world affairs. The development was never peaceful, conflicts and wars among them followed in succession, besides the material improvements to living standards globally through new knowledge and technology used in production of new consumer goods and services, distribution and in organizational management. By 1950s change in the affairs of States was taking place following conflicts and wars leading to development and growth of the economies of states across the world, particularly those in Asia, which happened to be the largest continent, containing some of the oldest world civilizations.
The global economic map has been changing continually, new centres of activity and growth, replacing the old and creating new changes and trends in economic development and growth among states. Today for example we witness the rise of miracle economies in Asia, first Japan after the second world war, then the- tiger economies, the newly industrialising centres of Hong Kong, S.Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and later followed by Malaysia and possibly Thailand.
Most recently the re-emergence of China, considered the –dragon economy of gigantic proportion and the potential economic dynamism of India. In the period 1980 to 2003 China has recorded the highest economic growth rate exceeding well over 10 per cent. This remarkable high rate of growth of China’s mammoth economy continued through 2007 until 2008 global financial crisis when most economies dipped dramatically. China appeared t o have recovered fast , to grow 7 to 8 per cent. The export share of China’s GDP increased from 38 per cent in 2002 to over 50 percent in 2016. Then China became the world largest manufacture- producer, the largest agricultural producer and finally the world’s largest exporter of merchandise and second largest importer.
Following these developments China became the world’s biggest consumer of steel, aluminium, copper, zinc and nickle, hence creating a large market for these mineral producers. Through its labour intensive production and its ability to keep the output prices low in international markets, China earned massive surpluses in foreign exchange thus becoming a strong creditor nation in international trade and investments. It has emerged as the second largest economy in the world and is vying for world leadership. The rapid economic development of China is outstanding in the history of development. Sixty years ago China was a poor country with wide spread poverty and even occasional food shortages experiencing floods and droughts in the country, pressed with a massive population to cope with. This Chinese record of achievement in economic development and growth, in such a short period is indeed unique, not recorded anywhere in world history before. Besides this inspiring China development, today we witness a number of emerging economies – groups, with acronyms such BRIC, MINCTS, and CIVETS, each letter in the acronym signifying a country emerging as countries of rapid economic growth global. For example in the acronym, BRIC, stand for Brazil, Russia, India and China, and in MINCTS, M stands for Mexico, N for Nigeria, T for Turkey and in CIVETS, V stand for Vietnam, E for Egypt ,and S for South Africa. These groups of countries emerging as growth prone economies clearly indicate what the shape of global economic map is going to be, i.e. becoming and not become yet and therefore the key appropriate words for describing the expected global economic map are, flexing and fluxing processes. In fact the global economic map that has evolved over time in the past, display some striking characteristics. Firstly the volume of trade exceeding output production, worldwide. Further the net work of world’s merchandise trade that has developed strongly in last few decades show a growing trends of trading among neighbours rather than with far-off states. This leading to neighbourly logistic developments and clusters of complementary- economic activity near geographic regions, giving rise to development of logistic hubs and promoting of trade agreements and preferential tariff agreement among neighbouring states.
Hence giving rise to a crop of economic agreements among nations in for trade and industry. This can promote co-operation and understanding among nations and promoting world peace. In this geographic setting of the of global economy, the following are note worthy: Europe still remains the world-s largest trading region accounting for 39 percent of global trade , of which 70 per cent is among the neighbours in Europe itself. Only 13 per cent is with Asia and 7 per cent with America. Asia is the second most significant trade region accounting for 16 percent of the world trade and of which 57 percent is intra-regional, i.e. among neighbours in Asia and only 12 per cent with Europe and 9 per cent with America. North America accounts for only 16 per cent of the world trade and conducts 38 per cent of trade internally. The other most significant feature of the global economy is the rise of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). (This is direct investment across national boundaries, to buy a controlling share of a foreign firm or setting up a new affiliate to produce goods. Up until 1985, FDI grew in parallel to trade worldwide but subsequently FDI grew faster than trade. This significant divergence of trade and FDI is attributed to a development of a mechanism of interconnectedness within the global economy in trade and investments involving newly emerging communication technology and arrangement systems in business organizations, the key player being the Trans-National Corporation, which has come to play a major role some economies, particularly those for small economies, below 100 billion dollar GDP economies. The importance of FDI to national economies varies widely across countries. For example in 2012 for India, the FDI share of GDP was only 12.2 per cent, Indonesia it was 23.4, Malaysia it was 42.6, and for the high income Switzerland it was 100.7 per cents of each respective GDPs. Despite this variability the FDI has grown over time in most cases. Unfortunately the inward flow of FDI to Sri Lankan economy has been weak and unsteady following political instability and uncertainty, particularly after 2015.
Investors pursue profits in safe havens is a fact of life. That is why countries with political stability under strong leaders tend to attract FDIs and they contribute to economic development and growth process in several ways. Many economies in the Far-East demonstrate this clearly. Both in technological change and transfer of technologies and market expansion FDIs play a crucial role as illustrated by success stories from Easts Asian economies
Finally it is gradually being realised that the State and its strategies play a crucial role in economic development and growth, despite the conventional wisdom based on the faith of neo-classical market forces. The rise of miracle economies of South Korea, Singapore and now China are good examples to show how the role of State matter very much in development and economic growth process in their respective countries. In all three countries the strategies for development and growth were based on strong political leaders who were highly committed nationalistic leaders. This is well illustrated by the statement made by Chinese President Xi Jinping before the China’s Peoples Congress. China will sustain high economic growth, will protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investment companies. China will never close its doors to the outside world. This statement expresses China’s strong commitment to growth and development in the coming decades together with her Open Door Policy. The case of China shows clearly what a strong political leadership can achieve, in economic development in a short period even with such large population of over a billion people, in a country much of it not so fertile.
The pivotal change came only in1979 and since then the country came to be guided a strong political leadership. The State and its political leadership matters very much in economic development and growth, irrespective of the size of the country. China’s strong desire to expand its old trading links well beyond its ancient silk route and to spread her development initiatives to other nations is indeed, both praiseworthy and challenging. Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is a most ambitious project, reflecting China’s new vision in modern world, perhaps diametrically opposite to what the Great Wall in her history signified. This BRI project planned has two main components, one land based travel rout to run through six corridors covering most nations in Asia and Europe, to facilitate trade and industry flow across countries to link with China. The second component is a Maritime Shipping route in the east and south involving the development of shipping harbours, hydrocarbon refineries, and industry parks in large number of various nations enroute on the planned shipping routes, based on the projects, the development of the Hambantota Harbour and Colombo Port City are part of this multi-nations project. When fully developed and functioning these projects in world trade and industry development would surely lead to a very different global economic map from what it is today.
Hence the expected massive shift of the global economy to Asia in the coming decades. Many a political change are to be expected ,either accompanying or following this shift and the recent political change in Malaysia reflecting the need for strong political leaders of good track records, perhaps signify the new trend emerging in politics of Asia, accompanying this shift in its economy.
