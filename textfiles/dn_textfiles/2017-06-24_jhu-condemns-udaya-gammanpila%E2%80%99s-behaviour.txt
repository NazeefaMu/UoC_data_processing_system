JHU condemns Udaya Gammanpila’s behaviour

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) condemned the behaviour of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader, Parliamentarian, Udaya Gammanpila who insulted the JHU Leader, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU Office in Battaramulla, JHU National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Gammanpila insulted JHU Leader Patali Champika Ranawaka by calling him different names and even criticised his parents for giving his name.
“The reason for insulting and immoral behaviour of Gammanpila is questionable, as he is a person with a good family background.
His father was a Principal and the mother was a teacher,” Warnasinghe said.
He said Gammanpila is a person who betrayed his party and enjoyed benefits.
Presenting audio evidence in which former MP Sajin Vas Gunawardane mentions about a secret meeting he had with Gammanpila, JHU Deputy General Secretary Anuruddha Pradeep said Gammanpila stopped criticising former MP Sajin Vas after releasing the audio evidence. It proved the hidden agendas of Gammanpila, he said.
