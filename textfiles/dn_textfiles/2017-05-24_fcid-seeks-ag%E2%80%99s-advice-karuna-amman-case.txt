FCID seeks AG’s advice on Karuna Amman case

 
The FCID informed Courts today that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal steps to be taken regarding former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman’s case on the allegation against misusing a Presidential Secretariat bullet proof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million. 
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the FCID told that they were waiting for Attorney General’s advice and sought a further date to report the progress of the case.
The FCID alleged that the suspect purposely ignored his duty to hand this vehicle over to the Presidential Secretariat even after he lost his Ministerial position in 2015.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the FCID on November last year, alleging him to have failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat after losing his Ministerial position in 2015.
The FCID further alleged that the former deputy minister had failed to return this vehicle until August 2016 by violating the provisions of Public Property Act.
He is currently out on bail.
