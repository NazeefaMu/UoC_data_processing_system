Murder of Sri Lankan:
Police charge 44-year-old Selliah

A 44-year-old man has been charged with murder following the stabbing of Sri Lankan national Arunesh Thangarajah in Mitcham, southwest London on Sunday.
Manimaran Selliah, of London Road, Mitcham, was arrested by police in Upper Green East on the morning of the attack (May 20) and was charged yesterday, not only with murder, but also the attempted GBH (grievous bodily harm) of the 35-year-old man.
He was remanded in custody and was scheduled to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates Court yesterday.
Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding from the Homicide and Major Crime Command believes this incident is not gang related. “We will be speaking to locals and continue to appeal for those who witnessed the attack or have information to get in touch,” he said.
“I fully appreciate the alarm this incident has caused within the area. This attack is not being treated as gang related or racially motivated.”
