Pregnancy time  dress for teachers

A suitable dress designed by an expert panel for pregnant teachers was introduced to the fraternity at the Education Ministry yesterday.
The expert panel that designed the dress included doctors, fashion designers and academics. There are 236,000 teachers in the education system and of them 172,000 are female. A large number of them, over 10,000, are on maternity leave annually.Pregnant teachers up to now had to wear sarees to schools causing them inconveniences.Therefore, the Education Ministry introduced this comfortable and dignified maternity dress for school teachers.
Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr.Vijith Vidyabushana, a member of the panel that designed the dress said it was designed considering the physical difficulties specially during the last few months of pregnancy.
He said a pregnant woman should wear a comfortable dress during pregnancy, and therefore, the dress was designed with the objective of introducing a comfortable dress that does not harm the professionalism and decorum of teachers while providing an efficient and effective service by experiencing the splendour of pregnancy.
He said that the saree is not a suitable dress for any pregnant woman, that may result in several health issues such as gastritis, uneasiness in passing urine and fungal infections among others. “Moreover it is difficult to climb steps or staircases wearing a saree.There is a tendency to fall. Such cases are reported commonly,” he added.
Panel member Dr.Virajini Medagedara Karunaratne of the Moratuwa university and a member of the expert panel, that prepared the dress said they wanted to bring in tradition as well as modernity when designing the pattern. The pregnancy dress comes in six patterns and in six light colours.
