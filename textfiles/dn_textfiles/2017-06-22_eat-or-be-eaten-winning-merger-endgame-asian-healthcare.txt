Eat or be eaten: winning the merger endgame in Asian healthcare

Overview
A bird’s eye view of the global healthcare landscape reveals a market in consolidation and the implications for Asia are well worth considering.
In 2016, healthcare mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity worldwide topped approximately US$ 320 billion.
With 169 deals valued at approximately US$ 29 billion, Asia accounted for 9% of the global pie. For some healthcare players, the endgame might be more apparent than others: If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu—or worse still, on your way out.
Back in 2008, Chinese medical device manufacturer Shenzhen Goldway Industrial found itself on the menu, when Phillips snapped it up in a bid to solidify its place in the patient monitoring market.
Fast forward a couple of years and Asia-based providers are increasingly ‘at the table’ making their own cross-border bids.
With an ‘eat or be eaten’ narrative at play, should Asian health providers increasingly look to the acquisitions bandwagon to stay competitive? Whether through local or cross-border deals, the question is a pressing one, both for the C-suite in healthcare and investors.
The Consolidation Lifecycle
According to the merger endgames theory posited by A.T. Kearney researchers, the answer depends on where a particular industry falls in a four-stage consolidation lifecycle. The theory- which is based on an analysis of approximately 25,000 companies across 24 industries globally - suggests that all industries will journey through the same four stages over an approximately 25-year period.
The companies that fare well in the long term are reportedly the ones that take a proactive role in driving their industry’s consolidation - the so-called endgame.
The idea is simple. If it is possible to understand the defining traits of each stage in the consolidation lifecycle, a business should undertake every major strategic and operational move in line with their place in a particular industry and the industry’s stage in the overall consolidation trajectory.
This sounds promising in theory, but what does it mean?
Stage 1: An industry is said to ‘open’ with a single start-up or a monopoly resulting from deregulation or privatization. Initially, industry concentration stands at 100% but as competitors make swift inroads, the market quickly becomes fragmented.
Players at this initial stage are focused on making inroads, with no real rationale for consolidation.
Stage 2: With the passage of time, players in the industry switch towards building scale and the Top Three come to hold 15-45% of the market.
This is a stage of rapid consolidation as larger players absorb smaller targets in their effort to create ‘empires’.
Stage 3: By this stage, players in the industry are focused on developing their core business and outpacing the competition, with the Top Three claiming 35%–70% of the market.
Unlike the previous phase when larger companies acquired weaker targets, Stage 3 is all about megadeals and large-scale consolidation.
Stage 4: During the balance and alliance stage, the Top Three companies control 70%–90% of the market.
This is a stage when further consolidation is either limited or non-existent, whether due to antitrust concerns or industry complexity. Instead, companies operating in these industries must defend their leading positions.
Application of the Consolidation Lifecycle
Within the global healthcare landscape, the concern is that consolidation decisions don’t pan out as planned, partly due to poor timing.
For Asian providers particularly, the need of the hour is to build strategy around the stage of the industry in which they operate.
What might it look like if the consolidation lifecycle was applied to some of these players?
Stage 1: Regenerative Medicine in Japan
In Japan, regenerative therapies are a good example of a Stage 1 industry, owing to a new legal framework for cell-based and tissue-based therapies that went into effect in November 2014—expediting the development and conditional approval of products that demonstrate safety and probable efficacy.
Japanese corporations such as Cyberdyne and Healios K.K. are increasingly investigating opportunities to bring regenerative therapies to market, even as foreign companies - like Australian regenerative medicine business Mesoblast - look at more partnership deals in Japan.
According to the consolidation lifecycle, the right move for companies in Stage 1 industries is to aggressively defend their first-mover advantage by building scale, developing a global footprint and protecting proprietary technology and ideas.
The idea is to focus on earning revenue and amassing market share, particularly before competitors encroach upon the opportunity.
If the consolidation lifecycle is to be believed, it is still too early for players in this stage to consider acquisitive activity as a viable strategic move.
Stage 2: Pharmaceuticals Sector in Japan, China and India
A sampling of recent deal activity in Asia suggests that the pharmaceuticals sector is a good example of a Stage 2 industry where players have been focused on building scale.
In the three years leading up to 30 June 2016, approximately 388 healthcare deals transpired in Asia. Amongst these, approximately 125 deals were in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology space—with approximately 70% of acquisitive activity involving companies based in Japan, China and India.
In Japan’s Big Pharma market, the bulk of large-scale consolidation took place in the past decade, involving companies like Astellas and Takeda.
Lately, Indian pharma giants like Torrent Pharmaceuticals have also been busy swallowing up smaller players. In Torrent’s case, these acquisitions have been a means of enhancing their standing as a manufacturer of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for regulated markets.
In China, most recent deal activity has involved domestic players in Chinese herbals and natural medicine.
A Stage 2 industry is one that has found its bearings - front-runners in such industries typically enjoy a stable income stream and entrenched customer relationships.
At this point, it makes sense to build scale. As such, Stage 2 is characterized by larger players regularly absorbing smaller targets.
On the flip side, companies that opt to sit out the M&A wave can grow increasingly vulnerable to ‘being eaten’.
Achieving a calibrated fit in terms of acquisitions may be pivotal for businesses that do not wish to be overtaken in a Stage 2 industry.
Stage 3: In-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) Market in China
Globally, the IVD industry has been rather deal-oriented with approximately 240 acquisitions between 2012 and October 2015.
With in-vitro diagnostics influencing over 60% of clinical decision-making, this is a market that appears to be switching from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in China - with foreign players driving the endgame rather than homegrown companies.
International companies currently account for approximately 75% of the Chinese market, with Roche (approximately 20%) dominating the space.
For players in Stage 3, the strategic priority is to enhance their core business and outpace the competition via large-scale consolidation plays.
The goal is no longer the acquisition of smaller targets but mergers of equals. Over the past 2 years, Roche in particular has embarked on a string of acquisitions in order to ensure that the company has an end-to-end value proposition that meets the needs of customers in the clinical sequencing arena.
In future, the company is likely to shift towards larger-scale plays in the region. By comparison, it would appear that homegrown Chinese players in the IVD space have already lost the merger endgame.
Stage 4: Private Hospitals in Singapore
Singapore’s private hospital space is on the cusp of transition from Stage 3 to Stage 4.
While large companies operating in Stage 3 of the industry lifecycle tend to focus on outpacing the competition via large-scale consolidation plays, such players eventually transition into Stage 4 ‘Grandmasters’ whose priority it is to defend their leading positions.
IHH Healthcare Berhad—the 2012 IPO-ed offspring of Singapore’s Parkway and Malaysia’s Pantai—is a solid example of a merger of equals that is pushing Singapore’s private hospital market towards Stage 4. In 2012, IHH alone commanded approximately 44% of licenced beds and approximately 70% of revenues across Singapore.
With approximately 10,000 licenced beds in 52 hospitals across 10 countries and a market value of approximately US$ 14.2 billion in 2016, IHH also tops the region’s healthcare providers in market value.
Companies like IHH that lead in Stage 4 industries have the potential to be successful for a long time depending on how they handle their position.
So What?
Ultimately, the merger endgames theory or consolidation lifecycle has its limitations in terms of the precision with which it can explain an industry’s trajectory over time and the behavior of companies within these industries.
The real value of the consolidation lifecycle, however, is as one of several frameworks for strategic thinking. Health conglomerates can also leverage this knowledge in order to optimize their aggregate portfolio of subsidiaries and business units across the different endgame stages. Not every player can lead the consolidation endgame but there is much to be learned by tracking the progress of Endgame winners, like Roche and IHH Healthcare.
