Thenuwara's 'Executive Demon' Feels Like a Mistake

Entering the main exhibition space of Chandraguptha Thenuwara’s Executive Demon at Saskia Fernando Gallery feels like accidentally walking in on someone getting dressed or seeing an upscale bar with the lights turned on. It is an attack on highbrow gallery standards in the form of a large, gold-coated, nude figure, fallen on the floor.
Forcing the viewer look down and grapple with the discomfort of this massive interruption in the exhibition space, Thenuwara’s Excecutive Demon thwarts the notion that art is to be elevated and deified. The gold-clad figure-- with its lifted arms and spread legs-- insists you step around it, like a piece of garbage, rather than the carefully crafted statue that it is. Violating the credo of the modern gallery, it feels like a mistake.
On the one hand, the sculpture could have been knocked over by a boisterous child moments before , for, surely, the cur could not have remained in pristine gallery space in such condition for long. But, on the other hand, the figure stubbornly retains its standing posture—arms raised, feet flat, not a broken bone in its golden body-—suggesting it could not have fallen, and its placement must be intentional. Without a frenzied gallery assistant trying to pick up the statue, the unsettling silence of its demise reverberates through the sterile room.
Executive Demon is a six-armed, naked man, gripping a symbol in each hand-- from the politically-charged lion tail representing nationalism and mace representing parliament, to the Blue lotus (Nil Manel), Sri Lanka’s national flower, and Themis, the goddess of divine law. Thenuwara does not shy away from darker themes-- figures of copulation represent sex and gambling and a pistol and a knife represent organized crime. Snakes stretch voraciously from the figure’s head, an allusion to Medusa, a Grecian mythological creature infamous for her serpentine hair and ability to turn everything she looked at to stone.
Thenuwara calls the work a commentary on the executive presidency, how, “one day, [it] must fall,” but the work is as much a commentary on the presidency as it is a commentary on institutions and the gallery as a space that operates under certain rules and expectations.
The curator describes Executive Demon as a “monster,” and Thenuwara calls it a “warning,” but, slithering hair aside, the fallen figure hardly arouses the sense of fear its name or description suggests. While vertiginous and even unnerving to look at, the figure has a placid, innocuous face, evoking images of a theater mask rather than a demon.
Perhaps, that is precisely Thenuwara’s point.
Such is the nature of Thenuwara’s political demon-- superficially harmless, grotesque only in its ostentation, and furtive in guarding the secrets of its power. Thenuwara’s piece embodies the “demonic qualities” of a political office with staying power, despite being fraught with controversy.
What is truly terrifying, in the conventional sense, is the complusion to pick up the figure--akin to looking at a frame hung crooked on a wall. But here, the urge to correct, to restore dignity to the figure, has symbolic repercussions.
“The sculpture is on the ground intentionally, implying that it should not be lifted upright, emphasizing the absence of someone to venerate it,” states Thenuwara. When a viewer enters the room, they fill the absence and become the person to venerate it.
Thenuwara creates an emotional simulation of our allegiance to established institutions and calls attention to the widespread belief that something large, gold, and heavy with the weight of the establishment, deserves respect.
While Thenuwara says his work is a representation of how the executive presidency must fall, central to the piece is the persistence of the position. The demon retains its standing posture so defiantly, so resolutely; one cannot help but cock one’s head to the side and impose on the fallen figure the image of what it would look like upright.
The rigidity represents the oft sedentary, immovable nature of the institution. In Thenuwara’s piece, the executive presidency, even when defunct, becomes the elephant in the room that won’t budge.
A series of preparatory drawings line the wall above Executive Demon. There, fluid pen strokes contrast the rigid mass in the center of the room. In one image, lotuses grow into the form of a swastika, and in another, they metamorphosize into snakes. A visual rhyme with greater political and cultural undertones, these pieces emphasize how easily one thing becomes another. From roughly rendered barrels to what looks like machine-generated camouflage, Thenuwara’s creations vary stylistically, and across the exhibition a cohesive narrative-- apart from political undertones-- is difficult to find.
A commentary on construction in Colombo during the civil war, his ‘barrelist’ works highlight the contradictory way in which construction can obstruct. His ‘camouflage’ works camouflage internally—a close look at one reveals anthropomorphic forms and legs. But, on the wall, these pieces stand out-- the opposite of what camouflage should do. In the final room, a new series called “Glitch” features pixelated human forms peering out of abstract grids. It alludes to the malfunction of contemporary politics and, perhaps, technology’s role exacerbating the problem.
A sense of brokenness, of objects in disrepair unites the stylistically disparate works, and Executive Demon is no exception.
A gold statue’s very function is to be ostentatious, to be looked upon with reverence. Here, the malfunction is not within the piece but outside of it. The gold figure is not inherently dysfunctional, rather, its lack of proper positioning defies the rules of the gallery.
Executive Demon stands apart from the other works in the show because there is a sense we can and should correct this malfunction, but the inclination to fix it may just say more about the viewer than the piece.
Executive Demon and Other Works is on view at the Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41 Horton Pl, Colombo 7, until August 14, 2018.
