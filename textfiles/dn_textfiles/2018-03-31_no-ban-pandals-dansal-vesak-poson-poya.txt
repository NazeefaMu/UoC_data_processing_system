No ban on pandals, dansal for Vesak, Poson poya

The government has not taken any decision to ban dansals and pandals on Vesak and Poson celebrations, the Government Information Department said yesterday.
“The government had not taken any decision to ban pandals and dansals during the Vesak and Poson full moon Poya days.Media reports quoting the Buddha Sasana minister as saying that dansals and pandals have been banned on these poya days are false.There is no impediment for the public to organise Pandals or Dansals,” the statement said.
However, Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera had requested the public to avoid pandals and dansals during the Vesak and Poson full moon poya days to emphasis on Prathipaththi pooja than the Amisa Pooja. This request has been made with the full concurrence and agreement of the Buddha Sasana Advisory Council and it is not meant to ban pandals or dansals. All decisions with regard to the Buddhism are taken by this Council that consists of eminent Buddhist monks.
