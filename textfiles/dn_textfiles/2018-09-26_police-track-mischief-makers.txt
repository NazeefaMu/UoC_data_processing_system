Semi nude photos atop Pidurangala:
Police to track mischief makers

Police have begun investigations into half nude photographs posted on social media taken atop the Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya rock in Sigiriya.
The Sigiriya Police had received a complaint regarding these social media posts yesterday, Police media spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Sigiriya Police will initiate legal action against the visitors under the Obscene Publications (Amended) Act No.22 of 1983, the spokesman said.
Dr.Daniyagama Ananda Thera of the Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya said legal action should be taken against the group of youth involved in the incident immediately.
The Thera said the youth by their obscene act has insulted a world heritage site which also showcases the country’s Buddhist culture.
The Thera said a complaint has been lodged with the Police.
