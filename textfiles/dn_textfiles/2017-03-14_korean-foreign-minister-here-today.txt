Korean Foreign Minister here today

South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se will arrive in Sri Lanka today to discuss economic cooperation and joint policies in dealing with a wayward North Korea, his ministry said yesterday.
According to the Korean Herald, Yun will arrive in Sri Lanka today for a three-day visit marking the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the countries. He will also visit Vietnam after the Sri Lankan tour.
The Korean Foreign Minister will hold talks with Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and pay a courtesy call on President Maithripala Sirisena.
The visit will focus on deepening South Korea's economic cooperation with Sri Lanka as well as stepping up collaboration over North Korea's provocations, according to the Korean foreign ministry.
Last week, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles, the latest military provocation which followed the country's test of a new type of intermediate ballistic missile last month, according to the Korean Herald.
A month earlier, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother Kim Jong-nam was assassinated by North Korean suspects at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, resulting in severe diplomatic tension with Malaysia, the report said.
"Yun's visit is expected to produce a milestone in strengthening collaboration with the Southeast and Southwest Asian region in dealing with North Korea," the ministry said.
En route to Sri Lanka the minister plans to briefly stop in Singapore for talks with the city state's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, focusing on security and global issues, the ministry also noted, according to the report.
