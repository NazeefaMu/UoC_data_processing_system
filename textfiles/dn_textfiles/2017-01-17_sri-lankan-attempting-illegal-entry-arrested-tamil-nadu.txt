Sri Lankan attempting illegal entry arrested in Tamil Nadu

 
RAMESWARAM:  A 27-year-old Sri Lankan was arrested at Arichal Munai, Tamil Nadu, after he arrived by an illegal ferry, four days after another man from the island nation was held from the same area.
Police said Rochen (27) told them he had come here from Vavuniya in the island nation after paying Rs 40,000 to a ferry operator, who dropped him and then went back to Sri Lanka. On January 13, another Lankan national Prithviraj landed in the same area by illegal ferry and was arrested.
Meanwhile, officials quoted fishermen from Mandapam as telling them that the situation in Palk Straits was scary, as gold and ganja smugglers were making frequent trips to Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar and the fishermen were caught between the smugglers and the Sri Lankan Navy.
They wanted the Coastal Marine Group to further tighten vigil on the sea.
