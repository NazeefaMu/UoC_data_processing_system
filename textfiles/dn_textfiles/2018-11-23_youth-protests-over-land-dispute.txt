Youth protests over land dispute

A person in the Mahaweli C Zone staged a protest on the roof of the Dehiattakandiya Mahaweli Project Management Office on Wednesday, as authorities had failed to resolve a land issue after 12 years.
The protester, 26-year-old Sujith Niroshan of Ulpathawewa, Veheragala, climbed on the roof in the morning with his documents, saying that the land granted to his father had been given to another person, although he he had demanded right to ownership of it.
The youth said that his grandfather was granted several lands in 1990, including paddy fields, and that they were used by his father after his demise. He added that that his father had been imprisoned later and since then, for 12 years, he was demanding the land to be given to him. Niroshan added that instead of giving them to him, the lands had been given to someone else.
However, Niroshan ended the protest when Dehiattakandiya Mahaweli Project Management Office Manager K.A.C. Vimal Kumara had promised to grant him other lands to continue his cultivation.
