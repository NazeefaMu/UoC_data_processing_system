Special events were organised in Colombo to commemorate the 157th birth anniversary of Nobel Laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, who has a special place in the heart of Sri Lankans and whose legacy continues to have a lasting influence on local art and culture.
The Centre for Contemporary Indian Studies of University of Colombo organised an event at the Main Library of the University. Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu graced the occasion as the chief guest and garlanded the bust of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Colombo University Vice Chancellor, Senior Professor Lakshman Dissanayake, Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies, Prof. Nayani Melegoda, academicians, students of the university and Sri Lankan admirers of Gurudev Tagore, attended the event.
The bronze bust was sculpted by Janak Jhankar Narzary of Kala Bhavana, Visva-Bharati, and was gifted by the government of India to the university in 2012.
Separately, the Indian Cultural Centre, Colombo organised a special Bharatnatyam performance by Himanshu Srivastava, an eminent dancer from Benaras. The performance was based on Tagore’s compositions and was deeply appreciated. Numerous other events in Sri Lanka were also held on the occasion.
