Poems

Enemy Within
The enemy within is to blame for your pain-To be sure, you must keep it at bay always and again!Patience keeps you free, yet even mine has limits,Be ever vigilant shall I- as love is within!Think now as a rational trier of facts, outwardly-Not must you hide behind your fear so cowardly!With great power comes great responsibility-To strengthen the human heart- fraught with fragility!Why would you allow your own self-destructionWhen diametrically opposed was such to our love’s construction?Only ever if you allow your mind to falterWould you remove we two from our love’s altar! ?Think now of the decision you must make,As it is this that decides the road you must take!
Amarasena Ranasinghe

If
If one’s life was dull and drearyEngulfed with drudgery every day,With no peace of mind,A little wish for happiness is wanting.If the environment you live inWas literally disturbed with sounds and music every day,Then there is a longing for silence and tranquility.If the world had no flora and fauna,With scorching sunshine everydayThe sweltering heat would be unbearable, andThe strain would be felt immensely,One hopes for coolness and plenty of rain.
Yasmin Jaldin

SEARCHING
Searching through the crowds, You are not thereWatching at the clouds, I can’t find you thereWalking in the midst of the cold breezeNot even the shadow or the embraceStanding under the rain dropsI don’t feel you next to meWandering through, that little rose gardenEnlightening of every glorious momentLoads of memories reckon in my heartSearching all over without a single signPushing that pain into deep downI lie down, touching my heart so tenderlyu murmur “darling don’t look everywhere”“ I am only here in your heart “forever and ever

HARD TIMES
Hard times we all encounterAt some time in this voyage of life.Sunshine bright and warm,Rainbows beautiful and alluring,Storms reckless and glaring,Are usual while going through.Many phases, including hard timesWe have to encounter while voyaging through.It is a must to face them allFor never can we bypass a single.What cannot be cured, has to be enduredKeep this in mind when facing hard times.Cursing the Gods, lamenting or weepingIs no remedy to wipe away the troubles.Being positive, alert, and not getting disgustedWould make it better to slip through hard times.

SLEEP AND WEEP
If you sleep too muchYou will lose brisknessAnd vigour to work hardUltimate result will beLoss of earning for the dayThen your eyes shed tearsBy weeping and weepingSo the young and old!Do not embrace bewitching beauty ofExcessive sleepThat will make lovers of indolenceheedless of life toilConsequently you are the great losersOf time and moneyYou will be grief strickenCrushing joys of lifeAnd you will burst into tearsIn the flood of weepYou are condemned by vigilant heroesFor your drowsy stagnationWithout energy to take the next stepIn the progressive wayYou are then far behind the active workersWho have achieved great successIn life processSans moderate sleepAnd sans ailing weep,

Waterfront
Now, tall edificesRemain ruinedIncessant rainPelter hardCyclonic windsSweep roofs awayTorrents of mudSwirl around townThe river riseDebri float paststench of rottingcarrying decayStagnant waterFlood all citiescollapsed BuildingsBroken homesFloods destroyDeath kills life

Free to be educated
Where I come fromFree education is nothing moreThan an euphemismA sugar coating for what isRestrictionA curtain for this scholastic jailThat is free of chargeComplimentary knowledge is deadWithout liberation and a choiceWithout a voice and visibilityIt will suffocate beneath bigotryAnd hemorrhage from the scars of inequalityThis organism of free educationIs stunted in growthAnd is weak at its kneesIt cannot develop and it will not flourishFor no influx of drugs can healIts deficiency of magnetismAnd cancer of invarianceAnd no simile can describeThe real fatalitiesOccurring on hospital bedsIn hospital wardsWhere the lamentationsOf the lonely and sickCan smolder ones earsOnly because years agoChildren had been given freeEducation, But were not freeTo be educated.
