Meghan Markle’s latest outfit paid homage to Princess Diana

If the pale pink Carolina Herrera dress Meghan Markle wore Trooping the Colour ceremony felt familiar, it might be because Princess Diana wore a strikingly similar design over three decades ago.
The Duchess of Sussex’s off-the-shoulder look is reminiscent of a Catherine Walker design worn by Prince Harry’s late mother to a Berlin Opera House Gala in 1987. Both dresses feature the same pastel hue, open neckline and buttoned-up bodice.
Despite its similarity to Princess Di’s gown, Markle’s outfit was deemed “inappropriate” by some on social media, who felt that exposed shoulders had no place at Queen Elizabeth’s birthday parade.
This isn’t the first time Markle has channeled the late princess of Wales’ style: Her engagement ring from Prince Harry features diamonds once owned by Diana, and she wore her late mother-in-law’s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception in May.
