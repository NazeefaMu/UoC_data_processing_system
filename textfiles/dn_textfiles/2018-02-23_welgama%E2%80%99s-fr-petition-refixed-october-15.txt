Welgama’s FR petition refixed for October 15

The Supreme Court yesterday refixed for support for October 15, a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
The Court was informed through a State Counsel that the FCID has not concluded its investigations into the magisterial inquiry.
Kalutara District UPFA Parliamentarian KumaraWelgama had sought an order preventing the FCID from arresting and remanding him in connection with alleged financial fraud said to have taken place at the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), while several tenders were awarded to two private companies to supply bus spare parts between 2011 to 2015.
Through this petition, Welgama sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent his imminent arrest over the magisterial inquiry at Colombo Magistrate’s Court No 3.
In his petition, the former Minister had cited FCID Chief Inspector (Unit 7) C.I. Ranasinghe, ASP P.K. Serasinghe, DIG Ravi Waidyalankara, police chief N.K. Ilangakoon and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner further sought an order and declaration that collective acts of the first to fourth respondents cause an imminent infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 12(2), 13(1) of the Constitution.
