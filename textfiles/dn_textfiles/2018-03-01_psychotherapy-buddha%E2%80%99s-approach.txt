Psychotherapy of the Buddha’s approach

“Surely, if I am worthy of any affection or care, Sidhuhatt will come and see me” – Bimbadevi
K K S PERERA –
Neutralised the pride of relatives; responded to anxieties of Yasodharavo and prince Nanda-The Buddha spoke caringly to Yasodharavo, telling of her boundlessvirtues inherited from previous lives. She had indeed been repeatedly of great backing to him. Her pureness, her devotion, her gentleness, had been precious to the Bodhisattva when he aspired to triumph over enlightenment, the highest objective of mankind. And so virtuous had she been that she favoured to become the wife of a Bodhisattva.“The realities of mind are more important than realities of body” – WilliamJames- American Psychologist.
Leading men in the psychological field like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Otto Rank and Adler used hypnosis as the basis for examining the cause, but gave up developing the concept of ‘Free Association’, another skill that the Buddha practiced as well. The Buddha attached lot of importance to development of cooperation and attachment between therapist and patient; quite a few modern psychologists have professed this line of treatment.
Psycho and neuro-pathological complications are now receiving admirable attention in scientific training, exactly what the Buddha taught 26 centuries ago. Modern medicine confesses that there is an ultimate inter-dependence of mind and body at all phases of physical ailments. Buddhist teachings however, go a step further; it adds more importance to mental faculties, it says mind is the fore-runner of all sensations and occurrences.
Childhood relations
King Suddhodana, was particularly concerned about meeting his son. Nine messengers carried his request to Buddha asking him to visit Kimbulwattpura; all of them became followers and stayed back at Rajagaha Nuwara. Finally, the king turned to Kaaludai, the childhood friend of Sidhuhath. Buddha left Rajagaha in a two month-voyage delivering Dhamma to inhabitants on the way, before reaching Kapilawastupura onMedin Poya day.
Buddha had to exhibit delusionary effects to neutralize the pride of his relatives using his psychic powers, Yamamaha. The following morning the Buddha’s entourage was on alms rounds, where he had to explain his ancestry to a shocked father who objected to him. The king and other family seniors in the kingdom received the Buddha with great reverence except Yasodharavo, the mother of Rahula. She chose to stay inside her chambers. The most passionately focused event was the meeting between the Buddha and Yasodharavo that took place at the Suddodhana’s palace. The king sent a message to Yasodhara who replied in the negative. Instead, she expected the Buddha to visit her chamber.
“Surely, if I am worthy of any affection or care, Sidhuhatt will come and see me” – Bimbadevi
Unassertive character
Having learnt that she had turned down the appeal, the Buddha, accompanied by his two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana straight away walked to her compartment signifying his unassertive character and well-mannered regard for his former partner in samsara.
“Bimbadevi not having seen me for a long time, she is extremely distressed, unless you allow its natural course her heart will slash. In the event she touches me let’s not prevent her” She was relaxing in her room dressed in uncaring fabrics, and her haircut. As the Buddha cross the doorstep from the wealth of her warmth, like a brimming bowl she was unable to hold her admiration. For a moment she failed to recall that her precious man was now the noblest of the world, she seized his feet and wept frantically. However, seeing that the king was present, she rose. By allowing Bimbavo to spend-off her grievance in that harmless way—he taught the world a lesson in Psychotherapy.
‘Sabbe Satta Ummattaka’-Buddha said it is hard to find a being in perfect bodily health: but indeed far more challenging to find a completely mentally well person’- Roga Sutta [Annguttara Nikaya].
Leading men in the psychological field like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Otto Rank and Adler used hypnosis as the basis for examining the cause, but gave up developing the concept of ‘Free Association’, another skill that the Buddha practiced as well. The Buddha attached lot of importance to development of cooperation and attachment between therapist and patient; quite a few modern psychologists have professed this line of treatment.
The two-way or dialog form sermonizing used by the Buddha has a close parallel to what today’s psychiatric approach to mental patients. Buddhist psychotherapy cures mental sicknesses, enables understanding of the working of their conscious and unconscious minds. One can use it to build up his own mental wellbeing in today’s stressful society. The aspects that cause mental illnesses are recognized as kleshes or mental destructions. The fundamental vision behind this method is found in Sabbasava Sutta, Satipattana Sutta, and Vattupama Sutta-[Majjima Nik.,]
Saga of celestial nymphs
Buddha visited his step-brother Prince Nanda the next day at his palace, who was planning to get married to the most gracious woman of the time, Janapada Kalyani, the loveliest girl of the kingdom the next day. As he was leaving them, Buddha gave over his bowl to Nanda. Janapada Kalyani saw the prince walking away and requested his quick return. Kalyani was highly thrilled with the prospect of her marriage. Prince Nanda expected the Buddha to take back the bowl near the entrance to monastery; he did not do. So, Buddha had taken him to the monastery to give up house-hold life.
At the monastery he was inspired by the arguments of the Buddha and accepted the renunciation, but his willpower was weak and feeble. He was pined for his gorgeous bride with strong sensual longings, which gradually affected his health. However, Rev Nanda spoke to colleagues thus;
“I am discontented with leading the sacred life, friends, I am unable to bear the holy life”, which was communicated to the Buddha; Nanda Thera admitted the fact, saying, “The warm and loving words and her beloved’s tears enthused me deeply and continues to do so.” The Buddha, who with his heavenly eye saw that Nanda, with a little strength of mind, could grasp the Dhamma and supreme satisfaction of insight. He thought of a little psycho-analytic therapy to retain him without disturbing his present frame of mind. The Buddha asked him to accompany him to the Himalayan range; the Lord took him by the arm, left Jeta-wood and appeared among idols of Thawatimsa. Hundreds of pink-footed nymphs had come to minister to Sakkra,… the chronicle says.
Celestial Nymphs, Janapada Kalyani and the charred monkey
“What do you think, Nanda, who is more beautiful, fairer to look at, and more appealing? [Buddha made Nanda witness a scene of a charred body of a female monkey in a Chena.] Kalyanie or the gorgeous celestial nymphs? Replying Nanda said, compared to these nymphs that girl is like the charred body of the female monkey. The Buddha practicing a bit of psychology of his immature mind assured him to get him any of those nymphs as his bride to be, on condition that he will not leave the monastery. “Revered sir if you guaranty I shall be content with monastic life” he quickly replied.
Buddha was the physician and the surgeon of the psyche. He believed in treating the cause, not the symptoms [Nidhana], exactly what they practice in modern psychotherapy. According to Dhamma, all human chaos are basically mind related and stems from three harmful motivating factors, namely, attraction Lobha, repulsion Dhosa and delusion Moha. The story of the prince had been unjustly distorted in many a script. Nanda though in his excitement agreed, when he reached the monastery where other monks questioned his initiation for monk-hood, they laughed at him and called him ‘menial’ and ‘hireling’, he felt humiliated, embarrassed and he eventually saw his motive as the base—psychotherapy worked; and renouncing desire soon he gathered up his nerve. Realised the coarseness of all compounded things and endeavoured for attainment and Nanda became an Arhant. It was an instant where Buddha used his skills in psycho-therapy.
Our legendary writer, author, and intellectual Martin Wickremasinghe once said, “Psycho-analysis was not initiated by Sigmund Freud, but by Jataka story teller.”
