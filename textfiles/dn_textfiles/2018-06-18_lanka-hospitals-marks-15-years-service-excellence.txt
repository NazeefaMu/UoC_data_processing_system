Lanka Hospitals marks 15 years of service excellence

Lanka Hospitals PLC commemorated 15 years of service excellence of its Nuclear Medicine Centre recently. The founders of Nuclear Medicine Department of Lanka Hospitals arrived from India to grace the occasion.
Hospitals’ Nuclear Medicine Centre facilitates a team of experts comprising medical specialists, technicians and nursing staff led by Consultant Nuclear Medicine, Lanka Hospitals, Dr. J. M. Chandraguptha Udugama, MBBS, PhD, one of the three most senior specialists and pioneers in the discipline of nuclear medicine in Sri Lanka.
According to Dr.Udugama, nuclear medicine was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1973 under the purview of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), where the country’s first Nuclear Medicine Unit was established at the Peradeniya University’s Medical Faculty. Consequently, the second Nuclear Medicine Unit was established at the Colombo National Hospital (formerly known as General Hospital, Colombo).
Lanka Hospitals was the first private hospital in the country to establish a fully-fledged Nuclear Medicine centre, to support the rapidly rising demand. Since then the centre has continued to play a pivotal role in supporting the country’s health care sector for 15 long years.
Lanka Hospital’s Nuclear Medicine Centre is equipped with state of-the-art Dual Detector Gamma Camera (SIEMENS-E Cam), a first and only of its kind in Sri Lanka. Adopting a procedure which allows least radiation and discomfort to patients, this gamma camera (scanner) produces high precision imagery of the internal organs at cellular level.
The nuclear medicine scans solely focus on the functionality of the relevant organ. Gamma ray imagery is essential for early detection and diagnosis of illnesses, especially for acute and chronic illnesses such as kidney diseases, cancer and heart diseases and so forth.
Early detection of such illnesses not only helps to prevent aggravation of an illness, but also prevent long term suffering. Moreover, being administered for early treatment has the potential to significantly increase the rate of curability and survival of a patient. Gamma camera scanning is not only safe for the patients but also causes minimum side effects. Therefore, successful diagnosis and treatment at the Nuclear Medicine Centre has earned more referrals year after year.
World class health care facilities, high calibre medical professionals, and breakthrough medical technology has firmly placed Lanka Hospitals in the forefront of Sri Lanka’s health care sector.
