Rural children excel in studies: WDJ

A majority of schoolchildren from rural areas have excelled in examinations, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J.Seneviratne said.
Minister Seneviratne said the government should provide basic facilities for rural schools as whatever hardship parents’ undergo, they educate their children.
The minister expressed those views after distributing school books among schoolchildren in Kuruvita recently.
Seneviratne said free education is a relief for poor parents.
“The country has a high literacy rate. What is required for rural schoolchildren to pass examinations is determination and guidance,” he added.
