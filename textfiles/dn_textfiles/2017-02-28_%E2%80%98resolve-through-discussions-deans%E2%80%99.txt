‘Resolve through discussions with deans’

The issue regarding standards of the SAITM should be resolved through discussions with the deans of state medical faculties, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday after handing over appointment letters to 308 post intern doctors.
“I hope that the SAITM will take steps to overcome the weaknesses pointed out by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC),” he said.
After solving the issue, SAITM students should be allowed to obtain education freely.
There is no need to take over the SAITM or any other private institution by the Government, he said.
