Injured du Plessis unavailable for Zimbabwe series

Faf du Plessis is South Africa’s cricket captain across all formats. However, he is likely to miss the team’s upcoming limited overs’ series against Zimbabwe, owing to injury woes.
The player suffered his second shoulder injury in the space of a year while featuring in the Sri Lankan tour. Du Plessis, who had to undergo surgery on his right shoulder in as recent as December 2017, tore his rotator-cuff set of tendons in the same shoulder while attempting a fielding effort against the Lankans.
He has evidently been rested, keeping in mind the impending busy summer, after which the team will also be a part of the ICC World Cup scheduled for May and June 2019. “It’s important to get the shoulder as strong as possible,” du Plessis said on his arrival back to Cape Town on Friday.
“Playing against Zimbabwe would be nice but an extra few weeks (of recovery) would be good. I was under pressure before the India series but I managed to get through it. No disrespect to Zimbabwe but there’s a lot of cricket still to be played. The long-term goal is the most important thing,” he added. He obviously meant the likes of the World Cup, and his career itself, which can’t be put at stake by playing with an injury.
