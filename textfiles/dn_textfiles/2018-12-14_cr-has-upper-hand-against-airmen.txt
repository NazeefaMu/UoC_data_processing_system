CR has upper hand against Airmen

CR & FC will have the upper hand against Air Force sports club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League first round rugby match at Longden Place today. Kick of will be at 4.00 pm.
CR forwards along with their speedy three quarters gave a pathetic performance against Havelock sports club last week where they went down 22-31 to Havies, hence the red shirts will have to come up with a much improved performance if they hope to overcome the Air Men at their own den, Longden Place.
Meanwhile the lads from Ratmalana lost to Police Sports Club 19-28 after a superb performance where their forwards had an out standing game scoring the solitary try in their first round game played at Police Park in Colombo last week and if they play to their full potential then another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today. And it won’t be a surprise if Air Force sports club pull off a shock win against the red shirts today.
