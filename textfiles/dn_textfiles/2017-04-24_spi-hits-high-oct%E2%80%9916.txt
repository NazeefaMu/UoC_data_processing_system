Point of View
Blue-chip led gains drove markets yet again this week, helping the Broad-share Index shed early losses from some profit taking on Monday.
The benchmark ASPI ended 133 points stronger W-o-W with Index heavy weights such as JKH, LOLC NEST, COMB, DIAL & SLT contributing 72.98 points amid strong HNI and Institutional (particularly foreign) activity.
Crossings accounted for 61% of market turnover for the week helping push market turnover to a YTD high of LKR 5.17Bn on Tuesday. Crossings in COMB accounted for 64% of the week's total crossings and 39% of the market's total turnover for the week while JKH accounted for 21% of the week's total crossings. Retailers too returned to markets this week, taking cues from the consistent foreign buying in domestic equities in 2017.
The market rally since late-March has led to the ASPI gaining a cumulative 539 points (or 9%) over the last four weeks.
The rally over this period has helped wipe off earlier losses on the Index, and the ASPI has gained 4.9% YTD, relative to the loss of 4.0% between Dec 31 2016 and Mar 24 '17 when the rally began. Markets are likely to retain the current positive momentum, although some profit taking is also likely in the week ahead.
IMF Raises Global Growth Outlook for 17-18E
In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF raised its global growth projections for 2017 (to 3.5% from 3.4% in Oct'16) and 2018 (3.6%), citing consistently good economic news since H2'16 (buoyant financial markets and a cyclical recovery in manufacturing and trade) for the improved outlook1.
The IMF noted that growth is expected to be broad based, with activity projected to pick up markedly in EM and developing economies as macroeconomic strains experienced by commodity exporters ease amid the partial recovery in commodity prices and as growth remains strong in China and many other commodity importers1. The reported noted however, that a stronger recovery is held back by structural impediments and that the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside, particularly over the medium term.
The IMF noted further that persistent structural issues such as low productivity growth and high income inequality have increased pressures for inward-looking policies in Advanced Economies, threatening the global economic integration that has served the world economy (particularly EM & and developing economies) well1.
