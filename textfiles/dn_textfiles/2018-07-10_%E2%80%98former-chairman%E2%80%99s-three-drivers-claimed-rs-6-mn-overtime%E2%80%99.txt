Presidential Commission on SriLankan corruption, frauds
‘Former Chairman’s three drivers claimed Rs. 6 mn as overtime’

Three drivers of former SriLankan Airline Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe had been paid Rs. 6 million as overtime.
It was revealed at the Presidential Commission investigating into SriLankan Airline, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka when SriLankan Airline Secretary Dalrene Thirikumar was giving evidence before the Presidential Commission yesterday.
She said the three drivers had received Rs. 6 million as overtime when Nishantha Wickremesingha was the SriLankan Chairman.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unambuwa PC, after taking her submission into consideration, told her to produce a complete report as to whether these drivers had claimed overtime when Nishantha Wickremasinghe was out of the country.
