Small farmers can help revive rural economy: PM

Helping small farmers will revive our rural economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister was speaking as chief guest at the inaugural ceremony for Lanka Livestock 2017.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that without modernising the small farmer and helping him grow, the economy would remain stagnant.
He made a special plea to those in the private sector, explaining that it would play a major role in this economic revitalisation programme.
After his speech, and a larger introductory ceremony that included a traditional Sri Lankan dance performance and certificates of appreciation given to the exhibition’s sponsors, the Prime Minister toured the grounds of the SLECC (Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre), meeting various representatives from the 150-plus international participating companies and brands from 17 countries, including Germany, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, USA, UK, Denmark, Italy, China, India, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Turkey, and, of course, Sri Lanka.
The theme of the exhibition, “Transformation and Modernisation of Sri Lanka’s Livestock Industry,” was prevalent throughout the corridors of the SLECC. Technological advances, as well as various types of feed and equipment for dairy processing, livestock breeding, and waste management, were on display. Representatives from the respective companies were eager to explain how their respective products would benefit the Sri Lankan agricultural field and rural economy here more generally.
Lanka Livestock 2017 is Sri Lanka’s first ever international culture, feed, and livestock production exhibition. Taking place at the SLECC from July 20th to July 22nd, the exhibition aims to “provide a platform that will provide suppliers of agriculture, feed and livestock production equipment and supplies to meet farmers, plantation owners, feed producers, veterinarians, processors and integrators.”
Over 3,000 relevant people including farmers, breeders, feed manufacturers, veterinarians, university academics, students, and dairy and meat processors are expected to attend.
