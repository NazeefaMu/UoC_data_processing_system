Basil's Malwana land 'valuation report' referred to Justice Ministry

The valuation report of the 16-acre land in Mapitigama, Malwana said to have belonged to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, on which a court order had been given for sale by public auction, was referred to the Justice Ministry to obtain funds necessary for future action by Pugoda Magisrate and Additional District Judge Nilupuli Lankapura. The case was heard in the Pugoda Magistrate's court yesterday.
The case was filed by the FCID under the Money Laundering Act following a complaint that former minister Basil Rajapaksa had bought a 16-acre land at Mapitigama for Rs. 64 million and built a luxury house on it at a cost of Rs. 125 million.
Basil Rajapaksa and Thiru Kumar Nadesan, former deputy Minister Nirupama Rajapaksa's husband, were cited as the first and second respondents respectively in the case.
The FCID making its submission in court asked for court sanction to sell the coconut harvest of the land and deposit the proceeds in court in connection with the case. The FCID also requested a copy of the valuation report received by court.
The magistrate said the court decision regarding the coconut harvest would be delivered in due course and said the FCID would be allowed to obtain a copy of the valuation report after making the relevant payment.
Senior lawyer Nalin Ladduwahetty PC, who appeared for Nadesan, requested court permission for his client to travel abroad for business purposes.
The magistrate said the second respondent would be granted permission to go abroad for six weeks from January 25.
Rajapaksa was not present in court yesterday. The second respondent was present in court.
Further inquiry was postponed for April 25.
