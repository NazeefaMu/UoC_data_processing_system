AIA Vitality support Little Hearts Foundation

AIA Vitality app users had chosen the ‘Charity’ option as their AIA Vitality reward and donated a sum of rupees 200,000 in the month of November.
Each user made a donation of rupees 500 towards the Critical Care Unit for children at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
The Little Hearts foundation wishes to extend its heartfelt appreciation to all AIA Vitality users for their contribution. AIA Vitality will maintain the donation option on its app for users who wish to partake in a journey towards minimizing non-communicable diseases in Sri Lanka.
AIA Vitality is a science-backed wellness programme that offers its users an opportunity to get fit and healthy while earning rewards along the way. Over 25,000 Sri Lankans take part in the weekly challenge and enjoy weekly rewards.
AIA Vitality provides participants with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve their health.
You can download it for free from the Google play-store or the Apple app-store.
