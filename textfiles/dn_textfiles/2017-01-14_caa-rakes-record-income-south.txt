CAA rakes in record income in South

Officials attached to the Southern Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) have collected a record income of over Rs. 679,000 from errant traders as court fines in sudden raids and mobile inspections in the Southern Province in December.
About 264 raids were conducted during the period. Errant traders were prosecuted in Magistrates’ courts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts. Charges framed against them were sale and display of food items unsuitable for human consumption, altering set prices on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sales of rice and cement above set prices and non-display of price tags.
