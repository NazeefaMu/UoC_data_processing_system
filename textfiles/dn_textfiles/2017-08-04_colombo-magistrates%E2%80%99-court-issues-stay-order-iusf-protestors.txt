Colombo Magistrates’ Court issues stay order on IUSF protestors

 
The Colombo Magistrates’ Court this morning issued a stay order barring Inter-University Students’ Federation protestors from obstructing traffic, people’s movement or entering into government offices.
The move comes as IUSF protestors enter Colombo to culminate a five-day protest march against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) that began at the Peradeniya University premises on Monday (July 31).
