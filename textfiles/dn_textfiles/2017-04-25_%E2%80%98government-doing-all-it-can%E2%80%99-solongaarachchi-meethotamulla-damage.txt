‘Government doing all it can’: Solongaarachchi on Meethotamulla damage

 
Former Kottikawatte-Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Prasanna Solongaarachchi said the government is doing all it can to mitigate the damage caused by the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
“Although this problem began during the time of previous governments, the tragedy happened in the time of our government, therefore as a government, we are taking the responsibility for this incident and doing all we can to mitigate the damage,” he said.
“The victims and who passed away are all helpless and had nothing to do with this problem,” he further lamented.
“As a responsible government all we can do is pay compensation for the victims and take steps to prevent such incidents occurring in the future.
Commenting on claims that he silent in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla disaster, despite championing their cause in the previous years, the former Kottikawatte-Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman said he had not been silent, but had been active on the ground.
