Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse: Housing for 60 families in Salamulla

Sixty families who lost their houses due to the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse will be provided houses in Salamulla soon. Thirty eight more houses will be provided to the displaced by June, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said.
Addressing the media at the Disaster Management Ministry Auditorium yesterday, he said discussions were held with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding the compensation procedure.
The minister said an allowance of Rs. 250,000 will be provided to 98 families to purchase interior items for their houses.
“The government has not decided compensation for the damaged properties. Compensation will be provided for the aggrieved parties after the assessment process,” Minister Yapa said.
