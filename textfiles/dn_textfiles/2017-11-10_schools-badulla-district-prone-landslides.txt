Schools in Badulla district prone to landslides

The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) which conducted a Survey in the Badulla district has identified 23 schools which are prone to landslides in its report published recently. The report has also recommended that five of them should be completely shifted and established in safer locations as they are in imminent danger.
The report said that other schools need not be shifted elsewhere if the technical advice and recommendations made by it are implemented to ensure safety.
The schools which have been ordered to be moved out are Diyanagala Tamil Vidyalaya in Min Badulla DS division, Memale Tamil Vidyalaya in Hali Ela DS division, Wewegame Vidyalaya in Uva Paranagama DS division and Rahupola Muslim Vidyalaya and Meeriyabedda Tamil Vidyalaya in Haldummulle.
