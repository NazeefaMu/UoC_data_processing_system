Norbie’s batting was a class above the rest

Some call him Norbie, some others NA and his Air Force colleagues Ever Green. Former St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, Catamarans Sports Club, Adastrians and Air Force and Hotel Intercontinental all-round cricketer Norbert Fernando spoke about his cricket career as he completed 60 years after representing his alma mater in the fourth Battle of the Golds against arch rivals Prince of Wales’ College in 1957. The former Sebastian captain, Best Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer in 1964 and Bank of Ceylon cricketer Sumithra Fernando has written about Norbert in this year’s Big Match souvenir.
“A very talented cricketer that I have seen in my days of cricket was Norbert Fernando and he has created some batting feats of great skills that one feels convinced that his batting was of a class way above those we know in today’s cricket. He produced really exceptional stuff. He had an amazing cleverness, a foxiness, to say to know the ruse the bowler was going to follow next, and so device a maneuver to inflict the harshest damage to the bowler. I saw in a big match how this lion hearted cricketer though injured, came into bat with a runner and produced a very cultured and refined batting piece that chartered a huge Sebastianite total. He was absorbed in to the Air Force soon after leaving school and there too he became a star, and his flowery batting bedecked the cricket there too with all sorts of beautiful performances. He played cricket and very exceptional cricket at that until he retired from service.”
