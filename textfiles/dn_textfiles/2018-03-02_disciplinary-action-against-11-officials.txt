Principal’s death during leadership training programme
Disciplinary action against 11 officials

The Education Ministry yesterday announced disciplinary action against 11 officials, including two additional secretaries over the death of a school principal during a leadership training programme.
Rohini Kumari Attapattu, who was the Principal of Suchi National School in Hambantota, died due to an accident while attempting to climb a rope ladder as part of a training programme for Principals at the Wayamba Teacher Training Centre, in Wariyapola last month.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam ordered a ministerial level inquiry into the incident and its report was handed over to the Minister on Wednesday.
The minister instructed his Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi to implement all the recommendations in the report. Issuing a press release, the Education Ministry stated that disciplinary action will be taken against the Additional Secretary (School Affairs), who organised the training programme, and that the Director and Deputy Director of Human Resources Development Unit will also be removed from their positions.
Disciplinary action has also been proposed against the Additional Secretary in charge of Procurement Division, Chief Accountant of Procurement Division, Technical Evaluation Committee members and Procurement Committee members. The report has recommended blacklisting the Sri Lanka Outdoor Adventure School which failed to take adequate safety measures for the officers.
Moreover, compensation will be paid to the husband and children of the victim and her pension and other insurance payments have been expedited.
