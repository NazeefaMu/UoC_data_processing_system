Treasured words

I sincerely feel happy that I had the rare chance of reading the novel titled as ‘The Prospector’ translated from the work by J M G Le Clezio, from French into English Carol Marks. Le Clezio is cites as the winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature. On reading the page moving novel, I found it as a remarkable contribution.
The protagonist known as Alexis is shown a attempting to find a treasure, which he knows via legend, history and myth.
But does he succeed?
Le Clezio offers a series of episodes where the protagonist is shown as passing time with his mother, father and the loving sister who keeps him. There is also the depiction of their constant struggle to exist amidst several natural calamities such as the flood, landslides and severe winds. But from moment to moment, the protagonist becomes optimistic when he realises the nature of the calamity he and the others have to face.
It is the understanding of a sublime beauty. The life led by the protagonist intermixed with others around him are sensitively captured. The human interiors, disputes, the will to live and love are all underlined as creativity that has to be faced by the humans. The hallmark of the work I presume is the use of the poetic language which by and large evokes a sense of spiritualism. Wherever the protagonist wanders, he discovers the essence of the myth of human creations left behind as a legacy.
The work is segmented into seven major periods. The place names may look fictitious or real. They are Boucan, 1892, the starting point a land where the protagonist and his family attempts to live as cultivations. But they are driven out by natural disasters which they fail to overcome. Then comes the second segment of moving to a better place called ‘Forest side’. The encounter of a seafarer makes them leave to a place it named Rodrigues in 1910. This also indicates the passage of time.
The fifth segment in the work titled as ‘Ypres, winter 1915 – the Somme, Autumn, 1916’, is full of such poetic and mythical episodes which pave the way for the reader to enter into an enchanting world full of bliss, which has been already cited as the exploration of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation. The moment of illumination in the whole work is the ultimate achievement in the struggle of settling down which is marked in the last segment which goes as Monanava, 1922.
In this a grave recollection in the mind of a silent man is recreated depicting the inner self as a discovery of man’s need to live in peace. Chronologically time passes, and the need to fight against time is futile. Le Clezio in a prophetic creative vision sees a given time passed with an added spiritual value. The period is denoted from 1892 to 1922. The conclusion is recorded as follows.
“Now the night has fallen. To the depths of my being I hear the living sound of the rising sea.”
Le Clezio’s novel is regarded as the crowning achievement from France’s pre-eminent contemporary novelists. The work is reminisced of the creative works of Andre Gide and Marcl Proust. But Le Clezio has his own stamp in The Prospector. He underlines two major themes of the creative artist.
Firstly a sensitive creative writer cannot escape from the grips of his nostalgia of the past lived and well remembered as memoirs. Secondly, the creative writer cannot escape from the realities of the existence such as the need to live in peace and harmony, the episode that bring the disasters, agony as well as ecstasies. As Le Clezio creates he makes his protagonist Alexis find a treasure left behind by a legendary character.
But it is prefaced by the reader and a search for the treasure of the need to live. The man by nature is obsessed with finding some treasure need for him to live. It may be wealth or knowledge. Like his protagonist Alexis, Le Clezio too has travelled widely.
The translator, Carol Marks, deserves to be commended by the reader for the sensitive linguistic approach, which is found rarely in the translation process. The passages in English read more like an original and one good example come from the concluding chapter where the nostalgia rises into a climax. A few sentences I recall go as follows.
“I think about Nam. I think she must be still sleeping somewhere, alone, in her big frase bed under a cloud of mosquito netting. I wish I could whisper to her about things that have no end, about memories, fragile and transparent like a mirage of our house and its blue rood, the garden of all of birds where night is falling, the ravine, and the tree of good and evil that stands as the entrance to Monanava.”
