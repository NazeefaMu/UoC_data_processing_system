Foreign exchange reaches Rs. 92.117 bn during past 21 months

After the European Union (EU) lifted the ban imposed on fish imports from Sri Lanka, the country had earned foreign exchange valued at Rs. 92.117 billion during the past 21 months. It was achieved through the exportation of 58.578 kilotonnes of fish.
The ban, which was imposed in 2015 due to local produce failing to meet the standards of the EU, was lifted in 2016 following discussions conducted between the union and President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In 2014, fish exports reached 26.320 kilotonnes and while the ban was effective, that is, the 18-month period from January 2015 to June 2016, 26.129 kilotonnes of fish were exported, earning foreign exchange valued at Rs. 2.103 billion.
According to information received from the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry, following the ban, a large number of fish-processing industries were closed down.
