The stage 2 is a promenade featuring 15 international restaurants, bars & cafes, a spa, 2500sqm convention centre, tennis court, multi-faith chapel and gymnasium.
The Beachfront is the only 5-star luxury development of its kind in Sri Lanka and it has four secluded beaches set on 500 meters of pristine beachfront. Owners get an additional benefit of 21 nights free stay per year so they can enjoy their investment while it is increasing in value.
This is very attractive for foreigners who can travel to Sri Lanka for a holiday with their families and find endless things to do around the safe and comfortable environment in Southern Sri Lanka.
The property is managed by Dusit Thani International which is a 5-star luxury hotel chain with an international portfolio of a range of distinctive destination hotels and apartments around the world, including 25 in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.
