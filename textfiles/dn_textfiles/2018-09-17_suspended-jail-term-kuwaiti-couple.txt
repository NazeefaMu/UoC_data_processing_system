Suspended jail term for Kuwaiti couple

A Kuwaiti man and woman convicted of assaulting Sri Lanka Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport earlier this year, were handed a six-month jail sentence suspended for five years, the Arab News quoted an official as saying.
A magistrate on Friday sentenced the 32-year-old woman and her 29-year-old male partner, who were also fined Rs. 138,000.
They were arrested for trying to smuggle a Burmese Mastiff into the country in July without following quarantine procedures. The woman was caught on CCTV cameras assaulting Customs officers who tried to stop them.
Bringing pets into the island without quarantine clearance can lead to the forfeiture of the animal as well as a fine of up to Rs. 100,000.
Customs spokesman Vipula Minuwanpitiya said the pet dog was confiscated and later given back to the couple to be taken out of the country.
