CHSGA rolls out five year plan  to ensure world class industry

Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association (CHSGA) in consultation with 3W Consulting rolled out a five year strategic plan to lead Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality industry whilst establishing its purpose in the business.
Contributing towards these aspirations, CHSGA would pave the way enabling the Sri Lankan Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) to produce world class graduates of high standards, continuous professional development for its elite membership, networking with the local and international HORECA (hotel/restaurant/cafe) sector and providing advocacy for good governance in the hospitality sector in order to be the voice of hospitality professionals in Sri Lanka.
The outlined five year strategic plan encompasses all levels of associated sectors possible and practical. Effective coordination of plans between state and private institutions to stay ahead of the competition is one of the key aspects of the new plan. It also involves the insights of the smartest minds in hotel revenue management working in tangent with related stakeholders to discuss ways hotels can optimize their pricing and service delivery in the face of an increasingly dynamic marketplace and industry challenges.

“In an era of rapid change with new players and intermediaries, it’s critical that all hotel stakeholders, sales and marketing leaders, owners and investors have the right strategies in place to tackle challenges on the ground,” said CHSGA President Sanjeeva Perera.
He added, “It is the ideal time for the generation of new ideas and approaches to shape the future of hospitality. We are excited to propose our planned out programme to bring even more innovation forward and develop new brands.”
