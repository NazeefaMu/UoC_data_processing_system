Deneeswaran removed from Cabinet

Northern Provincial Council Minister Deneeswaran was removed from the Cabinet by Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, who has informed the Governor.
He had further informed that some of the responsibilities of the Ministry had been given to Ananthy Sasitharan and the balance will be taken over by him.
However, Deneeswaran had earlier written to the Governor that he is continuing as the Minister.
Confused by the current position, the Governor has sought advice from the Attorney General’s Department.
In a context where Ministers Kurukularajah and Ainkaranesan had resigned from the Cabinet, Deneeswaran was hindering the reorganization of the Cabinet. His party TELO had taken a decision to suspend him for six months. Following this, the Chief Minister had informed the Governor that some of the responsibilities will be handed over to Mrs Ananthy Sasitharan and he is taking over the balance.
In a context where the minister had not resigned on his own will and as he was not expelled by a no-confidence motion, a legal problem had cropped up.
This had paved the way for the Governor to seek expert opinion from the Attorney General’s Department.
Meanwhile, the resignation letter of P. Sathiyalingam which was given to the Chief Minister had not been given to the Governor and this had caused delay in Minister designate Kunaseelan taking over the Ministry, it is learnt.
