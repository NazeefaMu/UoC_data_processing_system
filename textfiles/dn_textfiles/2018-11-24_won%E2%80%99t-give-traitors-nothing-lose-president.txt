Won’t give in to traitors, nothing to lose - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said he will not give in to traitors and those committing injustices, fraud and corruption and will not stop his march halfway.
Addressing the gathering at a ceremony to mark the National Gem and Jewellery Authority’s 25th anniversary at the Shangri-La hotel, the President said he has nothing to lose other than the Presidency and his life.
He said he had swum upstream against the tide in his political life and will be so in the future as well.
