Ranjan Ramanayake Contempt of Court Action: Written submissions filed today

 
The Supreme Court allowed Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake to file written submissions today, explaining as to why court should not issue summons regarding two contempt of Court actions filed against him for allegedly casting insulting remarks on the reputation of the judiciary and lawyers at a press conference.
President’s Counsel M.A. Sumanthiran appearing for Deputy Minister Ramanayake informed Court that his client had made a general statement and maintained that Court should not proceed with these applications.
“This is not a matter the court should entertain. The summons should not be issued on my client’, Sumanthiran added.  
Meanwhile, Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana appearing for the Attorney General told Court that the statement made by the respondent is tantamount to contempt of court.
