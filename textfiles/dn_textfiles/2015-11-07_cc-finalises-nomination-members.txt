The Constitutional Council (CC) which met in Parliament yesterday, finalised the nomination of members for five independent commissions. Parliamentary sources said the nominated members' list was to be forwarded to the President for approval.
The CC has nominated members for the Finance Commission, Audit Commission, Delimitation Commission, Elections Commission and National Procurement Commission. It has also nominated a member to the seat vacated by Lionel Fernando at the Human Rights Commission. This was also to be forwarded to the President.
All CC members participated in yesterday's sittings.
