Physician, heal thyself

The strikes, in general, are considered as a legitimate form of collective protest in a democratic country. They are an important weapon that workers possess and use to increase their bargaining power as well as facilitating the process of negotiation towards an agreeable result.
The latest wave of strikes was by medical doctors. It has now become a common regular phenomenon. Citizens become aware of a doctors’ strike only in the morning when they read or listen to the news. Patients become aware when they visit the hospitals. Since of late GMOA leaders give only short notice.
Health is a very important human value and hence health care is a paramount social obligation. In this context, on one hand, doctors have more responsibility on the health of each and every citizen of the country. On the other hand, doctors also may have their own grievances. These may be monetary factors or non-monetary aspects such as healthcare policy issues, better working conditions etc.
Doctors argue that they are compelled to take tough action to make their needs or demands met and that they go for strike decision as an ultimate choice of action. This argument does not hold water since we have seen how strikes by doctors are occurring with increasing frequency during the last few months for the slightest excuse. We have also witnessed how most of these strikes have been harmful to patients as these actions reduced patient’s access to care by eliminating or delaying necessary care, and may, at times interfere with the continuity of such care.
The recent doctors’ strikes, regardless of the reasons for them, received a lot of media attention and met a great deal of criticism and resistance from the general public. In fact, it aroused intense debate on the ethical justification of medical professionals failing to prioritise human life and their needs, without finding less harmful ways of negotiating their demands.
In such a complex situation, various ethical dilemmas have arisen whether doctors’ strikes can be ethically legitimate, especially in the Sri Lankan scenario? Do they have the right to strikes or work slowdowns, even if they have a genuine reason, which may put the lives of defenceless patients at serious danger?
Demand
In this brief article, I do not wish to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of SAITM or private medical education. That debate is being extensively done and continuing in the media. My only intention is to present my view regarding whether the current strikes by GMOA are ethically acceptable or not.
I do not have any affiliation or fraternity either with SAITM or with GMOA. When we go through the information available in the public domain, SAITM appears to have quite a number of serious shortcomings and deficits which need to be rectified. In the case of GMOA, for a long time I have regarded it as a professional organisation, but now I have my own reservations. The association’s view on the higher medical educations seems to be vague and confused.
The main demand of the latest strike by GMOA is for the government to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). It is nothing about their salaries, allowances or working conditions. The doctors maintain that the private Medical College does not meet the country's educational standards. They also say the existence of the private medical college could jeopardise the country's decades-long tradition of offering health care and education for free.
However, the trigger for the GMOA unrest was the Court of Appeal decision compelling the SLMC to register SAITM graduates. The Court has arrived at its judgement based strictly on the legalities of the issue and observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister.
The court ruled that recognition (or de-recognition) of SAITM was the prerogative of the Minister of Higher Education. Similarly, while the Medical Council can make recommendations regarding the registration of a medical degree, the authority for that decision finally rests with the Minister for Health.
This is the current legal stand on SAITM issue and both the GMOA and SAITM need to abide by it. If the association does not agree with the decision, they are within their rights to appeal to Supreme Court. News reports indicate they have already done so. Now it’s a matter of waiting for the judgement.
Ethical factors
With all these points in mind, we can now access the ethical aspects of the doctors’ strikes. Let me present my views in point form:
(1) Why did GMOA initiate strike action when there were alternatives to proceed were available. This contradicts their argument of “last resort.”
(2) The timing of the strike. Why did GMOA wait for eight years to press action to scrap SAITM? This medical college was established in 2008 under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
(3) Hippocrates oath. When you consider this oath and the importance of the term ‘profession’ in the medical field, two arguments can be put forward. In one sense, ‘profession’ emphasis a promise (profession), a vow to dedicate oneself to the benefit or well-being of the patient which stress on the overall fulfilment of some broad societal need. In another sense ‘profession’ is a job, which has many rights and duties. What does a Sri Lanka doctor belong to? First or second category!
(4) Dedication and compassion. These two qualities have always been promoted as important virtues in Sri Lankan medical field. We developed our own Ayurvedic system based on a series of prescriptions handed down from generation to generation over a period of 3,000 years. The ancient kings, who were also prominent physicians, sustained its survival and longevity. Historically the Ayurvedic physicians enjoyed a noble position in the country's social hierarchy due to their royal patronage. From this legacy stems a well-known Sri Lankan saying: “If you cannot be a king, become a healer.” Thus, the practice of doctors’ strikes is not compatible with the Sri Lankan cultural and traditional health care ethics.
(5) Patients’ Rights. GMOA is a registered trade union. The membership believes that they have every right to take trade union action if a situation called for it. Technically, it is correct. However, doctors’ right to strike should never conflict and override with the patients’ right to access health care since they are more dependent and vulnerable. Moreover, use of one’s right (doctors) to strike will violate the fundamental rights of the other (patients) to the extent that it even denies them right to live, apart from their rights to proper health care.
In such a situation, the Sri Lankan Government can legally activate laws like the Public Security Ordinance. Just the other day President Sirisena used the Public Security Ordinance to declare certain services connected with the Meethotamulla tragedy essential and threatened violators with punitive action.
(6) Abuse of Freedom to Strike. Doctors are currently legally allowed to strike. But other individuals who work in key public services are not allowed to strike. For example, members of the armed forces cannot strike. Police officers cannot strike. Prison officers cannot strike. Many countries, both in Europe and elsewhere, limit or prevent some public employees from striking. Is there a reason for banning strikes by police or soldiers, but for permitting strikes by doctors?
The ethical justification for restricting or removing the right to strike for police or armed forces or prison officers is on the basis of the threat to public order or wellbeing or national security in the event of a strike. The potential harm to the wider community is thought to outweigh the harm to individual freedom in restricting the right to strike.
Freedom of Assembly
The European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the right to freedom of assembly and association (including trade union membership), however, it potentially leaves open the possibility of restrictions on these rights “in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”
If the reason to prohibit police strikes is the potential harm to the wider community, that might also apply to doctor strikes. We might expect that such strikes could lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment of serious illness, and might even lead to higher death rates for patients.
As a parting note, let me remind our doctors that from childhood we were taught that doctors make great sacrifices to save lives. This belief gave the doctor’s profession a great deal of respect in the society. Yet, it appears this respect is eroding and eroding rather rapidly. The cancer of politics that has eroded most of the trade unions of public institutions in the society has touched the upper echelons of GMOA too. It’s time all medical doctors stop in their tracks and take a hard look at their ideals and ethics which are presently limited only to their family and close friends.
