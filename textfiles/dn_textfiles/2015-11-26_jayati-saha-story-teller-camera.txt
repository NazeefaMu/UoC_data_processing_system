Jayati Saha: The story-teller with a camera

The colour spattered streets, clothes and faces of India were transported to Colombo this month, through the story-telling talent of Kolkata-based photographer Jayati Saha. Her exhibition, 'Celebrating Life With Colours,' was held from November 15 to 25 at the JDA Perera Gallery, the Harold Peiris Gallery, the Lionel Wendt Art Centre and the University of Kelaniya.

It was organized by the Indian Cultural Centre, in collaboration with the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka, the Open University of Performing Arts and the University of Kelaniya.
Everywhere, people saw true stories from far off places unfold against the walls of galleries - photographs that captured colourful personalities, be it that of a dancer, a widow or a bevy of men celebrating life on the streets.
Although there seemed to be an overall sense of celebration and joy in Saha's exhibits, as most of the photographs featured people covered in the bright reds and yellows of Holi powder, perhaps the most powerful story told was a solemn one of Indian widows.
Manu Ghosh is one such widow photographed by Saha. Her photograph is accompanied by a powerful narrative: "We asked Manu Ghosh what it feels like to be a widow in the ancient holy city of Benares. The look on her face told us... nothing. Because the scriptures solemnly forbid a widow from feeling anything."
The captured images of widows celebrating the Hindu festival of Holi are revolutionary. Saha tells a story seldom told; widows in India are typically in white clothing and shaved heads, having renounced the joys of the world as a tribute to the passing of their husbands. However, in Saha's photographs, they are dancing, covered in colour, bursting with life in a state of absolute surrender and celebration. It is strangely reminiscent of what Deepa Mehta did in the 1990s with her movie 'Water'.
One of my favourites from the exhibition was that of a widow whose white clothes have been doused in bright pink Holi powder, her hand lifted in a gesture of dance, and her lined face a canvas of wondrous emotion - some pain, some joy, and a lot of perseverance.
It was with a pang that we came to the end of our viewing. Every photograph had been a little trailer to some magnificent real-life reel of events that the observer wished they were witness to. Her photographs are evocative and interesting, for being both visually mesmerizing and socially conscious.
Although her street-photography documents well the vibrant bustle of close-knit Indian communities, her strength seems to be portrait photography, in capturing those nanosecond-moments that flicker over the face, or those intense waves of pain and joy that all humans can relate to.
They seem to inspire curiosity in the viewer, a desire to know more about the person, the place and their story - and that is power. You can find and follow more of Jayati Saha's work on Flickr and Facebook.
