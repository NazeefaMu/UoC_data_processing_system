Recommence medical faculty academic  activities now - Minister

The Government should take immediate measures to recommence academic activities of the eight medical faculties, Science Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayanth said.
He was giving ideas and proposals before the Public Commission on SAITM Conflict and Finding Solutions convened for the second time yesterday at the OPA in Colombo.
“Students have been boycotting lectures for over nine months now. If I am the Minister, relevant to this field, I will never hesitate to abolish SAITM as an immediate solution to the crisis in medical education,” the Minister said.
He further said that the crisis in medical education has affected the entire education system of the country as well as the health sector. The government and policy makers should pay their attention to strengthen state universities.
The Minister charged that the SAITM Management had misled the cabinet of ministers of the then government which granted permission to begin SAITM.
The approval had been taken to set up a higher education institution called the South Asian Institute of Technology and Management and later they have substituted Medicine for Management.
Frontline Socialist Party convener Pubudu Jagoda stressed the importance of taking immediate measures to stop recruiting new students to SAITM and ensure justice for the students currently studying at SAITM.
The Public Commission on SAITM Conflict and Finding Solution comprises Prof. Krishantha Abeysena of the University of Kelaniya, Dr S.M.S.Samarakoon of the Colombo University, engineer Ananda Ranasinghe, engineer Upali Rathnayake and gynaecologist, Oncological Surgeon Dr. Sarada Kannangara.
