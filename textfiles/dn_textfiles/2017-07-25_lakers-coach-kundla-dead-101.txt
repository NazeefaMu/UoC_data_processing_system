Lakers coach Kundla dead at 101

Los Angeles: John Kundla, a Hall of Fame coach who led the Minneapolis Lakers to five NBA titles before the team moved to Los Angeles, died Sunday. He was 101.
Kundla, the original coach of the Lakers NBA franchise, had been in a Minneapolis assisted living facility in recent years.
“On behalf of the entire Lakers organization, I’d like to express our sadness at the passing of John Kundla,” Lakers president and co-owner Jeanie Buss said in a statement.
“John played an important role in the history of the Lakers organization. Not only was he a Hall of Fame coach, he was our first head coach and led the organization to five NBA championships.
“In addition to his numerous contributions to the Lakers and our legacy, John was a wonderful man and will be remembered fondly.” Kundla was only 31 years old when he guided the Lakers in 1948 as they signed center George Mikan, the star who powered the club to five NBA crowns from 1949-1954. AFP
