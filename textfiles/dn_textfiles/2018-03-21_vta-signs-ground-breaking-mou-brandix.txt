VTA signs ground-breaking MoU with Brandix

The Brandix Group and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) recently signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) denoting a collaboration to break new ground in skills development for Sri Lanka’s Apparel Sector.
The first of these agreements facilitates the creation of an NVQ Level 5 equivalent qualification for Garment Technicians – the first of that level in the Apparel industry – with Brandix assisting the VTA to develop the curriculum and providing training at the Brandix Academy. The Brandix Academy is a new initiative to unleash the technical and leadership potential of individuals through an unconventional and rigorous learning and development process to improve business outcomes with individual growth. This will be further cemented with technical support and guidance from the VTA. Additionally, holders of the nationally-accepted NVQ Level 5 qualifications may apply for a degree at theUNIVOTEC (University of Vocational Technology).
The second Memorandum of Understanding enables Brandix to identify and employ school leavers who have receiveda three-month training as Industrial Sewing Machine Operators at the VTA’s island-wide network of vocational training centres. Selected trainees will undergo a further three months of training at Brandix business units, after which they will be offered a certificate equivalent to NVQ Level 3 upon completion.
“Elevating the standards of training and technical competency development is essential for our Apparel industry to progress and advance up the value chain,” said Mr Ishan Dantanarayana, Chief People Officer of the Brandix Group and one of the signatories to the two agreements. “As the country’s top-ranked exporter and largest employer, we are delighted to partner with the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka to steer this process that would provide much value to the Sri Lankan youth and our country as a whole.”
Eng. Dr Lionel Pinto, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, who signed the agreements on behalf of the authority said: “This is a unique endeavour that fosters the public private partnership thrust between VTA and Brandix which is one of the most renowned and leading companies in the Apparel sector in the country.This joint venture promotes new openings to the youth to embark on their careers in the Apparel industry by way of skills training and guaranteed employment together. I am also glad to highlight that this initiative has been facilitated by the Policy Development Office of the Hon Prime Minister.”
According to the VTA, NVQ Level 5 status, which is equivalent to a Diploma, has not been defined and made available for any of the job roles in the Apparel industry in Sri Lanka.
Once the curriculum development is completed at the national level, the VTA will provide necessary technical support and guidance to deliver the training programmes via the Brandix Academy.
