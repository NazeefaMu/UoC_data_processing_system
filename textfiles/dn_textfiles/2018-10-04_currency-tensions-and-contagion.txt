CURRENCY TENSIONS AND CONTAGION

 
Roots of currency tensions to currency crises
How a significant currency tension will end up in a currency crisis is well-known. We must understand that currency tensions in modern global economies appear as an early warning of long-prevailing economic or financial imbalances or unhealthy concentrations/excesses or dark corners which are macroeconomic risks whose real background and the magnitude are not adequately known which may be about to burst. Sudden currency tensions are one of triggers to such bursts.
There can be various developments/causes that lead such early warnings to emerge suddenly. In present currency tensions, the continuous increase in the US interest rates with the rising value of the US dollar is the prime cause. In the case of foreign currency sector, the excessive dependence of the economy on foreign exchange is the underlying risky concentration/excess. The excessive dependence means the protracted deficits between foreign receipts and foreign payments that are funded by government’s foreign borrowings. When the foreign deficit is funded by the roll-over of short-term foreign borrowing, the risk of a possible burst of the borrowing/funding is the worst.
The possible burst will have various roots. First is the borrowing by banks and financial institutions. This includes borrowing in foreign currency as well as in local currency from foreign sources/customers. In addition to direct borrowings, there are various borrowing products such as foreign currency swaps, deposits, re-purchase agreements and payment commitments such as forward contracts, credit lines and various foreign guarantees. In the case of longer-term borrowing, there may be some borrowing that are due to mature soon. Although banks and finance companies are subject to maximum limits of foreign currency borrowing, they will have various borrowing products innovatively created to circumvent the limits, inclusive of additional borrowings with the approval of the Central Bank on various ad-hoc reasons. Accordingly, nobody really knows the true extent of the exposure of banks and financial institutions to foreign funding sources and underlying cash flow mismatches between foreign currency and local currency. In addition, majority of such foreign funds usually have been invested and lent for longer-term basis.
Accordingly, such foreign borrowings have exposed banks and financial institutions to risks of currency mismatches (between foreign currency and local currency) and maturity mismatches (short-term liabilities and longer-term assets) in addition to risk of roll-over of funds. In general, in currency tensions and crises, foreign lenders and investors do not renew their funds and take them back. In that event, banks and financial institutions will run out of funds to repay and come to local money market for borrowing. In general, this stage of the contagion will cause a liquidity crunch in the money market as surplus banks will cut-down lending naturally for their safety due to emerging tensions in the market. Also, they become unable to continue lending to businesses as usual and, therefore, businesses start defaulting of existing loans due to business cash flow problems.
As a result, banks, financial institutions and businesses get into spiral of finding shortages. In addition, a general exchange control permission has been available for the local companies to borrow from foreign sources. Nobody has the information on details of such borrowing. Generally, foreigners do not lend long-term to private businesses of local origin.
Therefore, the possible non-rollover of such private foreign borrowing could cause new demand for foreign currency to repay loans and new demand for local bank loans to finance businesses and cash flows of these companies. As a result, local companies get into funding problems which will add to shortages of funding or liquidity crunch in the economy.
In general monetary economics, any liquidity crunch, if it persists, leads to a credit crunch in the economy. As all major economic activities are financed by credit, the credit crunch immediately leads to an economic and business crunch. The credit crunch also will result in increase in interest rates and recession in the economy causing a wide range of business bankruptcies, loss of production and employment. It is highly possible that banks and financial institutions are highly exposed to market funds and, therefore, their cash flow deficits can cause a loss of public trust in some weak banks and financial institutions which will end up in a banking crisis and cripple the economy in no time. This is the catastrophe that countries will face due to currency crises. There are enough real-world experiences.
No need to mention about funding difficulties that the government will confront as the government is financed by new borrowings as well as the roll-over of existing borrowings in both local currency and foreign currency.
As the government is the regular borrowers in large volumes in the market, the increase in interest rates due to the shortage of liquidity in the market will first appear in the government debt market and all others will follow it.
The inflation caused by the currency depreciation also will push up market interest rates further to protect the real value of funds. As seen in many countries in the recent past, nobody can preclude possible public bankruptcies too at times. No intellectual macroprudential/financial stability surveillance frameworks of central banks in the world have been able to detect early such financial contagions and catastrophes in the past although it was their duty.
Responsibility of the Central Bank and its recent policy stance
In terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act, Foreign Exchange Act and other statutes relating to regulation of banks and financial institutions, prevention and resolution of present currency tensions and possible currency/financial crisis are the responsibilities of the Central Bank. The Minister of Finance also has responsibilities if the policy actions of the Central Bank are not adequate. The Central Bank has to use a mix of immediate policies without waiting for any further early warnings as the whole country and the world are now talking widely about currency tensions in the emerging market economies. Tensions will not end up soon as the US monetary policy tightening by way of increase in interest rates from the current 2.25% to around 3-3.5% and absorbing of nearly one trillion US dollars from the market, despite the strong opposite views of the President Donald Trump and his economic team, are expected in next two years in line with the mandate of the US Fed to keep inflation at around present 2% target with so-called normal/long-term level of interest rates. Meantime, the Europe also plans to commence tightening its monetary policy in 2019 as the economic recovery of the region from the same global financial crisis 2007/09 appears to be strong where some of foreign investments would flow to the Europe from emerging market economies.
The transmission and multiplier effect of this aggressively tightened monetary policy on the emerging market economies would be adverse as the US dollar is the leading global reserve currency. The US Fed states that, although it considers spillover effects to other countries, the US Fed is the central bank to the US and implements policies in the direct interests of the US.
However, the Central Bank still has not publicly recognized the currency problem although it could wee bean early warning of the macroeconomic risk of the prevailing exposures to foreign currency where many other countries have commenced standard monetary and regulatory policies since May to counter spreading of present currency tensions.
Instead, the Central Bank has made irresponsible statements to the public. First, in the middle of the beginning of currency tensions, the Central Bank cut interest rates (standing lending facility rate) by 0.25% in April after communicating in March (one month before) that there was no macroeconomic rationale for any expectation of increase in interest rates in the economy in near future (despite the fact that US Fed had been raising interest rates aggressively).
Second, in May, the Central Bank issued a press release stating that the foreign reserve of the country would increase to US$ 11 bn by mid-June from the level of prevailing US$ 9 bn and a part of its unprecedentedly large foreign reserve could be used to trigger even a material appreciation of the rupee to prevent unwarranted depreciation of the currency, particularly as the depreciation is not justified by the underlying fundamentals.
