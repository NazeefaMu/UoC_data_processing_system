Kantala’s dynamic entrepreneurs promote 300-year-old hana weaving

Two young designers, Vikum Rajapakse and Nadishan Shanthikumar, have a launched major crusade to take traditional handwoven mats ‘kantala’ to the international market. To meet this objective they have floated Kantala (Private) Limited.
Kantala is an ethical fashion accessory brand inspired by a 300-year-old traditional handweaving technique, indigenous to a tiny hamlet in Sri Lanka’s hill country.
Co-founders Rajapakse and Shanthikumar studying in England, always felt Sri Lanka had more to offer than being just a manufacturing destination for global fashion brands.
During his travels, Rajapakse was inspired by how Egypt's rich culture and crafts were integrated into contemporary goods.
Inspired by his discovery, he returned determined to carry Sri Lanka's wonderful traditional crafts to the global market through contemporary products and help traditional artisans secure a sustainable livelihood.
Rajapakse and Shanthikumar harboured ambitions of one day founding their very own venture. Starting off as colleagues, they quickly struck a chord, building a friendship based on shared values, aspirations and, not the least, a passion for the same football team and fast cars.
During their individual searches for the perfect idea they were inspired to join forces and bring their vision for Kantala to life.
While searching for the right traditional craft to take beyond Sri Lanka, Rajapakse was directed to a village of artisans outside of Kandy by a family friend. Upon visiting the village, he came across the community of artisans and their traditional handwoven mats.
After a chat with villagers, he knew straight away the search was over and with M. Dharmadasa he has met an artisan who shared his vision for the traditional handwoven mats.
Rajapakse shared his findings with Shanthikumar, explaining to him details of the handwoven mat, the history behind it and what he has in mind. Shanthikumar agreed that the handwoven mat has immense potential and was ready to partner Rajapakse to create a venture that will support the livelihoods of the traditional artisans.
"The traditional artisans are at the centre of everything Kantala does, providing them a sustainable livelihood and helping to protect one of Sri Lanka’s beautiful handcrafts for the future," said Rajapakse.
The handwoven hana mat is the centrepiece of every Kantala product. It is a craft perfected and passed down the generations for over 300 years in the village of Henavala in Kandy area.
“It is woven with precision, passion and pride by the master artisans residing in the village. To this day they retain the simple and eco-friendly process introduced by their ancestors, ” said Rajapakse.
Today, 95 families reside in Henavala and owing to economic reasons around 10 families actively engage in the craft and the younger folk continue to venture beyond the village in search of more lucrative and modern jobs.
"Through the popularisation of the handwoven hana mat through Kantala, we endeavour to provide the artisans of Henavala a respectable livelihood and encourage a new generation to continue the tradition," said Shanthikumar.
While at their full-time jobs, Rajapakse and Shanthikumar set about laying the foundation for their venture, frequently visiting the village of Henavala, trailing different mats, handbag designs and researching the market.
Given their background in the world of investment and finance, they had a lot to learn and sought advice from people already in the sector.
Little under two years from having first conceived the idea, they resigned from their day jobs and took the plunge to operate Kantala full time. 
'Kantala' / kænt<U+01DD>la: / is named after the Sanskrit word for the hana plant, which yields the core material used to create all their products. The leaves are scraped to extract a fine fibre, which is used to weave the mats used in their products. The fibre extracted from the hana plant is dyed using either natural plant colour or reactive dyes, conforming to stringent ecological standards.
“At Kantala we make fashion accessories that reflect and enhance the taste and personality of our customers. Tasteful and functional designs that retain the splendour of the handwoven Hana mats are the essence of Kantala products.
From the cheerful and reliable everyday handbag to the glamorous and delicate masterpiece, there is a Kantala product for every mood and occasion,” said Shanthikumar.
“With everything in place we have now started the campaign that will be Kantala’s launch pad for international expansion. The profits raised from the campaign will be utilised to support Kantala’s international expansion, the purchase of a hana fibre cleaning machine and setting up of a weavers cooperative for the artisans,” Rajapakse said. They hope the crowdfunding campaign will achieve their US$ 40,000 fixed funding target.
Kantala will be offering its first range of products to combine the new Piñatex material with the core material of all Kantala products, the hana mat.
“At Kantala we ensure no animals are harmed during the process of making our products. No animal based material is used to make a Kantala retail product. Kantala is a PETA approved Vegan brand," the duo said. Co-founder and Managing Director, Rajapakse wears multiple hats working at Kantala. While his main function is to set the strategic direction of the brand and the environment and resources for the rest of the eco-system to operate, he also manages the supply chain of the brand.
He completed his higher education in the UK, completing a bachelors in business and economics. He worked for a year in London in asset management. Upon returning to Sri Lanka he worked with the country’s largest apparel exporter for three years. Kantala is his third entrepreneurial venture, having tried his hand in a cinnamon export venture and HR software solution before.
Co-founder and CMO, Shanthikumar is in charge of all the sales and marketing functions at Kantala. From setting the annual marketing plans to executing them on social media or meeting customers and clients, he is Kantala’s salesman. He spends hours behind the lens perfecting each and every social media post.
Shanthikumar too completed his higher education in the UK, completing his masters in financial mathematics. He counts two years of professional experience in the UK having worked with a couple of investment banks and funds. In Sri Lanka, he also worked with the country’s largest apparel exporter for two years, joining the same team as Rajapakse. Kantala is Nadishan’s first startup venture.
Kantala has also received the 2016 award for 'Sustainable Sourcing' from the Good Market, Sri Lanka for the use of sustainable materials, OEKO Tex and ISO-certified dyes and natural dyes.More information could be obtained from
