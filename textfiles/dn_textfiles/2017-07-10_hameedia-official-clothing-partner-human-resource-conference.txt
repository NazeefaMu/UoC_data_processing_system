Hameedia official clothing partner at Human Resource Conference

Hameedia, Sri Lanka’s leading menswear specialist, was privileged to be the official clothing partner for the National Human Resource Conference 2017, organised by the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM).
The National Human Resource Conference 2017 was held at the BMICH from June 20 and 21.
Gift vouchers were distributed among all participants and three best dressed men at the event were selected and awarded with exclusive suits by Hameedia.
The conference attracted over 1000 local and foreign professionals representing the Human Resources (HR) fraternity as well as other industry professionals. The conference is considered to be the largest gathering of senior HR practitioners, consultants, academics as well as non-HR-related personnel from Sri Lanka and the South Asia region.
The conference brings together many experts in the fields of HR and technology to share their insights on industry trends.
Since its inception in 1949, Hameedia has cemented its place as the preferred menswear specialist in Sri Lanka with its world-class quality, custom tailoring and ready-made clothing.
The company continues to make its presence felt locally and internationally with 30 outlets across Sri Lanka and stores in the Seychelles, Maldives and Australia respectively.
