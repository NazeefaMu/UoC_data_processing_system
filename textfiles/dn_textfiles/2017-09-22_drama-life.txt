Drama for life

The 21st century, several qualities are needed to succeed in life. Amongst those are efficiency and speed. Success belongs to those who can perform efficiently and deliver the goods at a faster rate. Dramatic Moves speaks to the Richmond Drama Club where the boys are trained to become responsible citizens of the 21st century we live in.
Teacher in Charge, Sudarma Senanayake Gamage, pointed out that drama is the most conducive way to help students gain an understanding about what the world demands from you. She stated that we live in a society that is knowledge oriented. You need to understand exactly how things work or you will be left behind. Knowledge is one of the most powerful things you gain through drama.
“More than taking part in competitions and getting placed, what we want is to help our students develop 21st century skills through drama. By working as a team they build up skills of collaboration and communicative skills, and when they get exposure doing different types of Dramas like Russian Dramas, Anton Chekhov and English Literature like Shakespeare, they will improve their English Language skills and their personality. At the same time they will improve their leadership skills. Today in this globalized world, we talk about developing partnerships with other countries. And I believe specially through drama, even though our students do not get the opportunities to visit those countries, and get first- hand experience in being with those people, through drama they get that exposure. They learn about other cultures, traditions and history. So doing drama is not only for competitions but it is basically for the improvement for their overall personality and skills. Ultimately they will be very confident global citizens,” said Gamage.
She stated that as a teacher, she also learns a lot by working with these boys. “I would also like to thank my fellow teachers R.H. Priyadarshani, Surangi Alwis, Samankanthi Gamage and Geethanjalie Werradekara. As teachers we have a good rapport with these students by working with them, and the best part is developing very good relations with the boys. There is a good team spirit amongst the drama club members,” said Gamage.
The Drama Club functions at three levels as Senior, Junior and Primary levels under the guidance of a team of dedicated English teachers. So the seniors help the juniors to develop their dramatic skills and English Literary skills. The best reward is seeing our seniors take up the mantle and guide those who are younger to them.
Acquiring knowledge
President, W. S. P. Rasula Yadithya stated that meeting people can do wonders for your life. “When you meet people you learn from them. Everyone has a story to tell. You start to look at things from different angles. You acquire knowledge. Drama is the best platform to learn about behavior. You are able to better relate to people. You understand that there is a world out there that you may not be perceptive about. When I first started, there were some workshops that explored not only drama, but poetry and English as well and about Shakespeare himself. This helped us develop our skills in English such as speaking and correct pronunciation. It helped develop our coordination and improved our team skills. When we look at what we can learn from drama, the stage becomes a microcosm of real life. That is what we gain from drama. When doing drama we learn about other people and their characteristics and our lives have changed,” Yadithya said.
Yadithya stated that practicing is an experience of its own and are so much fun. His favourite drama was Macbeth where he played the character of Lady Macbeth. “Understanding those archaic words of Shakespeare was so interesting. It was so memorable to me. There is a really dark side to Lady Macbeth and I portrayed it! Learning to show these complex emotions was really enriching to me,” he added.
“There is a certain science in enacting these roles. You have to understand what is going on. Even when you are walking there has to be a certain purpose to it. You should know what you mean when you have to say something. It was Lady Macbeth who actually convinced Macbeth to kill Duncan. So this play could be a warning that there are people like Lady Macbeth in society. So we can gain something from reading this play,” Yadithya explained.
Real life copies
Vice President M. M. Sasmitha,spoke about trust. “You need to trust the man next to you. You need to back him up and he has to back you. You cannot have weak links in the chain.Doing Drama helps develop team spirit and teaches students how to work as a team. It especially helps to develop presentation skills like getting up on stage and overcoming your stage fright. Learning Shakespearean language helps develop your speaking skills because we become acquainted with the culture and literature. When working as team we get to know the strengths and limitations of others. We are in focus and we want everything to work perfectly well,” Sasmitha said.
Sasmitha played the part of Caesar and the betrayal of Brutus required Sasmitha to show complex emotions and required some special acting. “Life is a journey and drama helps you take that first step. Life is a book and drama helps you turn the first page,” Treasurer, P. H. Channuka Devnindu said adding that the learning is what most impresses him about drama.
“It helps you develop your leadership skills. You learn how to face problems by taking that first step. It is interesting, because through drama you see real life copies of the characters in the drama. So there are certain similarities between the characters I have encountered in dramas and in real life,” Devnindu added.
Not afraid
Secretary, T. Pamesh Uralagamagestated that drama provides you with something that is priceless which is not being afraid to speak. “You learn how to develop that charisma. You learn how to develop that boldness. You learn to tune into what other people are going through. It makes you are more empathetic person. At the start there was that initial stage fear. But when we practice hard and continuously it automatically develops your personality. You are not afraid to go up to anyone and speak, you are not afraid to go up there on stage and speak. We are all a team and we know each other,” Uralagamage said.
There is no time for shyness in this world. Every moment you spend being shy your chances of living a good life diminish.
“When you start off the main problem is being shy. When doing drama you are not afraid and you can face anyone. There are subtleties in dramas that you need to master,” Uralagamage added.
A good opportunity
Assistant Secretary, M. Mecci Nassimrevealed that a combination of attitude and perception is gained through drama. “We live in the 21st century. We live in a world that expects so much from you. You need to have a positive attitude. You need to be able to adapt to this global village we live in. And along the way you meet lifelong friends. Doing drama gives you a good opportunity to learn about the ways of this globalized world. Doing drama does wonders to your proficiency in English. When doing drama a friend you make is a friend for life. Through cooperating with everyone we learn about each other. We understand each other,” Nassim said.
He stressed that the arena, which is the stage is the best way to rid oneself of stage fear and drama helps the boys to showcase their talents. “Believe it or not, talking to others and stage fear are the two things that terrify people in our society. One of the ways to manage this situation is to dive in to drama. I sort of like Julius Caesar. That play interests me. It enlightens us on Leadership qualities. It shows the difference between those days and now,” Nassim pointed out.
