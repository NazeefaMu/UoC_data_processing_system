Castaway feminine gender makes astounding headway

Wednesday was International Women’s Day (IWD). It is a global event to celebrate women, unity, reflection, advocacy and action.
The 2017 theme for IWD focuses on ‘Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030.’ The world of work is changing, with significant implications for women. On one hand, technological advances and globalization bring unprecedented opportunities for those who can access them. On the other hand, there is growing informality of labour, income inequality and humanitarian crises.
A series of events
The day is usually marked with a series of events including political rallies, business conferences, networking events, craft markets, fashion parades, theatrical performances and more. Even Google usually does its bit by doing a Google Doodle.
In 1975, March 8 was announced as the official date for IWS by the United Nations. IWD was first started as a political and socialist movement in 1909 in four European countries. It soon spread with a determined screech and began reaching out to be celebrated in other parts of the globe in different ways. It is a day to commemorate the achievements of women and to raise awareness for the social and political equality of women around the world. It aims to highlight the importance of creating conditions for the elimination of discrimination against women and for their full and equal participation in social development. The day is also a time to reflect on progress made, to call for further change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres aptly put it: “For too long, discriminatory stereotypes have prevented women and girls from having equal access to education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). As a trained engineer and former teacher, I know that these stereotypes are flat wrong.” “They deny women and girls the chance to realise their potential and deprive the world of the ingenuity and innovation of half the population. On this International Day, I urge commitment to end bias, greater investments in STEM education for all women and girls as well as opportunities for their careers and longer-term professional advancement so that all can benefit from their ground-breaking future contributions.”
The remarkable aspect
Surely, it is right and just that the world recognises the achievements of women regardless of national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political divisions. Its objectives must include promoting gender relations, gender equality, celebrating and encouraging positive female role models which in turn will inspire the younger feminist generation.
South Asia comprises eight nations – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – and is bursting with various aspects of culture. However it is worth noting that almost half of the female population, experiences rampant gender based violence and discrimination in the areas of education, nutrition, health and employment, curtailing their human rights, disrupting gender equality and their general well being.
Yet, all over the world the turnaround in some cases of women’s success stories is causing turned heads, raised eyebrows, and some rifts in what is still seen as a male dominated society. But, thanks to the precedents set by courageous and resourceful women front-runners who have wielded remarkable influence, others of their gender have and are being encouraged to step up and take leadership roles as businesswomen, heads of financial firms, teachers, scholars and writers.
The remarkable aspect to all this is that the relatively new-found inspiration seems contagious. It is not at all surprising that the trend has caught on in many parts of Asia. And who can forget Sri Lanka, the little nation that gave the world its first woman prime minister. Look around you and there is no gainsaying the fact that local women are starting businesses at a record pace, rising to key leadership positions, and helping communities flourish across the nation.
Today, they continue to inspire women in every strata of society to reach their fullest potential. In essence, they have challenged the way men and women think about business, education, politics and life in general. In Sri Lanka both through traditional roles as mothers and wives andas professionals, businesswomen, financial leaders, media personnel and teachers, women have made great strides to hold their own in a male-dominated world.
Essentially important
There was a time, not too long ago, when it would have seemed unimaginable for a woman to have broken through the highest, hardest glass ceiling. The connotation refers to occupying the ‘corner office’ or the executive suite. At present, thanks to the achievements of several trail-blazing icons to inspire them many women have blended into the professional and personal sphere with less conflict than they ever encountered before. Things certainly seem to be looking up for women in corporate Sri Lanka. Yes, and times certainly appear to be changing in our conservative little world of business enterprise. One of the more significant among them is the empowerment of women in all spheres of trade, finance and industry.
In corporate Sri Lanka a good many women professionals have shattered the gender stereotype and climbed to the highest rung of the hierarchal or rather matriarchal ladder. Indeed, a handful of remarkable personalities have created history by heading some of the country’s most elite institutions.
In the present day world relationships have become very important as the level of insecurity is just augmenting every day. The woman, in your life, plays a very important supportive and encouraging role. She is the sole inspiration factor for you. So, it is essentially important to have the best wife, girlfriend gift ideas to help you reiterate the fact that you love her the most. They are important as far as maintaining a relationship is concerned.
In truth, it has been their fortitude, vision and pluck that have carried them to the very zenith of their careers. They have done so with admirable determination displaying those rare attributes of courage, resilience and endurance. And all the more credit to them because they have achieved their ambitions despite the entrenched gender bias that pervades our culture.
Many global corporations have also started to more actively support IWD by running their own internal events through supporting external ones. Year on year IWD is certainly increasing in status. The United States even designates the whole month of March as 'Women's History Month'.
So let’s all make a difference, think globally and act locally! Make everyday International Women's Day. Do your bit to ensure that the future for the fair sex is bright, equal, safe and rewarding.
