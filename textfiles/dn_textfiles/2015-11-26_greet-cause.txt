Free eye care through Helpage greeting cards
Greet for a cause!

Over 500,000 Christmas and New Year greeting cards as well as Christmas decorations have been issued by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL). They are now on sale at bookshops and super centres in Colombo and other areas. The cards are priced at Rs. 35 to Rs. 40.
The proceeds will be used to conduct free cataract surgeries and free mobile medical and eye camps for senior citizens over 55 years.
A large variety of greeting cards adorned with colourful embossed and normal print graphic designs and foiled designs are available.
The Christmas cards depict the birth of Jesus Christ, Nativity, Christmas, Holy Christmas, message of love and peace, Bethlehem, born King of the Jews, and Our Saviour and Prince of Peace.
Christmas decorations in various colours can be used in houses and business premises.
The paintings of the New Year cards have been done by renowned artistes while photographs depict the country's wildlife and heritage.
HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said elders need regular medical attention. A large number of elderly cataract patients are reported from many parts of the country.
"Since a majority of them are not in a sound financial position, HelpAge conducts free surgeries with the latest Foldable Intraocular Lenses (IOL's) at their Eye Care Hospital, Wellawatta located opposite Savoy Cinema," he said.

According to Fundraising Manager Ruchilalani Batuwanthudawa, contributions can be made towards helping the aged, by sending HelpAge greetings cards during the festive season.
Cards are also available at HASL Head office, No- 102, Pemananda Mawatha, Rattanapitiya, Boralesgamuwa. Contact 0112803752/54 or 0114926948/358 for details.
