CITES in Colombo next year

The 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) will be held in Colombo next year.
The CITES is an international agreement between governments to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.
This conference will be held once in three years and next year it will be held from May 23 to June 3 at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial International Exhibition Centre in Colombo.
Representatives from 183 member countries and international organizations, NGOs, various environmental organizations and journalists will participate.
The CITES was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the IUCN (The World Conservation Union).
The text of the Convention was finally agreed at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C., the United States of America, on March 3, 1973, and on July 1, 1975, the CITES entered in force.
A special discussion on the preparatory works of the conference was held with Secretary to the President Udaya R. Senevirathne at the Presidential Secretariat last Friday.
Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Amaratunga, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake, officials and the IGP participated.
