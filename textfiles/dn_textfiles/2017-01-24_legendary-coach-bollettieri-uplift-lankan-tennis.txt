Legendary coach Bollettieri to uplift Lankan tennis

Turning a new chapter in Sri Lankan tennis, legendary US tennis coach Nicholas James Bollettieri who has trained 10 world number 1 players including Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, Maria Sharapova, Venus and Serena Williams, Martina Hingis, Jim Courier and Kei Nishikori has pledged his support to help uplift the standard of Sri Lanka tennis.
The 85-year-old veteran on a short visit to Sri Lanka on the invitation of Queen’s Club Tennis convener Asanga Seneviratne addressed the media at the Sports Ministry auditorium yesterday. Queen’s Club in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) conducted a three-day coaching camp for budding tennis players where Nick actively engaged in training and inspiring young Lankans.
“It’s not the size of the gift, but the thought behind it I value, said Nick when he was presented a memento by the Sri Lanka Tennis.  Pictures by Sarath Peiris
Nick has revolutionised elite junior tennis coaching by opening the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (NBTA) in Florida, the first major tennis boarding school. Even after International Management Group (IMG) bought the academy in 1987 Nick continued his services to the academy.
SLTA Selecting Committee chairman Arjun Fernando said that Sri Lanka is very fortunate to have the services of an elite international coach like Nick. “Nick instructed our Davis Cup team and we are glad that we could include around 100 young players for this short training. But I believe in the long run, we have to focus on high performance training for our top level players by Nick if we are to raise our standard internationally. We hope to produce at least one player in the top 200 ATP rankings in the future,” Fernando stated.
Despite his age, Nick was so alive and graceful in his speech and emphasized the value of team work. “It’s not Nick did everything alone, it’s me and my team. Today there are 225 full time tennis players in our academy in addition to another 800 sports men and women in nine sports,” said Nick.
“Coaches must know how to speak to young players. They must not let down a player in front of others, which can cause severe damage to his or her mentality and career. I have worked for three days with Lankan youngsters. I saw two seven-year players who are capable of challenging a same aged competitor from any part of the world. You need competition to raise you to the next level”.
“Parents and family play a vital role too. I had the opportunity to speak with Sri Lankan parents on the last two days. I hope to launch a continuous program here. I will visit Sri Lanka three or four times a year, but will have a constant follow-up through internet discussions and videos of practice sessions”.
“We can choose talented players for scholarships, but the results won’t come overnight, it takes time. The children will lift themselves to the next level in two-three years and within five-six years they can reach international level. I can guarantee that the children will transform into another level, not just in sport but in life as a whole. Their moral values will be enhanced and they will learn how to refrain from bad habits such as alcohol. What can be done here is more than I thought,” Nick explained.
When asked whether he felt that Sri Lanka was on par with international standards in practice venue conditions and materialistic requirements, Nick said, “It is not the size of the desk, but who sits behind it. It depends a lot on coaches. When you put good players with good coaches the standard will rise,” he noted.
Nick also said the right combination of techniques, physical ability and mind will bring out the best out of a player. Giving some useful tips to youngsters Nick said it is very important for them to have realistic goals. “Take one day at a time”. Secondly, how good you are you must have the feeling that you can be much better. Your family support and encouragement is the other important fact in all your success,” Nick said.
