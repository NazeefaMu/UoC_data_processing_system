Groomed for success

Not only was she the first Sri Lankan contestant to represent Sri Lanka at the Mrs Universe pageant but she managed to make her mark at the event as well and bring home the mini title of ‘Woman Mrs Universe Honesty’. Apart from that multi talented Thrikala Dharani has even been approached by Victoria’s Secret, UK. All this and more she has achieved with her supportive husband Enoke Perera by her side cheering her along from the ramp to uploading pictures of her delicious food onto his Facebook account.
In a few words
Thrikala is very loving, caring and objective. She has a lot of confidence. She is also very honourable.She went to Thakshila Central College, Horana. She is qualified in many different sectors. She is one of the youngest people to get a Visharada degree in music in Sri Lanka. She got her degree when she was 16. She can play pretty much any musical instrument except the flute. She has undergone training and is a qualified aircraft maintenance technician. She is also a qualified cabin crew member. We have a two year old daughter, Saleen, so now Thrikala is also qualified as a mother!
Music runs in the family
Thrikala comes from a family which is deeply rooted in music. Her parents, Ajith and Samantha Kalubowila, are both musicians. They have their own music institute. Her elder sister, Thanu, is a lawyer. Her brother, Ridma, is still engaged in studies. They have all got musical names. Thrikala means three arts, Thanu means melody and Ridma means rhythm.
The meeting
Our meeting was coincidental. It took place four years ago. Thrikala called me to get some advice about joining SriLankan Airlines. I work as a pilot for Etihad Airways. Her parents were not fond of her joining the company so she was looking for other avenues of advice. Soon we were texting each other on WhatsApp and we found out that we have a lot of similarities. We realized that we were very compatible. So eventually I asked her out.
First date
One day when I was at my home in Pelawatte I got to know that Thrikala had dropped by Maharagama for some work. My best friend lives in Maharagama so I decided to tell her that I am heading off from there. My first glimpse of her was of her crossing the road and running towards me. Later I lied to her saying that I am driving towards Horana and dropped her in her home town.
Similar interests
I love cars and I would do anything for cars. Thrikala too had a passion for cars. We shared pictures of cars and she was spot on from the framework, paint job, trim and alloy wheels in the pictures of the cars she sent. She and I also love pizza and Thai food. We are into music too. I can drum and she plays almost anything. Everything about her from her passions to her personality captivated me. That made me decide that she is ‘the one’ for me.
The marriage
We have been seeing each other for less than six months after we decided to tie the knot. By then we knew that we had to be together. I had to head off to Abu Dhabi because of my profession. So I decided that she had to be with me there. I asked her and everything happened spontaneously. We got married on January 23, 2015, at Kingsbury Hotel. Our daughter was born on February 2, 2016.
From marriage to Mrs Sri Lanka Universe
Trikala’s father is very strict. Once she changed her hair colour and she was given 24 hours to change it back to the original colour! She wanted to compete for the Miss Sri Lanka pageant but he was not into that idea. However once she decided to take part in Mrs Sri Lanka for Mrs Universe he had no objections. He gave me a look saying “that is your problem now.”
I am comfortable to an extent of Thrikala taking part in the beauty and glamour scene. I have my limits too but most of the time I am very supportive towards her work. It is based on trust and I believe that everybody should be given an opportunity. Being in the field is time consuming as well.
I believe that it all comes down to the individual. If that person can manage their time, handle the pressure and the changes, I don’t see a problem.
Winning a beauty pageant of this nature is her dream and I am happy to see her dream come true. I usually speak out when I am not comfortable with things and she has been understanding towards those matters. It is something to do with the understanding between both parties. If there is a breakdown in communication, then things are going to be difficult.
Thrikala showed me a USA beauty pageant and they were willing to absorb her as a representative of Sri Lanka but based in the US. It was complicated then because we just had the baby. Later when we returned to Colombo we heard about the Mrs Sri Lanka for Mrs Universe pageant. It was just a matter of her telling me about it and me giving it a nod.
She is a winner
Thrikala is very confident and she has got an extremely good personality. She is also very dedicated to whatever she takes up. I had a lot of faith in what she did. I was very confident that she had a very good chance of winning the Mrs Sri Lanka Universe 2017 title. Whenever I had an off day I would be there to cheer her along and people used to give me the thumbs up when they realized that she was my wife.
She won four mini pageants: Mrs Best Catwalk, Mrs Talent, Mrs Best Model and Mrs Popular. She did a fusion traditional and modern dance, played the tabla and sang raga for the talent competition. I made sure that I was there for that because she trained so hard for it.
Tough times
Thrikala had put on 25 kilos during pregnancy. She worked out, walked and planned her meals and got back to her normal weight before the pageant. She did not take any supplements or medication to lose weight.
She went on a high protein diet and lost five kilos when she was in South Africa taking part in the Mrs Universe competition. This was mainly to lose belly fat because they had to wear a bikini for the competition.
Favourite Mrs Universe moment
Thrikala did a fire eating dance called Gini Sisila for the Mrs Universe talent round in South Africa. Lalith Parakum choreographed it and trained her in less than 10 days. Everybody was cheering her. We have the video and I even watch it on some of my off days because I am truly fascinated about how she did it.
Biggest strength and biggest weakness
Thrikala is very determined. That is her greatest strength. She is also quite presentable. She always looks well groomed. I am very casual. I dress when I need to dress up. She is a sucker for fashion. The only thing I had to train her on was time management. If we had to attend a cocktail party at seven she would only be ready at eight. However now she has overcome that hurdle too.
Foodwise
Thrikala is an excellent cook. We are both vegetarians. I actually have a separate album on my Facebook account which is called ‘Tiki’s Vegetarian Kitchen’. The specialty about her dishes is that she garnishes them. They are like something out of a culinary magazine! She makes cauliflower dough to Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. Whenever she goes to a restaurant she chats with the chef and asks for the recipe to recreate the dish. I love her cauliflower dough pizzas. She loves Thai food and the sticky rice is her favourite.
Favourite pastimes
We live in Abu Dhabi so we usually head off to the race track or shopping mall. We love family outings. Our favourite holiday destination is Seychelles. We have not been to Switzerland and would love to go there.
Unfulfilled dreams
Thrikala has recorded a song called Kohe Hoo Nuba Innawa Athi. The melody is by Sanka Dineth and the lyrics are by Isuru Weerasinghemudali. She and Mr Sri Lanka 2016 Udaya Sri Bandara are featuring in the music video. She is hoping to release it at the end of the month. She wishes to do an album as well. Thrikala’s dream is to win a Best Singer in a Motion Picture award. If she gets an offer for a challenging character in a movie which does not involve scenes like running around bushes holding somebody’s hand,
then yes, I would encourage her to take up the role.
