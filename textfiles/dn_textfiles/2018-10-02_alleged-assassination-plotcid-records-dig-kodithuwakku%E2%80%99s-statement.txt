Alleged assassination plot:CID records DIG Kodithuwakku’s statement

CID officials yesterday recorded a statement from the DIG in charge of the Kalutara district Ranmal Kodithuwakku over the alleged telephone conversation that described a conspiracy to harm President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
According to CID sources, the investigators have already recorded statements from State Intelligence Service DIG Milantha Jaywardena, STF Commadant M.R.Latheef, Western Province DIG Nandana Munasinghe and several others.
Meanwhile, Public Enterprise Deputy Minister H.M. Harees yesterday made a complaint to the Criminal Investigation Department over the revelation made by Operations Director of the Anti Corruption Movment Namal Kumara.
The Deputy Minister has asked the CID to arrest Namal Kumara and conduct full scale investigations into his allegations.
Namal Kumara last week said that he received money from an individual in France who has allegedly had very close connection with the diaspora to create communal clashes in the Eastern Province.
He also revealed another telephone conversation that describes about a plan to launch an attack targeting a politician in the Eastern Province.
Meanwhile, Police Media sources confirmed that the office of Terrorist Investigation Department’s DIG Nalaka De Silva has been sealed. “CID investigators have also taken several documents into their custody,” sources said.
