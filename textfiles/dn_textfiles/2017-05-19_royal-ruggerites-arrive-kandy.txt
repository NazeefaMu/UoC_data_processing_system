Royal ruggerites arrive in Kandy

Royal College ruggerites arrived in Kandy last afternoon and were seen at pratice at the Nittawela grounds under the watchful eyes of head coach Sanath Martis and assistant coach Dushanth Lewke. The players under the leadership of Ovin Askey are in peak form. If Royal beats Trinity they will become the inter-school league Cup champions and also winners of the first leg of the Bradby Shield. So it is going to be a tremendously exciting game.
