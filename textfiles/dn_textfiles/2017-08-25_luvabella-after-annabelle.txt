Luvabella after Annabelle

It’s that most irritating time of year (which comes earlier each year) when Christmas present ideas seep into the national consciousness.
One such idea aimed at hitting parents in the pocket is the touted ‘must have’ kids toy our little ones will be clamouring for come the autumn.
She’s an artificial intelligence doll called Luvabella and she hits the shelves in October - just in time for all those festive wish lists.
Luvabella responds to affection, falls asleep, giggles and talks and sounds like a dream, but may have in fact crossed that fine line between cute and creepy.
With her wide-eyed, knowing stare, there is perhaps something a little unnerving about Luvabella.
Responding to a post about it on Facebook, several parents aired their doubts about her.
One woman wrote: “This doll looks like Annabelle’s little sister! Who in their right mind is going to give this creepy looking doll to their child. I know three kids who will start crying and hit their parents with this thing.”
“Annabelle’s little sister” is a strong statement, and the critic wasn’t alone in her opinion.
“It’s a must if you want to scare your kids from playing with dolls...” agreed another woman.
Citing another famous doll, one Facebook user added, “Hello, child of Chucky.”
“I thought this was a joke,” was another lamentation, with people also asking if she had an ‘off’ switch.
However, a smattering of people seemed to like poor Luvabella.
