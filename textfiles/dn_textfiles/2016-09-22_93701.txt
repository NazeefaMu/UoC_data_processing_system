The countdown is over. Dhanush‘s Thodari after a series of postponed dates was released today September 22. The romantic actioner is directed by Prabhu Solomon and also stars Keerthy Suresh. It’s about an adventurous train ride from Delhi to Chennai. Fans are super excited about the flick for various reason! Here are a few of them! So, the one intriguing part of this movie is, it’s entirely shot on a train. So Dhanush who plays pantry vendor had to learn the way they walk, the way they sell and also learn to balance many things in his hand while shooting on the train. He had to also learn to fight, dance and sing on the moving vehicle! It’s is about a train ride from Delhi to Chennai, so the fact that it’s going to be one setting, is exciting!
Dhanush-Keerthy: Dhanush and Keerthy Suresh are coming together for the first time for Thodari. From the looks of the trailer, their romance is simple and ordinary, there is nothing glamorous about this pair. Yet, you are drawn to this fresh duo! The chemistry in trailer is already evident, so we are now eagerly awaiting the movie! Of course romance on a train has its own fun and we can’t wait!
Little bit of everything: If you thought this movie was just a love story, think again. It has elements of action, comedy along with romance. Believe it or not, Thodari promises to be a complete entertainer. It will make you fall in love, laugh and entertain you, when it’s time to face the bad guys.
Prabhu Solomon: The Mynaa director is back! but unlike his other times, he has taken on an established actor for his film.
He believed Dhanush fit the bill as he wanted someone who could get into character easily and also be a familiar name, on the business front. We are even more excited as he’s back again with a love story! So now we are eagerly awaiting to see if the Dhanush-Prabhu combo clicks at the BO!
Dhanush first film in 2016: This will be Dhanush’s first film in 2016, so fans are obviously excited! After producing Amma Kannaku, we are finally getting to see the versatile actor on the big screen! He will be playing an ordinary pantry vendor on a train.
