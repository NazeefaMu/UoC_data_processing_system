Computerised data network for Mediation Boards Commission

The Mediation Boards Commission is planning to create a computerised data network consisting all information relating to the network of mediation boards throughout the country.
Commission's Chairman and Retired Supreme Court Judge Hector Yapa, hopes to obtain assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for this programme.
Commission sources said such a data network would enable the commissions to obtain instant information about the working of all mediation boards.
