JVP to present 20A on April 19 or 20

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to abolish the Executive Presidency will be presented in Parliament on April 19 or 20. Speaking to the media at the Parliament Lobby yesterday, he said the Amendment would be presented as a Private Member’s Bill.
“We decided to give priority for the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister and wait till it is finished.
The Government has failed to keep to its promise of abolishing the Executive Presidency even after three years in office. We will give the initiative to this move through the 20th Amendment,” he said.
