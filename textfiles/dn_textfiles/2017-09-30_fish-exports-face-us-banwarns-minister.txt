Fish exports face US ban,warns Minister

Incidental catching of dolphins using Longline method:
The US authorities will impose a ban on Sri Lanka’s fish exports if the fishing community using the Longline fishing method does not take measures to prevent Dolphins from getting trapped in their nets, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing officials at the Advisory Committee meeting at the Ministry recently, Minister Amaraweera said there is a risk of the United States imposing ban on Sri Lankan fish exports to the US due to the absence of a proper mechanism to avoid incidental catching and killing of dolphins.
The Minister has directed the Ministry Secretary to take measures to import new devices used to prevent incidental catching and killing of dolphins in other countries and distribute them, free of charge to all fishermen engaged in long line fishing, by next year.
According to the International Fisheries Law, catching and killing of dolphins has been banned.
