Report card with a steady progress

Two years ago, on January 8, 2015, the incumbent President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who thought he would be in power for another term, was thrown out of office at the Presidential election. Some called it a political coup, if ever there was one.
His contender, Maithripala Sirisena, was elected President. He has now had two years in office and it is possible to see what changes he has done and will do in the future.
A few days after Maithripala Sirisena assumed the Presidency, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the Parliament. He said, "The state of public finances exposes the shady operations of the previous government. The façade of duplicity must be removed and the actual position made known. The previous government gave Rs 524 billion as Treasury Guarantees to commercial banks to implement infrastructure projects by state-owned enterprises (SOE). The outstanding debt of SOEs to the local banking system is Rs 593 billion. Foreign borrowings of SOEs at end-2014 was US $ 2.36 billion or Rs 308 billion. The outstanding government debt at end-2014 including these three items is Rs 8.8 trillion". [Rs 8.8 trillion is 78 % of our GDP]
In August, same year, the UNP led United National Front won the parliamentary elections and for the first time in Sri Lanka's political history, two major political parties joined hands to form a Government. They called it a unity Government.
Progress
Even with an ailing health report, the unity Government emerged with a renewed emphasis on economic reforms and fiscal consolidation. Industry stakeholders began to emphasize the importance of diversifying and adding value to Sri Lanka's export basket and trade relationships, repeating the country's earlier success in the garment market. A variety of sectors, including branded tea, rubber products, gems, IT and business process outsourcing, were all seen as potential avenues for expansion.
Tourism posted record growth in the last two years with tourist arrivals of 1.8m and 2.0m respectively. Along with inward remittances, it represented an important component of Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings, though both were vulnerable to volatility in international economic conditions. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment contributed highly in foreign exchange, 90% of which coming from the Middle East.
With major international hotels, including luxury players Shangri-La and Grand Hyatt, continue to emerge in Sri Lanka, the country will be looking to reinforce its tourism profile overseas in 2017 and beyond.
Sri Lanka also has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the other MDGs, outperforming other South Asian countries.
What Next
President Sirisena has often emphasized that his Government plans to create a knowledge based social market economy and an export-oriented economy and a Megapolis in the western province to promote economic growth. Creation of several business and technology development areas specialized in various sectors island wide as well as tourism zones is also being planned.
Business Analysts suggest that a medium term (3-5 year) program is the call of the day. Two pathways are suggested: One is that it must be an all export oriented effort and the other recommends that it must all be left to the private sector. Both suggestions, in moderation, have a point but it is a balanced approach that is more to the point.
Economic growth
As President Maithipala Sirisena moves into his third year, the future of Sri Lanka's economic health will largely depend on the country's political stability, public service efficiency, return to genuine peace, good governance and continued policy reforms-particularly in fiscal discipline and public service management.
He can be happy that a significant progress has been made during his two years' tenure. His Government has reversed the previous Government's slide into authoritarianism and family rule. Space for dissent and activism has reopened in civil society. There have also been appreciable gains in rule-of-law and liberal-democratic governance, with the police and judiciary functioning more independently and reduced powers for the executive president.
The Government has set a more conciliatory tone on ethnic issues. Symbolic gestures like singing of the national anthem in Tamil on Independence Day accompanied initial progress in releasing military-occupied land in the Tamil-majority north and east and a slight pullback of the military's role there.
The Government's broader agenda is extremely ambitious, including a new constitution, to be drafted and approved by the mid-2017, further governance and rule-of-law reforms, addressing the legacy of the war and major changes in economic policy. Each track has powerful political opponents; all need to move at their own speed and are hard to synchronize against a backdrop of a deteriorating economy.
We have yet to see how willing and able the government is to move on deeper reforms, such as justice for wartime abuses and a political solution to the ethnic conflict based on greater devolution of power.
On January 4 the government launched the economic development plan, themed under creating a powerful Sri Lanka and economy which uplifts all. The plan is in keeping with the President's 'Sustainable Era' initiative.
Diagnosis
This writer believes that we have misdiagnosed the slowdown of the economic progress. It is not a problem of a 'weak top.' to be solved by a 'strong leadership.' No, it is not! Sri Lanka is faced with a systemic problem, born of the wrong or insufficient laws and deficient regulatory capacity.
But systemic problems take much longer than two years to fix. When you examine the reasons why doing business in Sri Lanka is so difficult: tax uncertainty, dozens of permits to start a business, daily corruption, broken infrastructure, shortage of trained talent, none are easy-fix ones.
There are larger problems in Sri Lanka that will take some time to tackle: education, health care, pensions, pollution. It is heartening to see that some long-term plans are afoot to solve some of these issues.
One of the platforms President Maithripala Sirisena ran on was to rid the country of corruption and rope in the people who got involved in corrupt deals. On that front, at least, one can say the Government has unearthed many mega-scams done during the previous Government. But people were complaining about the slow progress of the investigations.
To expedite the process, the Cabinet recently approved to set up a tribunal on the lines of Criminal Justice Commission to enquire into the cases of fraud and corruption.
Foreign policy
Only a few expected President Maithripala Sirisena to be a strong foreign policy leader; after all, he was a newcomer to international politics. Yet he has been a revelation on the world stage, a complete natural.
President Sirisena's invitation as a guest of the G-7 nations - the most powerful and influential group of nations - is unprecedented, not only for a Sri Lankan head of state but for a Third World leader.
Most of the trips he made during the last two years had been state visits to Asian countries invited by the leaders of those countries.
President Sirisena has undoubtedly opened doors to Sri Lanka. He has made friends among many leaders and won over the increasingly significant diaspora. This will have economic and social benefits down the road.
Under President Sirisena, Sri Lanka remains relatively nonaligned. But more importantly, Sri Lanka seems to have moved beyond: it has more of a global feel to it, projecting ambition.
Judgment
In the end, President Sirisena will be judged by Sri Lankan people on whether they feel their lives are improving, and here the President has some breathing space. Sri Lanka is going to keep growing for many years, in part because it is starting from short, medium and long-term plans and is blessed with hundreds of thousands of young people hungry for jobs and opportunities. The reality is that delivery takes time, especially in Sri Lanka. There is much to do. For President Sirisena, it means, less PR and more action, especially at home. He still has the tools and the confidence of the people to be Sri Lanka's most transformative leader in the post-independence history.
