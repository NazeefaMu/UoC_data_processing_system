LAUGFS Southern Petroleum Unveils Solar Powered Fuel Station in Pepiliyana

LAUGFS Southern Petroleum, in collaboration with Lanka IOC (LIOC), recently unveiled Sri Lanka’s first ever model fuel filling station with solar roofing at Pepiliyana, marking the 20th addition to the LAUGFS network of fuel filling stations. This is also the 8th addition to the LAUGFS Southern Petroleum filling station network under the LIOC dealership.
The new fuel station will be operated by LAUGFS Southern Petroleum in partnership with Lanka IOC. As the company continues to strengthen its presence in the retail fuel sector, the Pepilayana station will serve as another benchmark for the industry, with its solar panel installation. The 25 KWH Solar Panelled Roof is expected to add over 3000 units per month on average to the National Grid, positioning it as a benchmark in the fuel retailing industry.
“We are delighted to serve the motorists of Pepiliyana with this latest addition to our LAUGFS fuel retail network in partnership with Lanka IOC. This also marks another important milestone in our efforts to minimize our environmental footprint with the installation of the first ever solar-panelled roof. This is an innovative concept, which is a first in our local petroleum retailing industry, and will be a benchmark for many to follow. The solar panel installation will serve to support our electricity requirements at the new Papiliyana fuel station with clean energy and will also supply excess generation to the national grid. We also hope to be certified under the GREENSL Rating System developed by the Green Building Council of Sri Lanka (GBCSL),” commented LAUGFS Southern Petroleum Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mahesh Weerasena.
The Pepiliyana fuel station by LAUGFS Southern Petroleum offers Xtra Primium 95, Euro 4 Standard, Petrol 92 Octane, Lanka Super Diesel, Lanka Auto Diesel as well as Auto Gas. It also features a diverse range of lubricant and car care products for the convenience of busy motorists, along with the LAUGFS domestic and industrial LPG cylinders.
“At LAUGFS, we have a strong customer focus, which is why we continuously invest in developing our employees and equip them to serve our customers better each day. We have initiated a program together with NAITA to help our teams across the country to gain an NVQ Level 3 qualification, elevating their knowledge as well as profile and providing them with a strong career path,” Weerasena further elaborated.
