EU urges Lanka to maintain death penalty moratorium

The European Union (EU) yesterday, urged Sri Lanka to maintain the moratorium on the death penalty.
Permanent Representative of Austria Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger speaking at the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of the European Union (EU), said that the EU welcomes the overall progress made in advancing respect for human rights in Sri Lanka.
Regarding the death penalty, she said the EU encourages Sri Lanka to maintain the moratorium, with a view towards complete abolition.
However, she noted that much remains to be done and that there is only six months left before the next report on Sri Lanka by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 2019.
