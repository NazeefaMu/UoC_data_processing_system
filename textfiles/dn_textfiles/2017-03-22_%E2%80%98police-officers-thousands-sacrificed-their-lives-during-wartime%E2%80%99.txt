‘Police officers in thousands sacrificed their lives during wartime’

About 3,000 police personnel died and 639 were disabled during the wartime, Senior DIG Eastern Province Sumith Edirisinghe said.
He was addressing the gathering at the commemoration of the 153rd Police Heroes Day held at the SSP office yesterday after hoisting the flag and paying floral tributes to the fallen heroes.
The Senior DIG said 1,500 policemen who left service for various reasons were taken back to the service. "Police officers provide an exemplary service to maintain law and order and peace in the country. We should continue that record," he said.
Batticaloa Ampara DIG Yogoda Arachchi, SSP Saman Yaddawaram, SP Keerthi Retna and religious leaders participated.
