Trinity College rugby player dies at practice

 
A seventeen-year-old Trinity college rugby player who collapsed during a warmup run from Trinity College to the Pallakelle Stadium on Saturday (30) died at the Kandy General Hospital yesterday (1). 
Trinity College Headmaster Andrew Fowler–Watt said ‘Bhathiya (Ekanayake) was immediately taken to the nearest Chanelling Centre in Pallekelle by the Master in Charge of Rugby and one of the TCK Coaching staff.’
‘The doctor (who saw him immediately) advised that he should transported as quickly as possible to Kandy General Hospital’.
‘When he reached the Hospital, Bhathiya was immediately admitted to the ICU. From that moment, he received the best possible levels of medical support with a large number of doctors and nurses working extremely hard on his behalf’.
‘However, it was ultimately to no avail; despite fighting all the way himself, Bhathiya finally lost his battle for life this afternoon. He died with his loving family at his bedside’, the Headmaster said.
He added, ‘Until the moment he collapsed, there had apparently been no suggestion whatsoever (according to both boys and staff) that Bhathiya was experiencing any sort of difficulty. Far from it, in fact – his teammates and coaches had been amazed by his performance throughout the session’.
Ekanayake, studying in grade twelve, played in last season’s under eighteen matches as a prop forward.
He was training to take part in 1st XV pre-Season rugby training when he passed away.
Bhathiya Ekanayake is the son of a Trinity College staffer.
