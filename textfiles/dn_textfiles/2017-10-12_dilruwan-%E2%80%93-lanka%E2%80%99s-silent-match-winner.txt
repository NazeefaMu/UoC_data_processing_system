Dilruwan – Lanka’s silent match winner

DUBAI, Thursday – He is the silent performer, hardly in the news with his most illustrious team mate Rangana Herath hogging the limelight most of the time with his outstanding left-arm bowling.
But in his own way Dilruwan Perera has become an integral part of the Sri Lanka cricket team’s bowling combination and played the support role to Herath to almost near perfection.
On Tuesday at the Dubai International Stadium, the roles were reversed as Perera played the role of chief destroyer of the Pakistan second innings taking five wickets for 98 to bowl his team to a series clinching 2-0 win.
Amongst his victims were Pakistan’s top order batters like Shan Masood, Haris Sohail, Babar Azam and skipper Sarfraz Ahmed. Herath was left to clean up the tail which he did by dismissing Yasir Shah and Wahab Riaz.
“Pakistan concentrated too much on Rangana and tried to prevent him from taking wickets. They came with that plan and they didn’t think that I can be a threat to them,” said Perera. “I knew on this pitch the ball would turn and I concentrated bowling in the right areas.
“We bowl according to the match situations. In the last Test (Abu Dhabi) when Rangana was taking wickets my role was to close up one end and help him get wickets from the other. Today the roles were changed because I was taking the wickets and Rangana played the role of containing the batsmen. That’s how we complement each other.”
It was Perera’s fifth five-for in a Test innings and on four of those occasions Sri Lanka had ended up winners. Having begun his Test career at the age of 31 Perera who made his debut in 2014 has 93 wickets in his bag from 22 Tests at an average of 32.
He is currently being played as a bowling all-rounder at number seven because of his ability to contribute with the bat as well having scored 783 runs (avg. 21.75) with six fifties (highest score 95).
Bowling with the pink ball Perera said that there was a difference when it lost its shine.
“The one difference with the pink ball is that when it gets old it won’t grip the surface so much. That’s what happened to us last night (4th day) we couldn’t get much turn because of the dew as well and Pakistan was able to bat comfortably,” said Perera. “We knew the next day with the second new ball available we will be able to get the required grip from the surface.
“The pitch at Abu Dhabi helped the batsmen in the first four days, it was only on the fifth day that it began helping the spinners, but here the ball began to spin from day two and by the time we came to the fifth day we knew the runs we had on the board was sufficient to get Pakistan out,” said Perera who went through a tough series against India at home.
“I came here with a plan because against India I did not have the right rhythm. I did a few adjustments to my bowling that’s how I was successful in this series. I also gained confidence because I was able to contribute with the bat as well,” said Perera.
“I only bowl the off break but my biggest plus factor is that I am able to vary my deliveries and also bowl the arm ball which goes away from the batsman. The key to my wicket taking is the off spinner that drifts,” he said.
Perera who is not part of the Sri Lanka one-day squad will return home to prepare for next month’s three Test series in India.
“We have the Mercantile one-day tournament to prepare for India. I am concentrating on the three tests with India. I think I can perform better than I did against them in the last series if I can produce this same form,” he said.
