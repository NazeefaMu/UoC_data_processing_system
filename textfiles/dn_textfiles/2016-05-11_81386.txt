Mubeen dominated the game from the beginning and won the first three frames in a row with a top break of 51 in the third frame. Noor bounced back to win the fourth frame, but could not pose a threat to the defending champion as Mubeen sealed victory by winning the fifth frame with ease.

The semis were played in the best of five frames and the final was decided on the best of seven frames. The consolation final for third place, which is a three-frame affair was won by Army's M. Sherifdeen who beat M. M. Rikas of Moors SC by two frames to one (25/31, 44/31, 48/25).
With their performance at this tournament, M.M. Mubeen and Riyaz Noor will qualify to represent Sri Lanka at the Asian Six Red and Team Championship in Abu Dhabi, UAE from May 18 to 26.
