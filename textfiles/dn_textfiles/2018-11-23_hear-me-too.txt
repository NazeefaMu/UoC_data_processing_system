November 25 is International day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
Hear me too

Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread and devastating human rights violations currently. It also remains largely unreported due to the stigma and shame surrounding it.
Violence against women continues to be an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace. In Sri Lanka, during the past few decades, communities both in the North and the East were exposed to several stresses, natural and man-made and the entire population was exposed to widespread trauma and losses to both human lives and infrastructure.
Mostly women were affected by the traumatic events and violence that occurred in such instances exposing them to grief and distress, as well as a variety of other psychological problems. This has left an impact, not only on the individual, but also on the family, community and society.
Adverse Impact
“If the trauma and losses are not addressed, it can impact families and societies, causing changes at the family, community and societal levels. The detrimental repercussions of these events are visible in almost all aspects of trauma survivors’ lives; family relations, education, health, social identity, civic constructs, etc. The effects of traumatic incidents, such as frustration, feeling helpless, displacement, and loss of traditional roles, increase the incidents of psychosocial problems within the communities,” Family Rehabilitaion Centre’s Clinical Psychologist, Anagi Gunasekara said.
She points out that according to the National Institute of Mental Health statistics, one out of five persons in Sri Lanka suffers from a mental health problem, out of which only 20 per cent receive services.
“The consequences of trauma and problems created by the rapid change within communities, causes people psychological problems such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep difficulties, emotional distress, suicide attempts, low self-esteem, prolonged grief due to bereavement, and demoralization. People who display such symptoms further suffer from social isolation, an inability to find work, loss of income and an inability to care for their children and family. Such conditions further increase issues like domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcohol addiction and the behavioral and emotional disturbance,” Gunasekara explained.

Since its inception, Family Rehabilitation Centre has been committed to constantly assessing and improving the quality of services providing physical and psychological relief and rehabilitation, including livelihood support and basic needs to the victims of torture and trauma, while increasing its coverage.
“Through FRC we are able to take measures to address people’s other needs such as medical treatment, legal services, vocational training etc. through the referral system while providing psychological assistance. We are mostly present in North and we have a minor presence Kalutara District. FRC currently implements two core programmes. The Trauma Rehabilitation Programme delivers services and implements activities, with the purpose of providing holistic treatment and care to those who have been affected by trauma. Under the Trauma Prevention Programme, FRC lobbies, decision makers, and decision making institutions and organizations, and conducts advocacy campaigns aimed at preventing trauma in Sri Lanka,” Gunasekara added.
Tackling trauma
FRC’s psychologist, Harithra Chandrasehar said FRC currently has offices established in the Colombo, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Manner and Vavuniya Districts in Sri Lanka, implementing long-term programmes to provide holistic treatment and care for those who have been affected by trauma, prevent trauma and increase capacity of different stake holders including communities on Mental Health and Psychosocial Services (MHPSS).
“The Family Rehabilitation Centre (FRC) is a humanitarian, non-profit, non-governmental organization, registered in August 1992. It is an independent organization with its own Memorandum and Articles of Association and is incorporated under Section 21 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. Through the organization we hope to effectively address and prevent trauma in Sri Lanka. Using this vision and broad framework, FRC is focusing its work on three specific spheres in the psychosocial field: Rehabilitation for trauma survivors, prevention of trauma and (re) victimization of trauma survivors and capacity building for relevant stakeholders,” Chandrasehar explained.

She added that their services are offered to survivors of gender based violence, survivors of domestic violence, sexual violence, trauma survivors, torture victims, widows and widowers affected by trauma, internally displaced persons affected by war, migrant workers affected by trauma, survivors of natural disasters, women and men who have been disabled as a result of trauma.
“We offer them counseling and psychosocial support and raise awareness on psychosocial wellbeing, training and capacity building and advocacy. In Sri Lanka, the impact of facing mental health problems is exacerbated by social and cultural norms that deter survivors of trauma from openly discussing their condition or seeking treatment due to stigmatization. Vulnerable communities need greater awareness about trauma, causes of trauma, psychological/ behavioural changes due to trauma and services available to them. Lack of resources and expertise in treating people affected by trauma, limited awareness about mental health issues prevalent in communities and lack of livelihood opportunities are the constrains that need to be overcome to ensure holistic care,” she added.
Forum Theatre Performances
Chandrasehar said that the organization had the first phase of its walk `Path to Healing’ to raise awareness on mental wellbeing. “The first phase was from Mannar to Vavuniya and the next will take place early February from Vavuniya to Mulativ while the final phase will be from Mulativ to Jaffna end of next year,” she said.
Meanwhile FRC in collaboration with the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka and Act4: Theatre for Change conducted several forum theatre performances in the North Central and Eastern provinces.
“The performances are part of an innovative approach to creating community awareness on the legal rights and responsibilities of citizens in upholding human dignity, and the need for rehabilitating survivors of trauma. The significant number of participants at the performances included local residents of communities in the areas as well as civil society representatives and representatives from the Human Rights Commission and The Legal Aid Commission. It was encouraging to note the enthusiasm and appreciation of participants in all locations at which the performances took place,” Chandrasehar added.Global Action: Orange the World
United Nation (UN) has designated the 25th of every month as Orange Day by the UN Women campaign Say No, UNiTE launched in 2009 to mobilize civil society, activists, governments and the UN system in order amplify the impact of the UN Secretary-General’s campaign, UNiTE to End Violence against Women. Participants the world over are encouraged to wear a touch of orange in solidarity with the cause - the colour symbolizes a brighter future and a world free from violence against women and girls.This year, the International day for the Elimination of Violence against Women will be on November 25, and the theme is Orange the World: #HearMeToo and like previous editions, the date marks the launch of 16 days of activism that will conclude on December 10, International Human Rights Day.
A host of public events are being coordinated, among which iconic buildings and landmarks will be ‘oranged’ to recall the need for a violence-free future.
UN says the adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of violence against women and children, affect women at all stages of their life. For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls; down the line they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market.
While gender-based violence can happen to anyone, anywhere, some women and girls are particularly vulnerable - for instance, young girls and older women, women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, migrants and refugees, indigenous women and ethnic minorities, or women and girls living with HIV and disabilities, and those living through humanitarian crises.
