Cabinet approval to erect antennae to increase mobile network coverage

Cabinet approval has been granted to erect antennae on the roofs of buildings in strategic places in Colombo and other urban areas to increase mobile network coverage around the island.
A proposal submitted to Cabinet on the above subject by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister noted that mobile service providers were having issues in providing full service to all their customers around the island as there was insufficient antennae to cover all areas.
The above proposal with the approval of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority was approved.
