ICTA signs MoU  with FITIS

The ICT Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), the nation’s apex ICT Institution under the Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure, recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federation of IT Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) the Apex ICT Industry Association in Sri Lanka.
ICTA’s partnership with FITIS on Smart Social Circle is yet another initiative to push the ICT industry to greater heights.
Expressing her views on this new alliance, Chitranganie Mubarak said, “As the apex body for driving ICT development in the country it is incumbent on us to ensure that the benefits of ICT development reaches all sections of our society.”
“It is only then we can talk of being digitally inclusive. ICTA launched the Smart Social Circle Initiative last year and its outreach and scope has exceeded our expectations. But this is not something we can sustain and drive on our own.”
“We need partners, strong committed partners, and FITIS as the largest industry body in this domain is well equipped to take up this role. ICTA’s association with FITIS goes back many years and the MOU we have signed today only strengthens our commitment to jointly ensure that Sri Lanka forges forward towards a Digital Economy which is beneficial to all sections of our society.”
ICTA’s objective is to create an islandwide network of SMART social circles with knowledgeable, experienced and responsive citizens through the effective use of emerging digital technologies and social media. For this purpose, they expect to develop 860 SMART Social Circles in 860 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions in all 25 districts during 2017.
SMART Social Circle is a community which consists of representatives from villages, members of community organizations, school children, housewives, small and medium scale enterprises, social activists, and charitable organizations.
A minimum of 10 competent knowledge agents will get selected from each GN division including government officials work at the grassroots and members from the community and get trained on effective use of digital technologies and applications.
“This is a historic occasion for Sri Lanka's ICT industry. FITIS and ICTA have been working very closely for several industry development initiatives and we jointly conduct several programs very successfully. Joining with ICTA for an important initiative like ‘Smart Circle’ will benefit the country in massive way.”
“From this joint initiative, FITIS and ICTA expect to promote active partnership among citizens to organize, integrate and provide user-friendly online information and services, build networks among entrepreneurs, administrators, activists, educators, and innovators,” said Dr Kithsiri Manchanayakke, Chairman, FITIS.
