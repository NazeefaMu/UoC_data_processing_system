NCPA requests public help regarding affcted children

The National Child Protection Authority(NCPA) yesterday requested the public to inform the Authority or other relevant government organisations about children who have lost their parents or guardians as a result of the floods and landslides.
The NCPA said that obtaining such details at the earliest will help ensure the safety of children, provide viable shelter and arrange for their needs.
In addition to the NCPA officers, the public are advised to provide such details to the nearest police station, government officials in charge of temporary shelters for the displaced, disaster management centre officials, the Grama Sevaka Niladhari, child rights promotion officers, child care and probation officers or to the ‘ChildLine’ Hotline : 1929.
