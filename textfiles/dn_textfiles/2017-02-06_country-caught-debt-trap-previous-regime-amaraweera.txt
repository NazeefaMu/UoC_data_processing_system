Country caught in debt trap by previous regime: Amaraweera

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the country was caught in a debt trap by the previous regime and he was also a minister of the government that rules the country now.
“We cannot abstain from settling these loans as a responsible government," he said.
He was addressing the gathering at the 69th independence day celebrations in Hambantota opposite the Hambantota International Convention Center. The State Fisheries Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi also participated.
The minister said Rs. 9,90,000 billions has to be repaid as a result of constructing the sea port and other mega projects in Hambantota and that every child born in future and is living now is indebted to Rs. four lakhs each.
The minister said a country like Sri Lanka cannot march forward under such circumstances and added that mighty plans had been drawn under the intiative of the President and the Prime Minister to launch programmes to strengthen the economy. Investors around the globe were invited to set up industrial and service projects in Hambantota and provide jobless youth with jobs.
Amaraweera said false rumours spread like wildfire that 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota would be given to Chinese investors and that ten lakhs of Chinese people would arrive at Hambantota and that Chinese colonies would be set up.
"Those who spread such rumours are dead against the youth in the area," he said. The minister said another rumour was that traditional dwellers in Hambantota would be evacuated and that the temples would be dismantled.
A regime dedicated to safeguard Buddhism will ever do it? he queried. Hambantota District Secretary W.H.K Arunarana, Additional District Secretary Suneth Lochana, heads of Tri-forces and state departments participated.
