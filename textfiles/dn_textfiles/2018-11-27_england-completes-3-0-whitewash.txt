Despite spirited Lankan fightback
England completes 3-0 whitewash

Sri Lanka’s misery was complete at the SSC grounds after tea on the fourth day when they were beaten by 42 runs by England in the third and final Test – a result that gave Joe Root’s men a 3-0 whitewash of the series.
Root became only the third visiting captain to win a Test series by a 3-0 margin after Ricky Ponting of Australia in 2004 and Virat Kohli of India in 2017.
Chasing a target of 327 Sri Lanka were eventually dismissed for 284 in the fourth ball after tea to spark of celebrations from the England camp and the players in the middle. It was a well-deserved series win for Root’s men for the way they outplayed Sri Lanka in all three departments.
There were moments yesterday when Sri Lanka looked like turning the game in their favour but each time England found a way to get back.
After losing nightwatchman Lakshan Sandakan in the tenth over of the morning, Sri Lanka deprived England of a breakthrough for over two hours when Kusal Mendis and Roshen Silva carried the fight to the opposition with a stand of 100.
The partnership was reaching dangerous proportions with England trying everything they had to separate the two and desperation creeping in as the two batsmen were well set and playing the bowling with ease finding the gaps and picking up the runs with the odd boundary whenever there was a loose ball.
Then out of the blues came a breakthrough for England in the most unlikely manner – a run out.
Mendis who had been batting brilliantly and looked well set for a century was unfortunately run out going for a second run by a direct hit from Jack Leach at backward square leg.
It was a cruel blow and it only proved how things have worked out for England in their favour right throughout the series. That run out brought England back into the game and despite a late resistance from the tail there was never any doubt of a win.
Mendis departed with his head bowed for 86 scored off 129 balls with a six and eight fours to his name in what was his best performance of the series.
Niroshan Dickwella (19) and Dilruwan Perera (5) didn’t last long – both out to the brilliance of Keaton Jennings at short leg.
When Roshen Silva’s 190-minute vigilance was ended at 65 falling lbw to Moeen Ali, the writing was on the wall for Sri Lanka who at the time still required 101 for victory with the last pair at the wicket.
But Malinda Pushpakumara injected life into the chase with a career best knock of 42 not out of 40 balls (6 fours, 1 six) and indulged in a last wicket partnership of 58 off 75 balls with stand-in skipper Suranga Lakmal that saw an extended afternoon session by half an hour. However the partnership was too good to last and off the fourth ball after tea Leach trapped Lakmal lbw for 11 to bring an end to the match.
Leach and Ali shared eight wickets in the match and took 18 wickets apiece in the series with Adil Rashid contributing with 12 to complete England’s dominance with spin in the three Tests.
Jonny Bairstow who scored a century (110) in his first match of the series was named Player of the Match and Ben Foakes who replaced him as wicket-keeper for the series when he got injured took the Player of the Series award with some outstanding contributions with the bat (277 runs) and gloves (10 dismissals).
England head for home having won the Test series (3-0), ODI series (3-1) and the one-off T20I.
