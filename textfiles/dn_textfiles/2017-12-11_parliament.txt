PARLIAMENT

PM promises safe and secure future for all
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a safe and secure country would be ensured for all, especially the younger generation to forge ahead without fear.
The Prime Minister was speaking in Parliament on Saturday.
He said so, during the ceremony to accept the initial payment of $300 million by China Merchant, in handing over of the Hambantota Port.
He said that this was the first time that such a large sum has been received into the country’s monetary reserve, while this sum would be placed as a fixed deposit in the country’s special monetary reserve. Accordingly, the cheque was handed over to the Ministry Secretary.
The ceremony was attended by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Strategic Development Minister Malik Samaraweera, Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe and Sarath Amunugama, Port s Authority Chairman and several Chinese Government members and representatives of the China Merchant.
The Prime Minister noted that the Hambantota Harbour would be developed into a thriving harbour without burdening the country, adding that the $300 million was only an initial payment the country had received. He said that through this investment, the government aimed to develop the harbour without leaving not only the present generation, but also future generations of the debt burden.
“No matter how much criticism is levelled to the government with regard to the Hambantota deal, this is a huge profit making venture that is a welcome sign for the debt ridden country,” the Prime Minister noted.
“This is a significant juncture for the country’s economy and the Hambantota Harbour which would be made into a thriving shipping hub under the China Merchant Company and the Ports Authority of Sri Lanka. The Hambantota Harbour was just idling all this time, but under this initiative taken by the government, it would be transformed into a strategic harbour in the Indian Ocean,” the Prime Minister noted.
The Premier said that with the development of the Hambantota Harbour and its surrounding area would also see the development of the Economic zone, Industrial zone, Tourist zone and even the Naval industry. A separate Dock Yard, Cement Factory and Refinery would also be established in the Industrial zone in the vicinity of the Hambantota Harbour.
The Prime Minister said that for the first time in history, the Ruhuna region would witness an economic boost.
Local Govt. Elections Amendment Bill passed
The Local Government Elections Amendment Bill was passed in Parliament on Saturday evening, following the passing of the budget proposal.
The Bill was passed with 137 voting for, while 49 voting against the proposed Amendment Bill. Eight Members of the Parliament abstained from voting.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, commencing the Second Reading debate of the Amendment Bill , said that the reason for the amendment was that there were two technical errors that needed to be corrected.
“The first one is” Minister Musthapha said, “If any party receives less that 25 percent of votes and has three members to be elected that the mandatory requirement of electing a female will not have to be done. However, when I read this at the Bill’s stage, I read it correctly. But in the Sinhala translation, it was not correctly included.” He added that it should be correctly included.
“The second issue relates to multi member votes,” Minister Musthapha said. “As you know there was a policy decision that if a party wins a multi members’ seat, both seats would be awarded to that political party.”
These are errors to be corrected. As the Election Commission needed those errors to be brought about before the election was held. There is an issue with Enderamulla in the Mahara division.
“I have instructed my secretary to solve it too.”
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that the Amendment Act had been issued on November 8, 2017.
This is to correct a mistake which had happened due to a language flaw. This could be done by a resolution in Parliament.
Minister Musthapha said he could not take responsibility for a mistake that he had not done.
“Minister Musthapha asked permission to amend one mistake,” MP Gunawardena said.
“This is wrong and an attempt to include clauses while an election process is in progress. That is not legal and I request that the motion be over ruled.”
Minister Rauf Hakeem said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena had raised a very valuable argument. “This amendment is not Gazetted, so it is wrong,” Minister Hakeem said. “This is against the Constitution.”
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the country was trying a novel method. “Our objective is to hold elections on one day,” the Premier said.
“My point is that what ever law we make, we have to be cautious not to go before Courts. The best way is lets try this out. There could be issues. Later, we could correct the flaws before the Provincial Council election. There is suspicion in the minds of some members. But, when we Gazette the nominations, they would be cleared. We should all get together after the results of the elections and discuss, investigate and take corrective measures concerning the flaws in the act.
Chief Oppostion Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that there were flaws in the Act, since the Sinhala Language translation was different from the English Language translation.
The Attorney General has instructed that it should be corrected by way of an Amendment. The Election Commission Chairman said that he could accept the changes if the Attorney General approved. “So this amendment is a must,” MP Anura Dissanayake said.
However, following the lengthy debate between the Government and Opposition members, the motion was passed at its Second Stage reading following a vote with 146 votes in favour, while 56 voted against. The Third Reading was passed.
Ministry vacancies filled in just manner - Kiriella
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in filling vacancies in institutions under the Higher Education Ministry, it was seen that no injustice was caused to the residents of those areas.
He said this in Parliament on Saturday, in response to an allegation that the government was filling these posts in the North and East with residents of other areas.
The Minister noted that based on the applications received, the applicants were subjected to a written test and interview and the most suitable candidates were selected and given appointments.
Accordingly, 40 vacancies were filled in the Jaffna University, 74 to the Eastern University, 27 to the South Eastern University, to the Road Development Authority, 80 to the North and 151 to the RDA East, according to the Minister.
‘Role of media needs to be re-examined’
Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the media’s responsibility in the development of the country needs to be re-examined and assured that measures would be taken to invest the revenue earned through tele dramas for the betterment of the tele drama industry.
He was speaking in Parliament on Saturday, joining the debate on the expenditure heads of the Ministry of Finance and Media.
The Minister added that the media should ask themselves whether they have identified their responsibility to society and are conducting their operations accordingly.
“The media needs to re-examine themselves and see whether they are carrying out their role in an ethical manner. The need has now arisen to implement certain controls on the media. What we mean by controls is certain not the repression of the media. But, the need has arisen and it is timely that certain boundaries be enforced as certain media programmes are leading to the erosion of our values and encourages myth, which is a stumbling block for the future progress of this country,” he said.
Alagiyawanna said the people have been given the Right to Information and measures have been taken to mitigate the losses incurred by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and Independent Television Network. However, he noted that Telecine is making profits but added that the success of an establishment cannot be measured by profits alone. Media institutions should also be mindful of the task they have to perform. Therefore, the Deputy Minister noted that his ministry intends to introduce quality programmes through the state channels and serve the people better in the future.
He also noted that the SLBC and ANCL were in the process of minimising their losses. But,added that although there were certain regulatory bodies, television programmes are not properly regulated.
“We intend to tax these institutions and utilise these funds for the uplift of the industry. Meanwhile, we need to intervene immediately in the media rating issue. Media reporting is not done practically and it is currently at a low standard. Decisions are taken based on false ratings. Around 95% of state media is covered and as such the government has to intervene in rectifying this situation,” Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna added.
PM will enforce the code of conduct – Eran
Minister Eran Wickremeratne said his party had tabled a Code of Conduct on August 8 this year, which is yet to be passed. But he said he was certain that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would take leadership in seeing the Code of Conduct enforced.
Minister Wickremeratne called on the government to set an example and prove to the masses that the government was working for their welfare.
The Minister was speaking in Parliament yesterday, joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 under the expenditure heads of the Finance and Media Ministry.
With Saturday being the last day of the budget debate, Minister Wickramaratne noted that it was significant as it was also Anti Corruption Day.
“It is incumbent on us that each and every member of the Assembly decide on the course of our nation. Therefore, we must influence the course of our nation. Corruption has been eating into the very fabric of our government institutions and it has caught on deep into the soul of our administrative machinery. It has come to a point where it is difficult to differentiate between a corrupt practice and a usual government business transaction.
Corruption has become a part of our culture. A culture that has replaced the lofty ideals of the nation once held with pride without prejudice. The government that came into power in 2015 was bogged down by the vagaries of politics and corruption, because we inherited an extremely corrupt system, a system that was made a tool by the practitioners of these corrupt practices. Those who held political power made every attempt to turn this into a bottomless pit from which they could steal and plunder the country. But, this culture needs to be dispensed with,” added Minister Wickremaratne.
He pointed out that while the private sector was accountable to its shareholders, the state sector including the government was accountable to the people of this country.
“We are answerable to all our shareholders, the people and in that act of being accountable, we should fulfil our responsibility in a serious manner. No member of this House, be it the Prime Minister or Cabinet members, junior MP or Opposition Members, should be spared of this responsibility, even if the President is not spared of this notion of accountability and answerability. It is where the responsibility lies. A culture that has embraced and desecrated our day-to-day lives,” he said, adding that the government must enforce at least the code of conduct that is applicable to all in Assembly.
“Our shareholders are watching us and they are sick of a prolongation of a corrupt system and they are disaffected by the blatant abuse of power by politicians to such an extent that where every practice of governance hinges on this exercise. Isn’t it a disgusting spectacle that we are all being looked upon as a set of corrupt, greedy merchants because of the behaviour of a few? Hence, we need to change this? This is not an impossible task, but it is a long journey,” he said.
“The people voted for a change. This budget has been proposed to fulfil the economic promises made. The budget is focused on a better tomorrow, which has paid greater consideration to the low income groups. Prior to the budget, we reduced the price of many essential commodities. We have also made the ‘DIMO Batta’ more affordable by reducing its price by Rs. 300,000.”
He said unlike the previous government, the good governance government had generated 300,000 jobs in 2015. “These are real jobs. Unlike the previous regime, we will not simply provide jobs during election time alone. This is a journey and we have laid the foundation for a strong future.”
The Minister said that the most valuable asset the country has is its youth and the government has increased allocations for youth activities.
“We intend to provide our children higher education as we don’t want to create a culture of slaves to be sent to the Middle East,” he said.
Constitutional Assembly convenes today
The Constitutional Assembly will convene today (11). The assembly will debate the interim report on the proposed new constitution submitted by the constitutional steering committee. National Co-existence,Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganeshan said the debate will be held to hear arguments presented by members who are yet to speak on the report.
