Livelihood supports for low-income families in Anuradhapura

Livelihood support will be offered to 57,898 labour families who were affected by the prevailing drought, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake said
Each family will be provided with a bag of 50 kg basmathi rice for working seven days at a drought relief work site. The Disaster Management Ministry has provided the rice stock. It is an outright gift from the Pakistan Government.
He said 25 kilos of rice will be provided when a householder falls sick. Aged or disabled householders will also receive the offer. They have to engage in small work at the worksite such as renovating small tanks, repairing farm roads, and rural public buildings among others.
Anuradhapura District Disaster Management Officer Rasika Liyanagamage said 62,809 bags of rice were received in this regard.
