Present Agreement with Singapore to Parliament – JVP MP

The foreign trade agreement with Singapore has many flaws and therefore it should be presented, debated and defeated in the Parliament, stated JVP MP Wasantha Samarasinghe at a press briefing yesterday.
According to the MP, the anti dumping and countervailing act was passed in March 2018 while the agreement was signed on January 2018. “The agreement had a segment on the anti dumping and countervailing Act which was not passed back then. Nevertheless, the agreement was signed even though the Act wasn’t passed,” MP Wasantha stated.
The MP also said that the agreement has an indefinite clause which prevents the termination of this agreement.
If the government decide to terminate this agreement, the Singaporean businessmen can lodge complains to the Industrial Dispute Settlement Court.
“Therefore, this agreement should be presented in the Parliament.
It then should be debated and defeated if we are to protect the local economy,” MP Wasantha said.
