Students bring practical solution to garbage issue

Students of Kandana Nursing Training School (NTS) have come up with a practical solution for the garbage issue of the ‘Podi Vee Kumbura’ Village in Ragama.
The students of the 2015-B Group have selected the issue of garbage disposal as an unsolved problem of the Podi Vee Kumbura as the project of their studies. They have set up compost bins in different places in the village.
They have also set up eight barrels at different places in the village for seperation of degradable and non degradable garbage. The road sides of the village were cleaned by the students and the villagers. The students made the Prasansaramaya Temple of the village as the centre of the project and summoned the villagers there with the assistance of the village church and the Grama Niladari.
Public Health Inspectors, the Police and environmentalists also helped make this project a success. The students had collected funds for this project by selling greeting cards prepared by themselves.
The students received a treat fron the villagers for initiating a project which greatly benefitted the village. The village consists of 5,986 villagers.
