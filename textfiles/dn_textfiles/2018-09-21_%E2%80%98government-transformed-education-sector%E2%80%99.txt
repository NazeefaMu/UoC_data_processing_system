‘Government transformed education sector’

The government had transformed the education sector for the benefit of future generations, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a gathering during a recent inauguration ceremony of a two-storeyed building at the Mahanaga Vidyalaya in Angunakolapelessa.
The building had been set up at a cost of Rs.15.1 million and 1,700 students would benefit from it, he said, and added that students should be nurtured as they were an asset to the country.
Highlighting drug addiction, Minister Amaraweera urged parents and teachers to be vigilant about their children.
He said that a programme would soon be launched to grow fruits in schools.
