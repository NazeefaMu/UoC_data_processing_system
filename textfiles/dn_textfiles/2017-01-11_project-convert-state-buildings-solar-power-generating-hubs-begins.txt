Project to convert state buildings into  solar power generating hubs begins

The inaugural ceremony of the national project to convert all State sector buildings into solar power generating centers within two years was officially held at the Ministry of Finance yesterrday.
The project was launched following a proposal by Budget 2017.The project will be implemented under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena's “Beginning of third Year of a Sustainable Era”, and the Prime Minister's concept to build a powerful Sri Lanka under his “Economic Policy Statement”.

The first solar power generating scheme under this project was fixed in the Finance Ministry building.Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake inaugurated the project.
Minister Karunanayake said converting current expensive power sources into new energy sources through conserving environment is a turning point of the ongoing rapid development agenda. He pointed out that introducing solar power will help the government to manage its cost factor specially in repaying the existing colossal debts.
He said the Finance Ministry expects to cut its monthly electricity bill by Rs.200,000 accordingly.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake further said: “A huge amount of debt had borrowed haphazardly when we took over the government on January 8, 2015. As a government, we found two methods to come out from this colossal debt trap. One is to leave them as they were and continue our activities.
The second remedy is to go ahead by minimizing public costs, managing the economy and look for new sources of revenue.
We have been implementing the best remedial measures. The national project that we inaugurated today will protect environment on one hand and, on the other hand, it will convert the current expensive energy sources into cheap solar system thereby cutting the state sector energy costs.

Therefore we believe that all will extend their support to make this venture a success. Our aim is to set up solar panels on all state buildings by 2019 to enable them to meet their electricity demand by solar power”.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said economic development and environment conservation cannot be separated as both are of paramount importance.
He said that it was welcoming sign that the Finance Ministry inaugurated such a program of national importance.
