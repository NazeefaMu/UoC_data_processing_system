Buttler optimistic despite India’s strong reply

MUMBAI, Frida: Jos Buttler believes England are in a strong position despite India’s impressive start to their innings on the second day of the fourth Test in Mumbai on Friday.
The right-handed batsman notched a splendid 76 at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium to propel England to a commanding first innings score of 400 before India finished day two at 146 for one.
India started their reply positively with Murali Vijay hitting an unbeaten 70 and Cheteshwar Pujara batting on 47 as the pair recorded the highest partnership of the Test so far with 107.
However, Buttler insisted England had the upper hand.
“Those two guys (Vijay and Pujara) played very well for India but we still lead by 250,” the 26-year-old told reporters.
“If we can be a bit more consistent and when we build the pressure there’s definitely wicket-taking balls on that surface.” Buttler has only recently returned to the England Test side after a year out but said he’d benefited from some thinking time during his spell on the sidelines.
Middle-order batsman Buttler was a late call-up for the third Test in Mohali, having last played for England in October 2015.
Buttler started the day on 18, reaching 64 at lunch as England put on 385-8 in a Test that they must win to keep the five-match series alive. He outlasted Ben Stokes, who became Ravichandran Ashwin’s fifth scalp of the innings when India successfully appealed a not out decision.
The left-hander was dismissed for 31 when the TV umpire ruled that the ball had nicked his bat before dropping into the hands of Virat Kohli.
Ashwin’s fellow spinner Ravindra Jadeja then grabbed the wickets of Chris Woakes (11), who was caught behind by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, and Adil Rashid, who made only four.
Ashwin took his wicket haul to six when Jake Ball was caught on 31. Jadeja then grabbed his fourth wicket of the innings by bowling Buttler.
