Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commissioned the US$ 50 million ATG Hand Care (Pvt) Ltd facility in Koggala on Friday.
The operations in the Koggala factory commenced recently and over 4,000 people will get employment in the factory in the first phase.
ATG Ceylon (Pvt) Ltd is an I.S.O. 9001 and 14001 accredited British Industrial Glove Manufacturing Group with factories at the Katunayake, Wathupitiwala and the US$ 50 mn ATG Hand Care(Pvt) Ltd facility in the Koggala Investment Promotion Zone is the latest addition to the Group.
ATG commenced its operations with the parent company ATG Ceylon (Pvt) Ltd incorporated in 1992 and was in the verge of completing 25 years next February. Since 2005 there was a rapid growth and in 2007 expanded to two more factories ATG Occupational (Pvt) Ltd which is located in the Katunayaka Zone and ATG Gloves Knitting (Pvt) Ltd located in Wathupitiwala which is also the largest single unit knitting factory in South East Asia.
In 2014 the agreement was signed with BOI to commence the Koggala factory in a 12 acre land which is apparently the largest factory in the Koggala Investment Promotion Zone with a US$ 50 investment.
Sudath Fernando ATG Group Finance Director said that they have already started one plant and plans to install another nine plants and all plants will be operative by 2018 onwards.
Fernando said ATG industrial gloves were rated as one of the best in the world and also holds patent rights for some of their gloves.
