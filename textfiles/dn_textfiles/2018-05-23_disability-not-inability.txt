Disability, not an inability

Disabled people with extraordinary talents succeed and contribute to the world economy every day. Imagine the world of science without Stephen Hawking. The Olympics without Tanni Grey Thompson. And the horrendous thought of television without Stephen Fry.
Many unemployed people with health challenges and disabilities face complex barriers that they must overcome to be successful in their search for work. But for many people with disabilities, the main thing they have in common with these heroes, is a strength of character and determination to succeed.
Diri Daru Piyasa is a project started in 2003 by the educationist and the renowned artist Miranda Hemalatha as a result of a very successful experiment done during the previous four years between 2000 and 2003 to develop the children with Down Syndrome.
The project trains dancing and music to develop their psychomotor skills and then started doing various activities to develop their language and other basic skills. About 60 children with Down Syndrome are being trained by the project. A dancing concert that comprises their talents was held recently at Buddhist Cultural Centre.
