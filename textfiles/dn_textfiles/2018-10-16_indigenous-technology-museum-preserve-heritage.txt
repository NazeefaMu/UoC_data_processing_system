Indigenous technology museum to preserve heritage

President Maithripala Sirisena inspected the construction site on an indigenous technology museum in Polonnaruwa, on Sunday.
This is the first such museum which will showcase indigenous technology of the last 150 years. This museum will also highlight the significant milestones of state patronage through the ages. This museum will have a modern auditorium and an observation cabin as well.
The purpose of the museum is for local and foreign tourists and students to obtain an understanding of the country’s technology history and traditions. The physical construction of the museum is almost complete, while procedures regarding artifacts have already been taken.
The President also inspected the construction site of a kidney hospital in Polonnaruwa, built with a donation from the Chinese government. This hospital will be the largest kidney hospital in South Asia and was initiated by President Sirisena.
Due to recent media reports on irregular excavation in Manampitiya, the President inspected the area and directed officials to take immediate steps to prevent such irregularities.
National Museums Department Director Thanuja Kasturiarachchi, Sri Lanka Telecom Chairman Kumarasiri Sirisena and other officials were present at this event.
The President inspected the construction work on the new bus stop in Polonnruwa under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa district development programme.
President Sirisena also addressed the grievances of the people in the area during his recent visit to Polonnaruwa.
