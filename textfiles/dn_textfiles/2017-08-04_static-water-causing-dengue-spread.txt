Static water causing dengue spread

The Addalaichenai Konawatta River is blocked by shrub jungles. The Konawatta River joins the sea from Akkaraipattu division.
The river speeds up the flow of water from drainages of paddy fields on the western side.
The river has become an environmental hazard as garbage and dirty water from nearby hotels and houses are directed to the river.
Residents urge authorities to look into the matter immediately as dengue is raising its heads again in the area. They request to clean up the shrubs.
Residents say that this river has not been clean for the past several years. It comes under the purview of the Akkaraipattu Regional Irrigation Engineer.
The people urge the Irrigation Department Authority to protect the Konawatta environment.
