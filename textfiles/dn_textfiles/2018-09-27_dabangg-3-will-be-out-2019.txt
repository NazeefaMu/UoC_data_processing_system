‘How to Train Your  Dragon 3’   will end the  franchise
The ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ franchise is sadly coming to an end after three movies. ‘How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World’, which hits cinemas early next year, will be the last in the series, writer and director Dean DeBlois has confirmed.
“We thought about it for a long time and came up with what we think is a bittersweet way to say goodbye to these characters, but the right way,” DeBlois told Entertainment Weekly.
The film’s first trailer dropped back in June and featured Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) having fulfilled his dream of creating a peaceful Viking-Dragon utopia. But the trailer also heard him say, “There were dragons when I was a boy,” a statement which DeBlois says fans will understand once they watch the film.
“You will understand why Hiccup says [that],” DeBlois said.
“And by the end of this film, you’ll have answered the question of what could have happened to them.”
The end of the film franchise also means the end for Netflix series DreamWorks Dragons, which released its eighth season in February.
‘How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World’ also stars Cate Blanchett, Jonah Hill, Kit Harington, America Ferrera, Kristen Wiig, T.J. Miller, Gerard Butler and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.
