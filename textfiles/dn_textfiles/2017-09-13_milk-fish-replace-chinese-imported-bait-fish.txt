Milk fish to replace Chinese-imported bait fish

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to promote milk fish (Chanos Chanos), known in Sinhala as Wekkaya, as an alternative for bait fish imported from China.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has directed relevant officials to provide relief for those who are willing to breed this local fish variety as an alternative for the Chinese bait fish variety.
The Minister said that the price of Chinese-imported cuttlefish used as bait has increased rapidly during the past few months.
“Though fishermen made a request to reduce the price, the ministry cannot do that as no tax has been imposed on this Chinese bait fish variety,” said the minister.
According to that, the ministry has decided to provide a financial assistance of Rs. 500,000 and lands for them. Measures have also been taken to provide loans at concessionary rates through a State bank. The Minister said that a land from Balapitiya close to Madu Ganga and another land from Chilaw have already been identified as suitable lands for breeding this bait fish.
The Ministry has also decided to give priority to the fisher community when they select beneficiaries with the intention of enhancing their living standards.” said the Minister.
