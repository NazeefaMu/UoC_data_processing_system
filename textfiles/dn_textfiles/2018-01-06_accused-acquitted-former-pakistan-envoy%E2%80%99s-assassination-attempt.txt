Accused acquitted in former Pakistan envoy’s assassination attempt

A trishaw owner arrested and indicted in connection with the assassination attempt of former Pakistani High Commissioner in 2006, was yesterday acquitted and released from the case by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judegment against the accused Balakrishnan Balasundaran Manoharan, the High Court Judge observed that the prosecutors have failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused, a trishaw owner, was arrested on the charges of conspiring to commit this offence by providing a trishaw to carry out a claymore bomb blast targeting the Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bashir Wali Mohamed at Kollupitiya on August 14, 2006.
The accused, Balakrishnan Balasundaran Manoharan, was arrested by an Immigration and Emigration official when arriving in the country on August 29, 2012. He had been charged under the provisions of Prevention of Terrorist Act (PTA). On August 14, 2006, a convoy carrying the Pakistani High Commissioner was attacked with a claymore mine. The High Commissioner escaped unhurt. However, seven people including four Army commandoes were killed and several persons were injured in the blast.
