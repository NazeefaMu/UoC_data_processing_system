Jelly nails are the big new summer beauty trend

There's a wonderful feeling that comes after getting your nails done. Not only have you just been pampered, but you look fabulous - and you know it.
But when it comes to manicure trends of late, we've certainly had some weird ones and they just weren't worth it. From miniature combs you could brush your hair with, to nails that looked like teeth. It seems people will quite literally put anything on their finger nails.
But finally there's a new trend that we're a little more willing to get on board with.
And it looks set to be a big beauty hit this summer. We're talking of course about jelly nails.
The bright, eye-catching look has become a big hit on Instagram, with many people opting to try the style in neon hues.Similar to the jelly shoes and jelly backpacks that were popular with youngsters in the 1990s, the jelly nails are slightly transparent.
They're also known as 'glass nails' because of the transparency.
The jelly nails are being done in all shapes and sizes, with some going all out to have long pointed claws and others opting for a more sleek, square look.
To get the look for yourself simply ask your nail technician to add a clear tip to your nails or use clear gel to sculpt the extension. But be warned that not every salon may stock the right tools or gels needed to recreate the cool manicure.
Some people have also been adding stickers and glitter to their jelly manicures to create interesting effects. People on social media are big fans of the look, with more than 3,500 posts cropping up under the jelly nails hashtag.
