Indian spiritual leader prays for SL

Once the Sri Aekadasa Ruthra Velvi Yagam is over, there will be a change in the political climate in the country, said Indian spiritual leader Annai Siddhar Shri Subramanian Rajakumar Guruji.
He was speaking on the final day of the ritual yesterday, at Kaluthavalai Suyambu Linga Pillaiyar Temple, Batticaloa.
He said he performed the ritual for unity and harmony in the country. This ritual is being conducted for the whole country and not for any particular race or religion.
The ritual will definitely bear fruit and all the people will benefit, he said.
