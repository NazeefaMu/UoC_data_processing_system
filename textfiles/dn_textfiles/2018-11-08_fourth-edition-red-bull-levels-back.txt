Fourth edition of Red Bull Levels is back

Hailed as one of the toughest obstacle courses, Red Bull Levels returns to Sri Lanka for its 4th edition. With three successful events held in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 this ultimate test of body and mind returns to the Southern Coastal city of Bentota on the November 24 at the Avani Resort, Bentota.
Red Bull Levels is an obstacle course that brings together two of Sri Lanka’s ancient trades – stilt fishing and toddy tapping into one obstacle course that challenges one’s strength, grit, stamina and team work. More than 800 dare-devils in teams of four will descend upon Bentota to participate in the 4th edition of this event, which will feature an entirely new and updated course.
“Red Bull Levels is a unique competition. It makes teams work together more than ever before, while still testing your personal challenges people have come to expect from Red Bull events, “said R.D.S Surf School, defending champions of Red Bull Levels 2017.
“The team strategy you come in with paired with the crashing waves, the challenge of stilt fishing and the unforgiving strength needed to balance on the tightrope is something that you just cannot understand. It’s exhilarating”.
This year, competitors will have until November 23 to register their teams and compete for the total prize pool worth Rs. 500,000. Teams will qualify to the next round based on intense timed-knockout elimination.
Registration for Red Bull Levels is now open for all those ready to take on challenge. To register for Red Bull Levels, sign up at www.levels2018.com and follow all the action on Facebook at the Red Bull Levels 2018 event page.
