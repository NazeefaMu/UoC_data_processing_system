President highlights need for river conservation

President Maithripala Sirisena stressed the importance of a comprehensive programme on river conservation, when he met the representatives of the World Bank at the Presidential Secretariat, on Thursday.
He said the river system in the country faces the challenge of erosion on shores.
President Sirisena said from the centre of the country, 103 rivers flow into the sea and Mahaweli River is the largest river. However, due to the lack of a proper programme for the conservation of rivers and the lack of a dedicated institution, Mahaweli and other rivers have been severely challenged. He said all responsible stakeholders should pay urgent attention to this.
The President appreciated the assistance provided by the World Bank for development activities in Sri Lanka.
He said the assistance provided to Sri Lanka by the World Bank is expected in the future too, as a responsible stakeholder in the development journey of Sri Lanka.
Recalling the challenges faced by Sri Lanka and other countries as a result of climate change due to global warming, the President said even though drought and floods are not a novel experience to Sri Lanka, during the past few years, the country faced a disastrous situation unlike in the past.
President Sirisena expressed gratitude for the contribution provided by various projects under World Bank funds.
He discussed the progress of the dam safety and water resources planning project under World Bank assistance and added that the World Bank's support towards new transformations in the field of water management is also expected in the future too.
President Sirisena said the government is giving priority to agriculture, irrigation and power, while the main emphasis is on renewable energy sources.
He said whatever the investments that flow in, the country has kept faith in an economy based on agriculture.
Secretary to the Mahaweli and Environment Ministry Anura Dissanayake and other officials were present.
