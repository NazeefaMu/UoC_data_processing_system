Horse spa pampers ponies

Look, we know life can be a bit hectic at times, but have you ever spared a thought a thought for the horses among us?
Don’t even try telling me you’re stressed before you’ve been ridden around a paddock, transported down the M1 in a horsebox or had shoes nailed to your feet.
Come back to me when you’ve dealt with a mild Polo addiction. If you think you deserve a luxe spa experience, then your nearest horse certainly does.
Frazzled horses should get themselves to Emma Massingale’s home in Holsworth, North Devon, after she set up a spa for her ponies in her back garden.
The 35-year-old professional horse trainer decided to treat her animals after the recent heatwave left them feeling hot and bothered.
Albert and Ernie were treated to a mud mask and clay mask (complete with cooling cucumbers for their eyes), as well as a curl and set blow dry, a hot stone massage and a refreshing dip in the hot tub.
They even had their hooves painted with special animal-friendly clear varnish.
“The weather has been so hot for them recently and I haven’t been able to do their normal training so I thought, what can I do with them that they will enjoy,’ explains Emma, of her DIY spa. That’s when I came up with the spa idea. They were absolutely loving it. I gave Ernie a clay mask and Albert a mud mask, horses love rolling around in mud so it was just an extension of that really. Although I did have to cut the cucumbers lengthways, so they were big enough for their eyes. I left the stones out in the sun to warm them up and they just lay there for ages enjoying it,” says Emma.
“Funnily enough the curlers did actually leave a nice wave in their manes too. A few people have asked how you get a horse into a hot tub, but I just asked Ernie to jump in and he did,” Emma continues.
“The only problem was he enjoyed it so much he wouldn’t get out. I had to just get in there with him.”
As well as making ponies feel pretty, Emma also works with troubled horses and is the first British person to have developed a language that is so well understood by horses that she can communicate with herds at any time, and carry out complex exercises and manoeuvres working as a team.
“Any time spent with an animal interacting like that and doing something they enjoy is beneficial,” she says.
“It’s all about building relationships and they loved every second. I have had horses all my life, my godmother gave me my first pony at six months old, a welsh mountain pony called Minnie. Like many young girls I started riding before I could walk.”
