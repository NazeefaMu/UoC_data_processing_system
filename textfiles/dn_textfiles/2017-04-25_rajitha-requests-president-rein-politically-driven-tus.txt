Rajitha requests President to rein in politically driven TUs

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take action against politically driven trade unions which interrupt people’s supplies, and deploy armed forces to carry out services, Health Ministry sources said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne requested the President to deploy armed forces to supply fuel. The minister said trade unions should not put 21 million people in difficulties through trade union actions.
“It is good if oil tans in Trincomalee can generate an income. It is the same at the Hambantota harbour. They should generate an income. Trade unions cannot be allowed to rule the country,” the minister said.
Some trade unions use oil tanks to topple the government. Sections which cannot come into power through elections try to use other methods to topple the government. It was the former President who expressed the willingness to hand over oil tanks to India, he said.
