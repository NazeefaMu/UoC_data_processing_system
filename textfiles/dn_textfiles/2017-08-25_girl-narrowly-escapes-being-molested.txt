Girl narrowly escapes from being molested

A teenage girl bathing in a stream near her house had managed to save herself from a sadist who tried to outrage her modesty by capping the man with the bucket she was using and running back home in her bathing cloth, a report from a village in Kuruwita said.
According to the report, the girl used to be accompanied by her mother when she went to the stream for a bath. But, on this day she had gone for a bath on her own since the mother was preoccupied with some other family chore.
Since there was a high tide in the stream due to the rainy weather she had used a bucket to bath standing on the embankment.
Suddenly a man had appeared on the scene, whom she chose to ignore thinking it was another bather. Suddenly the man had moved closer, held her by the hand and tried to molest her.
Through intuition she had placed the bucket on the man’s head covering his face and escaped by making a bee line home in her wet clothes, leaving the bundle of washed clothes behind and reported the matter to her mother.
Although the family members had rushed to the stream to catch the culprit, he had escaped by then.
