Karapitiya Hospital waste treatment network out of order

The waste treatment network of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle had broken down posing a danger to the surrounding environment and community life, Central Environment Authority’s Provincial Director Susantha Wedage said.
He said clinical waste of the hospital is discharged into a canal nearby without any waste treatment. Although all hospitals are required to obtain an environment clearance permit, the CEA has so far failed to issue such a permit to several hospitals including Karapitiya hospital, since their waste treatment networks were not in proper working order.
This situation had already been notified to the Health Ministry, he added.
