Chords of harmony

Aditya Gandhi has performed across India, Scotland and United States, including venues such as the Guinness Room and Stevenson Concert Hall in Glasgow, and the Calcutta School of Music. Most recent concerts include a solo and chamber performances at Ganz Hall, in Chicago, and Alliance Francaise in Ahmedabad, and a uniquely themed ‘Nocturnal Concert’ across India. Yet his most memorable concerts have been in living rooms, whose intimacy has no substitute.
Having grown up in a culture largely void of western classical music, Aditya’s musical creativity is born of this outside view, searching for that unique intersection between ‘contemporary’ and ‘accessible’ music. He believes that the universality of classical music is often obstructed by the traditional packaging we present it in. His on-going goal is to collaborate and curate ‘art music’ in a way that it is more accessible and reflective of contemporary culture.
He was awarded the RCS Trust Award in 2010 and second prize at the Calcutta International Guitar Competition in 2012. Born in India, Aditya began his musical journey at quite a late age of 15. He largely self-taught the instrument before completing his Bachelors of Music with Honours from Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and his Masters of Music at the Chicago College of Performing Arts under world-renowned guitarist Denis Azabagic.
Aditya has also had the opportunity to collaborate with incredible musicians along the way. Most recent projects include a set of contemporary works with Violist Michael Schneider, and a new commission for solo guitar (inspired by Indian landscapes) by composer Jonathan Hannau. He also accompanied CCPA’s production of Montiverdi’s l’incoronazione di poppea in 2016, a unique venture for the classical guitar.
Pursuing his ambition of exposing young audiences to ‘art music’ throughout India, Aditya has given frequent lectures at Greenwood High School in India, hoping to inspire more students to pursue higher education in Music and Arts. He has taught at Melody Makers Arts Academy in UAE, and given private tuition in Scotland,USA and India. Aditya has also written several papers on the music of Pierre Boulez, Toru Takemitsu and Luigi Nono, and is an avid researcher on contemporary music.
Aditya currently performs on a 2014 Sebastian Stenzel guitar. When away from the guitar, he loves to cook, watch stand-up comedy, and is an avid reader - particularly of South American and Spanish literature. He also spends hours ‘doodling’ on his ukulele.
