Akshay changes his voice for ‘2.0’

Known for his versatility and incredible range as an actor, Akshay Kumar is all set to experiment with something he has never done before. The actor will be playing the antagonist, Dr. Richard, in his upcoming film, ‘2.0’, sequel to the Aishwarya Rai and Rajnikanth film, ‘Robot’, for which he has transformed not only his looks but his voice as well.
The actor has gone through major transformation to look the part while he will also sound different than usual in the film. For this, Oscar winning sound designer Resul Pookutty has been taken onboard to work on the sound enhancement, an Indian publication reports. “We are working on it,” Resul said. “After struggling for weeks, Shankar and I have discovered a method. We are not fully satisfied with the voice quality yet. In a while, we will get the perfect voice and pitch for Akshay.”
Kumar’s voice will be dubbed in Tamil and Telugu while in the Hindi version of ‘2.0’, he will speak in his own voice but will sound completely different, thanks to a technological sound enhancement that changes vocals.
‘2.0’ is touted as one of the most expensive films in Asia with a budget of Rs 400 crores. Directed by Shankar, the big budget film also stars Rajinikanth and Amy Jackson in pivotal roles.
