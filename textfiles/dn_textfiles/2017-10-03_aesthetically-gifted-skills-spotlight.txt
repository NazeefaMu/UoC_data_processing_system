Aesthetically gifted skills in the spotlight

The School Orchestra of Anula Vidyalaya presented an exciting and grand show last week called ‘Anula Sara 2017’ which started off in splendid fashion. The BMICH saw a large number of parents, teachers, well- wishers and students flock in droves to witness this much hyped event.
It is no secret that Anula Vidyalaya has many aesthetically gifted students. The performances last week were of high quality and the talent was huge. Anula Vidyalaya has contributed to society by releasing young women blessed with talent into the field of aesthetics who have really taken the industry to new heights. The show Anula Sara 2017 proved to everyone who were present that this is a school to be admired for its aesthetics.
Principal of Anula Vidyalaya, Mrs. Principal P.N. Rajapaksha in her address stated that the endeavor undertaken by these girls is really one of great magnitude and the girls have put their hearts into it. This ‘Anula Sara 2017’ is done for the sixth time.
“The journey we have all taken as children of mother Anula has not been without difficulties. There have been many challenges and difficulties that we have overcome. Now we have come forward victoriously. Anula has enriched the field of Aesthetics in Sri Lanka. She has put out talented young ladies into this field. In the years to come Anula will continue to produce women of such character. This concert is testimony. The students and the administration have been a great strength to me in this undertaking,” said Rajapaksha
Rajapaksha pointed out that everyone has worked so hard to make this dream a reality. The Principal stated that the teachers and parents have been a pillar of strength to her.
Chief Guest, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Sunil Hettiarachchi, stated that he was extremely pleased at this project.
