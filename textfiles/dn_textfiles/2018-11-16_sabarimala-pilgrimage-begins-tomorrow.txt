Sabarimala pilgrimage begins tomorrow

The Sabarimala pilgrimage season begins tomorrow; the first day of the Kasthikai in the Hindu calendar. Thousands of Ayyappan devotees will take part in the pilgrimage in Kerala, India.
Sri Lankan devotees at the All Ceylon Ayyappan temple on the Aluthmawatha Road in Colombo 15, are staging a 60-day fast before beginning the pilgrimage.
The temple had made the necessary arrangements for the journey.
Ayyappan is the Hindu God of growth and is the son of Shiva and Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu.
In Hinduism, he was born with the powers of Shiva and Vishnu, to confront and defeat the demon Mahishasura. He was raised by a childless royal couple and grew up as a warrior of dharmic living. In South India, Ayyappan images depict him riding a tiger, but in certain countries such as Sri Lanka, he is shown riding a white elephant.
Ayyappan’s popularity has grown in many parts of India, with the most famous Ayyappan shrine located in Sabarimala. The shrine receives millions of pilgrims every year in late December and early January. Many of them prepare for weeks before climbing the hill barefoot, making it one of the largest active pilgrimage sites in the world.
