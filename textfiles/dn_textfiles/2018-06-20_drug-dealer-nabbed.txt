Drug dealer nabbed

A major drug dealer in the Peliyagoda area has been arrested by the Special Task Force (STF) yesterday evening.
The Police Media Unit report that the arrest was made during a STF raid in the area and the suspect was arrested with 5g of heroin and a hand grenade.
The suspect has been identified as 26-year-old Jayarathnage Gihan Sandaruwan, a resident of 156/53, Negombo Road, Peliyagoda.
This person had led the gang which rivalled D.Manju, the drug dealer who was recently killed in a shootout with the STF. His brother was Local Council member Shyamal Sandaruwan who had been shot dead awhile back.
