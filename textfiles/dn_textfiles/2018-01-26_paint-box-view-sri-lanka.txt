Paint box view of  Sri Lanka

Whenever Robert Sedgley is asked at which age he decided to become an artist, he usually replies that all children paint, but most stop when they become adults; he just carried on. All creativity, Sedgley avers, is dependent on play to realise an object of worth. To make is to be human, and play is at the very essence of what it is to be a maker.
He and Jean first came to Sri Lanka in 1996 and it was love at first sight. From there they made visits to Galle, Nuwara Eliya, Sigiriya, Dambulla cave temples and the ancient city of Polonnaruwa; making his first studies of this exotic country, charmed by the temples and the astonishing green hillsides of the highland tea estates. On a two day trip to Colombo a chance meeting with the artist S. H. Sarath led to his first exhibition, two years later, in the Artist’s Studio. A small exhibition of around twenty studies of buildings and temples, which was well reviewed in the papers, and opened by the then British High Commissioner, Linda Duffield, culminated in an interview on a television chat show and inspired many exhibitions since then and now an incredibly exciting book with the most amazing collection for paintings from his travels.
Robert Sedgley journey with art started at Junior Art School in Birmingham in the UK from the age of twelve to fifteen; and it was his time there, with its intense ethos of creativity and its sense of the camaraderie and the feeling of being part of a ‘brotherhood’, that he himself first realised that there was nothing else that he could do but be an artist. Amongst the subjects he studied there was lettering, and it is from this intense study of the forms, proportions and spacing of Roman letters that, he asserts, he derives his sense of design and space in his paintings and sculpture. On leaving school he trained as a silkscreen printer, and later worked as a poster writer, meanwhile attending evening classes in life drawing, portraiture and sculpture. Then, after some six years working at these trades, on the advice of a friend, he decided to retrain as a teacher. Following a degree level course at Birmingham and Exeter colleges of art, and a postgraduate study at Leicester Polytechnic, he worked in and headed the Art Departments of several Hertfordshire schools. A permanent move to a small village in Spain led to a lightening of his pallet and more colour in his landscape work.
Robert Sedgley next exhibition, From Holy Sites to Humble Dwellings, at the Sri Lankan Institute of Architects in 2001; where he showed a range of pictures, contrasting building styles in Spain, France, Italy, Uganda and Sri Lanka. Inspired by another journey, this time by a train ride from Kandy to the high, mountain town of Haputale, and utilising methods of mark making first developed in his Road and Bridge watercolours, this series of abstracted landscapes extend the techniques of brush and layered colour.
A visit to this exhibition by Barbara Sansoni led to exhibitions in the next two years at the renowned Barefoot Gallery in Bambalapitiya, Streetlevel and Trading Places. An extract from his Artist’s Statement for these exhibitions sums up the philosophy of his art in regard to his images of Sri Lankan buildings and sites:
‘’My paintings of street life are quite objective. A process of selection and elimination goes on but basically I paint what is there.
My subject is buildings, old or modern, but normally with some aspect of age or decay. However, I do not paint romantic ruins; to me there is no romanticism in decay, dirt and degeneration. The noise, ugliness and squalor of urban life repels me, but I am also drawn to it as a subject (the conventional beautiful view has no interest for me as a painter.)
‘’Architecture has been described as ‘frozen music’ and that is another of its attractions for me. So I conceive my paintings as musical analogies. The whole takes on a symphonic appearance.
‘’A painting needs time to tell its story, like a novel or piece of music. A painting doesn’t move or make a noise, and these are its attractions. There is a temptation to take it in at a glance and move on to the next. Paintings in a gallery should be islands of tranquillity; they need a quiet mind to allow them to reveal their secrets. I spend many hours with these pictures, allowing them to grow and develop into their maturity - so my hope is that the spectator will spend at least a few minutes with each one.’’
It was a conversation with Barbara’s son, the photographer Dominic Sansoni, that led to the idea of producing a book, which would be designed as a visual record of a journey around the island, with pencil notes of the artist’s impressions and experiences, and backed up with a scholarly text on the history and short articles on the most important buildings and sites. The work of many subsequent visits, Travels With a Paintbox, produced by Serendipity Publishing, is the result. In a book which is not only a personal reminiscence of his travels but also a useful travel guide, the artist presents around two hundred new drawings and paintings, with the text by Doctor KP Paranavitana, and a forward by the late professor Ashley Halpé.
Robert Sedgley has thus built a strong career and following in Sri Lanka, with some nine exhibitions.
Inspired by his interest in Eastern religions, he is currently engaged on a large complex and detailed painting with a modern take, entitled The Age of Kali. According to Hindu tradition we are under the sway of this destructive goddess, which carries within the seeds of ultimate regeneration, which will usher in a new Golden Age.
So we see that this is an artist whose interests are wide and sometimes complex, who’s work at every level, repays contemplation and thoughtful engagement to release all that it has to offer. Many of his works may be viewed on his website:www.robertsedgley.com
