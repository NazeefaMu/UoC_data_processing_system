Daily News article of November 15:
Russia refutes British PM’s claims

The Russian Embassy in Colombo, referring to an AFP news item published in the Daily News of November 15 under the title, ‘Russia can’t undermine West: British PM’, has clarified Russia’s position in a statement made by Maria Zakharrova, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The full statement follows:
“We have taken note of the statement concerning Russia made on 13 November by the British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Lord Mayor's Banquet 2017. This time our country is ranked first among “threats to the international community”, not just equal to others as before. Thus, the United Kingdom is making an attempt to claim global leadership in deterrence of Russia, in order to protect the existing world order, as PM Theresa May put it.
The assertions are not brand new, but the main common point behind them is the irresponsible and groundless nature of accusations against Russia. The idea of protection of world order sounds particularly cynical from the British Prime Minister. It is enough to recall the aggressive actions of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Libya which have led not to strengthening of the international law, but to numerous casualties and sufferings of millions of people and destabilisation of whole regions. At the same time, London shows fundamental incomprehension of current processes in the world and of the essence of the very UN Charter-based international legal order that the United Kingdom is vowing to protect.
The British society is currently not going through its finest hour due to the ongoing process of the existing EU and internal splits. It is understandable that an external enemy is direly needed to distract public attention for which role Russia has been chosen. It is deeply regrettable, especially now that the United Kingdom, considering its ambition to turn into a “Global Britain”, would benefit from multi-directional, pragmatic and efficient foreign policy. Such an approach would give UK extra opportunities on the emerging markets as well as strengthen its global standing through the development of dialogue with other countries. The path of confrontation chosen by London is unlikely to contribute to the achievement of these goals.”
