Vijayakala cannot be branded as terrorist: Vigneswaran

Northern Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said that when Tamils speak about their security and rights, the south should not look at that as a threat.
He said Vijayakala Maheswaran cannot be branded as a terrorist for expressing her opinion that the North was much safer under Prabhakaran.
“It is a world known fact that Tamils in the North were safe under Prabhakaran and nobody can disagree with that. Anyone who wants to comment about the prevailing security in the North and compare it with the past, they have the right to do that,” he said.
The Chief Minister said he was at the meeting but could not hear all what she said due to some problems with the speaker. He said he later questioned Maheswaran and learnt what she actually meant.
“All she wanted to say was that the prevailing situation in the North has to be changed.
I don’t understand what make people in the South think that it was wrong,” he said.
The Chief Minister said that during the war, even women wearing gold jewellery were able walk alone at night on the road without fear.
He said there is a drastic increase in illegal activities and crimes in the North and added that it can be controlled only if the government remove the army and give the police power to the Tamil people. “I tell the government to give us the police power, so we will sort out all the prevailing issues in North,” he said.
He said the attack was not actually against Vijayakala Maheswaran but against the Tamils as a whole.
