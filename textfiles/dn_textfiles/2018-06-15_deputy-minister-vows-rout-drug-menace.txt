Deputy Minister vows to rout drug menace

Newly appointed Public Administration, Management, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said yesterday that he would launch a massive programme to eliminate the narcotics menace from the country with the fullest cooperation of his Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the Police Department.
The Deputy Minister, addressing the gathering after assuming duties at his office yesterday, said that drug trafficking, underworld gangs, and other criminal organisations grew in size and strength during the previous regime, but we cannot see such a situation today.
He further said a large number of local and foreign narcotics are available the market and both schoolchildren and youth are largely addicted to them. “We will take steps to eliminate this menace,” he added.
He said both law and order and public services are major sectors directly important to the people of the country.
“I am extremely happy that I have got the opportunity to work with Minister Madduma Bandara who has proven efficiency and a good character as well as many decades of experience in politics. I am committed to taking the vision of this government forward to the best of my ability.”
Public Administration, Management, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said that he is happy that an efficient and committed young politician has been appointed as his deputy.
“Our mandate from the January 8 election is to bring culprits who rob the country’s wealth to justice. However, when we are working under the democratic framework, the Opposition is trying to blame and obstruct us. If there any crime occurs anywhere in the country, the Opposition is trying to pin the blame on the government.”
