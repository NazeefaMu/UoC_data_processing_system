Around 480 estate sector hospitals earmarked for development

Arrangements have been made to take over 480 estate sector hospitals by the Health Ministry for development, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered Health Ministry officials to formulate the relevant Cabinet Paper. A total of 13 estate sector hospitals will be taken over under the programme.
Minister Senaratne instructed construction companies to accelerate the construction work of several hospitals in the Kalutara district. The newly constructed Dialysis Unit at the Kalutara General Hospital (Nagoda hospital) will open on November 23, he said.
After taking over the 480 estate sector hospitals, development projects will be launched to upgrade them while other hospitals will be developed under various other hospital development programmes. The main objective of developing estate sector hospitals is to minimize the congestion in Teaching Hospitals, General Hospitals and other main hospitals, he added.
