Trinco oil tank farm a joint venture with India

The government will sign an agreement with India to form a joint venture company to operate and manage oil storage tanks in Trincomalee , Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
The minister said that does not mean that we are giving away of any of country’s ports to India or any other country.
Addressing a press Conference he also said “we are not going to assign full control of the totality of our oil tanks in Trincomalee to IOC (India Oil ompany),”
He said, ”the claims and speculations that have spread all around that all of our false.”
“The strike action staged by petroleum trade unionists has been a result of misrepresentation made by interested parties,” Hashim pointed out.
He said discussions were currently under way to dispel any misconception regarding the matter
Asked how those oil tanks would be shared, the minister said, he cannot give an official statement on the matter as he is not the minister in charge of the subject but said , “ as per earlier agreement the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation did not own a single oil tank. But as it stood after that discussion the Corporation is to get ten oil tanks. IOC was going to get 14 tanks.”
“The rest, I think about 74 tanks are going to be shared between the governments of Sri Lanka and India following signing an agreement between the two countries, to form a joint venture company,” he explained.
“This is not going to bring any adverse effects as is being speculated by some sections,” he added.
