Mahindra to jazz up SUV variants as competition hots up

Mahindra & Mahindra is trying to make two of its popular vehicles more appealing to the buyer, as competition is set to intensify further in the SUV space with rivals Maruti SuzukiBSE -0.22 % and Tata Motors launching new models.
M&M has readied new variants of the XUV 500 and KUV 100 to hold on to its share in the segment that is growing fast and where it has been upstaged by Maruti in some months of 2016 on the back of strong demand for the Vitara Breeza. The Ignis from Maruti and the Tata Hexa are set to pose fresh threat to the company.
The changes will be in aesthetics and features, and there will be no major price increase.
Pravin Shah, chief executive for the automotive sector at Mahindra & Mahindra, told ET that the philosophy of Mahindra always was to offer value of Rs 100 at Rs 50.
The company is adding a host of connectivity technologies to make the XUV more feature-packed. The new EcoSense telematics feature will allow real-time tracking of the vehicle, including fuel economy and wear and tear of parts. Mood lighting is another addition on offer.
The company has also added a safety button in the XUV, which will be triggered in the event of any accident and call the stored emergency contact number. It will offer this feature to existing XUV owners as well, through a small software upgrade.
In the Rs 15-25 lakh premium SUV space, M&M already sells 3,000-3,500 XUVs a month, more than all models of other companies put together. In the micro SUV space, where the company is facing maximum heat, M&M is upgrading the KUV by improving the aesthetics of the car and its fuel economy.
In the coming few weeks, the new KUV variant will come with dual colours for the first time to keep itself competitive against the Maruti Ignis. The KUV will also offer the options of bigger alloy wheels and a host of accessories.
The world is embracing digital technologies, while increasing traffic on the road is making people spend more time in cars, Shah said. “With connected features, we are trying to offer options which take away torture and fatigue, by making them more gainfully deployed, be it mood lighting or connectivity features.”
Mahindra has already tied up with Google and has integrated the Android Auto operating system on the infotainment system of the XUV and is in discussion with Apple to integrate the Apple CarPlay.
