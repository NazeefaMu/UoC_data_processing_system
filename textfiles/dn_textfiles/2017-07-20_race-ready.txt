Race ready!

If fast cars set your pulse racing, imaging being behind the wheel of one of them on the race track. While some may make it look easy, becoming a race car driver is anything but simple. Countless drivers take to the race tracks from across the world, yet only a few ever make it to the big time.
Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena are two of Sri Lankan motorsports’ brightest prospects. They have taken a less travelled path in the Sri Lankan sports arena at such a tender age. The two boys who are 15 and 14 year olds and schooling at Gateway College, Negombo, haven taken on the race track with professional riders from countries like Japan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. Not only have they competed head to head with racers who are almost twice their age but they have emerged as winners in the FIM Asia Cup 2015 .
Born with racing in their blood, the duo notes that they have ridden motorcycles before even riding a bicycle! This is not surprising because they are the sons of inaugural Foxhill Supercross champion rider Shane Gunawardena. Jaden’s first motorcycle was given to him for his second birthday. As soon as the boys have mastered the techniques of riding their mini motorcycles they switched to competitive 50cc bikes.
“Our Dad inspired us to take to motorcycle racing. We were around five years when we first took to the race track. We have photos to remind us about what we did and where we were placed but there have just been too many races after that. So we cannot really recall how we felt during our first race,” Jaden and Aaron said.
They note that their passion for the sport grew as they honed their talent. Shane, too saw immense potential behind his sons and he entered them for the National Championships in Road Racing when they were seven and eight years old. This turned out to be an eye opener for many as the two young boys beat top adult riders to clinch the National Championships in 2010.
Jaden was selected for the national pool to represent Sri Lanka at the age of eight. His first tournament was in India. Both boys represented Sri lanka at an Asian round in Japan in 2011. They created history by being the youngest riders to participate at a 150cc championship in Asia. Their most significant win was winning the 2015 Asia Cup in a three round championship among eight countries.
Jaden managed to win the first race of the ‘Round One’ of the ACRR in Motegi, Japan, in August 2015. However he met with a nasty crash and had to be airlifted out of the circuit concussed and with a fractured collarbone during the second race. Then it was all up to the then 12 year old Aaron to withstand the pressure and bring home the trophy. He managed to do this with glowing colours as he steered Sri Lanka to victory in the opening round. Moving onto the second round which was held in Nakhonchaisri Circuit, Thailand, in October, 2015, Jaden and Aaron went in with a few Injuries which occurred during practice and finished off by clinching sixth and seventh places.

Round three of the ACRR was held at Pen Bay International Circuit, Taiwan, on bikes somewhat similar to international racing 250cc bikes. The boys recalled that they had never ridden bikes of this nature before. However they did not back off from the challenge and their victory was truly a sight to behold as they took to the race track and zoomed past the finish line.
With experience gathered overseas the youth found it easy to become national champs. They were podium finishes at the Kandy and Colombo night races too.
“Our Dad did our basic training. He leased out properties to make practice tracks for us to train on when we were young. Now that we have reached the Asian level, he has leased out the Mirigama circuit and had it blocked out to use for motorcyclists alone. We would love to practice every day like the professionals, but the school work takes a lot of our time. Priority is always for our studies and sports and fitness come in second,” they explained.
Queried if they did not think twice about the dangers of the sport when they decided to pursue it on the long run, the boys said that they have never contemplated the matter a few years ago. However time and experience has taught them otherwise and now that they are much older and had seen fatal accidents occurring before their eyes, they ride with more caution.
“Our greatest achievement is being able to keep up with the riders at an Asian level. We would need to put in a lot of hard work to keep abreast, and even more if we are looking at podiums. Seeing our country’s national flag on a podium has been our goal. We have had many memorable moments where our country was highlighted during our overseas tours. We have also learnt quite a lot from better riders and their coaches during these events,” Jaden and Aaron said.
Their favourite sports idol is Italian professional road racer Valentino Rossi because he is the greatest of all time.
Jaden’s talent has been spotted by Red Bull Sri Lanka who supported him to earn a spot at the Red Bull Rookies Cup where he was one of two Asians who competed. They have also shown interest in grooming Jaden and Aaron to become one of the first Sri Lankans to participate in the global MotoGP Series.
“We had dreams of MotoGP and going international, but in reality a Sri Lankan with average support cannot make it there. We have one last chance to have a go at it internationally and that would be through this year’s world selection at the Red Bull Rookies Cup in Spain,” Jaden and Aaron said adding that they do not have proper facilities like circuits and support from the manufacturers to take their talents to the global level.
“We also do not have an insurance that covers racing. So basically there are many hurdles and hardships for our local riders,” they lamented.
Their words of advice for other youth are to stay off the addictive mobile phones and focus on what they want to do. However, they note with smirks, that they themselves have a hard time practicing what they preach.
