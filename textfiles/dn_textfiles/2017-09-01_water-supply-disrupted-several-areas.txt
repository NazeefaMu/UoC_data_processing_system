Water supply disrupted in several areas

 
Water supply to Moratuwa, Panadura, Boralesgamuwa, Kesbewa, Piliyandala and Horana was disrupted due to a water contamination issue, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board said.
The water purification centre in Horana, Kandana shut down the water supply to the above areas temporarily after it was found that the water is contaminated with fuel, spilled from a bowser which had toppled recently.
