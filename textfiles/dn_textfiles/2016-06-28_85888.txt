S. Thomas’ go out  firm favourites  against Zahira today

 
Inter-school league runners up S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia will go out as hot favourites to beat Zahira College Maradana in their Milo inter-school knockout tournament quarterfinal match to be played at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid avenue today at 4.30pm.
The Thomians have an immaculate record after the league tournament where they lost only to winners Isipathana.
The side has been bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards along with their speedy three quarter line who are scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves to go along with the dependable place kicking of centre Ashvantha Herath.
On the other hand Zahira possesses a good leader in skipper M. Ramzan who can play an outstanding game to bring victory to his school. They have been blowing hot and cold and are feeling the sting of the nailbiting defeat at the hands of St. Joseph’s College Maradana in their last outing. It will be a do or die battle for Zahira against a strong Thomian outfit. - (WAI)
