Low water capacity in major tanks

The average water capacity percentage in the 73 major irrigation schemes coming under the Irrigation Department is currently 40 percent, Irrigation Water Resources Management Director Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said.
Referring to the matter, Palugaswewa said that district-wise, water levels in Anuradhapura's 13 major reservoirs were at 34 percent capacity, whereas water levels in the Rajanganaya reservoir had reached 90 percent capacity. Although the average water levels in major reservoirs in the Ampara district were only at 20 percent capacity, the Rambukkan Oya remained at 97 percent capacity.
Further, the Senanayake Samudrya in Ampara was only at 15 percent capacity, Palugaswewa added. He said that the water levels of the 279 medium-scale tanks that fell under the Irrigation Department, remained at 25 percent capacity.
According to Anuradhapura Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa, the Yala paddy cultivation carried out under 3,000 minor tanks in the district, had dwindled to 25 percent. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that at the start of the season, it was envisioned to cultivate paddy in 75,000 hectares during the 2018 Yala, season. However, according to progress review reports, only around 40,000 hectares had been cultivated.
Wanninayake said the distribution of dry food rations for 75,000 drought-stricken families was continuing within the district, for which the government had spent around Rs. 3.5 billion so far.
He added that Grama Niladaries and Divisional Secretaries had been instructed to be vigilant regarding discrepancies in the distribution of rations as well as the listing of beneficiaries.
