Status quo prevailed after a bout of turbulence

The rumour mill had gone into overdrive late Sunday night with all sorts of speculation on prorogation of Parliament, break-up of National Unity Government, a possible power shift and crossover of some defecting MPs.
It was amidst these speculations and a week-long political impasse due to unforeseen developments after the Local Government polls that Parliament sat on Monday to carry on its legislative business.
It preceded a crucial meeting among President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya late Sunday night with the aim to resolve the political stand-off between the two main parties in the ruling coalition. It was reported this eleventh hour meeting of the first, second and third citizens of the country had led to an agreement culminating the days of uncertainty and instability in the Government.
However, the closed-door meetings of the political parties had not seen an end even as Parliament met on Monday, and the media had given prominence to a comment by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala that the UPFA decided to quit the Unity Government. It was against this backdrop, a special debate was requested by Joint Opposition on the current political situation in the country.
Debate on political crisis
The Speaker with the consent of Party Leaders paved the way for a three-hour adjournment debate for the purpose of recognizing the national importance and urgency of the matter. The UNP, JO, TNA and JVP actively took part in it, giving their own interpretations to the results of recently concluded LG polls and the future of National Government. The benches of SLFP members in the Government ranks were mostly empty because the President was having a group meeting with them at the Presidential Secretariat as the debate continued.
However, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala hurried to Parliament following the meeting at the request of the Speaker to explain the SLFP position and his remarks to the media the other day. He said his party’s decision to quit the Government was revisited and that they wait for the Supreme Court opinion to arrive at a final decision.
The JO, which was waiting in the wings to cash in on internal power struggle of the Government, however could not make much out of the debate as the two parties had agreed to continue with the status quo by then. The JO, revelling in the pleasure of its victory at the LG elections, went on to apply those results to that of a General Election. The JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, moving the adjournment motion, called on the Government to step down stating that it no longer has the people’s mandate to continue in the office.
“Only two blocs at a Referendum”
JO stalwart Wimal Weerawansa seconded the motion stating that the voters in large numbers had heeded to their calls to consider the LG elections a ‘referendum’ to express their disapproval to the Government. JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake counter argued that interpreting the LG polls as a referendum was in fact favourable to the Government as there could be only two blocs at a referendum.
“One can easily say the two blocs here were those supportive of Rajapaksa clan and those against them. This is exactly how the Government also wants to portray the results. In that sense, the anti-Rajapaksa group emerged stronger than the SLPP. But the LG polls were not a show down between two parties. It was a multi-party contest,” he added.
MP Dissanayake, stressing that the ruling coalition has failed to keep to their promises for which they received people’s mandate on January 8, 2015, pointed out this disillusionment was the main cause for the Government’s set back in the LG polls.
UNP Ministers Navin Dissanayake and Dr Rajitha Senaratne, humbly accepting the poll’s outcome as an eye opener, stressed the need for a course correction. Making a reflective speech, Minister Dissanayake said that the UNP would concentrate on its weaknesses, correct its mistakes and work resolutely with much vigour to fulfill the people’s aspirations. With his gentlemanliness, Dissanayake at the outset of his speech congratulated the SLPP for its success at the LG polls despite it being a fledgling party. At the same time, he warned the JO not to be carried away by the notion that they command the majority support in the country. “Bear in your mind that when you obtained 44.65 percent of the votes cast, the other parties have obtained 55.35 percent,” he told the JO.
“Eelam will bloom from your lotus bud”
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were attending the debate but both the leaders did not take the floor. Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, joining in the debate, took former President Rajapaksa, who was in the seat next to him, head on for the latter’s remarks in the campaign trail that incited fears of a “Tamil Eelam” among the Sinhala electorate.
The Opposition Leader said he was “alarmed” at the former President’s remark in the run up to the elections that the Tamil Eelam could bloom after the LG elections. Sampanthan also expressed his dismay that the SLPP virulently carried out its false propaganda in all the temples in the Sinhala villages in the South.
“That is unfortunate. My party in this election talked of a political solution within the framework of an undivided indivisible single country. There was no campaign carried out anywhere in the North and the East which talked of division. When we did that how dare former President Rajapaksa say that Eelam could bloom after the elections? Wasn’t he deceiving the people of the South including himself?” he questioned with strong emotion.
“I want everybody in this country to know that if this malicious, vicious and fallacious propaganda on the part of President Rajapaksa and SLPP persists, Eelam will bloom not on account of us but on account of your lotus bud,” he added referring to the party symbol of the SLPP.
“Please resist your temptation to achieve cheap political gains by carrying on such false propaganda,” he urged the former President.
Future of National Government
In the meantime, the sense of indecisiveness on the continuation of National Government and questions on its validity after the initial two-year period of agreement between the UNP and the SLFP were duly addressed in Parliament on Wednesday.
Ending days of uncertainty and speculation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera officially announced in Parliament that the National Government formed by the UNP and the UPFA is intact and both parties desire to continue it.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, making a ministerial statement on the request of the Speaker, told the House that the Resolution passed on September 3, 2015 to give effect to the National Government is still valid.
“We have not rescinded the Resolution. It is still operative. There are no circumstances yet to cancel it,” the PM gave a succinct answer.
The UPFA General Secretary also confirmed Parliament that his party has not withdrawn from the National Government and still working within the initial agreement signed between the two parties. SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake was also present as Amaraweera made the statement.
As Amaraweera stated his party’s position, the members in the Government benches thumped their desks to express their pleasure.
Putting to rest any further doubts, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya finally added that he accepts the official positions communicated to the House by the Prime Minister and the UPFA General Secretary on the continuation of National Government.
The members of both sides were also seen talking to each other with interest in the Lobby on the impending Cabinet reshuffle. The Government, before it faces crucial national level elections in two years’ time, has an onerous task of delivering its key promises to the people while walking the talk on its good governance policy. The abilities of Ministers assuming responsibilities in key ministerial portfolios including Law and Order and Justice will be important to achieve the desired goals.
