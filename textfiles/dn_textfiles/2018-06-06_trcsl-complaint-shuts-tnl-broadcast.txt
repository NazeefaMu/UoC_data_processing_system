TRCSL complaint shuts TNL broadcast

A repeater transmission center in Polgahawela belonging to the TNL media network has been shut down and broadcast equipment taken into police custody.
The Polgahawela Magistrate’s Court had issued a court order and based on that order the police had taken the broadcast equipment into custody. It is reported that with the transmission of the Polgahawela repeater station being out of service, transmission to several areas in the Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba and Western provinces had been affected.
Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL) had lodged a complaint yesterday at the Polgahawela Police that a private television channel had been operating this transmission tower without approval.
He noted that based on that complaint, the Police had presented facts in court, and the Polgahawela Magistrate’s Courts had issued orders to seize the equipment and conduct an investigation into the charges leveled against them.
Further investigations are being carried out by the Polgahawela Police with the assistance of the TRCSL.
The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) issuing a statement yesterday said they have taken into possession a repeater transmission center belonging to the TNL media network in Polgahawela as a result of the television network not obtaining their annual broadcasting license for the year.
TNL responding to the TRC via their facebook in the meantime said they had paid all licensing fees for the year.
