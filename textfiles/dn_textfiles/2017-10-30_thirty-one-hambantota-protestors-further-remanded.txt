Thirty-one Hambantota protestors further remanded

 
The Hambantota Magistrate further remanded thirty-one suspects including Joint Opposition (JO) MP Prasanna Ranaweera, until November 23.
They were alleged to have protested in front of the India Consular Service in Hambantota on October 6, violating the restraining order issued by the Hambantota Magistrate.
JO MPs and supporters launched the protest alleging the government to have sold the Hambantota sea port to China and Mattala Airport to India.
A student who was arrested along with the rest of the suspects was reportedly granted bail.
