Beauty bound!

For her, beauty is not a stranger at all. Born and groomed in a world of splendor, beauty became her passion. Not only gifted in beauty but also equipped with intellect she is now the creator of many beautiful and good looking women in the country. The Daily News spoke to Dr. Shanika Arsecularatne, who is striving to make the people she meet feel beautiful.
"We are concerned in making people looking their best. In Sri Lanka some people think the anti aging treatments are harmful and a may be risky. But it isn't so. You don't have to be exceptionally good looking or born with perfect features to carry out yourself. You can look good and confidently carry yourself out in the society with a few simple things," She said. "Unfortunately at present there is a lack of personnel to give proper advice to people on these procedures. People should have a proper person to guide them. Just applying a cream for a problem beneath the skin is not the remedy and it won't help in the long run of looking good.
Taking forward the legacy of her mother, Professor Ramani Arsecularatne, Dr Shanika Arsecularatne is determined to serve the ever-increasing clientele for standardized Aesthetic Skin and Hair treatments. "I was always associated with beauty. It was something that I grew up with. Then I discovered my passion for Aesthetic Medicine and pursued my studies in that area. I am happy that I can combine both my passions and make people to look better," she said.
Youngest in Sri Lanka
Dr. Arsecularatne is the youngest in Sri Lanka to have obtained the post Graduate Diploma by the American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine.
"Aesthetic Medicine promotes the association between health and beauty. At the clinic we tackle many skin and hair diseases by combining the newest medical technologies ranging from non-surgical correction involving lasers, chemical resurfacing to surgical scar revision. Some issues even stretch marks that many think cannot be treated or corrected can be made right although people are not aware of it," she added.
"Almost every person in today's society is qualified. Most of them have degrees and are equipped with professional qualifications. According to research those who make the extra effort to present themselves better, find it more easier to make better first impressions, engage in discussions better and reach the top of the corporate ladder ,simply because when you look good, you feel good and that makes you perform better. That is where we come in to serve and give people more confidence. A health or a physical issue should not be a hindrance to your career," Dr. Arsecularatne said.
"Every one that comes to me for advanced skin treatment is important for me. They are comprehensively advised on the procedure and results, throughout the process of treatments. We are always geared to deliver our clients a quality service with the results they look for," she added.
Strength 
Looking back she says her mother was her strength in every step she took in life. Professor Ramani Arsecularatne, a renowned cosmetologist and founder of Ramani Arsecularatne International Academy of Cosmetology (RAIAC) has paved the way for many new entrants to the Sri Lankan hair and beauty industry. Receiving a profound education in internationally reputed institutions in the United States of America, United Kingdom, France and Japan, she is a graduate of the Christine Valmy Institute-New York and Kimari International-Singapore and is the first Sri Lankan to have obtained a degree in the field of beauty and hairdressing.
With her expertise she has being an asset to the industry. Her vision of introducing the latest industry innovations to the country and helping people to build up their levels of confidence by looking their best is now intertwined with her daughter's dreams. "It gives me immense pleasure and satisfaction to help another person look well and boost their confidence. I am dedicated to bring in whatever new innovations that comes up in the industry in the future," she said.
