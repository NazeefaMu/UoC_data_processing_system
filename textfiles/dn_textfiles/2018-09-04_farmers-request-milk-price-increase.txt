Farmers request milk price increase

Galewela dairy farmers requested authorities to increase milk prices, recently.
They said that although production costs had risen during recent years, sales prices had remained the same. Farmers said that companies by their milk at Rs.60 or Rs.70 per litre, when the price should be at least Rs.80.
Dairy farmer A.P. Ariyaratne, a resident of Devahoowa, Galewela, said that the price of 50kg of cattle fodder had increased from Rs.1,950 to Rs.2,100. Prices of nutrient supplements and medicine had increased as well.
