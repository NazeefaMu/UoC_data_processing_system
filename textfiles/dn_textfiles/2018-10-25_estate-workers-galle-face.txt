Estate workers at Galle Face

Estate workers from the up country and other areas thronged the Galle Face promenade making a plea that their daily wage be made Rs.1,000 yesterday. They were allowed to gather at the Galle Face ground where they held a meeting airing their grievances for the attention of authorities and the government.
