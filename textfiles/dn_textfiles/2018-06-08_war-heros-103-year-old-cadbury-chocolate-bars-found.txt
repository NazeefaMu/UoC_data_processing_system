War hero's 103-year-old Cadbury chocolate bars found

A World War One hero's 103-year-old chocolate bars have been found in an old tin. The Cadbury bars belonged to Leicestershire Regiment soldier Richard Bullimore.
Troops serving in France during the first Christmas in the war were given Colonies Gift Tins, which were made in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire Bullimore, a corporal, ate just one of his ten chocolate bars, which are to be sold among other items at an antiques auction on Tuesday.
Paul Cooper, of Scunthorpe-based auctioneers Eddisons CJM, told the BBC, "Even the tin is rare but to find the chocolate still inside is just unreal. Richard also received a Princess Mary tobacco gift box containing cigarettes, tobacco and matches and almost all of the contents of that are still there too. Just three cigarettes are missing."
Also being sold in a collection of World War One paraphernalia are medals, citations, letters, and other material. Together, as a single lot, the collection is expected to make more than £2,000.
Cpl Bullimore was awarded a number of medals for his service.
He was given the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry during a clash in no man's land in the Ypres Salient in July 1915.
Despite being outnumbered by more than three to one, Cpl Bullimore and his patrol attacked with grenades, causing enemy casualties and eventually forcing the Germans to retreat.
The hero then carried one of his wounded men back to the allied trenches for treatment.
In October 1916, Cpl Bullimore was invalided back home due to shrapnel head wounds. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.
Cpl Bullimore recovered and went on to join Leicestershire Police in 1919. There, he rose to the rank of superintendent.
The veteran died in January 1967.
