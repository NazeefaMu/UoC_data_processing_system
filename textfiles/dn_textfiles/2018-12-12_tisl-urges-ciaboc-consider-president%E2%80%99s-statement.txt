Investigation into attempts at bribing MPs :
TISL urges CIABOC to consider President’s statement

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) called on the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), to consider President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement in its ongoing investigation into allegations of attempts to bribe parliamentarians.
The President’s acknowledgement in an interview with the Daily Mirror last week, that money had been solicited and offered to MPs in exchange for their allegiance, underscores the importance of a comprehensive and timely investigation by CIABOC. TISL has formally provided the recording of the President’s statement to CIABOC.
On November 28, TISL provided a detailed statement to CIABOC pursuant to a complaint regarding alleged attempts to bribe MPs, highlighting that the contents of telephone conversation recordings shared with the media recently by MP Palitha Range Bandara, clearly indicate an offence under Section 14 of the Bribery Act.
Speaking on the most recent development, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said, “The remarks made by the President during this interview give weight to the initial complaint filed by TISL. Whilst the President states that he will never support the bribing of politicians, he acknowledges personal knowledge of bribes being demanded, which is indicative of a potential pattern of criminal activity involving politicians and clandestine political intermediaries.”
TISL calls on the President to voluntarily provide a statement to CIABOC, thereby upholding his own commitment to transparency and accountability. Furthermore, during the interview, the President also alleged that attempts were made in the past to undermine investigations undertaken by Commissions of Inquiry.
“If such an obstruction has occurred, the President, as the appointing authority of these Commissions of Inquiry, must inform law enforcement agencies; for them to investigate and take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of the Commissions,” Obeyesekere added.
