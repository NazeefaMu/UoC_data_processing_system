Nalaka Weerakkody to introduce rugby kicking drills

Former Kingswood College, Kandy Youth SC, CR and FC, Kandy S.C. and Sri Lanka ruggerite, who was excellent in kicking goals and to touch Nalaka Weerakkody is to help ruggerites in developing their kicking drills and to improve their accuracy, technique, tactical awareness and skills so that they will know the right kick to execute it correctly.
“I am sure through these kicking drills players will develop the ability and technique to complete the drop (kicking out of hand), box, kick-off, chip, and grubber, long, high, short, and low kicks. Each kick has a purpose,” said Weerakkody.
He will use these drills to coach young players on how to start play, gain ground - so that they (chaser) can get past the defensive line without being tackled - and to convert a try or penalty.
Good sportsmanship is the key to any side succeeding, both on and off the pitch. Nalaka was the St. Anthony’s College kicking coach this season and helped their fly half to score over 100 points in goal kicking - 13 conversions, 23 penalties and 3 drop goals.

Football is poor in Kandy
Football is known to be the poor man’s game, but today the game has become poor in Kandy. Literally it means that the standards have dropped to such low levels that even club games are not conducted and played the way it should be. Referees are being attacked by players. Gone are the days when the FFSL supported the players, they even gave them a proper diet so that they can sustain their nutrition. Even with those poor facilities the standard of football in the early days was high. In the good old days FFSL maintained an unblemished record and saw that all football bodies carried out their responsibilities in a clean, just and enthusiastic manner. The Sports Minister should appoint an Interim Committee to the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) to clear up this mess.
Lawn Tennis
Lawn tennis, one-time was a very popular sport in Kandy, played exclusively by the executive class of people. But very sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity without any back up, nor any attempt to revive it. Tennis should be granted the status of cricket and rugby, where the common folks, whose love sports can contribute its resources to make tennis a popular game in Kandy. The controlling body SLTA does it, but the district association is not interested. They only help the sport only if their siblings are involved. Today tennis is played only for money, only classes no tournaments. It is the Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club and University of Peradeniya, who gave the best support to the sport. Trinity and Hillwood were also involved in big way. Former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer, the late D.S. de Silva gave his utmost support for the sport. Now the Lawn Club is no more while the Garden Club only conducts classes. During the time of DIG Bodi Liyanage, he introduced tennis to the police and came out with a super court at Asgiriya. Today it is neglected.

Former Test cricketers invited for first Test
