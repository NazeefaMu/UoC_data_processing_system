Constitution formulating process questionable. Prof. G.L.

People do not have faith in the formulating procedure of the new Constitution, Podu Jana Peramuna Chairman, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris yesterday said. He was addressing a press conference orgernized by the Joint Opposition in Colombo. Prof. Peiris said the persons behind the process could not be trusted.
He said the interim report of the Constitutional Assembly proposes changes of nine Provincial Governors' powers. "The powers of the Central Government can be severely curtailed with the clauses in the report," he said.
