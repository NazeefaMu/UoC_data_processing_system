Unqualified SAITM students must not be absorbed to KDU for medicine - Union

The parents union of state medical faculty students will take legal action against authorities if unqualified SAITM students are absorbed into the KDU, union secretary Gamini Ekanayake said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said the lowest Z score of the medical student who gained admission to a state medical faculty in relevant previous years should be considered as the minimum qualification for admission to the KDU, when absorbing SAITM students to the medical faculty.
The union has written to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTA), the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) with regard to this issue.
“Listing of SAITM students should be done below that of state medical faculty students of relevant years. SAITM students who do not qualify to enter into the KDU medical faculty should be allowed to follow other courses and not medicine,” Ekanayake said.
