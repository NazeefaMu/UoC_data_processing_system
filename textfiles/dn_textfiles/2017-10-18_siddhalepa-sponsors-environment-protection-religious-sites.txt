Siddhalepa sponsors environment protection at religious sites

The Siddhalepa Group enhanced their traditional environment protection activities at all key religious places of worship and festivals this year, as their commitment to create a healthier environment.
The Siddhalepa Group has traditionally played a major role in creating a cleaner environment in these places of worship and also provided refreshing health drinks and operated first aid services.
This year the group enhanced its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives in the Kataragama sacred area to coincide with the recent annual Kataragama Festival.
The Siddhalepa Group distributed a new beverage Acqualive which replaced the traditional Lak Peyawa Dhansala which was a welcome refreshment to devotees who trek from the Kataragama Devale to the Kiri Vehera on their annual pilgrimage to this sacred destination.
Among the group’s environment protection measures is the supply and maintenance of dustbins to minimize the garbage overflow and litter in premises.
The Group in recent years has introduced the garbage separation system to this area where separate disposables in different colours are supplied for plastic, polythene, paper etc for the convenience of the devotees and for easier garbage recycling.
Among the other CSR activities of the Group in Kataragama, is the maintenance of the iron fence around the Kataragama temple, the notice boards at the three main entrances to the temple, the 12 concrete benches, the signposts and lamp posts in the area.
Over forty waste bins were donated to the Getabenewa Dewale in the Matara district, 35 dustbins to Saman Devale in Ratnapura and 20 dustbins to the Seenigama Devale in Hikkaduwa.
This is the 50th year the company has been associated with religious activities at the Seenigama Devale Festival, where the Ransivigaya was donated by the Group for all four days of the Perehera. The company also sponsored a commemorative book titled “Desha Devol Surinde” for the Devale’s 50th anniversary.
Protecting the environment and educating and encouraging the younger generation on the importance of saving our environment is one of the key focuses in the Group’s CSR initiatives.
