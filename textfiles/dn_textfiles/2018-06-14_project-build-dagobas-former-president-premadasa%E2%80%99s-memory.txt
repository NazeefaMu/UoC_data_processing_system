Project to build dagobas in former President Premadasa’s memory

A project to establish dagobas in 25 temples representing each and every district of the country has been initiated to commemorate 94th birth anniversary of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Addressing the media yesterday at his Ministry, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said that the project will be funded through private donations from various institutions, organisations and individuals from civil society.
“My father did a great service for the development of Buddhism by constructing Buddhist religious institutions. He pioneered the establishment of the Buddhist Affairs Ministry. In each and every village reawakening programe, he constructed dagobas in the respective religious institutions. This noble programme has been initiated to commemorate the great service rendered to Buddhism and the country,” said the minister.
This programme will be initiated under the ancient theme of ‘Wewai-Dagebai-Gamai-Pansalai’.
Parallel to this programme, measures will be taken to establish two model villages in the same villages where the dagobas are constructed.
People those who are willing to assist this project can deposit their donations in the Sevana fund, he added.
