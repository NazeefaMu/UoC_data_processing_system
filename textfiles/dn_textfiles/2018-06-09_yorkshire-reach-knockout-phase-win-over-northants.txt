Yorkshire reach knockout phase with win over Northants

LONDON, Thursday - A fine individual display by David Willey helped Yorkshire beat Northants at Headingley to clinch a spot in the One-Day Cup knockout stage.
Northants will play Essex at Chelmsford for a place in the semi-finals after finishing third in the North Group.
England all-rounder Willey took (3-24) against his former county as Northants made 241 all out, with debutant Charlie Thurston top-scoring with 53. Willey added 71 with the bat in a total of 245-6 to secure a four-wicket win.
Holders Nottinghamshire booked their spot in the One-Day Cup knockout stages with a thumping eight-wicket win against Derbyshire at Trent Bridge.
The visitors were bowled out for just 110 inside 35 overs as England seamer Jake Ball took 4-29 in his 10 overs.
Matthew Carter claimed 3-19 from seven overs, while only Wayne Madsen (37) and Matt Critchley (33) could pass 30. Notts reached the target in just 11.5 overs, with Riki Wessels (63 off 34 balls) and Tom Moores starring.
Cameron Delport struck 122 to steer Leicestershire to a five-wicket win against Durham in their final One-Day Cup North Group match.
The left-hander hit 16 fours and two sixes to help the Foxes chase 241 with 34 balls to spare at Grace Road, while Colin Ackerman also made 50.
Durham had Ryan Davies (61 not out) and Barry McCarthy (43) to thank for pushing their earlier total up to 240. They shared a 100 partnership for the ninth wicket having slumped to 137-8.
