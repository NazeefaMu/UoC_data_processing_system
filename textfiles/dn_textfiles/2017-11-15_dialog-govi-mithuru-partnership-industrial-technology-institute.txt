Dialog Govi Mithuru in partnership with Industrial Technology Institute

‘Govi Mithuru’ Sri Lanka’s primary mobile agricultural information service offered by Dialog, to help uplift crop security and yield of local farmers, further enhanced their service by partnering the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI).
The Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) provides the latest techniques in storage and packaging, crop harvesting, protection and other essential aspects that need to be taken into consideration during cultivation.
The ITI is supported by the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) programme, administered jointly by the International Research and Development Centre (IDRC) and Global Affairs Canada.
ITI’s rich knowledge and international background will add further value to the information being dispensed to farmers.
Launched in 2015 in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Govi Mithuru provides customised timely advice on crop cultivation for more than 15 crops, weather conditions and family nutrition.
Currently, more than 300,000 famers are beneficiaries of this service and are empowered to receive timely and accurate agricultural information via their mobile phone.
Rural Sri Lanka’s primary livelihood and source of income remains agriculture.
The unavailability of and access to agri-related content, is a crucial issue faced by most farmers.
The Govi Mithuru service was founded on the premise of uplifting farmers and providing a platform to springboard their livelihoods.
Registered users including farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs, will receive customised guidance and relevant information based on their interest and requirements.
The service is currently focused on providing technical advice on different mango varieties such as Karthakolamban, Willard, Vellakolumban and TJC. Many other export crops including Papaya, Pineapple and Rambutan will be added to the service.
The techniques help farmers enhance productivity and minimize wastage after harvest, in turn allowing to market the produce at competitive prices that support better living standards.
