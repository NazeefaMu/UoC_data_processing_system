Colourful, controversial and captivating - SHANE KEITH WARNE

He is a world renowned Hall of Fame. He framed the art of leg spinning/googly bowling in a sensational manner. He was a wizard in the true sense of the word. And he kept the cricket loving fraternity at their wits end by injecting controversy. SHANE KEITH WARNE, dominated the cricketing world with a 'warning'---you will not find another like me in a century of time!
WARNE loved to bathe in controversy. He was always good copy for the news hungry mediamen. This was not only in Australia, but where ever he plied his trade --- a rare trade which was like a magician pulling out a rabbit from his hat---or more precisely his baggy green cap.
Good rapport with media
When WARNE took questions from probing mediamen, he always made news. And big news at that. He would always answer questions very cleverly and with aplomb never losing his cool. He built up a good rapport with the media.
When he first sported the baggy green cap and made his appearance in Sri Lanka under the clever Allan Border, not much was known of him other than being able to bowl leg spin and the usual googly, the stock deliveries of a bowler of his type.
When he in the First Test against Sri Lanka at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground was called upon to bowl, he bowled gentle spin in the first innings causing no undue worries to the local batsmen. He was carted all over the ground as well as over it. He appeared to be just another bowler!
Batting prodigy – sub head
It was a rerun of what the Indians did to him in Australia, bashing him all over the grounds. He was treated harshly especially by Indian batting prodigy and genius Sachin Tendulkar with his youthful exuberance who treated him without scant respect. With disdain, in fact. Warne’s figures of 1 for 150 tells the mauling he took.
Going into the final day, with the wicket playing easy and a Sri Lankan victory looking certain, writing a COMMENT in the ‘DAILY NEWS’, I headlined that article – A game is not won or lost till the final ball is bowled’, extolling on the Lankans not to take it easy, but go hard at the opponents.
But the second innings of that Test with Sri Lanka was unbelievable. The Lankans were galloping to victory. Skipper Border tossed the ball to WARNE as a last resort. In the first innings WARNE had figures of 1 for 78. But Border took a risk. And what WARNE did was to befuddle three Sri Lankan batsmen and grab the last three wickets without conceding a run to give the Aussies a victory by 16 runs. At one stage the Aussies thought the match was surely lost.
History now
But the Lankans dropped their guard and the rest of that Test is history now.
It was this mesmerizing spell that launched his meteoric rise to fame, fortune and controversy and when he finally bade good bye he had left a leg spinning/googly bowling legacy with a cocktail of other deliveries that had the brand name WARNE sealed on it.
However WARNE after bowling Australia to that famous victory, failed to perform in the next Test against West Indies and was dropped for the First Test against the West Indies in the next season. But that did not deter the young bowler. He was picked for the Second Test and he hit back with a vengeance capturing 7 for 52 in the second innings and helped Australia to victory.
Mother German
WARNE was born on September 13, 1969 to German – born Bridgette and Keith Warne and made his debut in big time cricket on January 2, 1992 against India at home on the historic Sydney Cricket Ground.
And that Test against India was one that he would love to hate when the Indian batsmen walloped him slapping figures of 1 for 150 in the first innings. The wicket he had was that of the present Indian coach Ravi Shastri caught by Dean Jones for 206 off 45 overs.
In the Fourth Test at Adelaide he went wicket-less conceding 78 runs and in the Two Tests his figures were 1 for 228 had the mortification of being dropped for the next Test in Perth. His next tour was Sri Lanka and what he did has been chronicled above.
‘Ball of the century’
He made his eagerly awaited Ashes tour to England in 1993. Ashes series against the old foe is something that is looked forward to by any cricketer of both countries. And with the first ball of that series he is on record of having bowled the ‘ball of the century’ that pitched outside leg stumps, turned prodigiously to knock England captain Mike Gatting’s off bail. It bewildered the bowler, the batsmen, the commentators and everyone watching the action.
In the 1993/94 Ashes series against England in which he took 27 wickets, he also performed the one and only Test hat trick when he bagged Phil de FreItas, Darren Gough and Devon Malcom in the boxing day Test at the famed Melbourne Cricket Ground.
WARNE then continued his phenomenal success against all opposition and captured bags full of wickets. And man of the match awards kept flooding into his cupboard. He became the third spinner to take 1000 wickets in all forms of the game. The other to perform this rare feat was Muttiah Muralitheran.
Fined by ACB
WARNE along with team Mark Waugh was fined by the ACB for accepting money from a book-maker for supplying information about weather and pitch conditions. He also had the ignominy of having a ban imposed on him before the start of the World Cup and was sent home after a drug test during a one-day series in Australia proved positive for a banned diuretic.
His innocence was not accepted by the Australian Cricket Board which found WARNE guilty of breaching the Board’s Drug Code and had a one year ban slapped on him.
WARNE also proved his magic in the limited over games for Australia and in the Indian Premier league leading his team Rajasthan Royals to the plum as captain and coach.
He also captained the Australian one day team and missed by a whisker of leading the country in Test cricket. He had 37 5 wicket hauls and 10 ten wicket hauls.
Space does not permit me to detail all of WARNE’S unique achievements in a record breaking controversial, yet colorful career. He retired as the best leg spin bowler which the cricket world saw and will not see again with 708 wickets. Off spinner Muralitheran went past him to bag 800 Test wickets.
