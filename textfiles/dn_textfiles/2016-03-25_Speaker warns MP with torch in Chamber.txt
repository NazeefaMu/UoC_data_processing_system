Speaker warns MP with torch in Chamber

 
UPFA MP Sisira Jayakody brought a torch to the Chamber yesterday and flashed it in protest against recent power cuts. Since MP Jayakody
turned on the torch while Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya was making a ministerial statement on the power cuts, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya advised him to turn off the torch and take his seat. The MP urged the government to provide each citizen with a torch as
regular power cuts have become a normal event these days.
