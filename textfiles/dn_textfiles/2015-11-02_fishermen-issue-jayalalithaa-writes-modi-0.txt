Fishermen issue: Jayalalithaa writes to Modi

Jayalalithaa
Worried over repeated instances of Indian fishermen being apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking "a lasting solution to this long-pending vexatious problem."
In her letter, the Chief Minister said: "This livelihood issue of thousands of our fisherfolk needs your personal intervention."
Recalling that she had written seven letters regarding the pathetic plight of 86 fishermen from Tamil Nadu who have been incarcerated in Sri Lankan jails and whose boats impounded by the Sri Lankan authorities, Jayalalithaa said the External Affairs Ministry, in response to her request, had informed the state that the Sri Lankan government had expressed its readiness for the simultaneous release of fishermen in custody on both sides.
State government officers had been in constant touch with the External Affairs Ministry officials and they have been told that all the fishermen from Tamil Nadu would soon reach home after fulfilling the required formalities.
Even as Tamil Nadu is eagerly awaiting their arrival, six more fishermen, along with their mechanised boat from Rameswaram, were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on October 31 and taken to Thalaimannar, Jayalalithaa pointed out.
