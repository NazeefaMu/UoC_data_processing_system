Trains cancelled  over shortage  of railway guards

Several trains were cancelled yesterday and the day before due to the shortage of railway guards, Railway Control Room stated.
“The railway guards have gone on leave for personal reasons.
It is not a trade union action,” the Railway Control Room sources said.
“On April 30, a total 16 rail turns were cancelled and on May 1, eight were cancelled. All those cancelled were to leave from Colombo,” the sources said.
The railway guards are expected to report to work by May 1 evening and train operations will return to normal by Tuesday (02).
