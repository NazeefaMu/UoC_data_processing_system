Conference on Role of Youth in Reconciliation

The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka, operating under the Ministry of Defence, together with the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, held a one-day joint conference on the Role of Youth in Reconciliation.
The conference was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on December 12 with over 100 participants representing the Sri Lankan youth.
The inauguration ceremony was graced by National Integration and Reconciliation Minister A.H.M. Fowzie.
Delivering the keynote address, Minister Fowzie underlined how sustainable peace would not be a reality unless there is unity amongst people of all races and religions.
Director General of INSSSL Asanga Abeyagoonasekare noted that the conflict experienced by the youth in the country was a burden that was passed down to generations. Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation V. Sivagnanasothy, highlighted the contribution the Ministry has been making in terms of reconciliation mechanisms operating in educational and media spheres. The Secretary of Defence Kapila Waidyaratne PC further stressed this point by underlining how the youth of today will be the decision makers of Sri Lanka in the future, hence making it crucial to embed the ideas of peace and coexistence in their mindset so that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated. The Secretary of Defence also commended the INSSSL and the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation for implementing such a thematic workshop.
As a pioneering initiative, speakers of the conference comprised a cross-section of youth activists involved in reconciliation initiatives from both the North and the South who shared the platform with members of the civil society and leading academics who are involved in peace and reconciliation studies. The conference was conducted in all three languages to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing amongst participants.
The highlight of the session was the presentation made by Sivakumaran Vinesh who is a beneficiary of Sri Lanka’s successful rehabilitation programme. Being a rehabilitated former member of the LTTE, he spoke of the experiences faced by rehabilitated former combatants whilst a considerable number of beneficiaries were also present in the audience. Vinesh emphasised the success he has had after being reintegrated into the society as a rehabilitated beneficiary. He also highlighted the hardships and challenges his peers and himself face.
Certificates were distributed to moderators and speakers by Prof. Chandra Embuldeniya, member of the Advisory Council of INSSSL. A report on the outcomes of the conference will be presented to the President.
