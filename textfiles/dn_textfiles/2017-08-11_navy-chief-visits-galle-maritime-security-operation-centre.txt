Navy chief visits Galle maritime security operation centre

Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne visited the Galle Maritime Security Operations Centre on an inspection tour recently.
The main purpose of the visit has to observe the preparations at the centre to provide security to commercial vessels of the Netherlands crisscrossing the Indian ocean. Dutch marines manning commercial vessels owned by the Netherlands are expected to obtain security cover from the Galle operations centre and store their weapons at the centre in accordance with an MoU signed between Sri Lanka and the Netherlands on May 16.
The Netherlands which owns the world's most modern commercial ships has a fleet over 1,200 commercial vessels owned by shipping firms such as Nedloyd, Netherland lines and Epil which service the Indian ocean ports. On the directions of the President, the Navy took over the duty of providing facilities to maritime security teams on November 13, 2015.
The Navy's maritime security operation centres in Galle, Hambantota and Colombo have earned Rs. 3,855,685,681 to state coffers by providing security to 11,105 ship movements in the Indian Ocean.
