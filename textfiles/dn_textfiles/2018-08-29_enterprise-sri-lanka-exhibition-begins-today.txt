Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition begins today

The first of the island-wide Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibitions would begin under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Moneragala, at 4.00 pm, today. It would be open for the public from 10.00 am to 12.00 am, before ending on August 31. Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, along with Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Deputy Mass Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, visited the site where the exhibition would be held, yesterday, to oversee its final arrangements.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe would provide land deeds to 800 families in Moneragala during the opening ceremony.
The event would comprise 515 stalls, with the participation of 204 persons from local and foreign corporate sectors. It would highlight the government’s interest-subsidised loan scheme (Enterprise Sri Lanka), which aims to boost entrepreneurship in villages, as well as the Gamperaliya initiative launched to boost rural infrastructure development.
Development work focussing on roads, schools and public playgrounds under the Gamperaliya project, would begin along with the exhibition. Three green parks would also be constructed in Moneragala, Wellawaya and Bibile, today. Moneragala Government Agent Padma Kulasuriya said each park would consist a meditation centre, gymnasium, jogging path and library.Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that Moneragala was selected because it was one of the poorest regions in the country. Several village-level infrastructure projects would also begin parallel to the exposition.
Enterprise Sri Lanka, launched with funds worth Rs.5.2 billion, comprises 16 credit financing schemes under three categories: interest-subsidy loan scheme, donor-funded refinance loan scheme, and financial and non-financial support, the minister said.
The government would allocate Rs.32 billion for Gamperaliya during the next four months and the ‘Budget – 2019’ to be presented to Parliament in November, would also provide more funds to the project in future, he added.
Minister Samaraweera said that Enterprise Sri Lanka’s second and third exhibitions would be held in Anuradhapura and Jaffna, adding that special bus services would be provided for people visiting them.
