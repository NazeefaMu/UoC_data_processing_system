Programme launched in Maruthamunai to develop Children's Park

A shramadhana campaign was held at the Children's Park located near Mazoor Mawlana Housing Scheme in Maruthamunai under the purview of A. M. Rakeeb, the newly elected Mayor for Kalmunai Municipal Council recently.
The shramadhana campaign was the first phase of the development programme of the Children's Park in Maruthamunai. The newly elected Mayor Rakeeb took necessary action to clean the premises of the park to enable it for the use of the children in the vicinity, with the support of the employees and machinery of the Kalmunai Municipal Council.
Due to various reasons, the park was not properly maintained and enabled for the use of the children in the area.
Rakeeb said, "the mental and physical health of the children are very important than the others. Today, most of the children are not playing in the ground, but they all play games by using mobile phones and computers. They are addicted to the modern technology. It also helps them to learn and spend the time leisurely, but playing games in the ground only helps them to be healthy people in the world".
The Municipal Council Commissioner J. Liyakath Ali and Memeber of KMC M. S. Umar Ali joined with the Mayor A. M. Rakeeb to inspect the progress of the work.
