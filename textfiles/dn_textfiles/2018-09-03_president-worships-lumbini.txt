President worships Lumbini

President Maithripala Sirisena attended the 4th Summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in Kathmandu, Nepal and commenced his two-day State visit in Nepal with the conclusion of the Summit on Saturday.
He worshiped several religious places including Lumbini, the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama.
The Chief Minister of the province and the Minister of the Culture warmly received the President on his arrival at the venue.
The President engaged in religious observances and the authorities had made arrangements for the Sri Lankan President to worship the sacred area where the Prince Siddhartha took his first step forward after the birth, by touching the place. This is an exceptional opportunity that no other State leader would receive when visiting the Lumbini.
Ven. Galahapitiya Premaratana Nayaka Thera, the Trustee of the Lumbini-Sri Lanka Maha Viharaya, did the religious observances and invoked the blessing on the President and the delegation.
The President informed the officers to apprise him on the development carried out by the Lumbini Development Foundation and said that he will provide every possible assistance in this regard.
President Sirisena worshiped the Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini. A special memento was presented to the President at the temple.
He visited the Sri Lanka Maha Viharaya at the Lumbini and paid homage to the sacred relics at the temple.
The President visited the Dutugamunu Pilgrims Rest as well and inquired into its shortages. It is constructed for Sri Lankan devotees. A Na sapling was planted at the premises to mark the visit of the President.
The President joined the religious observances at the Pashupatinath, a famous sacred Hindu kovil, yesterday. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.
