MR says ready to support SLFP form Government

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, said that he was not ready to take over the Government, but would extend his support to the Government under a SLFP Prime Minister.
“What we wish is to have an early Parliamentary election and we are working for it,” he said.
Rajapaksa said that the Joint Opposition would contest the upcoming elections under the
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna, while the SLFP candidates vying for future elections could also join the SLPP.
The Former President was addressing foreign correspondents based in Colombo yesterday. Replying to Government’s allegations the the SLPP had failed to win 50 per cent of voters, the former President added that his camp would receive 75 per cent of SLFP votes at a National election. He stressed that the SLPP had not been involved in any sort of incident that took place in Kandy and elsewhere, recently.
