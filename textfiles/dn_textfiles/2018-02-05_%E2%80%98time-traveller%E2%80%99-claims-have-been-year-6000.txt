‘Time traveller’ claims to have been to the year 6000

Step aside Doctor Who, this man says he has been to the future and has a photo to prove it.
The bizarre video shows the ‘time traveller’, who’s face is blurred, meeting a reporter at an undisclosed location to reveal what he knows about ‘secret technologies’ and what the future holds for humanity in the year 6000.
The self-appointed whistleblower, who has his voice distorted, claims to have been part of a secret program to send people forward in time in the 1990s.
He says advances in medicine, government and new technology will make modern life seem ‘primitive’, and humankind lives in peace under the benevolent rule of an AI overlord.
To prove his point, in the middle of a rambling speech he produces a photo of what an unnamed city. Unfortunately it is so blurred it has more in common with a Monet watercolour painting than a futuristic cityscape.
But hold your horses - he claims: “In the time travel process pictures tend to get distorted, as well as many other things.
He adds: “I know a lot of you are going to find my story extremely hard to believe and I don’t blame you and if I was watching somebody claim these same things I myself would most likely not believe them. “It is not my intention to deceive anybody, I simply want to spread a message about the future of humanity and where the world is heading. “I have seen the way the world’s changed and the technologies that have emerged it would blow your mind if you only knew the technologies that exist in the year 6000.”
In a bizarre twist, the ‘time traveller’ begins weeping as he reveals he left a close friend behind who can never return. I know he’s in a good place. In a way the future is like a utopia but sadly when we attempted to travel back we couldn’t. I just wanted to see him one more time.”
In an apparent reference to the film ‘Downsizing’, he adds that in the future technology will allow people to shrink down so space won’t be a problem.
Whether you beleive him or not you won’t have long to wait - he says time travel will become common knowledge by 2028. The vid, was uploaded earlier this month to ApexTV, a channel specialising in mysteries and the paranormal . It already has more than 3 million views.
