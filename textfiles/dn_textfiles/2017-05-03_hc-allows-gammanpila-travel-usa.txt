HC allows Gammanpila to travel to USA

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila to travel to USA from May 18 to 24.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for allegedly cheating Rs. 20 million and misappropriation of another Rs. 21 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, had sought Colombo High Court’s permission to temporary lift his travel ban.
Defence Counsel Thushara Dissanayake appearing for MP Gammanpila moved High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa that his client be allowed to travel to the USA between May 18 and May 24 to participate in a religious programme.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the prosecution would not raise objections to the request.
