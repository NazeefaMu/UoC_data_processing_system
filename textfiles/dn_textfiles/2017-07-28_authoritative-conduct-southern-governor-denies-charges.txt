Authoritative conduct: Southern Governor denies charges

Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara denied charges leveled against him by Provincial Councillor Chamly Withanachchi over an alleged authoritative administrative conduct as the Governor at the Southern Provincial council Meeting on Tuesday.
The governor made this observation at a media briefing at his secretariat yesterday.
A group of councillors who entered the council chamber wearing cloth trips on their arms expressed their objection over the alleged authoritative administrative conduct of Governor Hema Kumara Nanayakkara at the council meeting and the removal of the North Central Province Council Chairman by way of no confidence which was subjected to controversies.
The policy statement of the fourth session of the seventh Southern Provincial Council presented by the governor on July 4 was debated according to the agenda of the meeting.
