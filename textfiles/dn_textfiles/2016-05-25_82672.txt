Bordeaux's scrum-half Adams to retire

 
Bordeaux, Monday: Former South Africa international scrum-half Heini Adams announced on Monday that he will retire from rugby union at the end of the season.
The 35-year-old is currently playing for Bordeaux-Begles in the French Top 14, and is hoping to help them win a first national title.
They currently sit just one point outside the sixth and final playoff spot with two regular season games remaining.
Adams has been a key player for Bordeaux since joining in 2010 from Super Rugby side Bulls, helping the French club win promotion to the top flight in his first season. -AFP
