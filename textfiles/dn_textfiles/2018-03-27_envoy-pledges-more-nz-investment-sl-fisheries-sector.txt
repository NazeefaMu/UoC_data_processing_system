New Zealand High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Joanna Kempkers has pledged to encourage more investment from New Zealand in Sri Lanka’s fisheries sector.
She made this promise at a discussion held recently with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, at his official residence.
They discussed various facets of the bilateral relations between the two countries and the High Commissioner also pledged to share New Zealand’s experience with creating a management system for the sustainable development of the marine fisheries sector, since they were the pioneers in developing such a system. Measures will be taken to provide training in fisheries management for Sri Lankan officials as well as partners of the fisheries sector.
According to the Minister, a fish processing project with New Zealand investment is ongoing in Mannar and the investor concerned has pledged to invest further in the fisheries sector.
