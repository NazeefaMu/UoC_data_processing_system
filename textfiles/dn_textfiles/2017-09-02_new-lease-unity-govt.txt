New lease for Unity Govt.

President Maithripala Sirisena has laid it down in black and white. The Unity Government comprising the UNP and SLFP will run its full course until 2020.The MOU signed between the two parties will come up for renewal in December. But he was confident the union will continue, the President told newspaper editors, media heads and publishers at a breakfast meeting on Wednesday.
The President also said he would run the government until 2020 irrespective who leaves it or who comes in. He said, for the first time in the country's post independence history, the two major parties, who were at each other's throats, have come together to serve the people. He was certain that the arrangement will last despite some hiccups on the way.
Of course there is no alternative but for the two main protagonists to coalesce. No party had received a majority in parliament and only chaos can ensue in the absence of a working arrangement. It should also be recalled that a Unity Government was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesignhe's brainchild, for both parties to be equal stakeholders in the government, when, as the leader of the party with the largest majority in parliament, he could have easily engineered some crossovers.
Certainly, there is no reason for the UNP and SLFP to be daggers drawn any more. The SLFP, as a party, had long ago shed its socialist ideology and protectionist economy policies. The party has CBK to thank for that. She not only divested the SLFP from it's inward looking approach and socialist hangovers, but also bettered the greens in her zeal to continue with the market economy, famously saying she, who was once good socialist, will now be a good capitalist. Not only that, she completely rolled back her mother's protectionist agenda and even invited the Shell Company to whom Mrs. B showed the door, back into the country, with no qualms whatsoever.
Hence, the SLFP, at present, will have no trouble in adapting itself to the new reality and meld with the UNP in its thinking and outlook. Vituperative and contentious politics had taken this country nowhere except backwards. Hence, it is incumbent on both parties to set aside all petty differences and work for the common good of the country. Those who want to leave the alliance, as the President said, are welcome to do so. There has been speculation that some ministers in the SLFP are on the verge of quitting the government. Some of their recent remarks, no doubt, are indicative of where their sympathies lay. But they will be making a big political miscalculation if they harbour the thought that the SLFP voters are still with them. Having consorted with the ‘enemy’, they are bound to be regarded with scorn and contempt. With the general election a full three years away, those planning to quit will have to remain in the wilderness for that long, either with the Joint Opposition or as Independents, shorn off all ministerial perks. And like the President hinted, commenting on the attempts to divide the SLFP, those being cast adrift from the party would soon find out that they are orphaned. He recalled the fissures experienced by both the UNP and the SLFP at some point of time in their journeys, observing that the ultimate refuge (for all renegades) lay in the original party, be it the SLFP or UNP, in a clear dig at the Joint Opposition.
The President, no doubt, had precedents to go by. UNP and SLFP stalwarts who left their parties to set up splinter groups invariably returned back to the fold. Neither of these splinter groups succeeded on their own, as the results of the by- elections that followed the parting showed. Only Vijaya Kumaratunga managed to push the SLFP into third place at the Minneriya by-election in 1985 contesting from his breakaway Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, which, though, was decimated in the other three by elections held at the same time.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, may, or, may not, be as popular as Vijaya but only his hardcore supporters will vote for him at a future election if he contests from outside the SLFP, while the rest of the JO caboodle will be consigned to the status of also rans.
The President said; “only the SLFP has a vision and a policy framework. The party is guided by them. Political parties with individual agendas cannot function in the long run”.
It is time that those from the SLFP faction of the Unity Government who are planning to align with the JO ponder the fate that is in store for them before falling into the pile of also rans. The Yahapalanaya administration may have erred in some ways. But it is doubtful if the public are yearning for a return of Rajapaksa rule which they ended only two and a half years ago. With the Unity Government now set to continue its full term, it is hoped that the President and the Government will fulfill all the promises made to the people.
