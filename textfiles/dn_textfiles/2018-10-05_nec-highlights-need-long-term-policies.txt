NEC highlights need for long term policies

The need for a long term economic policy which will ease local businesses while facilitating exports in the backdrop of a rupee depreciation was discussed at the National Economic Council (NEC).
State and private sector stakeholders participated at the meeting. National Economic Council Secretary General and Chief Economist Prof. Lalith Samarakoon said views were expressed on the depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar and mechanisms by the state and private sector in response to this.
“It was discussed that if we used our foreign reserves to defend the rupee hastily, the country may run the risk of running out of funds to pay off debts in the next few years,” he said. Many had agreed that the government needs to have a long term economic policy which protects and insulates the operation of local business along with both short to medium term objectives that gives imports an impetus.
Trade liberalisation of various sectors was cautioned as it would have a negative impact on local sectors.
“If people do not support such initiatives, any effort to liberalise trade will be futile and it would collapse,” he said.
He referred to the liberalisation of the shipping sector, where it was discussed that shipping agents bring in 800 million USD and if the sector was liberalised, this would be lost. Various stakeholders had discussed that investor confidence was dipping in the backdrop of corruption, instability and a struggling economy. Private sector stakeholders had mentioned that the taxes were too high and that the government should incentivise it if it was going to increase exports.
Others had said that the construction sector was collapsing because contracts were mostly handed to foreign companies and there is a need to prioritise local companies in these processes. The inefficiencies of the government in managing its resources were discussed as being another drawback, there was a widespread recognition that implementation across the board was weak.
Some argued that although the country had signed free trade agreements, it had not made significant trade between those nations that it entered into FTAs with, and neither was there any plan to promote this.
“The upcoming budget will be key in solving structural problems, tax reforms, trade deficits, State-owned-enterprise reforms, clamp down on government expenditure,” Samarakoon said.
