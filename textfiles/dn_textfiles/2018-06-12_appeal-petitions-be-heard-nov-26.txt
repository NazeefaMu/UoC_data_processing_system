Controversial sil redi distribution case
Appeal petitions to be heard on Nov 26

Two appeal petitions, filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court, were yesterday fixed for argument on November 26 by the Court of Appeal.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
When the two appeal petitions came up before Court of Appeal Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, both Weeratunga and Palpita were directed to file their written submissions on October 5.
The Attorney General was directed to file his written submissions on October 5.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC over the controversial sil redi (fabric used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2018.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither a sum of Rs. 600 million nor a part of it was utilised by them for their personal gains. They further stated that the High Court judge had given them a short period of time (13 days) to pay off the compensations.
While handing out a lengthy judgement, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015 Presidential Election.
While observing that a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. two million and in default of the payment of fine, they will have to serve an additional one year’s imprisonment.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former TRC Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015 Presidential Election campaign. They were found guilty of all charges.
Counsel Kanchana Ratwatte with J. Ratnayake appeared for the appellant-accused. Senior State Counsel Jayalakshi Silva appeared for the Attorney General.
