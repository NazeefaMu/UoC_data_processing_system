Java Lane, Army to meet in FA Cup final

Java Lane and Sri Lanka Army qualified to play in the final of the FA Cup Football Tournament by beating Saunders (5-3 on penalties) and Colombo Football Club 3-2 respectively in the semi-finals played at the Sugathadasa Stadium on Saturday. The final will be played on May 20 (Saturday) under floodlights at the same venue.
In the first semi-final Saunders opened scoring through a header by S. Niresh from a corner kick by Krishantha Abeysekera to make it 1-0 in the 61st minute. Ten minutes later Java Lane made it 1-all when Naveen Jude scored a goal after receiving a pass from Janaka Chaminda. The score remained 1-all at the final whistle and in the penalty shootout Java Lane won 5-3.
In the second semi-final, Army scored two goals in the first half through Mohamed Issadeen who added a third early in the second half to make it 3-nil. Colombo FC came back storming in the last 20 minutes to score two goals through Dilan Kaushalya but could not prevent the soldiers from emerging victorious 3-2. This is the first time that Java Lane has entered a FA Cup final since the club was formed in 1968.
