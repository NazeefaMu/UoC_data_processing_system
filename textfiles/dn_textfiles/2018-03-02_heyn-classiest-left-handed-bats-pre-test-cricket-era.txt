HEYN, classiest of left handed bats in pre Test cricket era

Left hand batsmen, like left arm bowlers are a rarity in cricket. And when they do come, they are graceful, elegant, stylish and eye catching treats to watch when in action as batsmen or bowlers.
PETER DAVID HEYN belonged to the class of classy left hand batsmen that Sri Lanka has produced. Although not in the class of the international players HEYN , could have blossomed into one if Sri Lanka in his time had the chance to play international cricket.
A product of St.Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya he joined the class of another Peterite from the same school, Clive Inman. Both sadly showed their magic long before Sri Lanka was welcome as a Test nation by the arrogant lords at Lord’s.
In Colin Bland class
HEYN not only showed his excellence as a left hand stroke player, but also as a cover fielder of the calibre of South Africa’s Colin Bland. Had HEYN been born after Sri Lanka’s admission to the big league, he would certainly have been written in cricket’s history books.
But as a schoolboy and club cricketer first at the Burgher Recreation Club and later Nondescripts Cricket Club, he showed and proved his class that was far above an average cricketer that also had the promise and potential being bracketed with world class products.
HEYN played in two of the inaugural 1975 World Cup games against West Indies at Manchester on June 7 and against Pakistan at Nottingham on June 14, But failed to make a lasting impression. However in first class cricket in the country he showed his classic talent and potential playing 50 games scoring a bag full of 2625 runs with a highest score of 136. He also made 4 hundreds and 16 half centuries.
Pre Test cricket era
HEYN had it in him to join the classic left hander’s mentioned above, but unfortunately during the time he excelled in the game, the country had not attained Test status. As a left hand batsman, excellent cover fielder and penetrative medium pace bowler he would have been master class and a must in any word class team.
HEYN had a baptism of fire when he first made his debut for the country against the West Indies at the Colombo Oval in 1967. His selection was controversial and when he walked into bat a section of the spectators were baying for his blood, giving him a welcome boo to the centre.
But at the end it was HEYN who had the last laugh making a masterly 69 timing his shots and scoring with graceful sweeps and square cuts and at the end of his great knock that rescued his tea from 95 for 5 when he took guard his critics could not help but cheer him because that knocked helped Sri Lanka make over 400 with an unforgettable last wicket stand of 110 in 55 swashbuckling hitting by two former illustrious Thomian all rounders who are no more Ian Pieris and Neil Chanmugam.
Memorable tour
However his best and memorable tour was to India where against the home team who had world class spinners of the caliber of Bishen Singh Bedi, Chandrasekhar, Prasanna, Venkataraghaven, Shilvakar and Joshi he made scores of 100, 84, 30 and 50. After he quit the game in 1976 he left the shores to the home of cricket England and padded up for Richmond and Berkshire cc where after enjoying the game he loved best put aside his cricketing gear which would have hurt him inside which went to prove that all good things in life must come to an end.
On a personal note, I had the opportunity to play against and with him. First in inter-school cricket where he was my first victim when I took a hat-trick with three googlies. First HEYN stumped by Ranjit Fernando the second wicket was Tyronne Le Mercier who was bowled and then Aditha de Silva who was LBW. also failing to read the googly.
School game at Kotahena
This game was between St.Peter’s and St.Benedict’s played at Kotahena in 1961. Later we were mates in the Board President’s X1 that played Hong Kong under Michael Tissera in 1972.
Lankan left handers
Its apt to recall Sri Lankan lefties who joined that classiest of Internationals in Sanath Jayasuiriya and Kumar Sangakkara with Jayasuriya joining the 300 plus company when he made 340 against India.
While recalling these local heroes of our time its apt to reminisce on International left hand batsmen who left their indelible marks such as Australians Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey, England’s David Gower and of course the greatest ‘lefties’ in our generation were the left handed Don Bradman Sir Garfield st. Auburn Sobers and Brian 'King' Charles Lara of the West Indies.
Sobers broke Sir Leonard Hutton’s record score of 364 that stood for a long time and Lara was simply great when he broke his countrymen’s record after seeing Australia’s left hander Matthew Hayden go past Lara’s record and then as if taking it as an insult made a glorious unbeaten 400 in a Test against England that will probably stand the test of time.
Incidentally an achievement that Sri Lanka could be well proud of is that Lara is the godfather of one of Sri Lanka’s leading businessman Gamini and Manel Edirisinghe’s grand daughter Sharmilka and daughter of Achira and Suresh Edirisinghe. Lara is a very dear friend of the Edirisinghe Bros the leading Auto Court people.
The HEYN'S are an integral part of Sri Lanka cricket where they gave their hearts and soul for the betterment of the game. HEYN’S father Russel who was a Royalist too played hockey and cricket and later captained the country and after retirement headed the Sri Lanka Cricket Board for a few years. Rising to Major General he commanded the Army. David’s mum Edna was President of the Women’s Hockey Federation for awhile. His brother Richard captained St.Peter’s at cricket and hockey and played for the BRC.
