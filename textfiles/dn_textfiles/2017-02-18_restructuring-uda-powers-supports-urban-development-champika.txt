Restructuring UDA powers supports urban development: Champika

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the UDA, restructuring its powers, delegated to the local authorities in 1985, is a positive move and it supports urban development in the country.
The minister said this while participating as chief guest in “Lanka Property Show 2017” yesterday at the JAIC Hilton, Colombo. "Over the past few years, the real estate development sector directly contributed to more than 30 percent of Sri Lanka’s economy and indirectly much more," he said.
Minister Ranawaka said his ministry and its institutions have already started restructuring the urban development in Sri Lanka.
“We expect to gift Sri Lanka with a<U+200B> national physical planning policy and more competitive plan for the entire island with a strong policy on housing and urban development along with safeguarding environment. The plan will be ready within this year,” he said.
He said the ministry expects to complete a strategic development plan for all urban areas in Sri Lanka within next few years.
“They will be prepared with adequate understandings of the demand for land, space, potentials and constraints for investment. They will be prepared with wider participation of developers, business community and the public and will be collectively decided and have no secret documents,” he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the plans will be pro-development and not restrictive.
He said the details will be made available to all through internet and the public have access to information. All projects will be reviewed and planning clearances, building permits and certificates of conformity will be issued soon, he said.
