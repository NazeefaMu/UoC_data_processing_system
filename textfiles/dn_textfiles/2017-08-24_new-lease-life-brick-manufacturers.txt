New lease of life for brick manufacturers

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi had launched a programme to give a new lease of life to brick manufacturers in the Tangalle DS area.
Those who engage in the brick-manufacturing industry and newcomers to the industry will be helped financially under the programme. A workshop was also held in Tangalle recently, to educate brick manufacturers on new brick-manufacturing technology.
At the initial stage, 150 brick manufacturers and 60 newcomers to the industry would be awarded cash to develop their industries.
Secretary to the State Minister Ravidu Vedaarachchi and Industries and Commercial Activities District Director S. W. Rajapaksa were also present at the workshop.
Meanwhile, brick manufacturers at Mahindapura in the Tissamaharama DS area had been left high and dry due to the lack of water and firewood. Manufacturers said that as a result of strict rules and regulations imposed by the Department of Forest Conservation, the transport of firewood is impossible.
They added that they had to use paddy husk as an alternative, which is Rs. 700 per tractor load.
