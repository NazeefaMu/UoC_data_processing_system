Playing with words

 Words are easy for politicians and in politics, depending which class is involved. Take the word, ‘the people’ for example. It came with the democratic revolution where masses in large numbers participated in mass actions. It’s hard to think of a term that has been abused since.
It is in the name of the people all things done. In the feudal society, things were done in the name of the country or the sovereign. Now it’s all ‘in the name of the people’ isn’t it? Then the nation replaced the country and has a lot of utility value, and has been used and abused all over the world and across history; and then, with franchise and democratic debates emerged the ‘civil society’.
Organised working class
Civil society can be loosely defined as “the aggregate of non-governmental organisations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens” and includes the family and the private sphere, referred to as the “third sector” of society, distinct from government and business.” In other words it represents the large middle class that seek independent within bourgeoisie regime and the organised working class. It is supposed to give identity to hopelessly divided middle class. Hence refers to “a community of citizens linked by common interests and collective activity” and as such implies all manner of collectives, regardless of size.
However in usage it is the emphasis of this definition that dominates. It’s useful, to say collective activity, for political purposes. In usage, it would (like to) count every single unorganised citizen who is not a TU member, politician or a business owner. Perhaps this is why those who call themselves representatives of civil society see ‘civil society’ as an alternative to trade unions and governments.
Of course one can raise the question what really is civil society in Lanka? How representative are those who claim to speak on behalf of those, whose memberships are generally assumed. When in the past society was dominated by racist black hundreds, civil society with the help of left oriented trade unions, organised protests mostly at Lipton’s Circus. These were ‘peace demonstration’ or rather demonstrations for peace, meaning agitation to put a stop to military repression of Tamil liberation struggle and to go for political solution to the Tamil national problem. Most of the key voices in that civil society collective were and still are ardent advocates of power sharing, some occasions endorsing moves to direct talks between the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka. Some of these peace demonstrations were organised by women’s organisations. Interestingly some times these were organised by ‘100 women’s organisations’ getting together. However under the condition of fascistic terror some times less than 100 turned up!
Major political parties
It is true that captains of peace industry too worked within the norms set by the major parties in the country. I was, and I am a dedicated fighter for liberation of Tamils. But if am asked to come for a demonstration beyond Slave-Island I will request transport and something to fill the empty stomach. Hence civil society generally collected money from donor organisations to mobilize mass campaigns. But it should be noted; almost all who came to anti war campaigns, did so daring to face death. Hence when asked from a civil society person, on the sidelines of talks between the then government and the LTTE in Celigny, Switzerland, how many people he could bring to a demonstration if he didn’t receive funds from donor agencies. He was honest. None, he said. Membership, even temporary membership, has a price tag then. Yes, not too different to the rice packet, alcohol and a few hundred bucks plus transport that are spent to purchase support for the two major political parties in the country, one observes. Yes, these are the norms set by corrupt fascistic ruler of the country.
Civil society, however, assumes the kind of purity (of purpose, work and practice) that politicians in the past had, some even today dare not demand or, as of late, would not bother claiming. On the one hand, politicians seek and obtain votes. They are up for election. They are up for rejection. So are the activists in the civil society. Those who are not committed and have no social liberation vision will be exposed in the struggle and pushed out; and in the end nobody to help and nobody remember.
