Proteas no one to blame but themselves

South Africa has earned the tag of chokers for no other reason than failing to perform on the big stage. Their recent fall from grace was in the ongoing ICC Champions trophy in England where they folded without a fight in a crucial Group B match to hand to defending champions India a comfortable eight-wicket win with 12 overs to spare at the Oval. It was one more instance where South Africa has been knocked out of another global event. On this occasion South Africa had no one to blame but themselves for their shoddy performance. It was a must win game for both teams and everyone expected South Africa, the current number one ranked ODI side to come out with all guns blazing against India. But what we saw was a comedy of errors.
Within five balls of each other South Africa who was comfortably placed at 139-2 lost two crucial wickets to run outs that turned the game in India’s favour. Skipper AB de Villiers was run out responding to Faf du Plessis call and immediately afterwards three runs later David Miller, one of the hardest hitters in one-day cricket also followed his captain when he found himself at the same end as Du Plessis. South Africa never recovered from these stupid dismissals and to add insult to injury they suffered a third run out that ended the innings at 191 in 44.3 overs when Imran Tahir was also dismissed short of his crease. It was an awful batting display by one of the best batting teams in the world.
Over the years South Africa have been at the receiving end of so many global cricket events that finds this rainbow nation with only one victory in an ICC conducted tournament – that is in the inaugural Champions Trophy held in Bangladesh in 1998 where they beat West Indies in the final by four wickets under the captaincy of the late Hansie Cronje. We all know what an incredible team South Africa is and how much they have contributed to world cricket. They have given us some mind blowing players like Allan Donald, Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock, Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers to name a few.
But their chequered history has been replete with performances that have given them the tag of perennial chokers in major tournaments having lost all seven of their knockout matches in ICC tournaments over the past 22 years.
Here are some of the matches which led them to earn the title chokers:
l 1992 World Cup semi-final vs. England:
SA needed 22 of 13 balls when it started to rain and the D/L method came into action. When play resumed, South Africa were given an impossible target of 22 from 1 ball. Technically not their fault but it all started from here.
l 1996 World Cup quarterfinal vs. West Indies:
South Africa needed 265 to win from 50 overs. They started off well and were cruising at 186/3. But they lost the next 8 wickets for 59 runs and with it the match. South Africa had won all 10 ODI’s prior to this match and on form the target was gettable. But they choked.
l 1999 World Cup semi-final vs. Australia:
South Africa needed 9 runs off the final over. The first two balls were hit for 4’s by Lance Klusener and they needed one run off 4 balls. But there was a horrific misunderstanding in running between the wickets between Klusener and last man Allan Donald that led to a dramatic run out which resulted in a tie and South Africa’s exit from the tournament.
l 2003 World Cup group match vs. Sri Lanka:
Another rain interrupted match for South Africa. They did some horrible calculations with regard to the Duckworth/Lewis method and Mark Boucher, the man on strike got the wrong message. He hit a six off the penultimate ball of a Muthiah Muralitharan over and punched the air thinking they are ahead of D/L method. He just played the last ball down casually and didn’t score a run. When play was stopped according to the D/L method the match was tied. Sri Lanka went through to the Super Six. “South Africa lost because of its own mistakes,” said Frank Duckworth who devised the rain rule with fellow-mathematician Tony Lewis. “Both Shaun Pollock and Sanath Jayasuriya had the same papers with the run-rates. Sanath read it right and Shaun didn’t.”
l 2007 World Cup semi-final vs. Australia:
South Africa managed only 149 runs and Australia scored them inside 32 overs to win by seven wickets.
l 2011 World Cup quarterfinal vs. New Zealand:
Chasing 222, South Africa were well placed at 108/2 but again collapsed like a pack of cards, losing 8 wickets for 64 runs to be bundled out for 172.
l 2015 World Cup semi-final vs. New Zealand:
In another rain affected match South Africa scored a defendable 281-5 of 43 overs. According to D/L, New Zealand needed 298 from 43 overs. South Africa stayed in the match till the last over. New Zealand needed 6 of the last 2 balls. Grant Elliot hit a six off Dayle Steyn for New Zealand to win with one ball to spare.
When South Africa can get this unfortunate monkey off their back only time will tell. But for the moment they will have to live with it.
