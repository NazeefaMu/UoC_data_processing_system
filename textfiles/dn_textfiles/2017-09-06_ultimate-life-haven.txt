The ultimate life haven

What makes a ‘miracle’? At The Sri Mangalarama Temple, Wahalkada Kebithigollewa patients do share stories of extraordinary recoveries.
Comments made by a Leukemia patient who got cured
There is no magic here but a devoted mindset fine tuned to be empowered by Vishvashakthi through Buddha Shakthi with the spirit of Sri Patthinidevi. Commit yourself to a calendar to practise an honest religious, medical, physical, clinical, social, and spiritual lifestyle.
As you drive deep into the countryside in the North-Central Province, passing the Morawewa Elephant Orphanage adjoining the Wahalkada Natural Tank and the Yan Oya Reservoir at Kebithigollawa, you enter a certain atmospheric condition that makes you feel good physically and mentally. Miracles do happen, and it’s proven right here.
Pattini anklet
The legend has it that Gajabahu I of Anuradhapura (A.D. 114 - 136) on his return from India victoriously with 12000 men as prisoners, also brought with him the Pattini anklet. The king built the Devalaya enshrining the Pattini anklet at a place where he stopped to rest on his return to Anuradhapura. A different presentation of the legend says that the Goddess Pattini came from India with 12000 devotees formed 16 castes and settled in this area.
Patients who seek cure must live within the temple premises for at least 21 days and undergo a highly disciplinary procedure of conduct of medication which must be continued with the present medication until you get scientific evidence to prove that your problem is no more!
At the end, a comparison is made through medical reports which are submitted by the patient himself by going through the hospital or a reputed laboratory.
The physician monk treats the patient on early hours on Wednesday and Saturday and informs the condition. Chief Incumbent of the temple Most Venerable Rathnapure Dhamma kusala Thera uses the spirit of Goddess Patthini and surprisingly some patients get cured within a few hours some within days as some take time as per the medical treatment that patient had obtained. Many locals irrespective of religion, community, most rich to the poor queue up here at an equal platform for survival.
Sri Lankans across the globe have got the word of mouth publicity on same and have experienced the positive outcome of the mysterious conduct and the spirit within him and his territory. He recommends some indigenous/native medicine of which some are available on site and some to find and prepare.
Last-ditch effort
“I had cancer the inevitable and bought a cemetery plot. The cancer had spread throughout the body even after going through chemotherapy, radiation and many surgeries. But as a last-ditch effort, I managed to find the ultimate life support heaven and had my rebirth in the within three weeks and found the tumors had shrunk to nothing. This is amazing and nothing but a miracle. This extraordinary event that manifests divine intervention is experienced by thousands of Sri Lankans who go through simple lifestyle for the minimum of 21 days,” one patient remarked.
In the face of such unusual and unexpected recoveries, patients often give thanks to a higher power.
Eranga Kandambi, a Sri Lankan engineer in Australia, has more to add.
“Miracles take place in my country. I am so proud and feel indebted. I have no words to express but need to convey the message to all Sri Lankans worldwide.”
Eranga Kandambi reveals the mystery gift received from Most Ven Rathnapure Dhamma kusala Thera through the goddess Sri Paththini Devi by the merits of Buddha Shakthi. Then he was totally freed from his cancer widespread in his Lympode.
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, formerly known as Hodgkin’s disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system.
Stage 4
“I was suffering from various disorders and finally found that I have Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. By the time I informed Most Ven Rathnapure Dhammakusala Thera, my cancer was at stage 4 in medical terms. The doctors kept me informed that I have to spend time happily as all efforts have failed. Though I felt a slight progress at a certain stage my hips were badly affected after taking two therapy treatments per month over six months to be 12 in total. You name any test recommended Ultra sound, CT scan to PET I had gone through all of them.” Eranga and wife wondered what to do. They required to be healthy to work and had no other alternative source of living. When he was young, his parents consulted his horoscope which read that Eranga’s life would be rescued by a Buddhist monk.
“When I was happily living in Australia I shared this with my wife and had a good laugh over this. We wondered how it could be true. But now I know what happened. I need to share my joy with all,” said Kandambi amid tears.
What is special about the Wahalkada Mangalarama temple?
A series of customs/ programmes is lined up. You must live in a camping hut that looks like a basic room. You are required to undergo a pure Buddhist structured programme 100 percent based on Buddhism including meditation, poojas, blessings of gods, live in small huts and shelter with below basic facilities where patients feel equal.
Face value
“No one is favoured. All are alike, this could be the only wedamedura or the hospital where patients are not taken at the face value, influence as per their political or social strength or outlook. The majority of them have spent so much on their critical illness. I offer this treatment at no cost apart from the cost of medicine which will be negligible, Venerable Dhamma kusala Thera added. Most of the cancer patients have gone through every possible treatment and reach the temple as an ultimate destination.
