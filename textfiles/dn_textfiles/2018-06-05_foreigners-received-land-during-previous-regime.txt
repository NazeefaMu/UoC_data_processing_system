'Foreigners received land during previous regime'

It was during the time of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime that maps were redrawn to handover land to foreigners without any proper examination or procedure, Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
He said so responding to a question raised by a journalist after he opened a new electricity supply scheme at Bibulawela, Kamburupitiya, recently.
The journalist queried whether a project designed to vest local land to foreigners would be implemented under the Sri Lanka – Singapore Free Trade Agreement as alleged by the Joint Opposition.
Minister Ratnayaka said, “we have never planned or redesigned any maps to handover land to any foreigners. Such things only happened during the previous regime. The Sri Lanka map was redrawn only during the time of the Rajapaksa regime. They began the Port City project and tried to grant outright ownership of land to a foreign country. When we came to power, we redesigned that agreement to clarify the position regarding that land which is Sri Lanka’s property.”
The minister said a country marching towards development needed to sign trade pacts with foreign countries to ensure a market for local products. When there were bilateral trade agreements, both countries received special concessions for their exports. Therefore, we should be geared to profit from such trade agreements.
