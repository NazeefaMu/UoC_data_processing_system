Defence arms to be deployed in massive development effort next year

massive nation-building development effort is to be undertaken next year with the deployment of one third of the Sri Lanka army cadre and the support of other security arms including the Civil Defence Dorce while giving top priority to national security.
Under the programme, the Army will renovate 500 tanks in Trincomalee, 150 tanks in Polonnaruwa and build and renovate other tanks in the dry zone to help fill the national larder.
Several other development projects would be undertaken in Aaralaganwila assisted by retired army personnel.
The Defence Ministry, Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry, Civil Defence Department and several other government departments contribute to the programme and also launch a programme to combat kidney disease programme initiated by the Navy. It would be extended to the Northern and Eastern Provinces and maritime security services for commercial navigation would be enhanced to derive additional income to the national coffers.
Steps have been taken to save expenditure on obtaining foreign expertise and labour by using army labour and know-how for a number of development projects undertaken this year.
The Sri Lanka Air Force, which makes a special contribution towards safeguarding forest reserves, would join hands with the Navy to protect Sri Lanka’s maritime zone.
