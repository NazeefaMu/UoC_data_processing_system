Alien: Covenant will be first of three movies linking up to first Alien

Ridley Scott has confirmed that ‘Alien: Covenant’ will be the first of three films that will then link up to the story from the original 1979 ‘Alien’.
The second movie in his ‘Prometheus’ series is in its pre-production stage in Sydney, Australia, at the moment, where Scott confirmed the plans in a press conference.
He said that the newly-named ‘Covenant’ and the next two films will answer the ‘very basic questions posed in Alien: why the alien, who might have made it and where did it come from?’.
Covenant will tell the story of the crew of a colony ship which discovers what it believes to be an ‘uncharted paradise’ world, but is in fact a ‘dark and dangerous’ place, inhabited solely by David, Michael Fassbender’s android character from the first ‘Prometheus’ movie.
“It’s a very complex story. It’s an evolution of what I first did with Prometheus One,” he said.
“Prometheus One was borne out of my frustration that on Alien One in 1979 - I only did one as I don’t normally do sequels.
“I was amazed that in the three that followed that no-one asked the question ‘why the Alien, who made it and why?’ Very basic questions.
“So I came up with the notion of ‘Prometheus One’, which starts to indicate who might have made it and where it came from.
“So I’m now going to the next one, which is the next evolution directly connected with the first one, which was this Shaw, when he replaced Michael Fassbender in two pieces and we’ll kind of pick it up there and it will evolve. “When that’s finished there’ll be another one and then another one which will gradually drive into the back entrance of the film in 1979.
“So in other words, why was this space jockey there and why did he have an Alien inside him? And those questions will be answered.” The shoot begins in Sydney in March next year, and will take 16 weeks. He also plans to film all three new movies in Australia.
He added that the shoot will involve ‘monumental forest and monumental rock and the rest will be in the studio with fairly formidable CGI’.
‘Alien: Covenant’ is due for release on October 6, 2017.
