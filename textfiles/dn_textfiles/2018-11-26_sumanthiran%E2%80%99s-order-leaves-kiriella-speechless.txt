Sumanthiran’s order leaves Kiriella speechless

Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera yesterday called for the holding of a General Election. He also criticized the behaviour of the Members of Parliament during the last two weeks.
“We feel sorry to see the plight that befell former Leader of the House, MP Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament on Friday after calling for a name vote.
He was admonished into taking orders from MP Sumanthiran,whose party has only around ten to twelve votes in the House,Ven Elle Gunawansa Thera said.
“We feel sorry for the UNP and sad to see the pitiful state the UNP has fallen into under these circumstances,” the Thera said.
The Thera also stressed that the country needs clean, intellectual and credible politicians.
He urged the authorities to go for a general election and let the people elect proper political representatives for them and for the country, rejecting the wrongdoers of the past. The Thera was speaking at a press conference organised by the Yuthukama National Movement in Colombo yesterday.
Ven. Gunawansa Thera said at present, the there are issues in the economy and in the tourism industry. He also added that politicians should not criticise and speak out of turn by making irrespnsible comments.
Ven.Gunawansa Thera said they expect to present a national agenda before the country and will support those who accept it at the next election. However, the Thera said that the country needed a stable government at present; otherwise it will face to an anarchy in the future.
Yuthukama National Movement president Gevindu Kumarathunge said the only solution for the prevailing crisis in the country is holding a general election.
The Thera said by now, no party in Parliament has either the majority or a mandate to form a government as the mandate given to form a Unity Government in 2015 has been cancelled with the resignation of President Maithripala Sirisena’s Sri Lanka Freedom Party forming the government.
