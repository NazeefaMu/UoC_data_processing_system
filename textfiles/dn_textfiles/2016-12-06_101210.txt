JO members at protest  should share equal liability  for levelling threats: PM

 
The Joint Opposition parliamentarians too will have to take the responsibility for the threat levelled by the protesters on Saturday along Parliament Road if the members were present at the site, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation referring to the Joint Opposition protest along Parliament Road on Saturday after Joint Opposition MP and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena raised a privilege issue. “We regret the firing of water cannon and tear gas but the Opposition has to take the blame for the alleged threat to surround Parliament,” the Premier said. “Those who staged the protest were not university students but members of pradeshiya sabhas and other local bodies. One had raped 100 women while the other had killed a foreign national and raped his wife. According to information I received, only one lane was closed on that day. They are the decisions that the Police can take.”
The Prime Minister said those who came said they would surround Parliament.
He added that until that statement was made, it was a protest.
“It was not by university students but by the municipal council chairmen, provincial council chairmen and others involved in thefts,” the Prime Minister said.
At this stage Opposition and government MPs traded charges and the Speaker ordered Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara to take his seat.
He also instructed Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe to take his seat.
“If those people say that they would surround Parliament it is a threat to Parliament,” the Prime Minister said. “At such a moment if there was a parliamentarian among protesters, he too is complicit.
There is a great difference between what these members say and what we saw through the media.There was an organised gang. I feel sorry that they were attacked by water cannons.”
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Opposition members are trying to say that sil observers were attacked by water cannons.
“But these were ‘Upasaka Balallu’ (wolves in sheep’s clothing). They are those who are skilled in burning tyres and attacking vehicles. One chairman had raped 100 women, another had raped a foreign woman in Tangalla and killed her husband. So are we not afraid? At such a moment, Police act,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this should not be repeated.
“We have told Police to allow the people to protest. The two groups could stage the protest on either side, but leave a little space for us to travel. The other matter is that as the road is being renovated, the ordinary people are trapped due to a traffic jam,” he said.
Raising a privilege issue, Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena said the privileges of Parliamentarians to move freely and their protection have been secured by the Act.
He added that last Saturday that privilege was breached.
“Last Saturday, several members experienced it including MP Soysa who brought the matter before Parliament on Saturday,” Gunawardena said. “If the people are not allowed to meet us, let us meet those people. The Premier too promised that the people who come to meet us would be allowed. We are ready to explain this situation if the Chair allows us.”
At this stage UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said Gunawardena was not stopped going out of Parliament but he was stopped by Police while on his way to Parliament. “There was a large number of thugs, and I suggest that if we could lead them to the Parliament grounds we would have been able to trim it easily,” Jayamaha said.
