Inauguration of Second Session of parliament
President to deliver policy statement

A Party Leaders’ Meeting will be held on May 2 to discuss arrangements for the inaugural ceremony of Parliament on May 8 and the Parliamentary business thereafter, Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dassanayake said. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said it will be an informal meeting of the Party Leaders convened by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as the Parliamentary Business Committee stands dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament. He said that Parliament has been unofficially informed that the inaugural sitting of the Second Session of Parliament would commence at 2.15p.m. on May 8, adding that the relevant Gazette by the Presidential Secretariat was expected last night.
“The ceremonial sitting will be limited to the delivery of the Policy Statement by President Maithripala Sirisena.
As he presides over the House during the function, Parliament cannot take up any other business. The date which Parliament reconvenes has to be decided by the Party Leaders’ during the informal meeting next week,” he explained.
In the meantime, the Speaker’s Media Division issued a press statement yesterday denying media reports that the ceremonial sitting of Parliament is to cost around Rs.30 million.
“The inaugural session on May 8 commences after lunch and therefore no additional sum is being spent by Parliament for food or tea. The spending of Parliament on this date is the same as other normal sitting days,” the press release stated.
The Secretary General further said Parliament will have to appoint a Select Committee in the first instance it takes up the normal business to re-appoint members and Chairmen to the Parliamentary Committees including the COPE and COPA, as they stand dissolved after Parliament was prorogued on April 12.
“The Party Leaders, when they meet next week, will have to decide on the membership of the Selection Committee.
Then the members will be announced in the House,” he said.
Asked as to whether a new Deputy Speaker will be elected, the Secretary General said Parliament has so far not officially received any resignation letter from Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
“We will take further action only when we are officially told of his resignation,” he added.
