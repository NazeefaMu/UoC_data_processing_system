Abans redefines family entertainment with LG Home Theatres

LG has designed the LG Home Theatre range, which offers an all-inclusive solution for family entertainment.
Hosting innovative features that add that “special thrill”, LG Home Theatres enable families to grow closer together by rendering their favourite TV series, teledramas, and reality shows in a manner that enthralls both young and old.
The truly immersive sound, which each LG Home Theatre System offers, erases the need to step into a cinema. This is made possible through 5.1-channel surround sound that utilizes the speaker towers to create a 360° audio experience.
The speaker towers encircle the TV set and the viewers, and replicate sound from different angles exactly as seen on the TV show. The voice of the actors is then isolated to a single speaker in the center. These features work together to produce greater audio clarity than what usually proceeds from a regular TV set with one or two small speakers.
As you watch an action sequence on your TV screen, 5.1-channel surround sound produces the feeling that the events in the movie or TV show is taking place right there around you.
In addition, optical input uses the latest technology toreproduce purer, more lifelike sound effects.
All LG Home Theatre Systems are renowned for their versatility due to their unique functions including Bluetooth connectivity that lets you wirelessly link up your smartphone or laptop to the home theatre as well as HDMI connectivity which allows you to watch full HD content in optimum quality. LG Simplink is another cool feature that makes the TV viewing experience more convenient by letting you operate both your LG TV and Home Theatre with just one remote control. Further, only LG Home Theatres can double up as a sound system, which can be used to play your favourite music. This is due to the inclusion of a large front throwing subwoofer and speakers can withstand high sound volume levels.
You can select a LG Home Theatre that caters to your budget and entertainment preferences. The vast range of choices includesatellite speaker systems for basic usage, Hi-power 1000w systems, 4-tower speaker systems, the newly introduced 1200W Home Theatre, and a premium home theatre featuring 3D Blu-Ray Discand portable hard drive playability as well as an Ethernet connection. Further, the above cited features such as Bluetooth connectivity, Optical Input, and DVD playability are available in all LG Home Theatres, starting from the most basic model.
Plus, Abans makes it easier for you to purchase your preferred home theatre system with its incredible easy payment, hire purchase, and interest free credit card schemes.
