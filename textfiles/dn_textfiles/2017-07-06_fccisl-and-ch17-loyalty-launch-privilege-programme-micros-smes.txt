FCCISL and CH17 Loyalty launch privilege programme for micros, SMEs

The informal micro sector and small and medium entrepreneurs will soon get a shot in the arm to boost their businesses through a combined initiative of Commercial Bank, Sri Lanka Telecom and programme initiator CH17 Loyalty in association with the FCCISL.
For the first time, a coalition of four leading agencies who play vital roles in the facilitation of commerce and retail trade services have banded together to come up with a unique programme to support the informal micro and the structured small and medium businesses.
A FCCISL-endorsed privilege card will be issued to all those belonging to these three sectors which will entitle the card holder to an array of benefits and privileges which could help boost their business.
CH17 Loyalty which has a strong base of merchants and retailers of consumer goods, durables and many essential products give concessionary offers and attractive discounts which will be passed on to the members through the SME Privilege Card.
"For the first time a coalition of services and facilities essential to the SME and micro sectors have been integrated into a single loyalty platform. We want to serve the informal micro sector in particular which needs the support and guidance the most,” said Jumar Preena, CEO, CH17 Loyalty.
Key among them will be Commercial Bank which will introduce a special MasterCard Debit/Credit Card dedicated to the SME Sector. In addition to the attractive services, offers and incentives given by the bank for their card holders, this specially designed card will be integrated to CH17 Loyalty Merchant network, thus giving the micro SMEs the dual benefits of concessions.
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) has stepped in to provide products and business solutions at highly concessionary terms to the SME sector. Special SLT packages for businesses have been developed which will be of great assistance to this community, Jumar Preena CEO of CH17 Loyalty said.
There are several advantages which the micro and SMEs could enjoy by joining this programme. They are as follows: recognition by the industry body - FCCISL endorsed SME Membership Card, benefits such as discounts and concessions on a number of essential commercial goods and personal commodities from listed merchants, SME-branded Privilege Debit/Credit card from Commercial Bank, special telecommunications package from SLT, market access to identified consumer groups, B2B engagement with CH17’s business network and knowledge sharing with FCCISL’s business development programmes.
