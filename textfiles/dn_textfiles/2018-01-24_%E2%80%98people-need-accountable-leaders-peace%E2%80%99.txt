‘People need accountable leaders for peace’

If accountable leaders come forward, then people can live peacefully without any fear, said Jamath-e-Islami Deputy Leader and Country Affairs Officer-in-Charge Asheik M. H. M. Usair.
He was addressing a political guidance conference that was organized by the Jamath-e-Islami Puttalam branch office, collaboratively with Paffrel, the March 12 movement and CaFFE. It had been organized for the upcoming local council election, under the theme Beautiful, Peaceful, and Healthy Puttalam.
The conference was held under the chair of Jamath-e-Islami Puttalam Branch Head Asheik Abdhul Kahhar at the Puttalam Hudha Masjid premises. At the inauguration of the conference, the National Anthem was recited in two languages. Afterwards, a welcome speech was delivered by Suggestion Board member Asheik H. M. Minhaj. Many candidates who are to contest in the upcoming local council election also participated.
A political manifesto which included seven main features, was published during this conference. Asheik M. H. M. Usair presented a copy of this newly-published manifesto to Paffrel Planning Officer Sritharan Sabaanayagam. Subsequently, opinions of the Puttalam Jammiyathul Ulama president, Puttalam Muhiyadheen Jumma Masjid administrative officer, and many local council candidates, were also screened.
While addressing the event, Asheik M. H. M. Usair (Islahi) said, “These days, good people live as the majority in the country. If we need the good governance to exist in our motherland, then changing our minds is vital.
Whether the election candidate is a parliamentarian or a provincial councillor or local council member, he is, however, a people’s representative. But now, the roles have reversed and the people have become the representatives of the politicians. This situation should be changed,” he said.
“Puttalam is a place where Buddhists, Hindhus, Christians, and Muslims live in harmony. Therefore, those who are against extremism and racism, should be selected as leaders,” he added.
