DIMO partners with Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training

Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) recently signed an agreement with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to train 150 Combined Harvester Operators under the Ministry’s Employment Linked Training Programme (ELTP).
The training programme is an initiative of the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training and is funded by the Asian Development Bank.
With a clear objective of addressing skill gaps and the employability of youth, 150 students will train for a period of one year. The participants will be assessed based on their aptitude and will be provided with theoretical lectures as well as practical on-the-job training sessions over a period of six months. The training programme will be conducted at DIMO Na Sevana Training Academy under experienced and qualified panel of DIMO instructors.
This initiative aims to ensure employability of the youth in the country and address the skill gaps faced in the industry. It is envisaged to improve and align the skills development with relevant industry requirements and the employment aspirations of youth in Sri Lanka.
The participants will be awarded a recognized National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 3 certification accredited by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of Sri Lanka.
Located at Hambantota, the state-of-the-art DIMO Na Sevana Training Academy is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. The academy aims to provide vocational training in main areas including construction machinery handling, maintenance and repairs of automobiles to enhance quality of drivers, and machine operators to obtain opportunities in the local and global job market.
