RIU to host UK- Sri Lanka Investor Forum in London

The Research Intelligence Unit(RIU) will be hosting its annual edition of RIU Investor Forum on May 17, 2018 at the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, UK.
Their objective is to promote and channel investment into Sri Lanka from among the high net worth individuals (HNI) living overseas while also building strong interest among the investor community based in key global financial hubs. Foreign investors have shown confidence towards investing in Sri Lanka as foreign direct investment (FDI) into Sri Lanka has grown to over US$ 1.63 billion in 2017, doubling the US$ 802 million received in the previous year. As with our previous events we are proud to work with the UK High Commission in London to reach out to the corporate investors living in the UK, Roshan Madawela, head of the Research Intelligence Unit said.
“The UK is easily the most significant diaspora market for Sri Lanka both in terms of quality and quantity. We look forward to concluding yet another successful event in the UK together with our sponsors and associates.” The United Kingdom has over 436,000 UK citizens with Sri Lankan origin and they maintain a regular financial or real estate related presence in their country of origin.
The event will bring together experts from disciplines; property development and management, infrastructure development and economics.
