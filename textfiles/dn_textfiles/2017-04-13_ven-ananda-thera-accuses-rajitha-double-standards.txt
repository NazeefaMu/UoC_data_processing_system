Ven. Ananda Thera accuses Rajitha of double standards

If the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and the Public Services United Nurses’ Union (PSUNU) unite, a people friendly government can be formed for sure, PSUNU President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Releasing a statement to the media yesterday he said it was the PSUNU which commenced to offer diplomas for nurses in 2011 at Temple Trees with the participation of (then) President.
Therefore, the current Health Minister should not give birth certificates to others’ children. If he does not know the history, he should learn from President Sirisena.
According to Ven. Ananda Thera, the Health Minister had admired the President of the Government Nursing Officers Association during the recent ceremony held to hand over diploma certificates to 1,290 nurses and indirectly he had ordered them to obtain membership of the association. “This is purely an unethical and unacceptable act,” he said.
When the GMOA and PSUNU supported the Dental Surgeons Association strikes during the regime of late President J.R. Jayawardena, the current Health Minister praised both organizations and now he is accusing them.
“This shows his double standards. At that time he did not care if patients were affected by strikes,” Ven. Ananda Thera added.
