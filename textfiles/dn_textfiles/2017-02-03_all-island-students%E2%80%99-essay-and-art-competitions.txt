All Island students’ essay and art competitions

The Bakeer Markar Centre for National Unity (BMCNU) and the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), are jointly making arrangements to have the All-Island Students Essay and Art Competitions to coincide with the Centenary Birthday Celebrations of late Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar, to be held in May 2017.
The theme of these two competitions is: “ Unity in Diversity is the Strength of our Nation” This is to bring about awareness on the significance of National Unity and Peaceful Co-Existence.
The Essay Competition will be held in Sinhala, Tamil and English. All entries for both these competitions should be submitted through the Principal or Head of the Institute.
The grand awards ceremony to give away prizes and certificates to the winners will be held in May 2017 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), during the Centenary Celebrations.
The distinguished gathering at these celebrations is expected to be graced with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the President of ONUR and former President Chandrika Kumaratunge.
These competitions are held with the approval of the Ministry of Education. The rules and other details will appear in the print and electronic media, as well as informed through the Provincial and Zonal Offices of the Education Department.
