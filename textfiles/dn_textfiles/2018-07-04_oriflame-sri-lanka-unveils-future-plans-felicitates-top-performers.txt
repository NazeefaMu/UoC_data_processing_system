Oriflame Sri Lanka unveils future plans, felicitates top performers

Oriflame Sri Lanka, the leading cosmetic giant which has touched the lives of thousands of Sri Lankans with its wide ranging products recently hosted its biggest event of the year – The Director Seminar 2018 - at which top performers met for a three-day seminar at the exclusive Marriott Resort & Spa, Weligama.
The gala event and related mini-events were all linked to the main theme, aptly named themed ‘Diamond Bliss’, which celebrated Oriflame’s vibrant impact in Sri Lanka for the past 21 years, while simultaneously honouring its top performers.
Commencing in true Oriflame style, the participants were given a memorable welcome, escorted by the management and the staff of the Company in a spectacular motor bike parade. Adding to the delight of the Oriflame leaders of Sri Lanka, was the arrival of their Vice President South Asia, Sergei Kanashin and Sales Director South Asia, Pradnya Deshpande.
In addition to them were also the Local Managers, D. D. Samanthilake and Kalana Perera who enlivened the event by arriving on bikes to greet and welcome those who have been responsible for successfully spreading Oriflame’s presence in Sri Lanka.
The conference opened to a resounding theme around the mythical hero Thor and the Gods of Olympus. This appealed to the participants, who were made to feel part of a magical experience.
Oriflame’s Senior Vice President for South Asia, Sergei Kanashin reiterated the global dynamics and growth potential of Oriflame in Asia, which has experienced a rapid year-on-year growth with a dramatically increased market share. “We are strategically aligned with the clear vision to be the Number One Beauty Company with a multi-functional market model”, he affirmed.
Referring to the exponential development of Oriflame Sri Lanka, Area Manager Sri Lanka D. D. Samanthilake said that the leaders have performed exceptionally thus far in 2018, with a significant growth spurt compared to last year. He then went onto outline Oriflame’s plans to expand its market potential in Sri Lanka, while creating an innovative outlook in the near future.
The highlight of the first day was launch of the brand new Top 15 Leaders for 2018-2019 and the ‘Australian’ themed night. This was followed by the programme for Day Two, which commenced with a yoga session which enhanced the participants’ level of concentration.
They were then privy to learning testimonies and informative sessions which maximised their growth potential to a vast extent. Day Two also gave the participants an insight into the exciting and unique launches lined up for the forthcoming quarters.
The euphoric atmosphere culminated in the most exclusive celebratory event in which all the top leaders’ achievements were recognised on grand scale. The highlight was the official handing over of the project contract for the proposed building of a fully furnished library for the Wetakoluwagama Kanitu Viduhala to its Principal Upali Ekanayake. The grand finale was the launch of the newest product range NovAge Men which was showcased by Oriflame’s handsome models on stage.
“Our aim for the following year is to celebrate Oriflame’s growth with the highest participation and more title achievers. With the support of all players, we’re committed to making Oriflame Sri Lanka a “Diamond Bliss” to the world,” affirmed Local Managers, D. D. Samanthilake and Kalana Perera.
