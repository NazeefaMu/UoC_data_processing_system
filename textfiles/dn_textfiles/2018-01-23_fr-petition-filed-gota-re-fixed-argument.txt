FR petition filed by Gota re-fixed for argument

 
The Supreme Court re-fixed for argument, the fundamental rights petition filed by former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, today. Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Sisira de Abrew fixed the petition for argument on May 31.   The petition was re-fixed for argument since the Supreme Court bench was not properly constituted to hear the matter. In his petition, Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksha sought Court’s intervention to prevent an imminent arrest of him over several purported investigations.
