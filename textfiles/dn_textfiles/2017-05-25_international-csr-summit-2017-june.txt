It is time countries come together to brave the waves of global sustainability challenges and brainstorm and define solutions. As CSR continues to be a dynamic element for all organizations, it is imperative that thought leaders need to manoeuvre the wheels of CSR transformation in their organizations.
We continue to see sustainable leaders incorporating social purpose as vital components in building their strong organizational strategies.
Companies are also called to pay more attention to UN's Sustainable Development Goals, and to work with respective governments on specific targets to achieve over the next 15 years.
Other important trends include the growing number of partnerships and alliances in business, CSR is no longer a SILO initiative that is only the responsibility of the CSR team.
