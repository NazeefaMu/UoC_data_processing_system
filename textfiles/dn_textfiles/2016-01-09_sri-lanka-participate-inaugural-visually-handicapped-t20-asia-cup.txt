Sri Lanka to participate at inaugural visually handicapped T20 Asia Cup

Sri Lanka's visually handicapped national cricket team will participate in the inaugural T20 Asia Cup tournament for visually handicapped which will be held from January 17 to 24 in Kochi, India.
The Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI) is organizing the tournament and around 10 nations will take part in this first edition. Five nations, namely India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh will take part.

The Sri Lankan contingent comprises 17 players and three officials. Chandana Deshapriya is the captain of Sri Lanka team and Y.S.G. Sumanaweera is the coach. Ravi Perera will join the team as an umpire.
Even though cricket for visually handicapped applies many standard cricket rules there are adapted rules as well. A team will have players of three categories, according to their visual abilities. Players of B-1 category are totally blind and a team must have four B-1 players, three B-2 (partially blind) players and four B-3 (partially blind) players.
The national team, although almost oblivious to the Sri Lankan cricket lovers had garnered commendable accolades with their outstanding performance in previous international events. Sri Lanka took part in four Word Cups and they emerged third in 2014 when the World Cup was held in South Africa.
Sri Lanka Cricket Association of the Visually Handicapped (SLCAVH) is striving all these years to bring the sport to the attention of the masses while uplifting the standard to international level. They have entered a sponsorship agreement with one of the biggest multi-national companies, Regus as their clothing partner for the first ever T20 Asia Cup.
Commenting on the sponsorship, the Country Manager of Regus Sri Lanka Dr Nimal de Silva said, "We considered this initiative when the team reached out to us through the dynamic SLCAVH president Norbert Silva. We decided to extend necessary support in order to ensure that they will make it to India and have the opportunity to make Sri Lanka proud. We would like to extend our fullest support in their future endevours as well and I wish them all the best."
Norbert Silva appreciated the support rendered by Regus Sri Lanka and said even though cricket is very popular here, they found hard to attract sponsors when it comes to cricket for visually handicapped.
"But a big thank you goes to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who made quick arrangements to buy our air tickets. Without his generous support this tour will not be possible for these youngsters. He also arranged us lodging at Sports Ministry during the team's comprehensive practices.
We are greatly affected by two main problems over the years. We do not have a ground with a turf to carry out practices and also desperately in need of a national sponsor. If these requirements fulfilled, our players will surely perform better. I must also thank athe Foundation of Goodwill for their great support to SLCAVH," Norbert said.
"I have asked SLC to make SLCAVH an affiliated body, but they have turned a blind eye for a long time. But we have made it to the international level and are proud to be a member of the World Blind Cricket Association. In other countries, the national cricket governing bodies have given sanction to their Visually Handicapped Cricket Associations under them. I hope the new SLC management will consider our plea," the SLCAVH president added.
The national coach Y.G.A. Sumanaweera who has 20 years of experience working with visually handicapped personnel is confident of local the team's performance in India. "Our lads are very talented and brave, so they are capable of fighting against any country. We are in need of umpires, coaches, scorers and officials. If the sport gets sufficient local exposure, then people will be get interested. I think this first ever regional tournament will be a great opportunity to popularize cricket for visually handicapped," Sumanaweera pointed out.
