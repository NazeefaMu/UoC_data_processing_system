Howard fought to keep  ‘Jurassic World’  character’s heels

Actor Bryce Dallas Howard has revealed she had to push the makers of the upcoming ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ to let her character Claire wear heels in the film.
When “Jurassic World” released in 2015, the audience could not understand why Claire spends the entire film running across the jungle in a pair of heels.
The film’s director, Colin Trevorrow, tweeted a collage of the pictures of sturdy boots Claire will wear for the majority of the film’s sequel, directed by JA Bayona, but Howard has revealed the “heels” are set to return.
In an interview, the actor revealed that the original screenplay was written with extra care about not showing Claire in heels and she was specifically written to be wearing sneakers even in office environment. It was written like, ‘Claire’s wearing sneakers’. Like, specifically, Claire’s wearing sneakers. And I just circled that when I was reading it and I was like, ‘No... no, it’s an office, Claire would wear heels’.
And then it was like another scene where I’m like, ‘Hmm, well Claire’s kind of like... She’s going to wear heels in this scene also,” Howard said.
The 37-year-old actor said she found the heels important to her characterisation.
“It’s a part of the character and kind of a metaphor for her journey. And that’s how it was intended in the first, and intended in the second.
It’s important, I think, to be truthful to the character in that way. In that she can do both! She can wear flats, and she can wear heels!” she said. PTI
