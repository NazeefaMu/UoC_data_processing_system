Govt. trying to sell Srilankan Airlines to dubious company: JO

The Joint Opposition yesterday charged that the government was planning to sell the debt-ridden Srilankan Airlines to a company with a dubious reputation.
JO member, Parliamentarian Gamini Lokuge told the media in Colombo that the company tipped to take over Srilankan Airlines had several individuals accused of corruption in the past in its management team.
Lokuge warned that the government will fall into more trouble than it has faced with regard to the controversial bond issue, if it sells the national carrier to the aforesaid company.
The JO member said two prominent individuals in the management team of the company who were involved in the local transport sector in the past had numerous accusations of fraud and corruption against them.
The workers of several companies run by the two individuals had complained that the management have failed to pay their social security funds such as the EPF.
Lokuge said the deal is a clear indication of the government’s efforts to sell key state assets to their close supporters.
