Marriage - diplomatic relations

Nearly 50 Chinese couples tied the knot at a mass wedding ceremony held at the Colombo Town Hall yesterday. The event was held in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Sri Lanka – China diplomatic relations. Held with much fanfare, the mass wedding included everything from a fleet of plush cars, to horseback rides and Kandyan dancers for couples to say ‘I do’. The event is an attempt to position Sri Lanka as a wedding destination. China is Sri Lanka’s second largest tourism source market. The country received over 200,000 Chinese visitors from January-October 2017 alone.
