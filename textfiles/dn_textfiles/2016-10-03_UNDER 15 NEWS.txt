WP South Outer emerge 2016 Prima U15 Provincial Champions
Kavindu Umayanga’s blistering 122 followed by Lahiru Madushanka’s five-for in a final only a handful of players thrived either with the bat or the ball especially in the first two innings were instrumental in Western Province South Outer’s gaining the first-innings advantage over Western Province Central that was sufficient for them to become the 2016 Inter-Provincial Champions of Prima Cup before the two-day final that was played at the SSC petered-out into a draw without producing any positive result.
Ever since this U15 tournament commenced with district level matches followed by matches at provincial level, this tournament was conducted strictly according to the limited-over format before the final was played as a two-day contest. Therefore, as WP South Outer took slightly more than a day to finish their first innings after they won the toss and took the first lease, the first-innings outcome became only possible result in this all-important final.
WP South Outer opening the proceedings on a perfect batting track at the SSC got off to a positive start after their openers skipper, Kamil Minhara and wicket-keeper, Sheran Lakshitha shared a glorious 86-run stand for the first wicket before a mini collapse reduced them to 179 for six. Kavindu Umayanga then added a useful 105 runs for the seventh wicket with Ashen Dilhara helping his side hustle to an imposing total of 302 for nine that could put the opposition under pressure in their turn. After Kamil’s 72 at the top, Kavindu who scored a 153-ball 122 with 16 fours and two sixes was the only one to thrive on a day all others struggled with the bat in first innings. Almost all WP Central bowlers led by Yasiru Kasthurarachchi who picked up four wickets bowled quite economically, but failed to get breakthroughs to stop the opposition from reaching a total that could challenge their batsmen.
WP Central needing a miraculous start to cope up with opposition’s huge total lost half their side in an inexplicable collapse even before they put hundred on the board despite Chamath Yatawara’s fighting 41 at the beginning and their hopes for a first-innings triumph was hanging on a thread when they went collapse at 86 for six. However, there was a slight recovery during the seventh wicket stand between Amitha Dabare and Teron Gaskara, but it was too late and too small to make a comeback as their innings imploded for a woeful 148 in the end. Lahiru Madushanka who destroyed the WP Central’s batting with a structural damage that earned him a five-for at a cost of 41 runs was the ultimate hero after Kavindu Umayanga’s century that set the tone for winner’s early dominance.
