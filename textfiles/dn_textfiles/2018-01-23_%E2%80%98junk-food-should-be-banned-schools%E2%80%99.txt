‘Junk food should be banned from schools’

A decision should be made after having a discussion with the Education Minister regarding the types of food being sold at school canteens, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the School Canteen Policy declared through the relevant circular, is not being implemented properly at schools. Due to this situation, junk food is available at school canteens, and such food make schoolchildren ill. He was addressing the award presentation held in Colombo, recently, for the winners of competitions conducted to mark World Diabetes Day – 2017.
Minister Dr. Senaratne added that food with excessive amounts of sugar, salt, and fat, should not be given to schoolchildren. Such food promotes Non-Communicable diseases (NCDs). The School Canteen Policy and the relevant circular clearly states which food should be offered to schoolchildren.
NCD-prevention centers would be established in all State schools as soon as possible in order to protect schoolchildren from NCDs. It is easy to educate children than adults. Adults have various beliefs in them, he added.
