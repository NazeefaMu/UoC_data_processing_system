Army Sergeant invents iron bending machine

A new innovative production was invented by an Army Sergeant at the Sri Lanka Army’s Ordnance Factory at Dombagoda, Horana recently.
The new iron bending machine was invented by Sergeant K. K. D. S. N. Nadeeshan under the supervision of the Commandant of Army Ordnance Factory Brigadier H. L. Guruge.
This new iron bending machine is able to save a fair share of expenditure to the country. The machine generally costs about Rs 18 lakhs if it is imported but the Ordnance Factory succeeded in producing the same machine at a cost of Rs 30,000 using steel left-over in the factory.
With the assistance of the newly-invented machine, it was possible to produce new couplings needed for the construction of a new Army building at Ragama. Also, it was efficient enough to bend 100 steel pipes of 19 feet within a couple of hours.
