‘Higher education ensured for all OL students’

The right to higher education for all students who sit for their G. C. E. (O. L.) examinations, would be ensured from 2019 onward; their examination results would not be an obstacle for higher education, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala.
“Students have the right to enjoy a 13 year-long school education and a properly educated student population is a necessity for the nation, with a direct approach towards vocational training skills. Thenceforth, they will be confident about their futures,” the minister said.
About 4,000 students would follow vocational training courses at 42 schools countrywide during the first stage of the programme. During the second stage, about 14,000 students would undergo vocational training courses at 150 schools countrywide, he added.
“This vocational educational stream is currently in effect at 192 schools countrywide. A sum of Rs. 3.6 billion would be invested for the purpose from this year’s Budget,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
