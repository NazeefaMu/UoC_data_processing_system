Dengue eradication at fisheries harbours

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry on Thursday launched a mosquito eradication programme in all fisheries harbours concurrent to the National Dengue Prevention Programme.
Accordingly, the ministry and Fisheries Harbours Corporation jointly implemented the dengue eradication programme. It was launched in 20 fisheries harbours. The programme commenced from Dikowita Fishery Harbour premises, Wattala.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, State Minister Dileepa Wedaarachchi and others participated.
It is planned to carry out such programmes every week in due course.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the media said there was a large number of abandoned fishing vessels in fisheries ports and a majority of them were Court productions.
They have become dengue mosquito breeding grounds for many years. The minister said over 181 such fishing boats are at the fisheries harbours at present. The Fisheries Ministry has received this information from a field survey carried out by the Fisheries Department.
“Steps will be taken to destroy or remove them on the advice of the Attorney General,” the minister said.
The minister added that the relevant letter will be submitted soon to obtain the approval of the Attorney General. He said the release of plastic waste to oceans is a serious environmental problem. Many empty plastic bottles enter the fisheries harbour premises through the breakwater.
According to Dikkowita Fishery Harbour data, a total of 50,000 bottles were removed from the Dikowita Fisheries Harbour. It was revealed that at least one plastic bottle had been released at least one and two hours a day.
The minister said steps should be taken to minimize the use of plastic and releasing them into the ocean, and to take legal action against culprits.
