Indian Minister pledges road development assistance

India’s Minister of Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Nitin Gadkari said his ministry will provide full assistance to Sri Lanka in its road development projects, including the Jaffna-Mannar Trincomalee Highway and the Dambulla-Trincomalee Expressway.
He gave this assurance when he met Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his visiting delegation for talks in New Delhi on Wednesday.
Minister Nitin Gadkari said India possessed the ability to build long lasting highways.
India was always prepared to co-operate with Sri Lanka in building high quality roadways, he said. Views were also exchanged on reviving the economy in the North and a road linking Jaffna-Mannar and Trincomalee.
The Indian delegation included Indian Shipping Ministry Secretary Rajeev Kumar, Road Transport and Highways Ministry Secretary Sanjay Mitra and Additional Secretary Vaobhav Dange.
