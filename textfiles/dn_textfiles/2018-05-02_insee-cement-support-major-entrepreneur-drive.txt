INSEE Cement to support major  entrepreneur drive

In a major boost to Sri Lankan entrepreneur development efforts, the country’ sole and fully integrated cement giant stepped in to support one of the biggest industry-entrepreneurial development projects introduced in the country.
“INSEE Cement is part of Thailand’s SIAM Group with operations in Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Together with INSEE Cement team we want to strengthen the construction practices in Sri Lanka,” said the Executive Vice President and Sales & Marketing Director of INSEE Cement (or Siam City Cement (Lanka) Limited), Jan Kunigk on April 25 in Colombo.
INSEE’s EVP Kunigk was addressing the launch event of Entrepreneur Partnering session by National Enterprise Development Agency (NEDA) under the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen at the Ministry, Colombo 3.
In this pioneering initiative, NEDA is partnering with INSEE Cement to provide new skills and disseminate latest industry and masonry technologies practiced around the world to 4400 Lankan construction workers and masons in 45 cities across the country. The training at multiple levels are expected to continue through December 2018. INSEE is investing approximately SL Rs 2.2 mn in this project.
“INSEE Cement, earlier called as Holcim Lanka, has always been committed to long-term development of its people and stakeholders. Construction industry workers, masons are one of our key stakeholders who use our products ad solutions. As for solutions, INSEE Cement with its previous experience is the most innovative firm and the leading firm in Sri Lankan cement market. We are the only cement manufacturing company in Sri Lanka that is fully integrated -including in distribution. This makes us not only committed to Sri Lankan market but also to strength of employment provision with optimal composition. We now employ 20000 directly and indirectly”, added EVP Kunigk.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen commended INSEE Cement for joining this initiative and supporting NEDA’s national entrepreneur development efforts. “Encouraging entrepreneurs and making youth to not be a burden on state sector employment is part of the Unity Government’s reform vision. Self-employment can help our economy greatly. I commend INSEE Cement for stepping in to be part of Sri Lanka’s national entrepreneur development initiative.” Once INSEE Cement’s technical skilling of 4400 freelance and non-freelance Lankan masons is completed by end of this December, NEDA plans to step in, take them over and skill them on aspects of entrepreneurship, self-employment and SME generation.
