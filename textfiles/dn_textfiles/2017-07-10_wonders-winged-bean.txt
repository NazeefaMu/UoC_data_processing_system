Wonders of winged bean


The Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) also known as Dambala is vegetable which is highly valued as a source of protein. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor, K.N.K. Jayathilaka
“If one is to grow Dambala in one’s home garden, it will take care of the daily nutritional need of the family. One vine can satisfy the daily needs of the family. This vine is mainly grown on a fence (with the help of supports) and thus does not take up too much space in the garden. It is very important to grow this in a home garden,” said Jayathilaka
In the Dambala plant the pods, leaves, flowers, yam and seeds can be eaten/consumed.
“After the plant matures, a yam forms beneath the soil at the roots. The excess food within the leaves moved down to the roots and collects there. And then a yam is formed at the roots. This too can be eaten,” stated Jayathilaka.
Dambala can be grown in both Yala and Maha seasons. It can be grown in the Wet Zone and Dry Zone as well.
“To grow Dambala there should be a good drainage system and there should be Sandy-loam soil. Those are the two most important requirements to cultivate. The flowers are whitish light blue. It is also important to add compost to the Sandy-loam soil,” pointed out Jayathilaka.
There are many varieties of Dambala grown – SLS 44 (Plant is greenish and seeds are whitish), SLS 40 (Plant is Greenish and seeds are brownish), UPS 122 (plant is purple and seeds are brownish)
“It is cultivated through seeds. The hole dug must be 30cm x 30cm x 30cm and the spacing between two plants should be 60cm – 75cm,” stated Jayathilaka
When growing on fences there should be supports. And the supports take the form of a wooden pyramid shape (an inverted V Shape). The holes will be positioned on either side and the vine will grow along the supports and grow along the fence.
“The supports need to be 2 meters high. And there will be an entire line of these supports. This is on a commercial scale. In a home garden there is no need for such preparation, a few supports will do,” said Jayathilaka
It takes around three or four months for flowers and pods to appear. For around two to three years the plant will give a harvest and the harvest can be reaped every three to four days.
“One hectare will yield 15 tons. It is a plant with no pest or diseases problems. Now and then you will need to prune the plants. It also needs sunlight so growing them in spaces that get sunlight is important,” summed up Jayathilaka
