Parliament - 05.05.2016

Temporarily suspend tax revisions: Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked the government to temporarily suspend the tax revisions effective from May 2 stating that the Parliament has not approved them.
He was participating in the debate yesterday in Parliament.
“Just because the Prime Minister read a statement in Parliament, tax revisions would not get the required validity. Those must be approved by Parliament. There is a budget which was passed with two thirds majority in Parliament last December. These revisions are contrary to it,” Dissanayake said.
The MP also rejected the government’s claim that the VAT increase would not affect the ordinary masses. “Even though the government has exempted a list of goods from the VAT, the retail and wholesale trade come under the VAT. Every shop that has sales over Rs. 33,000 per day should pay 15 percent VAT. Today, almost all the shops have a daily turnover over of Rs. 33,000. In addition to that these shops should also pay two percent NBT and Economic Service Charge as of the value of their business. The shop owners would pass this burden to the people by increasing the prices of goods sold at their shops,” he said.
Dissanayake demanded to reveal the agreement signed between the government and IMF. “The Prime Minister should have presented this agreement to Parliament prior to signing it. The Parliament is still unaware of its content. However, the general condition of the IMF when granting loans is to reduce the budget deficit. The government increased the taxes and curtailed the relief measures to get qualified to receive this loan,” he commented.
MP Dissanayake also raised serious concerns over the irregularities in the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance. “On January 8 the Central Bank issued Treasury Bonds worth Rs. 19.6 billion that have 25 years maturity period. These were bought by the Perpetual Company, and within several hours those were once again sold by the company to the EPF,” he observed.
Dissanayake charged that the investigations on the allegations of fraud and corruption have been suppressed through political influences. “It is the politicians who decide which one is to be arrested and when that arrest to take place.
How did Sajin Vass come out of the prison One may argue he was given bail, but we say it happened as a result of a pre-discussion. He was also given Police security. The government is protecting the wrong doers,” he charged.
Bringing out several instances of waste in the government, he said the supplementary estimate that was produced before the House for approval yesterday includes among other things Rs. 594 million to purchase vehicles and Rs. 60 million to renovate the Public Enterprises Development Ministry. He also cited the attempted undervalued sale of a land in Vauxhall Street, the renting of a building for the Resettlement Ministry at a higher price, the 65,000 housing project in the North, the Customs releasing of undervalued Toyota Prados imported in 2015 and the renting of a building for the Agriculture Ministry at a higher price as instances of financial irregularities of the government.
‘Opposition MPs present only to take part in brawls’
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the Parliament yesterday that Opposition MPs would come to Parliament only if there was a fight but do not come to raise questions on behalf of the people during thequestion time.
Although the relevant ministers were present from morning to answer the oral questions of Opposition MPs today, the relevant Opposition MPs who wish to ask questions from the ministers were not present in the Chamber yesterday.
“However, if there is a fight in the House, all the Opposition MPs would have been here. The questions are included in the Order Paper, but nobody is present to raise the questions. There are four oral questions listed under my name, but none of the MPs from the Opposition is present in the House to raise them,” the minister said.
“We as a ministers are here from the morning after setting aside all our important work just to answer the questions. But none of them was here. He said that MPs attendance should be made mandatory if there are listed questions.”
Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in contrast earlier during the former regime, there were Opposition MPs to ask questions but no minister to answer them. Now on the other hand, there are ministers to answer questions, but no Opposition MPs to raise the questions. Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said this issue will be discussed at the next Party Leaders meeting to arrive at a solution.
Many essentials not subjected to VAT: Lakshman Yapa
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told Parliament yesterday that there are many essential consumer items which are not subjected to the recent Value Added Tax (VAT) amendment.
People still have a doubt on what consumer items that the imposition of increased VAT has been impacted on. The consumer items such as sprats, potatoes, red onions, big onions, garlic, vatana, dhal, chick peas, green gram, dhal, chili powder, canned fish, sugar, undu, kawpea, kurakkan, Maldive fish, dry fish, oranges, grapes, coriander, suduru, maduru, dilseeds, kurakkan flour, turmeric, undu flour, ground nuts, mango, vegetable oil, fish, makeral fish, yoghurt, butter, margarine, salt and dates are not subjected to VAT as they are registered under the Special Commodity Levy Act.
The minister said there is staff level agreement for an IMF loan amounting to US$ 1.5 billion. We may receive it by June. However, the loan is given to strengthen the economy and we cannot use it for the development activities.
However, the World bank, ADB, Koren funds and JICA aids which are expected to receive after the IMF grants can be utilised for the development projects. There has been a surge in the Stock Market after the IMF grants were announced. Once this is granted, we will release funds for the ongoing development activities and development projects expected to commence this year.
Accordingly, Southern Highway extension up to Hambantota, Outer Circular Highway extension and proposed Ratnapura expressway project, access road to the Colombo Harbour, Marin Drive, an elevated highway from Battaramulla to Athurugiriya, Baseline third stage, Badulla-Chenkaladi road and all rural roads countrywide will be implemented and completed using these funds.
Govt’s US$ 1,102 m loan largest ever: Weerawansa
The government has taken US$ 1,102 million in 2015 which is the largest amount of loan taken in a year by any government in history, parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said.
He made this observation yesterday joining the debate on the Supplementary Sum by the Finance Ministry. The motion was moved by the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella. The Supplementary Sum of Rs. 55 million be payable out of the Consolidated Fund of the country or from any loans obtained by the government for the service of the Financial Year 2016.
Weerawansa said that the stock market is down and the Sri Lankan Rupee is depreciating and added that during 2006-2009 when the war was fought, the Rupee depreciated at an annual rate of 3.2 percent while 2009-2014 the Rupee depreciated by 2.8 percent. But under this government the Rupee was depreciated by 9.2 percent. He added that tea and rubber small holders are in trouble now.
“The VAT increase is illegal. If the VAT is being increased the budget has to be amended,” Weerawansa said. “The VAT increase is not applied on Sugar, milk powder, flour, clothes and rice. But a tax is imposed on businesses that has a Rs. 1 million monthly turn over. This is not a big sum for even a small scale business”. He said when the tax increase is imposed on businesses like hotels, textile shops, bakeries, tea kiosks, etc. the owner would increase the prices. Weerawansa said indirectly the VAT has to be paid by the consumers.
Punishment insufficient - Gamini Jayawickrama
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera yesterday said in Parliament the punishment given to the MPs involved in the brawl in the House was insufficient.
However, he commended that the law has been implemented fairly on both sides.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday observed that the Speaker has certain limitations on the actions that he could take on the MPs who had misbehaved. Therefore he requested the Speaker to ask the relevant Party Leaders to take appropriate action against the MPs in question as of the report submitted on Wednesday.
Going by the provisions of the Standing Orders, the Speaker at the first instance can only impose one week suspension for a matter related to discipline of an MP.
Water Supply and Urban Development Minister Rauf Hakeem also observed what the party leaders agreed yesterday could be the most lenient punishment that one could think of. Therefore he asked the both sides to cooperate to put an end to the matter.
