Colombo Engineering installs anchor whilst ship afloat

The MSC FILOMENA operated by Peter Dohle Schiffahrts KG of Germany had lost one of its anchors in the high seas and a replacement was urgently needed.
The Principals of the Vessel immediately contacted Kiran Atapattu at Colombo Engineering and thereafter the replacement anchor was shipped out from Singapore.
On arrival of the Vessel to the Colombo Port, professional ship repair teams of Colombo Engineering lost no time but swept into action taking the new anchor in a floating craft alongside, lowering the anchor chain to the floating craft and connecting up the new anchor and heaving it up in place.
"Speedy response backed up by professional afloat ship repair technology promotes a very large image to the International Shipping Markets that Sri Lanka has the facilities and infrastructure to keep in par with any International port in the world," said the Flamboyant Kiran Atapattu.
MSC is represented in Sri Lanka by MSC Lanka (Pvt) Limited and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority also gave its fullest support for this operation.
