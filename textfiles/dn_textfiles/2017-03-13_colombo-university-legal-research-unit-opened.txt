The inauguration ceremony of the Legal Research Unit of the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo, was held recently.
The Legal Research Unit of the University of Colombo is a collaborative centre for legal research in Sri Lanka in partnership with the Ministry of Justice.
The Legal Research Unit will be headed by Faculty of Law Senior Lecturers A. Sarveswaran and Dr. N. Kamardeen.
The aim of opening the Legal Research Unit is for the purpose of enhancing legal research among legal institutions in Sri Lanka, academics, professionals, and students.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was the chief guest. Among other distinguished invitees were Sri Lanka Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuirya PC, Padmasiri Jayamanna, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice and Buddhasasana and Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi. Minister Rajapakshe was warmly received by the Vice Chancellor Senior Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake and Indira Nanayakkara, Dean, Faculty of Law, University of Colombo. Former Deans, members of the Faculty of Law, and the staff of the Ministry of Justice were present.
The Legal Research Unit will provide a better atmosphere for further developments in legal research and law reforms, and upgrading the judicial system of Sri Lanka to international levels.
"Sri Lanka has made a budgetary allocation to facilitate legal research and to establish a unit for such research in its Budget proposals for 2016. In acting in accordance with this decision, the Ministry has expressed interest in partnering with the Faculty of Law of the University of Colombo," said Minister Rajapakshe.
"It was proposed to establish a new unit for the said purpose in partnership with the law teaching state funded institutions in Sri Lanka with the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo, being the lead partner. State funded universities are established under the 'Universities Act of Sri Lanka' on the basis of academic freedom and autonomy," he said.
The objectives of the independent unit, housed in the University, would include engaging in multi-disciplinary and cutting-edge research regarding the law that will strengthen the law reform initiatives of the State. This will provide a platform for collaboration nationally among the different state-funded law teaching institutions and also between government agencies and state universities. It will facilitate regional and international initiatives that can strengthen legal research, advocacy, and law reform and providing independent and evidence based consultancy services for state agencies in relation to law and policy.
