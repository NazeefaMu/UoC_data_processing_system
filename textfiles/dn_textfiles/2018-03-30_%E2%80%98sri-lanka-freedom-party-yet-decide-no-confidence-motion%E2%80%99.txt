‘Sri Lanka Freedom Party yet to decide on No-Confidence Motion’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had not yet taken a decision about the No-Confidence Motion tabled against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, said Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa said.
They were addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo.
Minister Dr. Amunugama said that the decision on how the SLFP should response, would be taken at the Central Committee (CC) Meeting of the party. When asked when the CC meeting is scheduled to be held, the minister said it would be held prior to April 4.
Minister Musthapa said that a common decision would be taken at the CC meeting.
When queried whether the No-Confidence Motion was a threat against the President, he said that it is not against the President, but the Prime Minister.
Minister Musthapa, addressing the gathering on the new electoral system, said that it is a victory for democracy. The country cannot move forward with a corrupt and preferential voting system, he said.
However, if there are any shortcomings with the new electoral system, measures would be taken to rectify them.
Speaking on the allegations of human rights violations against the country, both ministers said the government would make foreign countries aware that such allegations should not continue to be levelled.
