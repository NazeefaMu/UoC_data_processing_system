Removal of Hambantota wind power plant imminent

The Hambantota wind power plant will be removed since it is almost defunct and a heavy rent has to be paid for the SLPA, Spokesman for the CEB Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
Inaugurated in 1999, this is the only wind power project that the CEB owned.
He said that of five wind power towers, only three are functioning.
The CEB had decided to remove the wind power plant taking into account the expenditure it costs.
The CEB has called for tenders to remove the wind power towers and evaluated the proposals received and the most eligible company will be entrusted to remove the plant, he said.
