Among the eagles

DK Promotions who has given some quality entertainment in the past few months is offering another great Tribute concert titled Experience the Eagles at theBMICH on October 5 at 8pm. Eagles considered as one of the best bands ever to have emerged are no longer performing together following the demise of the founder member Glenn Frey in March this year. In order to keep the hits created by them alive.
The Long Run was formed in 1999 in Los Angeles by a group of well-rounded professional musicians with a love of harmony and a deep respect for one of the greatest rock bands of all time. After months of painstaking preparation rehearsing a long list of The Eagles' chart-topping hits, The Long Run set out to win over audiences across the USA. The strategy was to provide authentic live performances. They quickly became regarded as the finest Eagles tribute band worldwide by consistently delivering the lush harmonies and rich instrumental arrangements that made The Eagles an unforgettable part of rock history. The Long Run continues to successfully blend the classic Eagles sound into their own genuine live performance style, delighting audiences young and old with faithful recreations of some of the best music ever written.
The Long Run is on a tour to Asia and fans of the Eagles will get an opportunity see them perform and listen to all Eagles hits on the 5th when they come onstage. The singing, music created and performance is on par with the great Eagles and one could experience an unforgettable show. The duration of the concert will be approx 2 hours with 20 or more hits of Eagles. There will also be a special tribute to Glenn Fray.
Damayantha Kuruppu of DK Promotions said that the demand for tickets has been high and a substantial number of tickets have been sold already. It is recommended that tickets are purchased early to avoid disappointment he added.
