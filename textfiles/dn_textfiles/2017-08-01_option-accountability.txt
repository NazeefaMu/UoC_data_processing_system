The option of accountability

The system of transferring the ownership of the cars imported on duty free permits and selling them by some parliamentarians and making a good bit of money while depriving the State of taxes show not only the unsound and skewed policies of Governments but also the abysmally low quality and immorality of parliamentarians who indulge in many other malpractices and unethical deals as well. It is plainly a racket that has been legitimized and justified by those with crooked minds.
As parliamentarians give the lead, professionals and noted public figures too have imbibed the misuse of their social standing thereby disturbing good civic order, equality and justice in society. It also undermines human dignity. It is also a case of politicians in power usurping for selfish political ends the power of the people. These parliamentarians and professionals not only lack a sense of responsibility they also lack a sensitive social conscience. They become a law unto themselves and are devoid of accountability. This is nothing but degenerate political culture.
The Governments by certain policies they adopt demonstrate that they have only a mediocre sense of accountability. The people elect someone equal to themselves in human dignity, with educational and professional competence, capable of representing them to responsibly participate in the Government of the country for the common good. Unfortunately, because of their lack of education and understanding, many of them once elected, think they are absolute rulers without limits and act like petty dictators.
CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS AND CORRUPTION
They do not seem to understand the purpose of privileges, the space, the facilities and freedoms within certain perimeters given to them to render a social service by the right of representing the people and standing by the country unhampered by fear or favour. However, in the vanity of their egoism they arrogate to themselves powers they do not have and try to justify their kind of arbitrary exercise of power. Not only they; their siblings, in laws, their wives, children think power also flows on to them and exercise varying degrees of power, arbitrarily. Shallow and ignorant nobodies try to become somebodies with inept activities and arrogant attitudes and they end up becoming outlandish cynosures to those who notice them.
Some politicians have arbitrarily arrogated to themselves such powers in their electorate that they order the opening and closing of shops and business establishments according to their personal whims and fancies. Politicians have gone to the extent of exercising capriciously fanciful power – many of them wish to be able to order the police; one tries to order a judge, another barges into a television station, ties a public servant to a tree while another forces a teacher to kneel before students. Inside parliament crude politicians are known for their bad conduct. Some of them are swollen headed and have not learnt how to behave there and even in their ministries and offices. And they think that they need not explain anything to anyone and that no one should question them about their public conduct and their public expenditures. Their indiscipline and lack of accountability indicate their irresponsibility, their state of corruption and ignorance of public duty. That such individuals have been elected is due to people continuing to be deceived by the ruses of politicians.
SURFACING HIDDEN MONEY
The leaders of the Government are vested with much power. All that power is to be used first and foremost for the good of the country and not for their private benefit or for that of individuals close to the leaders. When they do so, they become betrayers of the people. The last regime did just that and the people taught them an unforgettable lesson. If the present leaders close their eyes to corruption by those who are close to them and act obstinately like those of the last regime, common sense would say how the people will punish them?
The people should make them feel the heat of the high temperature of a burning political stake even if they are not on the stake itself. The people will not tolerate the continuation of the stupidity and the sheer lack of accountability of the Rajapaksa regime by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime as well. If the Bond scammers and other rotters in their ranks are prioritized and the good of the people overlooked the political motivations of the present leaders will seem as dubious, inconsistent and corrupt as those of the former regime. Further, it goes completely counter to the new political culture that was promised.
Surely MS-RW and their team did not promise a level of corruption comparably just a little lower than that of their predecessors who to create trouble for the government now seem to be spending lavishly on asinine projects to bring down the government. The Government should investigate the hideouts whence the money comes.
NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Governments and its members are clever at presenting all kinds of reasoning and befuddling the people and arrogating to themselves all sorts of ‘privileges’ from absenting themselves from parliamentary sessions – now they have given themselves a payment to induce them to attend each session, in addition to their MP’s salary, – to gallivanting the globe on the slightest excuse, to ordering the police and even the judiciary in addition to their normal practice of intimidating the people who elected them. And they call press conferences to sweep many issues under the carpet or throw a blanket over them and threaten journalists without clearly pointing out any misreporting by journalists. Press conferences should be to clearly set before the people well thought out government plans and call for their support while exposing the conspiratorial plans of opponents including the befuddled civic-senseless GMOA headed by politicians wearing trade union masks.
There are a few others who overawe the people and get away with it while many politicians think that they are in a continuous popularity contest. Their judgements and decisions about the common good and accountability get skewed. This is far from upholding and maintaining courteous relationships with people and the public service and facilitating services between them. It should also be remembered that MPs elected are not in any way privileged to be contractors and business dealers with the Government. MPs should not be involved in any transactions with the Government and no trace of conflict of interest with regard to their mission as peoples’ representatives. Membership in parliament should not be contaminated with unworthy and hidden suspicious deals. If presently there is room for these unethical practices, the new Constitution should put it right and protect the people’s interests in this regard.
PROBITY OF CHARACTER
People should hold the leaders of the government, all of the Cabinet and all the MPs to account and demand that they carry out their responsibilities honourably. If they are just MPs, it would be sufficient if each of them could say that they faithfully carried out an unbroken dialogue with the people s/he represents and attended the sessions of parliament and contributed in the best way they could to the debates, carried out the assignments in the interests of the people that may have been given to them, without being tainted with immoral dealings, unethical practices and corruption of any sort.
The leaders of the government and ministers should show the people that they are worthy of the positions they are entrusted with and hold and that they are not careless of the high cost to the people for every session of parliament and for every decision they make especially concerning instances when they wish to defer to certain individuals to whom they wish to show favour. There should be no procrastinating or sidestepping on the probity of character and the integrity of key party men or of critical issues and there is no question of anyone saying how difficult it is to govern after a big mess that has been left behind.
OWNERSHIP SHOULD BE LEGITIMATE
Anyway, many an irritable element in the Cabinet contributes to negate the focusing of the Government on such important matters as the New Constitution with the new elements in it that people hope will bring about a new political culture and clean political environment prioritizing service to the people.
After a restoration of the democratic power of the people, the people wish to see that justice is done and not set aside, that what has been stolen or illegitimately acquired and taken away by any citizen is recovered. Absolutely no MP or any citizens should be beyond explaining how legitimately he has earned, acquired and owns all that one claims as one’s own. What is beyond reasonable explanation should be confiscated and become the property of the State. No one should be allowed to escape with any transgression by paying a nominal fine minutely out of proportion to the deception or to what has been stolen.
What needs to be understood is that neither corrupt men and women of the former regime nor the corrupt men and women of the present regime could do any lasting good to the country and its people. It is the duty of the President and Prime Minister to honour the pledges given to the people, uphold the trust the people have reposed in them both and do what needs to be done to clean up their administration and set the ship of state on a righteous course. All the members of the Cabinet need to be held to a high standard of honesty, accountability and transparency. The President and the Prime Minister are entitled to be faithful to their friends, but even they, not at the cost of the people of this country. The undemocratic disregard of merit, competence and qualifications and preferment of the undesirable tradition of nepotism, favouritism towards kith and kin and political henchmen needs to be banished and should have ended definitively with the demise of the last regime.
