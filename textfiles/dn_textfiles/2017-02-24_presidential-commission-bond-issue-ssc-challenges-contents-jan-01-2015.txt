Presidential Commission on bond issue: SSC challenges contents of Jan. 01, 2015 gazette

 
In a surprise move, Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera yesterday challenged the contents of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1895/19 issued on January 1, 2015.
She rose to point out a discrepancy in the said gazette notification. The said gazette notification included details of Treasury Bonds for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
She then elaborated and made another point to say that the same gazette notification gave the details of the controversial
Treasury bond issuance conducted on the February 27, 2015 and March 31, 2016.
The said gazette notification was issued during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Finance Minister.
Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence together with President’s Counsel Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
The Presidential Commission comprised of Supreme Court judges Justice K.T. Chitrasri , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai.
While questioning the Secretary to the Finance Ministry Dr.R.H.S.Samaratunge,Avanti Perera pointed out the discrepancy she observed in the said gazette notification.
At this point the President of the Commission Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said the Commission has decided to verify from the Government Printer as to the date on which the said gazette notification was printed.
Accordingly President’s Counsel Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera was instructed by the Presidential Commission to record a statement from the Government Printer immediately regarding the said gazette. Proceedings took a new turn as Dr. Avanti Perera questioned Dr. Samaratunga, if, to his understanding, a gazette notification must be published in terms of section 4.1 of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance as soon as the cash roll statement has been sent by the TOD and the Central Bank decided the mode of issuing treasury bonds.
Dr. Perera also questioned Dr. Samaratunga whether he is aware that a gazette notification that was challenged, has been published dated 1 January, 2015 bearing the gazette extraordinary number 1895/19, to which the latter answered in the negative .
Dr. Perera also pointed out to Dr. Samaratunga that there are several notices referring to particular treasury bond issuance which the then Minister of Finance, the Former President has signed.
It was pointed out by the Presidential Commission that Dr. Samaratunga cannot be aware of such a gazette notification since he was not the Secretary to the Finance Ministry at that time.
Dr. Perera also questioned Dr. Samaratunge whether he is aware the gazette notification challenged, reflects details of a transaction that took place two months thereafter, which is also the main subject matter of the Presidential Commission.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane summarizing the point made by Dr. Perera re-phrased the argument as follows.
“So your point is that anybody who went through the said gazette could have known that there was a notice published on the 1 January 2015 that the Central Bank intends to issue 10.05 billion 30 year bonds on March01, 2015.”
