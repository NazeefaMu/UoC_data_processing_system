ACBC prevented from holding GM

Nugegoda District Judge Nilmini Ferdiandez yesterday issued an interim order preventing the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC) from holding its General Meeting until January 11.
The District Judge, however, also granted permission for the ACBC to hold their 99th anniversary within one and half hours.
Sudath Devapura filed this case against the ACBC because they are to submit the 2017 audit reports of the ACBC without submitting the 2016 audit reports.
Speaking to the media, Devapura noted that the accounts of the ACBC had not been approved at the last GM. Devapura said that there are many mistakes in 2016 audit report.
He said the ACBC is to submit the 2017 audit report in Kurunegala. Attorneys-at-law Jayantha Peries, Nishan Senarathne de Silva and Janaka Bodinanda appeared for the plaintiff under the instructions of Attorney- at-law Lahiru Galappaththi. Counsel Abeywardana appeared for the defendants.
The Judge fixed further inquiries for February 25.
