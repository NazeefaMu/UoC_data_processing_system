With China, The ASEAN, Japan, Bangladesh...: Sri Lanka will come into more agreements: Prime Minister

 “We will come into more agreements with Singapore, China, the ASEAN, Japan, and Bangladesh. Our intention is to create a platform for value addition and logistics in Sri Lanka. Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The ETCA agreement should be done by mid-year, he said.
The Prime Minster said so in an interview with the NDTV in Davos outlining Sri Lanka’s plans to develop its economy and become a regional economic hub.
“We envisage closer cooperation among the five southern states of India, US, and Singapore, which will help us develop,” he said. The Premier said he was in talks with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu about working together to develop industrial infrastructure and with officials from Kerala about creating common tourism program.
Wickremesinghe also noted that plans are in place to develop the Trincomalee Port.
“We are also in talks with India to develop Trincomalee as the main harbour for the Bay of Bengal. There are no sunken costs. We don’t require breakwaters. But at the moment, the whole of Trincomalee is being planned out,” he said.
"The Hambantota Port developments are going well and every country, not just China, is welcome to invest in the port," the Premier said.
Wickremesinghe mentioned that he would like to procure a $1 billion loan to jump start the Northern Province’s economy that would also help with rehabilitation.
“Rehabilitation work is going on but there are problems. There are a large number of war combatants. There are women-headed households. A lot of people are psychologically affected by the last stages of the war. The fact is that villages have been uprooted not once, but twice and thrice, and putting the social fabric back is difficult. There’s a lot of work to be done,” he said.
