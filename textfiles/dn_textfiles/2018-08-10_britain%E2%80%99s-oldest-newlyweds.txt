Britain’s oldest newlyweds

A couple are set to become Britain’s oldest newlyweds with a combined age of 167 – after falling in love at first sight.
Frank Bird, 88, and Muriel Kodritsch, 79, are set to tie the knot later this month following a whirlwind romance after meeting at church. The pair, who met in November, will be spending their honeymoon in a secret location on the south coast before enjoying a romantic getaway to the Lake District.
Muriel, who will be given away by her son Kevin, was widowed when her husband of 52 years David died in 2014.
Frank’s wife Renee died in 2016 after 62 years of marriage. Now, they’ve filled the empty spaces in each other’s hearts and no longer feel lonely.
Muriel, who worked as a carer for 26 years, said, “It was all so rapid. I just can’t believe it’s happened. I’d settled for being on my own for the rest of my life and Frank has also been very lonely.”
Frank, the former chairman of Redline Oil Company and a retired senior executive with Esso Petroleum, added, “I feel very fortunate finding love for a second time.”
