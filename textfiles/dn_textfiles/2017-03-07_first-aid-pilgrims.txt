First aid for pilgrims

A four day first aid and medical camp, organised by the Colombo Central Unit of The St John Ambulance Association and Brigade in Sri Lanka was held at Sripada. The event runs parallel to the Full Moon Poya day with the cooperation of teachers attached to the Western Province Education Ministry and nurses of the Accident Service of the Colombo National Hospital at Gangulathenne. It was held from February 23 to 26. 50 members, four nurses, four EMT officers, three principals and 10 teachers volunteered for the camp.
The team intends to provide all the first aid and medical assistance within twenty four hours to make the pilgrimage of the devotees comfortable and happy, by reducing their aches, pains, accidents and sudden illnesses throughout their journey. The event was sponsored by Bank of Ceylon.
