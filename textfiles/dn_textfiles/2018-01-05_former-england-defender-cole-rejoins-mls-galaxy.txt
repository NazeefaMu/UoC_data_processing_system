Former England defender Cole rejoins MLS Galaxy

LOS ANGELES: Former England defender Ashley Cole, a long-time Premier League star with Arsenal and Chelsea, has signed a one-year deal to remain with the Los Angeles Galaxy, the Major League Soccer club announced Wednesday.
The 37-year-old left back has 55 Galaxy appearances over two seasons, scoring one goal and setting up two others in 29 games for Los Angeles last season.
“We are very excited that Ashley will be returning for us in 2018. He has been a tremendous leader for our club,” Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. “He has shown he can be successful in this league and we’re confident that will continue in the season ahead.” Cole won two Premier League crowns and three FA Cups with Arsenal from 1999 to 2006, then added a Premier League crown, four FA Cups and a UEFA Champions League title from 2006 to 2014 with Chelsea.
He then spent two years at AS Roma before joining the Galaxy in 2016.
Cole played for England in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and with more than 100 international appearances became the most capped fullback in English history.
