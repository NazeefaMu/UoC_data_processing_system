Baywatch : Tanked!

Baywatch has had much hype and has been much looked forward to due to two reasons: the remaking of a well loved television series in new light and Priyanka Chopra’s debut to Hollywood. However as the wafer-thin plot unfolds all expectations go down the drain.
Firstly the movie does not have anything unique to offer. It is also not done cleverly enough to be enjoyed by the matured moviegoer. The movie takes a comic approach and revolves around an elite lifeguard crew, headed by Mitch Buchannon, who must stick together to keep their shores clean and secure from baddie Victoria Leeds.
Impossibly muscled Dwayne Johnson plays Mitch Buchannon, leader of the lifeguards. His exchanges with Zac Efron’s disgraced Olympic swimmer, Matt Brody, get only a few sniggers. Then there is Alexandra Daddario, who is Summer Quinn, a new recruit, who looks like Annabeth Chase in skimpy clothes. Priyanka Chopra is the evil Victoria tossing her hair, pouting and wearing slinky little numbers with plunging necklines. Sadly she does not even get a bikini moment in the tale.
Lack connection
Slapstick comedy is expected when Ronnie tries to woo the hot looking C J Parker. The editing too is not done well as Victoria and her two lame sidekick’s entrance seem out of place. The scenes lack connection and the characters have zilch chemistry. This is one of the main reasons why the film finds it hard to stay afloat.
There is too much focus on the perfect bodies of the lifeguards. However the sad fact is that both Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach are very forgettable as babes in red. They cannot compete with the likes of Pamela Anderson or any of the other legendary Baywatch cast who were breathtaking in their attire a couple of decades back.
One of the highlights in the movie is members of the previous television show: David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson making cameo appearances. However the downside of the matter is that they seem rather lost in the process.
Lively action
Director Seth Gordon should have taken an original path in the movie and made a production with sea, sun and sand with a psychotic shark thrown in. Then we could have had some lively action in Baywatch. However with the hero-villain approach found in almost every movie that hits the big screen, Baywatch tires it audience. It seems to drag on and we can only heave a sigh of relief as the story ends.
Unfunny, cheaply-produced, and let down by a cast which lacks oomph, it is not difficult to see why there were no clearer skies for Baywatch.
