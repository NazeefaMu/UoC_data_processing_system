Big winner at 2018 Canadian Country Music Awards

Global music star Shania Twain has a major reason to celebrate. She won big at the 2018 Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) awards.
Twain hosted this year's award ceremony, and she emerged as the big winner, taking home the coveted "Fans' Choice Award." This marks Twain's fourth time winning this prestigious award in her career.
At this year's CCMA award ceremony, which took place in Hamilton, Twain was also nominated for "Female Artist of the Year" but that trophy went to Canadian country songstress Meghan Patrick, where she earned her second consecutive win in this category.
Country star Dallas Smith was named "Male Artist of the Year," and Brett Kissel was named "Interactive Artist of the Year" for the fifth consecutive time.
