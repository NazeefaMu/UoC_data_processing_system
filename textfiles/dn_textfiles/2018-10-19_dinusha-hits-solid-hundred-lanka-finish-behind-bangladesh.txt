First four day Under-19 Test
Dinusha hits solid hundred but Lanka  finish behind Bangladesh

Sonal Dinusha hit a solid century but Sri Lanka finished 21 runs behind Bangladesh on the first innings on the third day of the first four day Under-19 Test played at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Dinusha’s knock of exactly 100 scored off 202 balls with five fours was the rock on which Sri Lanka built their first innings total of 288 replying to Bangladesh’s 309.
Apart from Dinusha’s innings only opener Navod Paranavithana (40), Mohomed Shamaz (31) and Ashian Daniel (27) made any noteworthy contributions to the total as Sri Lanka who were 168-3 at one stage folded up quickly to lose their remaining seven wickets for 120 runs.
Bangladesh skipper Towhid Hridoy followed his first innings half century with three wickets as did Rakibul Hasan who also finished with three wickets. At stumps Bangladesh were 18 for one leading overall by 39 runs going into the fourth and final day today.
