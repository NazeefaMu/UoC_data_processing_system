Padaviya’s thrifty water management yields bountiful harvest

Farmers in Padaviya have been able to combat the prevailing drought by thrifty water management during the Maha season and reap a bountiful harvest.
Around 141,000 farmer families have faced the drought for three consecutive seasons in the Anuradhapura district.
Residential project manager, Padaviya, N. Wasantha, himself a farmer, told the Daily News that the 6,500 farmer families who come under the Padaviya colonisation project succeeded in cultivating the full irrigable landscape of 13,500 acres, despite the prevailing drought, getting a yield of 150-220 bushels of paddy per acre. This commendable achievement was announced by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake at the recently Anuradhapura district agriculture committee monthly meeting. Padaviya reservoir's water capacity is 85,000 a.f.
The irrigable landscape under the tank is 13,500 acres. Padaviya is located 100 km from Anuradhapura city. The colonisation scheme began in 1950.
The reservoir has no other alternative water supply than rain water. After the crop failures in previous seasons, the farmer families at Padaviya were very discouraged as the water capacity in the tank was at 5,500 a.f., sufficient only to cultivate 1,000 acres out of 13,500 acres. Wanninayake authorised the Padaviya project management committee comprising farmers’ organisations, officials representing irrigation, agriculture, agrarian service development and the Divisional Secretary to take decisions regarding the water management for cultivation.
“We decided to cultivate every inch of the 13,500 acres giving top priority to preserve every drop of water in the tank, irrigating the land at the minimum level, with no conflicts allowed. Even though we faced many challenges, we didn't change our water controlling methodology, having understood the occasions when the paddy plant required water and we provided it in a thrifty manner,” Wasantha explained. “In a cultivation season with a low rainfall period, 6 acre feet of water is required for cultivating one acre.''
''But under our self-imposed and self-taught water management methodology, we used only 2.1 acre feet per acre. It worked, giving an unexpected paddy harvest, which our farmers never obtained during normal cultivation seasons earlier,” Wasantha said.
He said that hereafter the same water management system will be followed at the Padaviya scheme even when the tank is full.
The district agriculture committee headed by Anuradhapura GA has decided to submit a detailed report to the government regarding the Padaviya water management strategy which is exemplary.
