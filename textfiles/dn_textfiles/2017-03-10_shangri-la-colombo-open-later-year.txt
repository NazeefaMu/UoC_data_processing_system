Shangri-La Colombo to open later this year

The Shangri-La Hotel Colombo will open in the latter part of this year. Shangri-La Hotels Lanka sales and marketing head Neluka de Alwis said 57 % of the 390 luxury apartments has been sold by now which was a great achievement.
Among the buyers are Sri Lankan diaspora and international investors, she said. Shangri-La Hotel also incorporates a 1,800 sqm ballroom, 50,000 sqm retail mall and 125,000 sqm office space.
De Alwis said the work on the residencies was continuing on plan and was scheduled to be completed in the latter part of 2018.
The Hong Kong-based Shangri-La group broke ground in the US$650 million mixed used property in Colombo on 10 acre land in February 2012 under an investment commitment of US$ over US$ 720 million to complete its projects in Colombo and Hambantota.
