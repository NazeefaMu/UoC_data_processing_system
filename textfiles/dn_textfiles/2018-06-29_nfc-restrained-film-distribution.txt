NFC restrained  in film distribution

The Colombo District Court yesterday issued an injunction order preventing the National Film Corporation from carrying out the distribution of films in Sri Lanka.
This order is effective for 14 days. Last week, it was announced that a decision had been taken to handle the distribution of films only through the National Film Corporation and the private sector cannot handle any distribution of films.
The film distribution in the country was handled by four private sector companies.
