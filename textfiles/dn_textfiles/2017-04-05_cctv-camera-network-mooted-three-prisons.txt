CCTV camera network mooted for three prisons

Plans have been formulated to set up CCTV Camera networks inside the Galle, Welikada and Negombo prisons as a pilot project. This was disclosed by Galle District Parliamentarian and Co-Chairman Galle District Co-ordinating Committee at a committee meeting held recently. Hettiarachchi said this matter was discussed at a Parliamentary Select Committee meeting and measures have been taken to install this system urgently.
A special arrangement had also been made regarding the question of taking mobile phones into Prisons. This arrangement would be first tried out as a pilot project at the Galle prison.
