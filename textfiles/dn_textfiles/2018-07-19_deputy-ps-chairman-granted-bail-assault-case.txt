Deputy PS Chairman granted bail in assault case

Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Peiris released the Deputy Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) Chairman on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000, along with a Rs. 10 million surety, yesterday.
The magistrate ordered the Deputy Chairman to report to Akmeemana Police every Sunday, as well as to submit revenue reports on surety assets, to prove their validity in case of contravention of bail conditions.
He was accused of assaulting a PS office assistant over an incident that occurred at an Akmeemana Regional Coordinating Committee meeting on July 9, held under the patronage of Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi. The Deputy Chairman was said to have attacked the victim due to delays in handing him a microphone.
