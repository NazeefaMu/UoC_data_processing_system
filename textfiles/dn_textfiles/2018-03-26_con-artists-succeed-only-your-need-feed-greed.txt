Con-artists succeed only by your need to feed on greed!

Welcome to the shadowy world of confidence artistes, or con-men. A con-man, or woman, is a person who deliberately deceives another usually for personal financial gain. Despite what you may think, a con man, or woman isn't always a shady-looking character.
A con-artist is an expert at looking however he/she needs to look. Make no mistake about it, con artistes and con-men are among the most cultured, well-mannered and courteous people on Planet Earth.
You find them everywhere, the smooth-talking sophisticated types, with an aristocratic demeanour who impress you with their charisma. Con-men are suave and slick characters and tend to be excellent conversationalists while appearing genuinely charming.
Had they taken to the thespian profession they would have won accolades and Oscars by the bushel for their acting performances. They possess the flawless ability to charm and flatter people and also make them noticeably comfortable. This is obviously an effective ploy for getting what they want from people.
The shyster employs a light and subtle touch. His modus operandi does not involve violence or blackmail to get his prey to part with his money. No. That would be a contravention of the law. That is why his technique is at variance with all other forms of crime.
The confidence trickster is occasionally graded with criminals such as thieves, pickpockets, and larcenists. But that is usually a misnomer as he is not a thief in the legal sense because he does not actually steal. In many cases the gullible victim virtually thrusts a wad of money into his grubby hands. It is a personal accomplishment to him that he does not really have to steal in a technical sense.
So you see, many con-men are not crooks in the regular discernment of the word. A con-man flourishes in his occupation primarily because of the supportive dishonesty and greed of his victim. He first wins the confidence of his quarry. He is then able to inspire in him a firm belief in his own honesty. The next step is to excite the avarice of his target holding out the exciting prospect of easy profit. All the same they could rightly be categorised as charlatans and 'dirty rotten scoundrels.'
Con-artists make money through deception. They lie, cheat and fool people into thinking they have happened onto a great deal or some easy money. Remember the old adage that you never get something for nothing.
There's another axiom which goes: "You can't cheat an honest man." Most cons rely on the victim's own greed. Con-artists know that people often throw caution to the wind when they start seeing currency signs flickering before their eyes. Deals that sound too good to be true usually are. Relatively few master con-men are ever brought to trial unless they keep pushing their luck too far. Yet of those who are tried, few are convicted. And of those who are convicted, even fewer ever serve out their full sentences. This accounts for the fact that it has been found very difficult to prosecute confidence men successfully. For once a victim is fleeced he often proves to be a most reluctant and untruthful witness against the men who have taken his money.
These scams will often come in the form of a suave dynamic salesman phoning you or through glitzy promotional material in the post or on email. Basically when it comes to all sorts of investing is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. For example, 'Ponzi schemes' are some of the oldest scams of them all. These swindles were named after Charles Ponzi who first ran an investment scam in the 1920s where investors were persuaded to buy postal reply coupons. The scheme collapsed after he was found using new investor money to pay older investors. This is something to watch out for in cold-called investments that offer regular income or capital gains.
In Sri Lanka the Golden Key Credit Card Company run by Lalith Kotelawala collapsed like a pack of cards. Golden Key and the enterprises run by Sakvithi Ranasinghe operated such schemes on a large scale. They were two of the biggest scams to rock the country in recent years.
In recent history there have been a number of con-men who have really stood out for the wealth they amassed, their impudence and the ease with which they tricked trusting people. The majority of successful con-men undoubtedly have great style. Some call it the genius of social engineering for fleecing people for everything they have.
Our little isle too earned the dubious reputation of producing two such hustlers regarded as among the most audacious con-men in international history. No doubt, they were suave and slick and classy operators. Michael Marion Emil Anacletus Pierre Savundranayagam, better known as Emil Savundra and also styling himself Doctor Savundra (1923 -1976), was a Ceylonese international swindler and confidence trickster active in Belgium, Ghana and England. He was behind the collapse and scandal of the Fire, Auto and Marine Insurance Company in the United Kingdom. He was at least twice imprisoned for his crimes of fraud.
Then there was Charles Percival de Silva (1947-73) originally from Ceylon, with a sound education and a wealthy grandfather. He came to England in 1947. A courteous, intelligent man, he spent a quarter of a century either defrauding wealthy, gullible society people, or spending time in jail for his scams, which he referred to lightly as "one of my little games."
Operating by and large out of London's trendy West End, De Silva became identified and respected by members of London's wealthy establishment whom he would eventually swindle out of about £3 million, a staggering sum at the time. In 1951, he spent his first term in jail, sentenced for attempting to swindle Selfridge's store out of more than £2,000 in nylons, a then scarce commodity.
Released from jail, De Silva who was impressed by social connections cadged an invitation to a party held by the prestigious philanthropist Lady Dorothy Macmillan. He gave her a large cheque for one of her favourite charities, impressing the wealthy 'mug' sufficiently to get her to invest large amounts in fraudulent schemes soon after.
But what actually won him the highest questionable recognition was his duping an American multi-millionaire who had a penchant for young girls. De Silva pulled what was clearly the most incredible and hilarious scam in history which elevated him to the title of the 'Prince of Knaves' - the highest tribute the 'con' fraternity could confer on a master at the game.
Arranging a team of hand-picked prostitutes, all dressed as schoolgirls, De Silva threw a party for the American, convincing him that the young ladies had been provided by the Mother Superior of a Catholic convent school. The affluent American wrote a cheque for £25,000 to be paid to the non-existent Mother Superior. Without a doubt, it was the biggest 'pros and cons' swindle in history!
