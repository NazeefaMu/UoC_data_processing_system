A kindling journey

“Can we be like drops of water falling on the stone?
Splashing, breaking, dispersing in the air
Weaker than the stone by far,
But be aware that as time goes by,
The rock will wear away
And the water comes again
These lines, it is recorded, had been uttered initially by a Taoist Chinese prophet named Lao Tzu. But as times went by, several others tried to recreate the same in their own expression.
Several years ago, I came across a poetic playlet written by Bertolt Brecht titled as Journey of the Prophet, where I read the same lines in a different manner that ran as follows.
When a gust of water flows for some time, over a rugged stony slab, the ruggedness gradually wanes off. As such, get to know that a salient latent power line in the eternal flow of water, mild and calm.
Acts of kindness
I recalled all this, when I reread a certain book written by a psychologist named Lois P Frankel. The book contains about 100 such lines culled from various sources titled as Kindling the Spirit published in 1995.
The subtitle runs as ‘Acts of Kindness and words of courage for women’. But on reading the pages, one sees that the words could apply equally to any other gender irrespective of any difference in age and discrimination.
The writer cum compiler of the work mentioned has devoted at least 20 years in the collection process. The intention is laid down as follows:
“As Anan Freud said, it is the good, capable, conscientious woman who is more likely to be depressed than her counterparts.” Then she adds, that paradoxically, the woman who does so much for other creates her own drepression and has little energy left to spend on herself. As the compilation had grown up, the writer Frankel, who is a woman dedicated to help others had innermost feeling of sharing her expressions from various sources with other women. As a result, ‘read from wherever you like,” came to be the guiding epithet. Prior to the publication of the work, Frankel had the experience writing her first book titled as Women, Anger and Depression. Perhaps the interest shown on this work is the outcome of the compilation, which of course is not a sequel to the former.
Frankel adds her own brief interpretation to each of her collection of sayings, dictums, maxims and poetic expressions. Let us take a few out of them that goes as follows:
Healing power
“Life appears to me too short to e spent in nursing animosity or registering wrong,” said Charlotte Bronte.
Frankel states: “Let people know when they’ve hurt you so that you can heal sooner.” (145 pp)
Helen Keller said:
“I seldom think about my limitations and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is justa touch of yearning at times, but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers.”
These words are interpreted by Frankel as: “When you turn out lights tonight rest well with the knowledge that who you are is truly enough – you need not be anything gmore.”
The compiler Frankel inserts a saing of the French writer Nathalie Sarraute as follows:
“We are swallowed up only when we are willing for it to happen.”
Frankel adds: “Decide consciously what you want to do rather than taking the path of least resistance,”
Unwanted stress
A reader may feel, perhaps a meditative mood creeps into his/her mind. This may kindle a light to dispel the darkness which causes unwanted stress and strain. Over the years, our teachers have taught us that good words matter and good deeds matter. But how have you perceived the utterance of good words? How have you acted in the performance of good deeds?
Frankel attempts to show the path transcending from the mere barriers of positive thinking that has come to stay almost like a catchphrase in common parlance. Frankel says at the outset: “Resolve to engage in one act of self-kindness each and every day of the year.” Frankel develops her interpretation by a quote that goes as follows.
“If women were convinced that a day off or an hour of solitude was a reasonable ambition, they would find a way of attaining it. As it is, they feel so unjustified in their demand that they rarely make the attempt.”
Do not follow the path may lead. Go instead, where there is no path and leave a trail is yet another quote to which Frankel adds her interpretation as follows:
Forging path
“Break out of the boundaries that have been circumscribed for you through birth, race, gender or age, and forge your own path.”
Summing up her function, Lois Frankel comes out with a profound conclusion: “My writing always begins with the desire to help others and results in my being helped as much as I hope the reader is kindling the spirit are no different.
I found myself taking more time to actually engage in the activities I suggested in their book and thinking more about what I could do for myself that would replenish my well.”
The underlying factor in these book look like to me a series of religious thought and spiritual jottings that could be put to practice if one could calm down and concentrate.
