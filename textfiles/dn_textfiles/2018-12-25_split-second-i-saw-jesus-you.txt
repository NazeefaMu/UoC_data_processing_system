Split of a second, I saw Jesus in you

It happened one glorious moment when we met first.In a flash I saw Jesus in your heavenly smile.The wind russled when you seized my heart and soulWhen all these years I searched the truthUnaware it was knocking at my doorUntil the shimmering mantle fell on you.
As days passed to years, found the vacuum painfulUntil one day; in one bright summer mornIt stirred and merged as the vision in my heartI saw you at a distance, breathless beyond control.Virtually my guiding light in darkness.And knew I found you, my Lord on earth.
Cascading water from purple mountain topsCrash hard on the slimy slippery rocksRoar and thunder, awake the sleepy woodsAs you wander, I see you as the golden throthWhen floating clouds part to revealThe Lord who gently stole my heart
You are the wind in my hair that softly blow,Wild over cliffs to reach the sky;And join the mighty river gushing downAs dancing ripples swirl the flowWalking through the woods treading snowdropsPraising Jesus born to save us sinners.
From lofty green hills far awayTo glittering sandy valleysWhen I had a wondrous dream one sunny dayIt was blurred as many dreams areAnd I opened my sleepy eyes to confrontYour vision as the blur cleared away
You are the one I revere and loveWho walks beside me day after dayUnseen, unheard but always nearFeel your fragrance that never fadeAnd lessons you preach in wisdom wiseGives me strength and courage in sustenance.
Footsteps gently placed on earthYou guide the way to Lord Jesus ChristWhen you caress the withered flowers,They spring back to life and bloomGod has chosen you to shepherd His flockAnd placed the staff in your keep.
Cherish every moment at your feetEvery hour unto eternity.Warm and kind; you light each dayWhatever season be; spring or summerAutumn fresh to winter harshEach morn shine and glow on you.
You are my wide wondrous worldWhen I see you mountains moveAs gales and storms rip through,And turn around at your commandYou calm the rising sea and berate the wavesMiracle or not, in my eyes they behold
