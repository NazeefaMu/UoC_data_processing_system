Cricket is a game of many facets

I have seen the high wall of Lord’s ground, symbolically, as cutting off cricket from the outside world. “Keep politics out of sports” was the cry during the “ha ho” about the 1970 South African tour.
No sport runs deep into life than cricket in Sri Lanka. When watching a cricket match mood swings occur frequently.
Cricket in many ways is unique, yet to sing praises about it is to underestimate its humane quality.
It is a game of figures since it determines its outcome. A man may play billiards or snooker he will not look at a scoreboard to decide whether he is winning or losing. An interesting point here is that the players face in this game is permanently in shadow. Whereas the Australian, Indian, Sri Lankan or West Indian cricketers in action however and - regardless of their caps and colour - within minutes they will identify themselves by their methods, manner or attitude which goes to say that most games are skin deep; but cricket goes to the bone. It is worthwhile having a look at these countries.
AUSTRALIA - The Australians still play the game harder than any other country, recently they got what they wanted in their payment issue, they have never knuckled down to any threats posed on them. They are not sissies in the playing field and off the field they are always willing to have a friendly chat over a beer. The Australians have a rock solid cricket structure, from grade cricket to Sheffield Shield and then to the top rung, players are nurtured systematically so that they can be world beaters. By and large they also have a solid family life so that they can focus on their game without any distractions.
INDIA - India has improved in “leaps and bounds” in recent times, one may argue that it’s easy to pick talent from their vast population.This is not true because picking talent and nurturing them is a difficult task. They must be doing it with proper dedication and commitment by their scouts who must be incorrupt and honest. Their team is riding ably led by Virat Kohli. I feel that everything is in place in their cricket ‘jigsaw’. Due to their pristine culture the cricketers have a good family life most of their cricketers are geared not to have any distractions. They too have a cricket structure that is well in place and Sunil Gavaskar, the great cricketer and analyst had the audacity to state that Sri Lanka is no match for a “Ranji Trophy” side, for him to relegate us like that means there is something wrong somewhere!
WEST INDIES - The West Indian cricket were more less governed by their ‘prima donnas’, recently, headed by Chris Gayle. They are going through a lean patch at the moment, they too have talent and sooner than later we hope they sort their problems out. West Indian stroke play is exciting which nobody can match and their pace battery in the past has created havoc among the hapless batsmen as we all know.
BANGLADESH - Bangladesh are heading in the right direction, their cricket playing is under the able hands of Chandika Hathurusingha and some notable ex Sri Lankan players, all of them has had a raw deal back home. As they are an emerging nation in world cricket, the support they get from their crowd is tremendous, just like the Sri Lankan scenario in the mid-nineties.
SRI LANKA - At the moment Sri Lankan cricket is in dire straits; how can a team beat the Australians a few years back and get then get “Indian washed with the best detergents.” The set up has hardly changed, then and now e.g. players, selectors and the up above. Sifting through the rubble I point my finger at the commitment of the players and their lackadaisical attitude along with the shuffling of captains like a pack of cards.No one in this present team is playing for their country and in some instances not even for themselves.
Once a captain is changed and not being dropped from the team, that person pretends to carry an injury and underperform, it is an absurd state of affairs. We have had Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga and Dinesh Chandimal as captains, except Chandimal (yet to be properly tested but disappointing thus far) have not delivered at all. They have given records to their opponents on a platter. These captains have their favourites and enemies and the player’s commitment suffer as a result.
Lasith Malinga the “prima donna” has done the country proud but he should be shown the door, since his physical fitness is very poor and his commitment to his fielding is abysmal.
Angelo Mathews is not a fitness fanatic too, and when he fields he takes one catch and drops three, when he bats threes become twos and twos become singles which bugs the opposing batsmen no end. He is resting his muscles too by not bowling.
Rangana Herath with his battered knees has definitely seen better days, high time he retires now. He is another passenger in the field.
Upul Tharanga has a lackadaisical attitude although his cover drive is pleasing to the eye. At his age he should think of retirement as well.
Dinesh Chandimal - Now that he has got the much awaited Test captaincy, he should forge the team together, his field placing was much to be desired in the recent series and when you have three past captains on the field, at best they can confuse you more than been useful to him. I bet if Chandimal had his way he should have depended on his own judgement, and done better. He was batting well in the third Test but did not play with soft hands to the spinners and was plucked by the Indians in the leg trap.
Kusal Mendis - His talent is there and has scored many runs but his running between the wickets is horrendous, at times it looks as if he is bored with batting and looking for a way to get out. In the future he should think of the team first and foremost.
Niroshan Dickwella - The way he got out trying the “Dilscoop” was diabolical and at that time Sri Lanka was in dire straits, he should put the side before self in the future.
