Hayleys Energy  offloads oil rig from  Brazil Trincomalee

Hayleys Energy Services, had successfully completed the offloading of the Semi-Submersible oil rig Olinda Star at the Trincomalee Port Anchorage recently. This deep-water rig is capable of drilling at water depths of up to 3,600 feet and has a drilling depth capacity of up to 24,600 feet.
The company was appointed as the exclusive service provider and Sri Lankan representative for the handling of the rig by the Brazilian Oil and Gas exploration and drilling services company, Queiroz Galvao Oleo Gas S.A.’s (QGOG).
The rig was being dry towed from Rio, Brazil to Trincomalee Anchorage, Sri Lanka aboard Dockwise Mighty Servant 1, one of the world’s largest heavy lift carriers.
The Trincomalee Port Anchorage was selected for its ideal stable and safe sea conditions for offloading and loading such large Oil Rigs with the much needed deep sea depths, sheltered-calm waters and swing radius. Upon completing the safe and incident free offloading of the Oil Rig Olinda Star, the rig was towed from Trincomalee Port, Sri Lanka to Kakinda, India.
QGOG had contracted Hayleys Energy Services (HES) to manage all aspects of this Rig Offloading project in Sri Lanka, where HES had to coordinate and handle the project in close liaison with the Deputy Harbour Master of Trincomalee Port and Port Officials throughout this complex and challenging operation.
Speaking about the project, Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hayleys Energy Services, Chas Charles said, “Our experts have handled complex rig moves around the world as a 100% Sri Lankan Company since its inception, and it is indeed a noteworthy track record to see yet another safe and smooth rig offload carried out in Sri Lanka adhering to the industry safety standards and delivering timely results.”The wide end-to-end service range provided by Hayleys Energy Services as a one-stop-shop, included the provision of three Tugs and supply vessels owned by Sri Lanka Shipping Company (a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited), coupled with the supply of bunkers & fenders, vessel provisions, crew transfer boats, unlashing/welding & engineering work, hospitality services, emergency response services and project management for the entire operation in Trincomalee.
“Our team’s knowledge and expertise in the Oil & Gas domain, clearly gives us a distinct edge over the rest in Sri Lanka and has today earned a renowned name for carrying out complex integrated Oil and Gas logistics services and projects with a 24/7 personal commitment to our international clientele.
It is indeed a landmark moment for us at HES to successfully conclude yet another incident free rig offload meeting the client’s expectations.”
“We would like to thank QGOG for placing their trust in us and also appreciate the assistance offered by all stakeholders including the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Immigration, Sri Lanka Navy and all other regulatory bodies in making this project a success,” said Ricky Barnett, General Manager of Hayleys Energy Services.
