Electrocuted farmer’s body found in river

Pitabeddara police in Matara found the electrocuted body of Kudage Piyasena (58), a farmer of Siyambalagoda, Pitabeddara, in a stream of the Nilwala river on August 14.
Police are looking for another paddy farmer who allegedly threw the dead body to the river.
The deceased had been electrocuted by a live wire that the former had set to the fence of his paddy field. The body was sent for a post mortem to the Matara Hospital. It reveals that Piyasena had died of electrocution.
At the inquest, it was decided that the death was a homicide.
Piyasena’s wife had called him for tea around 6.15 am and came to know that he was not in the house. She then had complained to Pitabeddara police of her husband’s disappearance.
She lodged another complain the following day that she was suspicious of her husbands death. He may have been electrocuted accidentally when he touched a live wire fixed to a fence around a paddy field by another farmer, she had told police.
Police found the body around 3 pm on the same day.
