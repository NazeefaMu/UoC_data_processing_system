Nature’s many health benefits

We all know that getting away from our everyday tasks and stress can be enjoyable. However, even if it’s just for a short period of time, getting out in nature can have several health benefits.
Vitamin D
The sun is the best source of vitamin D for our bodies. Vitamin D is actually a hormone that helps to maintain a healthy immune system. Lacking vitamin D can put you at an increased risk for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoporosis. Heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis have all been linked with vitamin D deficiency as well. Getting vitamin D from natural sources is always best as supplements can be ineffective and unsafe.
Eye Health
Getting outside can improve your eye health in two different ways. First, it can help prevent computer vision syndrome which is caused by looking at a screen too close for long periods of time. When you are outside, you naturally focus on objects that are farther away which gives your eyes a much-needed break. Secondly, new research shows that being exposed to artificial light can increase nearsightedness.
Better Sleep
As humans, our sleep patterns follow our internal body clock or our circadian rhythm. This schedule naturally follows the sun’s schedule. If you spend too much time away from natural sunlight, it can alter your circadian rhythm and disrupt your sleep pattern. A few consecutive days in nature can really help boost natural sleep patterns for most people.
Clean Air
It is common knowledge that outdoor air pollution is harmful; however, indoor air pollution is even worse. In fact, indoor air pollution can be between twice and 100 times more concentrated than outdoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution can put you at risk for heart disease, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Breathing fresh air outside is much better for your overall health.
Exercise
Getting outside provides an almost automatic opportunity for exercise. Whether it’s a simple brisk walk or a kayaking trip, the exercise possibilities are almost endless when you are outside. Exercise has a multitude of health benefits such as increased fat burning capacity, as well as the potential for prevention of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure.
Psychological Benefits
Getting outside in the sunshine and fresh air also helps clear your mind. It has been linked with better mental well-being, improved attention spans, stress relief, increase serotonin (also known as the feel-good hormone), as well as better emotional stability and more empathy for others. Meditating outdoors can stretch these benefits even further.
Grounding
Finally, and maybe not quite as scientific, is the benefit of grounding. Sometimes referred to as earthing, grounding refers to bare skin contact with a natural surface such as dirt or sand.
The theory holds that because the earth is negatively charged we absorb the earth’s electrons when we are barefoot. A study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine reports that grounding can provide an energizing effect on the body as well as anti-inflammatory actions.
