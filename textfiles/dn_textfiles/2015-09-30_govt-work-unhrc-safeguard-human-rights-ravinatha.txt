Govt. to work with UNHRC to safeguard human rights - Ravinatha

The Sri Lankan Government will work with the United Nations Human Rights Council(UNHRC) and the international community to take necessary steps to safeguard and uphold the human rights of all citizens, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka Ambassador Ravinatha P. Aryasinha said.
He was addressing the UN Human Rights Council 30th Session yesterday when the Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka was taken up for debate.
"The President and Prime Minister placed reconciliation as well as development as the top-most priorities of the Government. Efforts were launched immediately to restore and renew Sri Lanka's relations with the international community as a whole to ensure that the benefits of these partnerships and relationships accrue to the people of my country.
Soon after the Parliamentary Election on the 17th of August, the President and the Prime Minister worked to forge a National Unity Government that is essential for the political and policy stability required for reconciliation to succeed.
The spirit of the Government that I represent is to build a nation that is prosperous, a nation where the human rights of all individual citizens are protected, a nation which is a responsible member of the international community, a nation that is confident, respecting the universal values of freedom, equality and justice, and a nation that is at peace with itself and with the world.
This new vision is what we now represent in our actions in this Council. You heard clearly the message that the Minister of Foreign Affairs conveyed when he addressed the Council on the 14th of September regarding the steps that Sri Lanka has already taken and intends to take in achieving reconciliation and upholding human rights including the setting up of mechanisms for truth seeking, justice, reparations and non-recurrence through consultations with all stakeholders.
In this path that we have chosen to tread, we will work with the High Commissioner, his Office, systems and procedures of the Human Rights Council and the international community including our bilateral partners to take necessary steps to safeguard and uphold the human rights of all our citizens. This includes obtaining their advice and assistance." he said in his statement.
