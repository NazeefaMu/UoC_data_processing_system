Life Lessons

Little would Louisa May Alcott have dreamed when she lifted her pen after writing the last line of her autobiographical novel in 1868 hundred and fifty years later a nine-year-old girl in Sri Lanka would be reading it with the same rapture she reads contemporary work like Harry Potter and the Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Alcott might also have been surprised to know that the girl had picked the book from her mother’s bookshelf, having seen how her mother reads and rereads the book and often heard that if her mother would be stuck on a desert island — with only one book to bring with her — it would be this one: ‘Little Women.’
I suppose you already know by now that the above is true because the girl happens to be my daughter and the tattered copy she is reading, the covers pasted together with tape, once belonged to my grandmother. I am sure like so many others belonging to many generations before me, those of us who love this book return to it again and again, called to it by some mysterious yearning for a life we never had, memories we never experienced, and yet driven by a wish to identify ourselves with one or the other of the main characters - which needless to say, often happens to be that of Joe March.
It is amazing, however, to read in a book written about a book, ‘Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why it Still Matters’ by Anne Boyd Rioux, Alcott wasn’t happy when her publisher asked her to write a book about girls. She told a friend, “I could not write a girls’ story, knowing little about any but my own sisters and always preferring boys.” But she persevered, and when “Little Women” was published 150 years ago, in September 1868, 2,000 copies were sold in two weeks. The book has never gone out of print since then, and has appeared in hundreds of editions and dozens of foreign translations.
Through the adventures of the March children and their mother, living in somewhat impoverished circumstances in a small Massachusetts town while their father is away during the Civil War Alcott brings to life four different girls endowing each with assets and flaws. Beautiful Meg is vain and dreams of riches; stubborn-but-talented Jo is prone to fits of temper; sweet, timid Beth wants to spend adulthood at home; and often-selfish Amy yearns to be an artist.
It is no secret that Jo mirrored its author, while her real-life sisters—Anna, Lizzie, and May—are models for the March sisters. What readers had not known at the time the book was published was that unlike Jo, Alcott experienced an unstable family life. Her father Bronson was a Transcendentalist who rubbed shoulders with Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although he encouraged his daughter’s writing, he believed working for money would violate his philosophy. Consequently, his wife and daughters labored to feed the family, which moved often. This may explain Mr. March’s small-but-exalted role in Little Women.
For most of us, the most important question in the book was: Would Jo marry her charming neighbor, Laurie? Sadly, no. For Alcott had hoped to make Jo a “literary spinster,” like herself but when fans demanded that Jo marry, Alcott bowed to pressure. She marries Joe off, but makes sure she doesn’t give her readers everything they wanted. She makes Jo reject Laurie’s marriage proposal and wed a less appealing older man. Faced with readers’ eagerness for a wedding, Alcott later said that she “didn’t dare to refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her (Joe).” If Joe’s choice of partner had disappointed the 19th century readers, it equally disappointed 21st century feminists, because the marriage caused Jo to abandon her writing career.
Through her book written to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Little Women, Anne Boyd Rioux, a professor at the University of New Orleans and a scholar of 19th century women’s literature shows how well she understands the love so many of us have for Alcott’s classic. Rioux says despite the fact that schools barely teach Alcott’s work today, with educators believing that requiring a boy to read a book with “women” in the title will forever turn him against reading, the book really does still matter.
Tracing literary works that owe a debt to Alcott, she writes, “Just as Hemingway claimed that all of American literature (by men) came from ‘Huck Finn,’ we can also say that much of American women’s literature has come from ‘Little Women.’Little Women’ has been called ‘the mother of all girls’ books.’ It is also, arguably, the most beloved book of American women writers (and near the top for women writers around the globe) and has exerted more influence on women writers as a group than any other single book.”
Rioux also argues that‘Little Women’ is not strictly for girls. Theodore Roosevelt, who was the very model of a manly man, admitted that “at the risk of being deemed effeminate,” he “worshipped” Little Women and its sequel, Little Men. At the end of the 19th century, Little Women appeared on a list of “the 20 best books for boys,” but in 2015, Charles McGrath of the New York Times confessed that as a child, he read Little Women in a brown paper wrapper to avoid taunts from other boys. Rioux says she understands that reading the novel and feeling like outsiders can be unsettling for boys, but she believes “that’s a great experience for them to have.” She also adds, for good measure, that the novel “also shows how men are educated into their gender, as Laurie must give up his music and prepare to take over his grandfather’s business.”
In her book, Rioux shows Little Women as a love letter filled with life lessons. She argues for the positive influence exerted by the book and in particular by the character of Jo, who chooses the life of the mind over the lure of privilege, pretty clothes and boys. Furthermore, she explains, “it’s a book that has had real world impacts on people’s lives and their perception of themselves and perception of each other.
Alcott’s decision to throw the spotlight on four different girls demonstrated to readers “that womanhood isn’t something you’re born with; it’s something that you learn and grow into,” Rioux says. “And you have the ability to pick and choose which parts of it you want.” These words bring to mind Alcott’s portrayal of the girls’ overworked mother, Mamee, who concedes, “I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it.”
One sleepy afternoon in September when the girls and Laurie sit in a quiet nook and chat about their future Joe says, “If we are all alive ten years hence, let’s meet, and see how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now.” They might not have achieved their wishes ten years later, but hundred and fifty years into the future the sisterly bond of the March girls continue to be held as a paragon of female friendship, so often belittled by women in modern fiction by being cruel to one another in order to fit into a male space.
There’s no doubt hundred and fifty years hence ‘Little Women’ will continue to be read and reread because, like how Louisa May Alcott said, “Some books are so familiar that reading them is like being home again.”
