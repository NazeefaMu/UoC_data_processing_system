Song-like stories Professor

I am quite thankful to the dear little creative writer, Aminthika Dissanayake who presented me her debut effort in the compilation of eight little narratives, titled as ‘Little Dreams’. Aminthika has told me that she is a student at Bishop’s College, Colombo 3. Having read these eight narratives as a reader, I felt that she possesses two major factors needed for a sensitive creative writer.
First, it is the creative imagination that seems to pervade other creative factors. Followed by this, she embraces the apt expression talents like communicative and linguistic skills. One good example is the first narrative titled as Song. Here she tries to humbly disagree with her music teacher without commenting it openly in the following introspective expression:
“My Music Teacher says that to make a song, you should decide on the perfect tune. That tune should have a rhythmical beat. Once the tune is set, you must compose meaningful lyrics that fit into the tune. The lyrics should come under a certain theme and should go with the title.”
This verdict is sensitively challenged by the narrator, the pupil, in these words.
“But to me, a song is never created in that way. A song is the call of your heart.”
Carrying on, the reader perhaps enters a realm of poetic vision that embraces a series of imagery.
“A song is a flowing sweet melody that takes you on a journey through your heart. Music is the greatest part of my life.”
Even the little wooden flute that was handed to me by my great-grandfather was part of my life.”
The poetic vision deepens as the narrator presents a convincible lively experience creating contemplative isolation. Each sentence is a thought-stream that goes as: My heart filled with the urge to burst into song and I hummed slowly before beginning
My words blew into the air with meanings that only the birds understood
I sang of the beautiful serene view from the mountain tops and the peaceful green valleys down below.
I sang the bubbling creeks as they gush down over the smooth pebbles and the trees that sway gently in the morning breeze and the golden rays of the sun pour down on the new leaves.
This stream of thoughts transferred into a series of words, the reader discerns as the birth of a song. The scene changes with the opening of the gate in the garden. An overhearing neighbour lady enters, saying: “I heard your singing, simply beautiful. I was so overwhelmed.”
The narrative culminates in the actual presentation of the song born in that manner. The songster is ushered into a competition where her theory is put into action. Once again the poetic vision emerges as she notes:
“I started my song, and I myself was stunned as the tunes pulsed high and low, swooping over the words.”
The reader feels that the words are born from the innermost layer of the heart. The narrator now is blended as the songster notes that her song which is endless comes to a close with a tear trickle down her cheek. What happens next? The audience cheers so loud that the judges ring a bell to quieten them. The songster thus born is adjudged by the panel as the young songstress of the year. She clambers down the stage with the enormous trophy in her hands. The short poetic narrative comes to a close with the words:
“I had achieved the greatest of my dreams and I knew it. I feel that this kind of short narrative written in the form of a poetic pattern is packed with delight as well as the wisdom that one needs the attention of our own creators, teachers and the media message builders of all types.”
I sincerely agree with the views held by the principal of Bishop’s College where the creator studies as a ten-year-old student. She says:
“Her stories show a sensitivity and awareness of a child brought up in surroundings which encourage observation and creativity.”
The creativity as shown in Little Dreams is not confined to a particular parochial culture and/or social setting. It transcends the geographical barriers by way of trying to enter into some of the historical past episodes.
Two good examples are ‘The Way I See It’ and ‘Confused, Angered, Lost’. In some ways, the narrative pattern of Aminthika comes closer to fantasies transcends the contents of fairy tales. Perhaps as a reader, I may not know the exact aesthetic sense which she tries to achieve. But I feel that I can visualise myself within the frame of the creative territory. This then is the bliss of the creative process that differs from one creator to another.
To use a high flown term the narrative situation in the story titled as ‘Confused, Angered, Lost’ centre around a theme of reconciliation. But in actual realistic terms, it is a simple situation where two girls meet each other, forgetting the fact that they belong to two identically different social conditions. Perhaps an imaginative reader could feel several other layers of meanings in it. There are quite a number of innovative nuances the reader may come across.
One good example is titled as ‘The Forest’. In this imaginative narrative, a slave camp is pictured, where two runaway slave girls are portrayed. Perhaps the alien nature of the slave master link may not be the issue the creator intends to present.
Instead, it is a study of the mindset of two girls namely Africa and Sylvia. The story setting may look alien but the human interest is closer to the heart. The Little Dreams to my understanding ought to be a compilation that deserves to enter into a healthy literary discourse rather absent nowadays in the academic atmosphere. I invite the attention of the elders the parents as well as the teacher to take more attention to this kind of innovative creative writing. This could be a wonderful starting point. A tribute to literary-minded parents and teachers.
