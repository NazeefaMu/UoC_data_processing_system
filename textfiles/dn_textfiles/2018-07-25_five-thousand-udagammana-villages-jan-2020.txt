Five thousand Udagammana villages by Jan 2020

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa pledged to begin the construction of 5,000 Udagammana villages by January 2020.
He was speaking at the vesting of two Udagammana villages - Thuruudugama and Muwasirigama - in Ampara to the public.
“Under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, the yahapalana government has launched an accelerated housing development programme,” said the minister.
Minister Premadsasa said that the construction of 906 Udagammana villages has already begun, covering all 25 districts from Dondra to Point Pedro.
“We are planning to establish 2,500 Udagammana villages by December 31 next year. To meet that target, we have to establish 1,594 more Udagammana villages.” “But we have only 533 days. So we have to start the construction of three villages per day,” he said. According to statistics, around 102,550 families out of a total of 209,796 families in the Ampara district have housing issues.
The reason for such a large amount of housing issues after the regime of a government which boasted that there was a massive development drive is surprising, the minister said.
“Construction of 39 Udagammana villages in the Ampara district has already begun. But we cannot be satisfied with that number and we are hoping to establish 150 more Udagammana villages in Ampara,” Minister Premadasa said.
