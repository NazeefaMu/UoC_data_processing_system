Presidential Commission probing SriLankan Airlines
Udayanga Weeratunga had recommended General Sales Agent to Russia -Witness

It was revealed at the Presidential Commission investigating into SriLankan Airlines that then Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had recommended the appointment of SriLankan Airline’s General Sales Agent to Russia.
SriLankan Airlines Manager (Technical Services) Shiromi Cooray giving evidence before the Commission said this was the first time a diplomat had recommended to appoint a General Sales Agent of an airline to another country.
She submitted the documents to the Commission with regard to Udayanga’s recommendation to appoint a General Sales Agent to Russia to Moscow.
She said that the airline has appointed a company as its General Sales Agent in Russia on the recommendation of Weeratunga and the appointment was approved by then SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe.
Former Chief Exeutive officer of the airline Kapila Chandrasena had given an extension to this company in 2014. However, the appointment was annulled on January 28, 2015 and no company was appointed as General Sales Agent of the airline in Russia thereafter.
