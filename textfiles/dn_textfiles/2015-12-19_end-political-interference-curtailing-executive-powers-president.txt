End to political interference with curtailing of Executive powers - President

 
The era of political interference by the Executive in matters pertaining to the Judiciary and the Legislature ended with the curtailing of the powers of the Executive Presidency, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these observations while participating at the annual conference of the Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, yesterday.
The President said that he has taken his maximum efforts to restrict the powers of the Executive Presidency , which was more excessive in powers than in any other country in the world. He also said that several decisions were taken during the past 11 months , giving due precedence to good governance.
The President recalled the way protests were carried out in front of judges' houses and how judges' houses were stoned for the neglect of Executive orders, and how the then Chief Justice was impeached after a short period of a 48 hour inquiry for not obeying the Executive. President Sirisena said that the assault incident on the Secretary of the Judicial Services Commission was an added black mark to the Judicial service.
The new government has taken steps to build good governance in all the sectors of the country while balancing power between the Legislature, Executive, and the Judiciary, the President said.
President Sirisena pledged to create an environment in which judges will be able to deliver their judgments freely.
He also said that steps will be taken in the future to provide foreign training to enhance their knowledge, while understanding issues related to the Judicial Service.
The President pointed out the importance of finding solutions to the issue of delay in delivering a judgment when the public seeks justice. He said that the immediate attention of the persons engaged in the field of law should be drawn in this regard.
Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakse, Chief Justice K. Sripavan, members of the Judicial Service Association of Sri Lanka and other officials and dignitaries were present at the occasion.
