Many dengue breeding sites at religious places

Certain places of religious worship and construction sites had become an obstacle to control dengue in the Galle district, District Health Services Director Dr. Chandima Sirithunga said at the district dengue control committee meeting recently.
According to field surveys carried out by his unit, almost 41 percent of the mosquito breeding grounds were found at places of worship. Mosquito breeding sites were also found in most construction sites.
They have found empty curd pots and containers strewn in the backyards of most places which remain unattended.
The Shasanarakshaka Bala Mandalayas had been informed about this problem and they should educate dhamma school authorities and dayaka sabhas and obtain their assistance in eradicating the dengue menace.
