Farmers’ water woes

Beneficiary participation in the development projects has been seen as a vital component of the structural adjustment programme. It is an extension of worldwide enthusiasm for privatization of services and empowerment. Participation is an essential ingredient to implement market friendly policies, a supportive and flexible public sector and a discreet mix of de-bureaucratization, decentralization and de-regulation.
To create legitimate participation of intended beneficiaries in a project, firstly beneficiaries should get an opportunity to play a significant role in decision making which must go beyond mere consultation. Secondly, evolution of an appropriate form of local organisation is necessary to use as a vehicle participation. Thirdly, timing of beneficiary involvement must be right from the initial stage of the project to get most effective participation.
There is a growing uneasiness among irrigation researchers, policy planners, politicians and donors of the gap between potential and actual performance in the irrigation projects. Several reasons have been forwarded for the cause of problem.
The research findings show that the primary or fundamental problem of irrigation performance is not engineering, but the formation and functioning of effective user organisation. Beneficiary participation in irrigation system planning, designing, construction and management has cost and benefits for both the farmers and the government. It is said that active farmer involvement is cost effective in terms of mobilization of local resources, improvement and maintenance activities, reduction of irrigation staff time, provision of local wisdom for better design and planning of the systems, reduction in destruction of facilities, improved fee and fine collection, resolution of disputes and provision of an organised means for extension and farmer training. This will also contribute to greater community cohesion and empowerment which could be utilized effectively for other development as well.
There are several costs to be incurred by government agencies, when initiating the participatory development through the formation of Water Users Association (WUAs). Under this list of costs, there may be several activities including conduct of action research about a field situation for a socio-technical profile, mobilizing field staff and organisation and providing necessary training to the WUAs as well as to the officers. Costs are usually definite and certain, whereas the benefits from participation are ambiguous and uncertain, specially determining the amount of net benefit is extremely difficult.
There are obvious benefits for both the government and the beneficiary farmers from well organised and co-ordinated participatory development programmes. The success is dependent on the degree, time and ways of beneficiary participation. Therefore, the governments should use appropriate strategy and necessary intensives to get the participation before the WUAs are formed by direction or persuasion.
Participation of water users in decision making in connection with the irrigation reservoir from where they draw water, is one of the key concepts of sustainable development. According to the available literature on IMT experiences the world over, the sustainability of a participatory irrigation management (PIM) programme basically depends on the water users activities, control structure and of organisation activities. The performances of these activities are determined by the following factors.
(1). Sustainability of the Water Users’ Association (WUA)
(2). Bureaucratic re-orientation and political will for PIM
(3). Physical condition of the turnover irrigation infrastructure
(4). Economics of irrigated agriculture.
Water users associations
The basic intensive for farmer’s motivation to involve in sustainable action is based on the WUAs performance in water management, operation and maintenance (O&M) and organisational management activities. Water users in an irrigation system are inter dependent for water and its management process within a water course and between the water courses. Water wanted in one part of the system might deprive farmers in the other parts.
The WUA can involve in the provision of services to the farmers such as the provision of agro chemicals, fertilizer, seed materials and credit etc and undertake maintenance and rehabilitation contracts from the line agency, livestock enterprises and fisheries, marketing of agricultural products, operation of farm machinery and so on. The provision of multiple services would in theory strengthen the WUAs and assist in their sustainability through the necessary finance to manage the irrigation system as well as the organisation.
The government commitment, political will, formal supports towards organisation development and farmer’s self management and legal backing are necessary conditions for the sustainability of WUAs. Having a clear legal entity and effective sanctions against rule breakers can substantially reduce opportunistic behaviour. The government has to create necessary conditions and suitable legal reforms to enforce sanctions against opportunistic farmers. The legal framework should be strong and transparent which provides farmer’s rights and benefits as well as duties and responsibilities.
The water user participation in decision making and water allocation is not sufficient for effective irrigation system management. It requires a well disciplined organisation at the top level, which is responsible for executing, policing the system and prosecuting delinquencies. Therefore, for a successful participatory irrigation management, there must be a strong commitment from the agency and the need to share knowledge, information and authority with the farmers. Moreover, they must fulfil their role in the system management.
The weaknesses in the maintenance and water distribution at the main system level have a significant effect on farmer’s ability to manage water at the farm level. An irrigation system as a socio-technical profile requires more than just farmer involvement. The involvement of farmers in the system management will not be fruitful unless the main system management is effective and responsive to farmers’ needs.
Incentive to mobilizes cash and materials towards the WUAs is highly dependent on the economics of irrigated agriculture. Therefore irrigation management component should be adopted as an integrated package with other aspects of irrigated agriculture such as extension, input supply, credit and marketing which influence farm productivity and income level.
There must be parallel programmes to solve the farmer’s agricultural problems which bound the achievement of high productivity and increased income. Physical condition of the irrigation infrastructure has an effect on timeliness and reliable supply of water deliveries, which is the major tangible benefit of the farmers for their participation. Thus, functional irrigation facilities is one of the major factors determining the sustainability of participatory irrigation management.
Further, physical condition of infrastructure should be able to be operated and maintained by the user community within the limits of their resource capacity and technical knowhow.
PIM and Irrigation Management Turnover (IMT) are a worldwide trend in the irrigation sector development and management. The various governments have made considerable amount of investments for institutional development for mobilization of farmers and for legal and policy reforms. Therefore sustainability of the PIM is a crucial aspect in the irrigation and water management sector.
PIM Policy in Sri Lanka
The PIM policy is not solely a cost recovery policy: rather it was seen as a strategy of cost reduction and transferring power and authority to beneficiary groups. The main goals of the PIM policy of the government of Sri Lanka have been twofold. Firstly improving the irrigation performance and secondly reducing the government expenditure on O&M by transferring the part of the O&M responsibility to user groups. Therefore the policy emphasizes the change in the traditional role of farmers from passive recipients of irrigation benefits to active partners in the management process sharing responsibilities with irrigation agency staff. Under the PIM policy, the government has to continue the financial allocations to the irrigation agency for O&M of the head works and main cannels (MCs). The O&M task of distributory cannels (DCs) and field cannels (FCs) are responsibility of FOs.
PIM programme implemented in Sri Lanka towards IMT since 1992, has been studied by many researchers in specific projects and locations. Past study findings show mixed results on the performance of PIM in irrigation system management, water use efficiency, agricultural production and the government cost reduction. Amidst these mixed results and pros and cons, PIM has continued to be the major irrigation management policy in Sri Lanka to date.
