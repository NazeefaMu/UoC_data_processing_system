HR recommendations not implemented: HRCSL

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) yesterday stated that a significant proportion of their recommendations were not implemented by government officials.
HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepike Udagama, addressing a media briefing held at the Commission in Bambalapitiya, noted that around 30 - 40 percent of their recommendations resulted in non-compliance.
“The main reason for this is the legal culture of our country. If we do not have a penalty or punishment, it is hard to enforce the law- this is entrenched in our society,” she said.
The HRCSL, which is an independent Commission, only has the power to make recommendations, and they are not legally binding. The Commission also has no powers to directly take recommendations which have not been implemented in Courts.
In a law abiding society, our recommendations would be followed but many of our government officials do not follow the law, said Dr. Udgama.
This year, however, the Commission is to work on ways in which the recommendations can be made more binding. Dr. Udagama explained that consultations held with public officials had provided them with a possibility of amending the Establishment Code to allow strict disciplinarian action be taken against public officials who do not comply with their recommendations.
“We have said in certain places that if they do not comply, we would report them to the Public Services Commission,” added HRCSL member and President’s Counsel Saliya Peiris.
The Commission, from January - September 2017, had received 5,614 complaints and has thus far resolved 2015 of them. Dr. Udagama explained that of the number that was resolved, 713 had plaintiffs not showing up for cases, recommendations were given on 83,247 had compensation granted, 195 were settled within the HRCSL, 306 were withdrawn, 25 sent to other government institutions for further inquiry and 105 were closed because they had legal proceedings in Court. “We have seen a great interest in people coming forward to complain about human rights violations in the last year,” said Dr. Udugama. As a result, the Commission is to open seven new branches in Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Puttalam, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitivu and Galle (sub office) to cater to the demand.
