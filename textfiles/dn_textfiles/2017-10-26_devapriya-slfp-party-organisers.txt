Devapriya on SLFP party organisers

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said that senior SLFPers are discussing whether it is possible to reinstate party organisers who were removed and offer them the opportunity to contest the upcoming Local Government election through the SLFP.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said the SLFP’s stance is that Sri Lanka should remain a unitary country. We agreed with the proposal of devolving more powers to Provincial Councils, but we are against any merger of Provincial Councils.
“The Governors should be appointed in consultation with Chief Ministers and they(Governors) should not be limited to ceremonial activities in the area,” he said.
The President should remain as the head of Cabinet while retaining all the powers regarding the defence.
Devapriya further said that several communal minded politicians are trying to misguide the people and the Maha Sangha by distorting facts of the statment made by the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwathu-Asgiriya Chapters.
“Our stance is that the new Constitution should only please Sri Lankans from the North to the South and not the Tamil Diaspora. The President is also of the view that there should not be a referendum.
He added that that President will resolve the SAITM issue once he returns to the country.
