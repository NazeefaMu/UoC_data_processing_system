‘Longstanding issues in Mawanella need resolving’

Whichever group that gains control of the Mawanella Pradesheeya Sabha after the current power struggle ends, should lay emphasis on resolving the main problems confronting the people which have remained unresolved over the years, residents of the area said.
They said the main unresolved problems which had dragged on for the past several years include the garbage problem, lack of proper amenities at the Mawanella town bus stand, sewage issues, Hemmathagama public market complex still being only half-complete, and the lack of a storm water drainage system and street-lighting system in Mawanella town.
They said the mountain of garbage dumped on the Randiwala Mountain had been subjected to earthslips in recent times, and it should come under a proper management. No one had paid attention towards modernising the Mawanella bus stand since it was last developed by former Minister Chandra Ranatunge in 1980.
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP) have an equal number of 16 elected members in the Mawanella Pradesheeya Sabha, while the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has five members. Two parties have to coalesce in order to gain administrative power in the Pradesheeya Sabha.
