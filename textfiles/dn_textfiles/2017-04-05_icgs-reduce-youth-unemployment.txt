ICGs to reduce youth unemployment

The National Youth Front of the SLFP has implemented a systematic approach for bringing down the rate of youth unemployment in line with the national convention of the Youth Front held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium recently, National Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. He said this while addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters.
Bandara said that the systematic approach was launched under the theme 'Visanduma' (Solution) at the National Youth Front Convention. Under the Visanduma programme, an institution called Institute of Career Guidance (ICG) will be established district-based countrywide. Each ICG will guide youths for job-oriented vocational training.
“Youths at the ICG will be guided and instructed for vocational training after their hidden talents and capabilities are identified. Then these youths will be guided to specific fields in accordance with their talents. In other words, a youth who visits the ICG will be converted to a capable person who can obtain a job easily,” he said.
He added that all ICGs will be coordinated through Sri Lanka Institute of Career Guidance (SLICG), which is going to be established in Colombo. It has been planned to establish the first ICG in a few months, he said. Bandara said that the President highly accepted and appreciated the concept of the
Visanduma project when he was presented the draft of it at the national convention.
