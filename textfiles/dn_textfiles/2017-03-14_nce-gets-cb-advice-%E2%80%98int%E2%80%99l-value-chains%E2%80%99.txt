NCE gets CB advice on ‘Int’l Value Chains’

The new President of the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Ramal Jasinghe, Secretary General Shiham Marikar and officials met Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy recently.
They apprised him regarding the services provided by the Chamber to Sri Lankan Exporters.
The discussion with the Governor and Central Bank officials centred on the current export related economic development scenario and related issues which have an impact on external trade, particularly in the context of the important role played by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
It was stated that the exporter community for instance have made little or no comment so far on the flexible exchange rate policy adopted by the Government, and currency fluctuations related to its impact on their businesses.
Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said the Central Bank website provides information on policy directions including the day to day currency movements.
The Bank welcomed the support of the Chamber by creating awareness among its members regarding the ready availability of such information to facilitate their business strategies, by linking with the website of the Central Bank.
The discussion also centered on the presence of Sri Lankan exporters and manufacturers in ‘International Value Chains’ related to trade. It was noted that in the modern trade in scenario, over and above direct exports, participation in Value Chains through the supply of intermediate products, components, and services, forms and integral part of value addition to Products and Services supplied by developing countries.
Since these value chains are an integral part of intra-regional trade, including the Asian Region, Sri Lankan exporters have great opportunities to participate in such Value Chains for economic gain.
