So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 14
Dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s in start-up tasks is your remit

As the main stakeholder of your company,it is your responsibility to perform all your start-up’s chores, or at least personally see to it that they get done. But you need to personally take care of all-important tasks at least - those responsibilities that will, down the road, either make or break your enterprise if they aren’t done correctly.
In this instalment, we walk you through the many hats you must wear as you navigate these sometimes-mundane details.
By this time, you should have completed your start-up tasks like writing a business plan, determining the legal entity that works best for you, locating financing, and selecting the product or service, many of which we discussed in previous instalments. Now you have to dive into the nitty-gritty details.
Buying insurance
One of the first things you need to do is to purchase insurance. We’re talking about insurance for vehicles, fire, theft etc, as well as workers’ health and compensation insurance.
Unfortunately, insurance is an expense that never goes away and generally increases every year. Making things worse is the fact that, if you’re like most entrepreneurs, after you sign the original policies, you’ll file them away and won’t consider shopping around to get a better price for long periods of time. Don’t even think about entrusting the creation and negotiation of your initial insurance package to anyone else. You need to take care of this important task.
Theft insurance: Sooner or later, someone is going to steal something of value from you. If you’re in the high-ticket retail or wholesale business, you should purchase theft insurance. You don’t need to purchase enough theft insurance to cover all your inventory; just buy enough to cover what one person or two could reasonably steal.
Property (including inventory) insurance: In addition to the physical property you own, rent, or lease, property damage insurance covers your inventory. Similar to homeowner’s insurance, property damage insurance is oftenrequired by the terms of a lease or bank loan. Fire Insurance, vehicle insurance, cash-in-transit insurance, stock-in-trade insurance, workers’ compensation insurance including medical, disability and death are other insurance needs.
It is advisable to obtain the services of an experience insurance agent/consultant for necessary advice and also to get the advantage of pricing.
Pay Government and local taxes
These taxes come in a mind-boggling array, depending on your industry. Your accountant or the selected auditor will advise you. When you’re short on cash, make sure that you pay any taxes you owe the government first, even if you have to put off paying your private vendors. Government, especially the central government, has an enormous array of collection tools at their disposal, and they have the right to extract a dear price (in the form of onerous penalties and interest rates) from those who don’t follow the letter of the law.
Negotiate leases
When you’re leasing space for a start-up, aim for three years as an absolute maximum. If you think you may want thespace for a longer term, consider negotiating and adding to your lease agreement an escalation clause that stipulates upfront how much the rental rate will increase should you choose to extend the lease for a subsequent year or multiyear period.
Long-term leases are a no-win situation for the small- business owner: If your business grows, it will outgrow the long-term lease and you’ll pay a higher price for its cancellation; if your business doesn’t grow, you’ll pay an even greater price to get out of the lease.
Maintain employee records
The day you hire your first employee is the same day you must create and begin maintaining your first employee-personnel folder. Be sure to maintain a written record for every employee, covering such issues as employment agreements (including salary history), performance reviews, business goals, commendations, and, of course, reprimands.
These records come in handy as you manage and motivate your employees. Such key managerial and motivational tools as goal-setting and performance reviews require that you keep detailed employee records for them to work. (We are going to cover this subject in detail in subsequent instalments).
Sooner or later, you might have a conflict with one or more of your employees - a conflict that in the worst case, is likely to end up in Labour Department. When a legal battle occurs, the party who can back up his or her claims with the most information usually prevails. Don’t be the one who’s handicapped by poor record-keeping and documentation.
Get licenses and permits
Almost all businesses require filing certain licenses and obtaining particular permits. Your accountant, auditor or company secretary (if you have one) will advise you.
Signing the cheques
Checks represent cash. From the day you hang out your nameboard until the day you close your doors, cash and cheques will be the lifeblood of your business. The annals of small business are filledwith stories of accounting officers who helped themselves to a hardworking entrepreneur’s cash.
If your spouse is your accountant, you canrest easy. But what do you do when it is not? You need to guard your cash like it’s your life. Schedule an audit twice every year. It doesn’t have to be a full- fledged, expensive, cover-every-detail audit. Simply ask your auditor to spend a day reviewing your books. He (or she) knows the sensitive areas to focus on.
Outsourcing
We define outsourcing as delegating services you don’t want to do, or don’t have time to do, to someone outside your company, who can usually do them better and faster. The term outsourcing is a buzzword that has surfaced more in the past decade, but the concept itself isn’t new. Businesses have been outsourcing, in one form or another, for many years.
The following list tells you which small-business functions are most frequently outsourced. You need to determine which out- sourcing options make the most sense for you.
Accounting and book-keeping
Accounting (the beginning-to-end process of collecting financial data, generating financial statements, and preparing tax forms) and bookkeeping (the collecting-of-financial-data function only) provide the gamut of outsourcing opportunities. You can, for example, hire someone to do all your accounting and bookkeeping, or you can recruit someone to do only your payroll, only your financial statements, or only your tax returns.
Because you, as typical entrepreneur, usually isn’t well versed in accounting and bookkeeping skills, it may be a better idea that these functions be among the first you consider for outsourcing.
Human resources
As your company grows, the various functions of human resources should be next in line for outsourcing consideration. Human resources include a wide variety of non-product, non-customer, and non-sales-related issues, such as new-employee hiring procedures,policies and procedure manuals for employees,payroll and related information-gathering systems,employee training on human resource issues. Employee training includes on a wide variety of sensitive issues, such as ethics and sexual harassment
Manufacturing
If you are a small manufacturing company, you would know that the manufacturing processis expensive, time-consuming, and extremely detail oriented. For many entrepreneurs, especially the creative and/or sales types who typically gravitate to this career, outsourcing the manufacturing function makes a lot of sense. Even if your core business is manufacturing, some elements of your product may lend themselves to outsourcing their manufacture to sub-contractors. Don’t worry, even Apple subcontract a good deal of their work.
Sales
Outsourcing sales is certainly the most potentially dangerous of the outsourcing options, but some businesses, including those that employ manufacturers’ representatives, do use it. We say “potentially dangerous” because it’s difficult to impart to outside sales people the enthusiasm and knowledge necessary to effectively sell your business’s product or service. Sales is definitely the last of the responsibilities to consider out-sourcing, although doing so works well for some small businesses.
Figuring out what to outsource
Here’s the million-rupee question: How do you determine which services to outsource and which ones to retain in-house? Business ownersare different in thinking and may have different views, but answering the following questions can help you make the best decision for your situation:
Can I better manage my available cash if I outsource? The answer here primarily depends on how much cash you have. For example, by outsourcing the manufacturing process, you avoid the costs associated with maintaining an inventory of raw materials and hiring manufacturing employees. By outsourcing your sales functions, you avoid the costs associated with maintaining a sales force.
Like it or not, accounting is one of the most important functions of running your business. Whether you intend to eventually outsource your accounting or do all the work yourself, at the start-up stage, accounting demands your undivided attention. One of the most common mistakes we see entrepreneurs make in the start-up stage is to not learn how basic accounting works or how it applies to their business. Take it from us: Learn the basics early, or you’ll never take the time.
Common systems
You have three options to consider when determining which accounting system to employ:
An outside accounting services, An in-house manual bookkeeping system, An in-house computer-based accounting system
If you decide to go the outsourcing route (using an outside accounting service), you need to make that decision before you open your business’s doors. If you decide to use an in-house computer-based accounting system, you have to find out more about the manual and computer-based options.
We will talk about them next week.
