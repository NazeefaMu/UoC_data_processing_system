Women betrayed!

It has been over two weeks since the first ever Local Government Election with a female quota has been held. The gazette declaration establishing the councils however have hit a snag and it has now become clear that it would be delayed until March 20.
The main hurdle for this is the failure of the Elections Commission and the political parties to come up with a fair solution to implementing the 25 percent quota for women in all councils by law.
This begs the question of whether the quota has worked or has it caused more problems?
The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2017 which brought in the 25 percent quota for women has been very clear on the fact that Local Government bodies in the country should fulfil the quota if they are to be established but it also leaves room for two exemptions which has created the current crisis.
The first exemption is that parties which win three seats or less are not bound to nominate women from their additional list. Further in the case of an overhang, the party which wins the extra seats does not get any bonus seats. This means that if women have not already won their wards through the first past the post system, the party with the highest number of seats (due to overhang) cannot nominate women from their additional list. Thus, the responsibility of fulfilling the quota falls to the party which wins the second highest number of seats. In the current context, the party which finds itself thus saddled with responsibility has expressed deep displeasure in finding themselves in such a situation.
Women betrayed
R.M. Premawathi (58) has worked for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in Bibile for the last 27 years. She has headed 71 societies since entering politics in 1991 including the party’s district women’s wing and attended 12-15 workshops on training women to become political leaders.
This year, she was asked to include her name in the nomination list for the Pradeshiya Sabha- she was told that her name would only be in the ‘additional proportional representation (PR)’ list. She would not contest her electorate. Not surprisingly, her party lost the electorate but won two additional seats.
“They have promised that one of the seats would be given to a woman, but I am not certain. I have the most experience and qualification for the seat”, she said.
Premawathi is not the only female candidate now having to rely on their party’s benevolence for a seat. The new system decreed that a minimum of 10 percent of women would contest the wards, whilst a minimum 50 percent of them would be put on the PR list.
Most parties had put up women to contest from weak wards and promised the majority that they would get a seat through the PR list if they won the ward.
This strategy to defeat the purpose of the quota has now backfired on many of the parties as they struggle to establish councils in the wake of not fulfilling the quota.
According to the Elections Commission, the number of women candidates elected to Local Government bodies has been increased to 595. Prior to 2018, there were only 86 women in local government, today, Deshapriya observed that through the FPP system alone, the increase has been over 10 percent.
Human Rights Activist, Shreen Saroor however noted that if the 25 percent quota was fully implemented, the increase would be between 1800-1900 women in local government.
In addition the overhang problem which is present in over 196 out of the 340 local government bodies; increasing the total number of members by 364 from 8,325 to 8,689 has made fulfilling the quota difficult.
Of this number, 10 Local councils have it the worst, with Deshapriya declaring that there was no way to bring in women to fulfil the quota in them.
Saroor however observed that the only way now would be to have more women selected through the PR list and all parties would have to collectively work out a way to bring in more women.
The fallacy that women can’t win
Though the Elections Commission is still figuring out the total number of women who would go to councils, on the face of it, many female candidates this time have lost the wards they contested or canvassed in. This has led to many political parties opposing the quota and having more women in their fold.
More often than not, it is not the women’s fault that they lost, explained Saroor.
Addressing a group of over 40 women gathered at the South Asia Partnership Sri Lanka (SAPSRI) in Rajagiriya recently, she asked women from both the South and North to explain their grievances and work out a way to move forward.
Niroshini Priyadharshika (43), a UNP candidate from Panama in the Eastern Province says that her party would have definitely won her ward if she had contested it, “The man they put for my ward was not liked by many and he lost. Many said that if I had contested, the party would have won”.
Priyadharshika had won much support in her village for her efforts in the Panama land struggle but her party asked that she contest from the ‘additional list’.
Soma Dissanayke, an entrepreneur running a successful business in Moneragala stood for the SLFP in the area and she too was put on the additional list, despite having popular support in the area.
In Puttalam, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) convinced Bisleah Bhutto (31) to run for office for the Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha at the eleventh hour as the party simply struggled to fill the female quota in their nomination lists. The party had nominated her to an area where the party had little support- she lost.
“We also had to face some men from my own party canvassing for the opposition party in the area, so that the people would not vote for women from their own party”, explained Bhutto who had to face the additional ‘cultural’ burden in the area.
Moreover, in the present crisis, many of her male colleagues have asked that the party not give additional seats to women, with some even threatening to resign if women are appointed to their council,
“My colleague was pregnant when she campaigned for the party from Kalpitiya to Puttalam. The organiser who gave us his van to campaign now says that politics is no place for a woman. And that we should not ask for a seat”, she added.
They used me; they did not train me for this. Every party did that, observed Bhutto.
Kulanthai Vadivel Jeyachandrika (42) alias ‘Meena’, who was chosen from the UNP to run for the Arayampathy Pradeshiya Sabha, similarly received very little party support after their initial encouragement to run. Having persevered on her own despite strong opposition, she lost her ward by 100 votes.
However, parties which made use of the female quota to their benefit have had strong women win their wards and support for their party.
Though the official numbers are still being calculated, sources from the ground show that the majority of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) women who contested for their seats have won. The SLPP also won a surprising majority in most areas of the country at the recently concluded election.
“The SLPP looked at how they could use the new system the best possible way to leverage their power as a new party. Both the women’s quota and the mixed system were used well. They got women from the grassroots to run and they got their men to support these women. This was a strategy they adopted- it was not about being progressive, it’s just being smart”, noted Saroor.
Similarly, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) which mainly has its base in the East, decided to provide a 34 percent quota in their nomination list for women instead of the minimum of 25 percent.
As a result, their candidate Selvi Manohar (44) is today the Opposition Leader of the Batticaloa Municipal Council.
A poultry farmer by profession, this is the first time she has contested an election, “I contested from the Manmunai North ward and had to face 15 other candidates who were all male. But I scored the second highest number of votes in my ward”, she said.
She had joined the party in 2010 and had been working in the grassroots for some time before being chosen to contest, “Most parties did not put the right women to contest”, said Manohar.
Our leader realises that women can win given the right support, she said. Her party which won five seats at the Batticaloa MC has three men and two women.
In the upcountry, Central Provincial Councillor, Saraswathi Sivaguru from the National Union of Workers (NUW) had four women contest for local government bodies in Nuwara Eliya. All of them were voted in with one becoming the deputy mayor, pointed out Saroor.
Lalith Kulanayake (54), a UNP candidate and former member of a Pradeshiya Sabha in Panama won the second highest number of votes in the Ampara District. She achieved this feat despite other women claiming that they found it hard to win in an environment where men spent money on votes and alcohol.
“If you are the candidate, you have to go forward and speak to the people, even if you go with a group of 50, you are the one who needs to speak. Some women allowed the men to speak on behalf of them, that does not work”, she said.
“We were always focusing on training women and building their capacity to contest. We did not think of the complications which would arise from the system and educating them on it and looking at which parties offer them the best deal”, added Saroor.
Many of the female contestants who were pushed into the fray by the political parties today are bitter, one reason for this could be that they do not understand electoral system and were not educated in it,
“We did all the hard work. Just because we were put on the list, it did not mean that we did not campaign. So I do not understand why they want to change the 25 percent quota. We need to be given a seat”, said Komala Ilayathamby (52), an SLFP candidate who has been working for the party for the last 31 years.
She insisted that all bonus seats be given to women, not knowing that only 50 percent of the additional list comprised of women. She, similar to other women was simply told that if they won their ward, they would be given a bonus seat. They were not informed that it was up to the party hierarchy to decide on who would be given that seat, not even the Elections Commission can insist on that.
Women’s Organisations had proposed that the additional list be prepared under a ‘zebra’ (names of men and women alternated in the list) system or a ‘zip’ (names in a set order) so that there is a transparent system under which women can be appointed but political parties had rejected these suggestions. Thus, the women now have to convince their own party organisers to give them space in local government.
The Elections Commission Chairman informed us, that they could not force political parties to implement the quota, said Women’s Action for a Just Society Convenor, Padma Pushpakanthi; who is campaigning for the quota to be implemented across the board.
“He asked us to appeal to the parties as protests will not help much”, she added.
The female candidates working with her organisation however, are not too happy about simply staying put until the political parties throw them a bone.
“The women were given extra seats, they did not take male seats, the quota created new seats. But now it looks as if the men will take that 25 percent too”, said Saroor echoing the disappointment of other women.
The female quota in its pilot project has succeeded as well as failed depending on how it was used by the political parties concerned. The women point out that the technical snag with the ‘overhang’ whilst needing to be amended at a future date should preferably not involve removing the quota altogether.
We cannot give up on the quota now. It has taken 20 years to get here. There are lessons to be learnt from this but that does not mean that it stops here, said Saroor.
The fight will go on until this 25 percent quota is ultimately implemented from Local Government to Parliament.
