Sathosa to sell coconuts at reduced prices

The Public Enterprise Development Ministry has stepped into to supply Sathosa with 250,000 coconuts at a concessionary rate.
The government run Kurunegala Plantations and Elkaduwa Plantations together will meet the supply of 250,000 coconuts to ease the demand during the holiday season. Kurunegala Plantations will supply 200,000 coconuts to Sathosa, the company’s Sales Manager, Jagath Jayawardena told the Daily News. Elkaduwa Plantations General Manager Roshan Perera said that they will add 50,000 coconuts to the Sathosa supply.
In addition to this, the main outlet run by Kurunegala Plantations, will be selling coconuts at a price of Rs 65 to consumers, Jayawardena said.
In November alone, Kurunegala Plantations had supplied 10,000 coconuts to Sathosa.
Elkaduwa in the meantime, supplied Sathosa with 50,000 coconuts in November.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe directed Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim to make arrangements to supply coconuts at a concessionary price.
This infusion of coconut into Sathosa will allow them to sell coconuts at a concessionary price of Rs. 65 to consumers.
