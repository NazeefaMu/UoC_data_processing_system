1st Under 19 one-day international
Comfortable six-wicket win for India

Anuj Rawat hit a solid half-century to guide India to a six-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first Under 19 one-day international played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
Chasing 144 for victory, the visitors rode on a 62-run fourth wicket partnership between Rawat (50) and Sameer Choudhary (12) which gave them the victory in 37.1 overs to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.
Sri Lanka off spinner Lakshitha Manasinghe took two wickets for 32 runs and Avishka Lakshan and Sandun Mendis claimed one wicket each but the total was too small to defend against a strong Indian batting line-up.
Batting first Sri Lanka were bowled out for 143 with the main contributions coming from Nipun Dananjaya 33 off 45 balls and Nipun Malinga 38 with three fours and two sixes. They lifted Sri Lanka from an uncertain 84-7 to their final total of 143 in 38.4 overs.
The Sri Lankan top order started to crumble when Mohit Jangra pushed the Lankan batsmen onto the back foot with Navod Paranavithana and Nishan Madushka’s early departure off his first four overs. Yatin Mangwani and Ayush Badoni claimed two wickets each to help dismiss the middle order.
Ajay Dev Goud picked up three Sri Lankan wickets for 18 runs including that of Malinga who was last out running short of partners.
With not much pressure on the run rate India Under 19 team, began their reply steadily with Pavan Shah and Anuj Rawat scoring 24 in four overs before lunch. Lakshitha Manasinghe raised some hopes in the Lankan camp by sending back Shah in the fifth over after lunch and Yashasvi Jaiswal.
But India were never under any discomfort against the Lankan bowlers as Anuj Rawat made certain of victory with 50 off 82 balls (five fours) before losing his wicket to Mendis. The second ODI will take place at the SSC grounds on Thursday (August 5).
