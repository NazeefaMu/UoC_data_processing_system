Matara district preschools close for another week

Preschools in the Matara District will remain closed for another week to protect children from contracting influenza and preventing its spread, said Matara District Preschool Development Foundation Secretary Manori Ilangamge.
Preschools in the Southern Province were which were closed for a week by Provincial Minister of Education Chandima Rasaputhra to prevent the spread of influenza, were scheduled to reopen on June 4, but as the spread of the respiratory tract infection continued and the number of deaths kept rising, the Preschool Development Foundation opted to keep them closed for another week.
“We are concerned about the health and well-being of our children. Most probably, the Preschool Development Foundations in the Galle and Hambanthota Districts will follow suit” Ilangamge added.
