Request to release Anura Senanayake turned down

A request made by defence to release former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake from remand custody was yesterday turned down by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Accordingly, Anura Senanayake arrested over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence and conspiring to committing the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till June 15 by Colombo Additional Magistrate.
President’s Counsel Anil de Silva appearing on behalf of the suspect requested to release his client from remand custody since he is held in remand custody over a period of one year contrary to the provisions of Bail Act.
Defence counsel submitted to Court that his client had been arrested by CID on May 23, 2016. He contended that in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person should be detained for more than twelve months in custody. However, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the CID told Court that a Magistrate has no jurisdiction to release a person accused of conspiring to commit a murder and the defence should make this application from High Court. He further argued that it would be an illegal order if a Magistrate decided to release such a person from the custody.
Taking into consideration the facts, the Additional Magistrate observed that the Magistrate’s Court does not have power to release a person accused of conspiring to commit a murder and ordered to further remand the suspect till June 15.
The revision bail application filed by Anura Senanayake seeking bail is to be taken up before Colombo High Court today (02).
Former Narahenpita Crimes OIC arrested over the same allegation is currently out on bail.
