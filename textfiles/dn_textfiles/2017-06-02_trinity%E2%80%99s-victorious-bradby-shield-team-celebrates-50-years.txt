Trinity’s victorious Bradby Shield team celebrates 50 years

Get-together at CR&FC today:
Trinity College’s Bradby Shield winning team will get together today at CR & FC to celebrate that famous victory 50 years ago, a day before the 2nd leg of the Bradby.
Celebrating this landmark will be the players who are in and around with their families. Ajith Abeyaratne who captained the winning side of 1967 is one of those involved in organizing the 50th anniversary reunion. Every player who was involved in that team, and who are living today are very much looking forward to their reunion.
One of the players of the team who is in Kandy is Iswan Omar. Recalling fond memories of that year will be the main tropic at this get together.
