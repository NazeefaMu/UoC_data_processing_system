Johnston’s Appeal allowed to proceed

The Supreme Court yesterday allowed to proceed with the Special Leave to Appeal application filed by former Minister and Kurunegala District MP Johnston Fernando who sought an Interim Order directing the Kurunegala High Court to release him on bail until the final determination of this application.
Accordingly, Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Murdu Fernando fixed the application for argument on October 18.
The application for the Interim Order seeking bail is to be considered following the arguments.
Johnston Fernando remanded in connection with the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds filed this application challenging Kurunegala High Court’s order to remand him until the conclusion of the trial. He is also challenging the Court of Appeal judgement dated September 17, 2018 to dismiss the petitioner’s revision application.
On September 17, 2018, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing the Johnston Fernando’s revision application.
On September 3, Kurunegala High Court issued an order to remand former Minister Johnston Fernando, former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M. Fernando and the former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer, until the conclusion of the trial.
The Attorney General alleged that Johnston Fernando as then Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013. President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with Counsel Sanath Wijewardane appeared for Johnston Fernando. Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Navana with Senior State Counsel Naomi Wickremasekara appeared for the Attorney General.
