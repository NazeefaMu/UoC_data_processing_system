Bajaj upbeat on Lankan market

Top officials of Bajaj Auto Limited addressing media in Pune India at the Bajaj Headquarters said the company through its partner David Pieris Motor Company (Pvt) Ltd (DPMC) has maintained a steady growth in the market share over the years in Sri Lanka and is optimistic the growth will continue despite domestic and global slowdowns.
Bajaj enjoys a market share of 92 % for three-wheelers and 65 % for two-wheelers in Sri Lanka.
Bajaj recorded sales of over four million vehicles which is a nine percent growth over the previous year exporting to over 75 countries. From April to September this year, the company has sold over one million vehicles globally. Bajaja’s latest addition, the quadricycle ‘Qute’ is poised to make a mark in the Sri Lanka’s transportation sector as a family, cost efficient and convenient mode of transportation. Known as ‘My Family Vehicle’ in Sri Lanka, sales of Qute crossed 650 units since its launch in April this year.

“For Bajaj Qute, we already have received central government approval in June 2018 to sell in India. As of today, we have received STA (State transport Authority) approvals in 18 states. We have started sales of Qute in the states of Kerala and Rajasthan. The initial response from Qute customers has been good, a top official of the company told journalists. Qute is being exported to more than 30 countries and we have exported over 7,000 vehicles so far. Across the globe Qute is being loved by the customers,” he said.
The sale of Bajaj Qute is expected to rise sharply in Sri Lanka Shanaka Jayaweera, Director Vehicle Sales David Pieris Motor Company (Pvt) Ltd said. This is in the backdrop of Qute gaining vastly popular in Europe, America and Japan. Jayaweera said the company has the capacity to localise and go up to value addition of the Bajaj range of vehicles in Sri Lanka. However, he said the project has not been able to take off so far due to absence of concessions from the Government.
Senior Vice President, Export Business Unit, Bajaj Auto Ltd., K.S. Grihapathy said they expect a higher penetration in the Sri Lankan market despite a minor slowdown in sles last year and Bajaj has the ability to adapt to volatile situations in markets across the globe. “The situation in Sri Lanka is only a temporary setback which will fade off in a matter of time,” he said adding “Bajaj has faced similar situations in Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria. The state of affairs in Sri Lanka will re-bounce and business will be back to normal,” Grihapathy said.
Bajaj is also considering moving into electric vehicles as it upgrades and promotes environment friendly transportation across countries.
“We will look into this aspect. However, we also have to ensure the specifications and eco-systems are right. We will watch the situation in countries and embark on the project,” Bajaj Vice President Marketing, Manish Sigh Rathore said. The Qute has been designed in response to requirements of low cost, first and last mile public transport across the world by optimising size, weight, cost and speed. Qute follows a philosophy of Smart and Sensible Design. It has got an eco friendly, fuel efficient, world class DTSi Engine, it is Smart in its size and handling, it is Smart in safety with its monocoque body and it is Smart in the space that it offers to passengers and their luggage.
