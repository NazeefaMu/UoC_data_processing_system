Mother of twin boys gives birth to rare set of twin girls

Doctors told a Colorado mother of twin boys to try her luck at the lottery after revealing she was pregnant with another set of rare identical twin girls against 10-million-to-one odds.
Casey Saunders, 27, thought the doctor was pulling her leg when she said the mother of twin boys was expecting yet another duo, the odds of which are one in 70,000.
On top of the already impossible-seeming odds, the babies had developed inside the same placenta, a condition that only occurs with about one per cent of twin pregnancies and can cause fatal complications in the womb.
After spending the final two months of her pregnancy in the hospital while doctors monitored the twins, Casey and her partner Eugene Goree welcomed baby girls Maya and Laia on December 3.
Four months later Casey has shared her unlikely story with Daily Mail Online.
Casey, an optometric technician, had her boys Hayden and Cameron when she was 17 years old, and nine years later she learned she and her partner Eugene were pregnant again.
When she went in for her first ultrasound she had the excited boys in tow.
“On the way to the ultrasound they were arguing over who was going to get to hold “the baby” first,” she said.
“I thought the sonographer was trying to tease me when she said there were two heartbeats because she knew I had my twin boys with me.”
The technician saw the monitor and told Casey: “You should go buy a Powerball ticket when you’re done here.”
She was pregnant with twins - again.
“I was shocked. I called Eugene and said: “You’re not going to believe this,”’ she said.
‘He was surprised but really excited from the beginning.”
Casey said she’s never tried to calculate the odds of a pregnancy like this one because they’re too complicated - but it’s clear that her girls are extraordinarily unlikely.
The odds of having identical twins are about one in 250, which is considered to be a relatively small number statistically speaking.
The likelihood of having two sets of identical twins is an infinitely smaller one in 70,000, meaning that Casey had about a .0014 percent chance of having twins again. On top of the already miniscule odds, the twins were revealed to be monoamniotic monochorionic, which occurs in less than one percent of twin pregnancies.
