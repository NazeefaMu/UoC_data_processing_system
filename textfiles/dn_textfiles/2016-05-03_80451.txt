The big short

Hot pants, boy shorts, baggies and bermudas — whatever the style, shorts have never gone out of fashion. A must for the summer, these lowers have transformed in terms of their structure, materials and even length, over the years.
“Summer is all about comfortable style. So, your wardrobe needs to reflect that. Not only are shorts super comfortable, but with the number of options available, they are perfect for just about any occasion,” says designer Sanya Dhir, adding, “Designers are also giving shorts a couture twist. Embroidered hot pants are a delight. A fusion of classic and trendy shorts, this variety has sequins, dabka and nakshi elements, with intense zardozi work.”
Contrary to popular perception, shorts need not be limited to casual outings only. “Many international celebrities wear shorts on red carpets. Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, Diane Kruger, Selena Gomez and Kristen Stewart have often sported shorts at formal events. So, they have proved that dressing formal is not always about being decked up from head to toe. At times, less is more; it’s all about how you carry your style,” says designer Shehla Khan.
Dos and don’ts
1) Make sure your shorts aren’t too loose or too tight; you don’t want them sliding off or creating unnecessary bulges
2) If you have long and lean legs, opt for hot pants. Those with shorter legs should stick to high-waisted options. Curvy women should go for skorts
3) Opt for shorts that are made using breathable fabrics like cotton, linen or khadi
4) Since shorts exude a relaxed vibe, chose your footwear according to the occasion. For instance, sport brogues with a pastel T-shirt and denim shorts for a casual day out. Or, make a fashionable statement by wearing the blazer-short set with a pair of stilettos at a formal do.
