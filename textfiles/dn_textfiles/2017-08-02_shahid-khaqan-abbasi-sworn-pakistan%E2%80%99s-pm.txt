Shahid Khaqan Abbasi sworn in as Pakistan’s PM

PML-N’s Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was sworn in as Prime Minister of Pakistan in an oath-taking ceremony held at President House on Tuesday.
President Mamnoon Hussain administered the oath to Abbasi.
Abbasi was elected Prime Minister by lawmakers in the National Assembly(NA) earlier yesterday, bagging 221 votes to become the successor to ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar secured 47 votes, Awami Muslim League Chief Sheikh Rashid received 33 votes, and four MNAs voted for Jamaat-i-Islami’s Sahibzada Tariqullah during the ballot.
An NA session to elect a new Prime Minister had been called by President Mamnoon Hussain following a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the Panama Papers case on Friday, in which Nawaz Sharif was disqualified as PM after being deemed unfit to hold office.
Following the SC verdict, the PML-N had agreed upon Abbasi, the former Petroleum Minister, as its candidate for Prime Minister for the interim period till the ‘permanent’ replacement could be elected. Abbasi has to eventually give way to Shahbaz Sharif, who is likely to compete for the National Assembly seat lying vacant following the ouster of his elder brother and then stand for the chief executive’s office.
Following the announcement of Abbasi’s victory by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, the PML-N benches in the Lower House had erupted with loud sloganeering in favour of Nawaz Sharif.
Addressing the Lower House soon after his victory was announced, Prime Minister-elect Abbasi said: “I am grateful to you all, for following the democratic process — whether you voted for or against me.”
“I am grateful to the people of Pakistan, and I am grateful to the ‘people’s Prime Minister’, Nawaz Sharif,” he continued.
“I am also grateful to the opposition and Imran Khan for remembering us in their daily slandering,” he jibed.
Moving on, Abbasi termed the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Panamagate case “unprecedented”, saying that although the party was blind-sided by the judgement, “we accepted it as it was”.
“We did not challenge the courts, there was no division in our ranks. The party stands as it was. No one wanted to joust for power — whoever the Prime Minister [Nawaz Sharif] named was supported unanimously,” he said, rebuffing rumours of cracks in the party’s ranks following the verdict.
“Everybody wants the [Prime Minister’s] chair. Tell me, who in this house doesn’t? It is to the PML-N’s credit that all party members rallied unanimously behind whoever was nominated by our leader.
“Within four days, the democratic process is back on track. There were no defections. There was no dissension in our ranks.
“Justice mandates that though a 1,000 guilty people may go free, not even one innocent person should be wrongfully convicted. I will not go into details of Friday’s decision — I only want to say that there will soon be another court — one held by the people. There will be no JIT there,” he said, referring to the upcoming general elections in 2018.
“I am sure that the real Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, will return to this seat.”
However, he said that, “I am the country’s Prime Minister — bet it for 45 days or 45 hours — and am not here just to keep the seat warm.”
“If I am here for 45 days, I will try to complete the amount of the work that requires 45 months,” he vowed.
Continuing, the Prime Minister-elect urged that the Constitution be respected. “Politics, which has come to be seen as a disreputable profession, will be made respectable again.”
“Be it the government, bureaucracy, opposition or the army — we are in the same boat, and a hole in this boat will sink everyone,” he cautioned.
“We will continue taking difficult decisions,” Abbasi said as he promised to take action against “private militias” providing security to citizens.
“There is not a single country in the world which allows the licencing of automatic rifles for citizens. If you go outside parliament right now, you will see a private militia,” Abbasi remarked.
“Action will be taken against them if my cabinet allows for it. The federal government will seize all automatic weapons, compensating people in return,” he promised.
The Premier, carrying forward Nawaz Sharif and the PML-N’s promises, vowed to eliminate loadshedding by November this year as he highlighted various infrastructure and development projects initiated by his party’s government as examples of its commitment to the country’s growth.
Abbasi also briefly mentioned a focus on agriculture, education and health services.
“Agriculture is the backbone of the country,” Abbasi said. “Although I am not an agriculturalist, I feel their pain,” he said.
Speaking about the state of education, the premier called for improvements in higher education and the need for a national testing mechanism.
Abbasi also touched upon the PM’s Health Card scheme introduced by Nawaz Sharif - “the largest system in South Asia”. - DAWN
