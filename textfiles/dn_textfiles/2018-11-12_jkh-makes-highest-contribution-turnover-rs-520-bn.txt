Point of view 
Domestic political uncertainty continued to dominate market movement this week with the broadshare Index falling ~2% from its 2-month high last week. Equity markets in most Emerging and Frontier market peers by contrast, hit one-month highs as investors perceived the outcome from the US mid-term elections (ie: a divided Congress) positively.
Sri Lanka’s benchmark Index however, recorded consecutive losses between Mon-Thur, falling ~162 points as last week’s heavy local retail and institutional buying eased-off amid some profit-taking from last week’s market rally and as the country’s political stalemate worsened over the week. On Friday however, the ASPI rebounded, gaining ~48 points to pare down the week’s earlier losses. Activity levels too remained robust despite the holiday-shortened trading week, and average weekly turnover remained in line with that of last week’s average of Rs.2.0Bn.
Foreign investors on the Colombo Bourse meanwhile continued to remain net sellers over the week, maintaing their pace of selling amid the ongoing political fallout. Foreigners sales amounted to Rs5.4Bn during the week cf. Rs.6.5Bn last week, and the majority of selling was in Sri Lanka’s main blue-chip JKH which was collected by key local HNIs. Foreign selling on JKH totaled Rs.4.4Bn, but foreign buying in NDB (Rs.0.4Bn) and Anilana Hotels (Rs.0.2Bn) helped pare down the net selling on the market to Rs. 3.9Bn.
Net outflows from domestic equities in Q4’18 so far has risen to Rs.11.4Bn cf. just Rs.6.2Bn recorded between Jan-Sep’18. Political developments surrounding the reconvening of parliament next week is likely to influence market movement in the week ahead.
The foreign sell-off on Sri Lankan capital markets continued this week, with net outflows of Rs. 10Bn from Govt. Bond markets and net outflows of Rs.3.9Bn from Sri Lankan equities pushing the LKR 0.5% lower against the USD this week.
The LKR has lost 1.3% of its value since the start of the political crisis on Oct’26, adding to the 11% loss on the LKR up till then and taking the cumulative YTD loss on the LKR to 12% to make the LKR one of the worst performing EM/FM currencies so far this year.
