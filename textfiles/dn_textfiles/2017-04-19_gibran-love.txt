Gibran in love

Can love letters be regarded as spiritual writings? Perhaps the love letters of the well known poet cum painter Khalil Gibran (1895 – 1931) written to a contemporary poetess cum journalist May Ziadah (1886 – 1941) as collected and published by the Gibran specialist Suheil Bushreui, could stand as an exception to the rule. These love letters written by Gibran has been collected by Bushrui to mark the 100th birth anniversary of the poet as entrusted by University of Maryland’s Khalil Giban Research and Studies Project.
Gibran who lived a short span of life, came to be known to the English readers all over the world through his celebrated prose poetic work named ‘The Prophet’. The work came to be translated to more than 25 languages. Born as a Lebanese living in the rural setting, Gibran emigrated to United States, with his mother, half-mother and two sisters. He settled initially in Boston, and later in New York, where he died. Though most of his writings were done to Arabic, he wrote in English as well.
Deep sense of intimacy
Gibran had remained as far as possible an independent creative thinker cum painter. These love letters have been written to May Ziadah, by Gibran as a release from his creative prolific functions. May who had lived in Lebanon as a member of the Women’s Emancipation Movement in Cairo, did not have the chance to meeting Gibran at all. Both of them seemed to have exchanged letters to communicate the deep sense of intimacy that surpassed beyond reality.
Bushrui, the collector of these love letters, as written in Arabic and translated by himself, contain material which shows the keen sense of Gibran’s poetic vision as drawn from the Lebanese countryside and Arabic cultural traditions of his homeland. Gibran who studied English to enter a wider world of creativity had the chance of reading German philosopher Nietzsche, French symbolic poetry and the English poet-painter William Blake. But it is noted that instead of meeting personally they had the chance of exchanging views about their creative functions via the exchange of literary works and ideas.
As such the love letters as denoted visualize the deep sense of heartfelt expression as noted by Bushrui, the early works of Gibran as written in Arabic contain short narratives which express his ideas. But this was gradually replaced by the parable, the didactic essay, the aphorism, the allegory and the prose epigram all of which became distinctive features of his English works that commence fromt eh writing to the assorted collections titled as ‘The Madman’ published in 1918.
This was followed by a series of short prose narrative poems as found in ‘The Forerunner’, ‘The Prophet’, ‘Sand and Foam’, ‘Jesus the son of Man’, ‘The earth Gods’ and ‘The Wanderer’. Coming on to the love letters of Gibran, the reader has the chance of reading letters from the period between 1914 and 1930, a collectin of 38 letters. Some running to just one single page with reference to some of the early letters which contain material fo spiritual matters.
Most of these letters remind the reader of Gibran’s poetic vision of making the humans look deep into one’s mind as teachings in meditation.
Rarest kind
The love bond which brought together, these two Lebanese writers living in different parts of the world, was one of the very rarest kind is the main factor as observed by Bushrui. As such, the unpublished love letters of the two form a collection of unparalleled significance for Gibran fans and researchers. Gibran’s letters, as we read on assume a sense of creative inspiration, exchange of views, praises and criticisms between two leading figures in arab literary circles of the early 20th century.
May Ziadah had apparently read the pioneer works of Gibran such as the first novella titled as ‘The Broken Wings’ published in 1912. Writing her first letter, she had praised his narrative style while criticizing the human experience that lay buried, the seemingly lack of sympathy with the heroine named Selma, a married woman who meets her secret lover at a prayer. As she had commented, Gibran had felt that man’s only path to self realization lay in love, May was all too conscious of the inescapable position of oriental women,t he grip of social restrictions.
Though May respected the freedom and individuality to which other women aspired she old not disregard the bonds which tied her to her own social structure.
As the intimacies deepen, Gibran tries to express mystic vision. One good example comes from the letter dated December 9, 1924, where the silence is expressed as follows. ‘But how strange the silence of my beloved how strange her silence! This silence is as long as eternity as deep as the dreams of het gods. It is a silence that cannot be translated into any mortal tongue.’
He too expresses the sensitivity of some of the cultural traits. One example is from the letter dated January 12, 1925.
‘The Americans are of all peoples in the world, the most fond of celebrating birthdays and sending and receiving birthday presents. And for a reason that has escaped me, the Americans shower their kindness on me on such occasions. On the 6th of the month, I was embarrassed by their overwhelming kindness and filled with a deep sense of gratitude. But god knows the word I received from you was dearer anymore precious to me than anything and everything others can do for me.’
Gibran discussions and interprets his views on poems, paintings, narratives and spiritual guidance despite the fact that the letters remain as love letters in spirit.
