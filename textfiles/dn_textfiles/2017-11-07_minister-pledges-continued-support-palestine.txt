Minister pledges continued support to Palestine

As a government, Sri Lanka stands by Palestine, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a ceremony held in Colombo recently to mark 100 years of the infamous Balfour Declaration that changed the destiny of the Palestinian people, the region and the world, Minister Senaratne stated that it is important to educate the youths on justice.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that he observed the Palestinian issue since his youth and witnessed the plight of the Palestine people.
Although the issue grows more complicated with the Jewish impact, Sri Lanka sincerely hopes that the issue will be solved soon.
The Sri Lankan government will continue to maintain cordial relations with Palestine, he added.
Former British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour signed the infamous Balfour Declaration on November 2, 1917, creating a `Jewish Motherland' on Palestinian land.
