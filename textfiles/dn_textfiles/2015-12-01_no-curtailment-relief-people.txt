'No curtailment of relief to the people'

The government will not curtail any relief given to the public and the national unity government is the only government which can fulfill the people's needs, Mass Media and Information Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said in Parliament yesterday.
He made these comments participating in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the seventh allotted day.
Minister Karunathilaka said Budget 2016 was presented in a new form which is completely different from the blue, red and green traditional budget styles.
"It is also a special budget as it was the first budget presented jointly by the two main political parties of the country," he said.
The minister also pointed out that if there was no democratic revolution on January 8, things would not have changed in the country.
"I represented the Southern Province and was elected to Parliament with the highest preferential votes than the Rajapaksas in the South," he said.
Karunathilaka also said that during the budget debate, the opposition used to talk about the prices of essential food items such as big onions, dhal, sugar etc.
"The government has not given any room for it this time by reducing the prices of 11 essential consumer items. The opposition has only got two points to criticise about - the eco test and price hike on imported vehicles," he said.
Budget 2016 has allocated Rs. 21,000 million to develop 14,000 villages. The government has given Rs. 10,000 to public servants as pledged and also reduced fuel and gas prices. This government has created an investment friendly atmosphere in the country, the minister said.
He also noted that there was media freedom today and there was a new political culture in the country with the Maithri-Ranil combination.
