CHRISTMAS: A DAWN OF RENEWED HOPE

Christians ardently believe that Jesus, known as the ‘Messiah’ (meaning the ‘anointed’ or ‘the chosen one’), was born to a virgin mother named Mary. This glorious Christmas story took its origin based on the gospels of Luke and Matthew. According to these gospels, Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem to mother Mary and his foster father, Joseph.
According to popular tradition, he is said to be born in a stable; but as per the Biblical accounts, he was born and laid in a manger. It is believed that this stable and manger are situated in a place called the Grotto of the Nativity, where Jesus is said to have been born (it is still found within the crypt underneath the main altar of the church of the Nativity in Bethlehem).
An angel had appeared to the shepherds who were living out in the fields near this stable and had announced the birth of Jesus.
The angel had further said to them that there will be a baby swaddled in cloths and lying in a manger and that he shall be the sign. Thereafter, they had left to see baby Jesus and they are believed to be the first group to witness baby Jesus. Christians believe that the prophecy which had been made many years before the birth of Christ was fulfilled with Jesus’s birth.
In a stable, having been born to a poor family, the son of Almighty God came to us in human form with the noble intention of delivering the message of truth to mankind. Christians consider that the arrival of the son of God into a world full of sinful humans is an act of showing divine love.
Based on the belief that baby Jesus was born on the December 25, the said date has been named Christmas day and every year it is celebrated all over the world by Christians.
Christians living in a large number of countries in the world consider that Christmas is the most significant day of the year and thus it is celebrated annually in a grand manner. At present, Christmas has been commercialised to a great extent and we need to realise the true value of Christmas.
Christmas, the celebration of the birth of baby Jesus, has evolved into a splendid ceremony with the incorporation of a number of other aspects. Dealing with the special observances and terms connected with Christmas while having an understanding about them will be of great help to bring out the true meaning of Christmas.
Christmas
The English term, ‘Christmas’ is shortened from the words, ‘Christ’s Mass’, which has derived from the Old English, ‘Cristesmæsse’.
The word, ‘Christmas’ is also written as ‘X-mas’. The appearance of letter ‘X’ can be seen as an influence of the Greek language as ‘X’ is the initial letter of the Greek term which stands for the word ‘Christ’. Therefore, it can be said that the abbreviation, ‘Xmas’ has also come into being with reference to ‘Christmas.’ According to sources, it becomes evident that this abbreviation has been used since the mid-1500s.
Christmas trees
The first artificial Christmas trees were created in Germany. It is recorded that it was made in the 19th century. These were made using goose feathers which were dyed green. Goose feathers were fixed into a structure in the shape of a tree which had been made using things such as wires.
Before artificial trees were introduced by the Germans, evergreen conifers had been decorated during Christmas. The earliest instance of decorating such a plant was recorded from the town Riga in Latvia. That was around the year 1510.
Earlier, Christmas trees made using evergreen conifers were decorated using fruit such as apple and grapes. Other than fruit, items of confectionary were also used for that purpose. Later on, candles were used to adorn Christmas trees and presently electric bulbs have taken their places to make the trees more beautiful.
People of Poland use artificial spiders and cobwebs to decorate Christmas trees. According to a folk story in that country, the swaddling cloth of baby Jesus had been woven by spiders. Due to this reason, Polanders consider spiders as a symbol of prosperity.
Even though artificial Christmas trees have been introduced, natural Christmas trees are cultivated using special types of trees and harvested even at present.
It is said that around 30 to 35 million natural Christmas trees are sold during each Christmas in America alone. To meet this demand, Christmas tree cultivation farms have been established in America. There are around 21,000 farms for growing Christmas trees.
Greeting cards
Another thing which people are in the habit of doing during Christmas season is sending Christmas greeting cards. The first Christmas card was designed in 1843. According to history, a British Civil Officer named Sir Henry Cole had taken the initiative to do that. After designing the first Christmas card, he started to create Christmas greeting cards just for the purpose of selling.
The act of sending greetings to relatives and friends through Christmas Cards has become an aspect of American culture since 1875.
Sending Christmas greeting cards has now become a crucial element within American culture. That becomes clearly evident when looking into the sales and the income gained by selling Christmas Cards in the United States of America.
Carols
Christmas songs render the splendour of Christmas an almost tangible rhythm which can be felt by our hearts. Usually, these gleeful renditions are given on stages made in front of churches and some people sing those songs while parading on open vehicles along the streets. It is said that Christmas songs became extremely popular during the 19th centenary. These are also known as Christmas carols by many people.
There are records which suggest that the first singing of Christmas songs took place in Rome. It has been mentioned that those songs were sung in the fourth century. Those were written by St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
The Christmas carols sung during the past were neither melodious nor harmonious and were different from the ones we listen today. It is said that those were written incorporating profound excerpts from Christian Theology. Therefore, their diction was inharmonious. No clear evidence is found as to how those recitals had been presented.
Christmas stamps
Issuing postage stamps on the theme of Christmas was quite customary in most of the countries. Those postage stamps issued for Christmas are specially used to send Christmas greeting cards. It is said that the first postage stamp for Christmas had been issued in Canada in 1898.
Father Christmas
We cannot even imagine a Christmas without Father Christmas or Santa Claus. The character of present Santa Claus originates from Bishop St. Nicholas who lived in Myra, Greece in fourth century. When considering various legends about the bishop, St. Nicholas it transpires that bishop, St. Nicholas derived great pleasure in giving away gifts to needy children.
In some other stories, it is said that an ordinary person named Nicholas had been in the habit of distributing gifts among children of poor families during the Christmas season. He had spent his personal wealth for that purpose. He did not let the society know that he was the one who had been distributing gifts among the poor.
He had acquired the habit of discreetly entering houses through the chimney during the night and to keep gifts by the sides of children. Later on, he had been canonised as a saint. It is said that he was known as Saint Nicholas thereafter.
It is clear that the character of Santa Claus had originated based on St. Nicholas.
The character of modern Santa Claus has been created mainly by artists and authors of children’s storybooks. The American cartoonist named Thomas Nast is one of the prominent figures who created the modern version of Santa Claus in the 1980s. In this regard, it is also worth mentioning the American writer, L. Frank Baum, who wrote “The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus” in 1902 based on the character of Santa Claus.
People have different opinions on where Santa Claus lives but the majority believes that Santa Claus and his wife, Mrs. Claus, live in the North Pole. Throughout the year, two of them are believed to be engaged in the act of making two lists of children in the world, categorising them as ‘good’ and ‘bad’. According to the said list, Santa Claus is the one who prepares presents.
So, he is said to be busy throughout the year. His group of elves assists Santa Claus to make the presents required. Santa Claus delivers the gifts he prepared for children on Christmas evening by riding his sleigh pulled by eight flying reindeer. This is the famous legend existed.
Letters to Santa Claus
Little girls and boys are used to sending letters to Santa Claus during the Christmas season. Santa Claus becomes extremely busy during the season of Christmas. So the letters addressed to him should be sent as soon as possible. Otherwise, it is said that he can hardly reply to you. Once Santa Claus sending a mail through British Royal Mail and this is what he had written in that regard.
Dear boys and girls,
Christmas is a very exciting but busy time for me: the elves are making toys, the reindeer are practising their sleigh runs, and I’m busy preparing my list of who’s been good this year. I want you to inform me your preferred present to have the soonest possible.
And in between, I will try to reply to as many of you as possible. Please send your letters to Santa/Father Christmas, Santa’s Grotto, Reindeer land. Please send your letters by December 9. I am looking forward to delivering your presents on Christmas Evening. Make sure you remember my mince pie and Rudolph’s carrot…..
Measures have been taken in many countries to collect the letters addressed to Santa Claus and to reply to them through postal services. It is said that the replies for letters sent to Santa Claus are sent by employees of the postal services of the respective countries or a board of volunteers. Reports say that in 2014 six hundred thousand letters addressed to Santa Claus had been received to British Royal Mail.
There are three towns which have been named as Santa Claus in the USA. Those towns are situated in Georgia, Arizona, and Indiana. However, nothing has ever been reported about Santa Claus living in any of those towns.
When having a closer look at the outward splendour associated with this hallowed festival, it becomes clear that it is merely clever of means of keeping the spirits of children up and actively engaging them in the celebration of Christmas with great enthusiasm and cheerfulness while the grown-ups explore the true meaning of Christmas through spiritual discipline.
Not only Sri Lankan Christians but also some members of the Buddhist community take part in Christmas celebrations. Especially during Christmas celebrations at government institutions all the Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and Islamic devotees come forward, help one another and work in unison during such religious activities of fellow Christians showing reconciliation and unity among the Sri Lankan community.
Sri Lanka Police, as a significant government institution which celebrates main religious festivals ceremoniously, has taken measures to celebrate Christmas decorously this year as well with the participation of Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith under the leadership of the Inspector General of Police on 21st evening at Police Grounds, Bambalapitiya.
While taking a determined effort to bring about peace and love expressed through the message delivered to this world by the Prince of Peace, we hope that the world will be filled with peace and prosperity and wish all the people of the world a Merry Christmas!
