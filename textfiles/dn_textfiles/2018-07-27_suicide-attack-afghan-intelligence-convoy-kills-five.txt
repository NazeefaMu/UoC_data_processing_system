Suicide  attack  on Afghan  intelligence  convoy kills five

AFGHANISTAN: A suicide bomber blew himself up near an Afghan intelligence convoy on Thursday, killing at least five people and wounding six, police said, in the latest deadly attack in the city.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said happened at 5:00 am. Most of the victims were NDS officers, Stanikzai said.
Four members of the NDS and a civilian were killed, while five NDS personnel and a civilian were wounded.
The attacker was “most likely” driving a vehicle carrying explosives, Stanikzai added.
The assault comes two days after five rockets were fired on a residential area of Kabul, wounding at least three people. There was no claim of responsibility.
And on Sunday, a suicide bomber blew himself up near Kabul international airport, killing at least 23 people, including AFP driver Mohammad Akhtar. A further 107 people were wounded.
That attack was claimed by the Islamic State group (IS), which said it had targeted Afghan Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum, who returned to Kabul after more than a year in exile.
Taliban and IS militants have repeatedly carried out deadly attacks in the Afghan capital, turning it into one of the most dangerous places in the country. - AFP
