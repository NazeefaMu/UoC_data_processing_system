Twenty-six arrested in Hambantota

 
Twenty-six persons were arrested in Hambantota after Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds outside the Indian Consulate.
Yesterday, the Hambantota Magistrate issued an order preventing the protest planned for today by MPs of the Joint Opposition.
MPs including Namal Rajapaksa and D.V. Upul from entering the vicinity of the Hambantota Port, the Indian Consulate and the roads leading to the Hambantota Port today.
However the protestors had converged outside the Indian Consulate in Hambantota prompting authorities to move to evict them.
