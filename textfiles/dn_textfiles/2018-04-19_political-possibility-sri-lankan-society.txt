Political possibility for Sri Lankan society

The struggle towards Independence in Sri Lanka was a peaceful political movement which aimed at achieving freedom and self-rule for the country from the British Empire. For those pioneers in the movement, the political freedom was their greatest objective.
Yet seven decades after it was won, what that freedom has delivered measures up poorly for most of the citizens in the country.
Today, politics itself has come to be seen as impeding the decisive action needed to expand economic and social possibilities. In a society of swiftly inflating expectations, where old deference crumbles before youthful impatience, frustration with the current state of politics is perhaps not surprising.
Most independent political critics believe we are running out of time. The Government has to make choices. And, these choices will determine how we are going to handle the daunting challenges we face today.
Five challenges
Some months ago, World Bank pointed out that Sri Lanka has five main challenges that need to be addressed in order to sustain progress and fulfil development potential. Those challenges remain valid even today and it's worthwhile going through it again.
World Bank said the country has ample opportunities to build on its success due to its enviable location for trade, relatively educated workforce and remarkable natural assets. The Bank also emphasised that effective leadership will be needed to steer Sri Lanka forward on a path that will continue its strong progress in ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
The five main challenges which need attention are as follows:
Fiscal challenge
For many decades, Sri Lanka has been one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world in spite of increasing economic growth and higher per-capita incomes. We did not have any tax adjustments in line with the economic changes. In addition, tax avoidance and tax evasion were not handled professionally.
The present Government has introduced a new revamped tax bill to ensure that all citizens pay direct taxes and cut indirect taxes. The new measure, according to the Finance Ministry sources, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programmes. However, success depends on the implementation of an effective programme to raise income tax collection and to rationalize the widespread income tax incentives.
However, the immediate fiscal challenge is to improve the external liquidity position and prepare for active liability management. Given the significantly large external obligations falling due, especially beginning in 2019, potential actions include buying back and re-issuing longer-dated bonds. However, this is a short-term solution.
When a high proportion of revenue is absorbed to meet debt servicing costs, most Government current and capital expenditure has to be met on further borrowings. This will result in growth slowdown, leading to delays in key reforms in a challenging political environment.
Therefore, structural changes to public expenditure are needed to focus on investment in human and productivity-enhancing physical capital to return to a higher growth rate. The government should also develop a stronger programme for poverty reduction while preparing to take care of an ageing population.
Challenge of providing jobs for the bottom 40%
Sri Lanka has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the other MDGs, out-performing other South Asian countries. Only 6.7 percent of the population live below the national poverty line. Fifteen years ago, it was around 23 percent.
It is important to note that around 30.0% of the employed population in the country is still engaged in agriculture and are producing food for 20.3 million people. The pro-poor economic transition cannot be achieved by abandoning the agricultural sector. Instead, sufficient attention needs to be given to increase agricultural productivity by improving extension services, introducing new technology and farming techniques, providing necessary advice and assistance to set up agro-based industries. Such comprehensive programmes could create new employment opportunities for rural youth.
The highest numbers of people living in poverty are located within the multi-city agglomeration areas of Colombo, Kandy, Galle and Matara. A critical means to end poverty and achieve greater shared prosperity is to harness urbanization for inclusive growth.
There are also pockets of high rates of poverty in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and within the estate sector. The high poverty rates in these areas are characterized by weaker access to services and poor links to the labour market.
Sri Lanka’s industrial policy has been broadly market-oriented since liberalization in the late 1970s, but the degree of outward orientation has wavered in the past decade. The introduction of para-tariffs has effectively doubled the protection rates, making the present import regime one of the most complex and protectionist in the world. Foreign direct investment remains below 2 percent of GDP, far lower than the levels of FDI in other middle-income countries, particularly in Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka also suffers from a skills mismatch, a result of the education system not equipping people with the abilities that businesses want.
Social inclusion challenges
High and growing inequality makes inclusive growth more difficult. Beyond a certain threshold, inequality could harm growth and poverty reduction. Although there was no specific goal on inequality, under MDGs, for SDGs, Goal 10 says: “By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain economic growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average”.
Women can play a stronger role in Sri Lanka’s development. Females made up 53 percent of the working-age population in 2012 but only 34 percent of the employed population, a figure that has remained static for decades. If Sri Lanka hopes to tap into the productive potential that women hold to stimulate economic growth, it must work to develop greater support systems for women who continue to operate within current socio-cultural frameworks.
Governance challenge
There is good enough proof that during the previous regime, our country has been plagued by corruption, the absence of the rule of law, the heavy politicisation of all government institutions, including the judicial system, police and the entire political machinery.
The newly elected government in 2015, therefore, was tasked by the people with the responsibility to create essential conditions, a governing system to achieve self-reliance, sustainable development, social justice and the ideal functioning of a democratic government which could operate with efficiency and effectiveness. People wanted the Government to ensure that accountability both financial and political, transparency both financial and political, enforcement of the rule of law and efficient and effective delivery system of services and goods are implemented as soon as possible. Above all, they wanted the corrupt politicians and officials to be taken in and institute legal action immediately.
How far the Government has succeeded to date is under debate. The recent Local Government Election results projected some idea of the public thinking.
Sustainability challenge
Over the longer term, the country will need strong political leadership with a commitment to fight against deep-rooted corruption, non-accountability, non-transparency and inefficiency. It should also be able to provide a durable framework for national reconciliation to address grievances which fuelled past conflict and carry through with institutional reforms. What is most important is that the current leadership sets a trend and provides inspiration for new generations of leaders to emulate.
