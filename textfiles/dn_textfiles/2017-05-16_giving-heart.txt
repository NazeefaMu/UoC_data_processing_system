Giving from the heart

Humanity seems to be the hallmark of her character. In an era when many former beauty queens have dusted their hands off charity projects Mrs Sri Lanka International 2016 Chandi Weerasooriya has set her heart in volunteer work. She takes pride in them
Especially because they have been embraced by the public so heartily.
“Things have changed drastically in my life after taking part and winning the crown. The title hasn’t just got me that tag of Mrs. Sri Lanka International. It has given me a lot of exposure and visibility. People have started knowing me, of course, there is an added responsibility as well. Beyond everything else, I have become more confident about myself because I never thought I will ever be a Mrs. Sri Lanka. I just went to give my best and when I got it, I realized miracles do happen. Earning this title is being in the spotlight in the country. So it gave me a lot of confidence, faith and also hope to do a lot more in my life,” Chandi said.
Chandi has been actively involved in projects that are carried out to protect and support children who may be at risk for being subjected to physical, emotional and sexual abuse or the young survivors who have endured more than we can imagine. She considers assisting children who are at risk of or are victims of abuse, children who are in alternative care, street children, and families at risk as a responsibility of one and all.
“Redirecting them for proper education by enlightening the importance of education, supporting the children from the poor income families by giving educational scholarships at least till they finish the ordinary level education is important. I am glad to say that there are doctors who are voluntarily working with me in medical camps that we carry out for children in homes, children from families that live in rural areas with poor income, street kids, and young mothers,” she explained.
“The most important fact in all these projects is to let these children know that they are valuable and cared for. They need to realize that there is an ear for the little voices crying out silently,” she added.
Chandi carries out a separate project to uplift the young mothers to establish skills for small industries.
Her recent work involves empowering abused women, women from poor income families and single mothers. This is a step away from her projects which mostly focus on children. She says that she finds it as a blessing when these women reached out to her for help. “My main aim is to connect and unite women where they will no longer suffer alone. The next most important fact is educating people on the importance of the bond between the parents which leads to safeguard the family unit,” she explained.
Chandi notes that Sri Lankan women have nowhere to gather with other women and talk about issues like gender equity, women’s rights, or health. She has taken steps to create READ Centers which provides a safe, trusted space for women to gather and learn. They already have a couple of donors who have lent them required buildings to create READ centers.
“We will educate women who haven’t had proper education, teach them job skills, and build up self-esteem. This is not something that can be implemented within hours or days. This takes time and support from the community and, of course, the government as well.It is my mission to spearhead this effort using all the support I can get locally and internationally from various organizations I am connected with,” Chandi explained.
In the recent past she had the opportunity to sign a memorandum with Thailand to get support to implement small industries.
“At the moment we are in the process of carrying out workshops to find out the most suitable small industries which we can extent the technological support. It is important to help single mothers with less education to improve their skills to own small home based business,” she said.
With so many social care related projects in her kitty Chandi says that it is one person, her grandfather, who inspired her to change her life in a significant way.
“He made me into a person who is driven to lend a hand whenever I see the need. When it comes to Mrs. International it’s all about strong women passionate about their chosen platforms. They have been involved in social services and charity work way before they are chosen as queens and with or without the crown they continue what they have started,” Chandi mused.
Recalling one significant moment which is engraved in her mind during her social service work Chandi says, “I work with this little boy who is neglected and gone through violence at home. He is only about five years old. Although he can speak he had stopped communicating completely. Recently he started communicating with me through his paintings. You simply have to hold your tears and read the frustration and pain he cries out silently through his work. To witness what these small children go through really makes me wonder what we, as adults, really do to save them,” she said.
