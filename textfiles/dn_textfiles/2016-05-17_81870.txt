Raigam Tele’es nominations evening

The Raigam Tele’es Nomination Evening was held on May 13 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo. The Chief Guest and the Guest of Honour for the occasion was Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Media Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranawithana. Prominent artists, members of the judge panel and media personnels took part in the event.
The 12th Raigam Tele’es will be held on a grand scale at the Nelum Pokuna theater on June 3 at 6 pm.
Polling by SMS to select the Most Popular Actor, Actress and the Tele-drama will be open till June 2 midnight.
When The Kingdom of Raigam reached the eighth milestone of its journey, the television industry was selected as the area for its corporate social responsibility (CSR) work. For the betterment of the television industry in Sri Lanka, Raigam Tele-awards Ceremony was born, providing evaluation with proper judgment.
One of the unique features of Raigam Tele’es is the selection of a special visual theme. This theme is evident from the invitation card to the stage decorations. For the fourth Raigam Tele’es, the theme was the Coliseum to signify the road from Dramas of the Coliseum to Tele-drama. The following years had Sigiriya, the Taj-mahal, the Colour Spectrum and the Sooriyakantha Mirror and Bird’s eye. The theme for last year when Raigam Tele’es celebrating its eleventh consecutive performance was “Meaningful tele-contribution of an eleven-year voyage, perfectly balance like 11”. At the twelfth encounter, the visual theme that has been chosen is “Twelve years that appreciated tastes of twelve months…..”.
As an industry there are thousands of artists and technicians engaged in the television industry in Sri Lanka. Out of hundreds of entries for the event there are about 120 nominees for various awards less than 40 in number. The efforts of Nominees are also equally valuable as final winners but there is no room to appreciate such capabilities at the Awards Ceremony due to time and other constraints. That is the reason behind organizing a grand scale nominations evening by Raigam Tele’es. That is a standard practice of recognized international festivals. Raigam Tele’es pioneered this international standard in Sri Lanka. Once again, Raigam Tele’es has made all arrangements for the artists as well as viewers to experience a grand scale Nomination Evening.
Nominations for 18 awards under the category of “Excellence in Tele-drama”, and 19 awards under the category of “Excellence in Television Media Programmes” will be announced at the nominations evening. Accordingly 121 artists who have shown exceptional talent and nominated for the above 37 awards will be apprised and appreciated. Recipients of awards under other categories (Jury Awards, Popular Awards, Awards of Appreciation and Awards for Channels) will be announced at the final event. Total number of awards scheduled for Raigam Tele’es 2016 is 54.
Raigam pioneered the use of SMS to select the winners of popular awards. This time too the general public will get the chance to use SMS to elect their choice of the most popular Actor, Actress, and Tele-drama. To register one’s choice, type the name of the Tele-drama, (space) name of Actor/Actress and send to 772-522522 or 702 722 722. The competition is now on and will be closed at midnight on June 2.
Honouring the Pioneers and Artists who had worked hard for the development of the television sector is one of the special events of the Raigam Tele’es. Two awards of appreciation will be presented to two special people who have helped to build up our television industry during its three-decade history and another prominent contributor to the industry will be honoured with the ‘PRATHIBHA PRABHA’ life time award.
The TV channel winning most number of awards under the television media programme category will be honoured with the “Television Media Programme Channel of the year” award, while the TV channel winning most number of awards under the tele-drama category will be honoured with the “Tele-drama Channel of the year” award. The channel winning most number of awards will be the “Channel of the Year”.
