Govt must stop JO from misleading public: Bahu

The President and the Prime Minister are focusing on the wrong issue, the bond issue, without telling the truth to the country about the proposed new Constitution and stopping the Joint opposition from misleading the public, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) Leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the party office in Colombo yesterday, he said two years had passed without nothing been done for a new constitution.
"Only public opinion is collected. There is nothing about the devolution of power or whether the country is a unitary state or not. However, the former President's gang shouts from the top of the roof telling that the new Constitution is a death trap," Karunaratne said.
He said the JVP was now not telling the government what should and not be done.
"They are trying to take political advantage using the existing situation in the country," Karunaratne said.
