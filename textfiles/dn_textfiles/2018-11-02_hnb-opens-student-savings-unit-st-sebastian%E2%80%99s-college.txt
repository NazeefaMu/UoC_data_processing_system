HNB opens student Savings  Unit at St. Sebastian’s College

Expanding its efforts to inculcate a resilient savings habit among the nation’s youth, a premier retail bank, HNB PLC, opened a Student Savings Unit at St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa.
The new unit was opened at a ceremony held at the school with the participation of HNB’s Managing Director and CEO, Jonathan Alles together with senior management from the bank and HNB Director and past pupil of St. Sebastian’s College, Nilanth De Silva St. Sebastian’s College’s Rector, Rev Fr Ranjith Andradi said “Our college has long maintained a strong and active relationship with HNB and we were eager to partner with the bank to establish our own Student Savings Unit. In our consultations with HNB we identified the need to teach children about financial responsibility from an early age, and this starts with being responsible with their pocket money.
“We express our heartfelt gratitude to HNB in partnering with the College to help our students develop healthy financial habits,” noted Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi.
HNB’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Alles, speaking on the occasion said “We at HNB are privileged to expand our Student Savings Units in schools and are thankful to St. Sebastian’s for giving us the opportunity. “Financial education is an important component of school going children and is their first lesson in money management” Alles stated, adding that lessons, such as developing budgets, savings, investing for college and the wise and responsible use of credit are learned by students in the process.
Established in 1854, St Sebastian’s Moratuwa stands among Sri Lanka’s oldest and most prestigious educational institutions, serving as a centre of learning and education for over 3,000 students.
