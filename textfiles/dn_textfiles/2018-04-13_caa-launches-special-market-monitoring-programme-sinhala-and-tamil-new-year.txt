CAA launches Special Market Monitoring  Programme for Sinhala and Tamil New Year

Boosting its consumer safeguards for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year (Avurudu), the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) had launched a special seasonal monitoring programme on the directions of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen. Hence, CAA monitoring currently expands to Avurudu sales promotions by firms and various seasonal discount campaign offers.
Meanwhile, the rush to cash in on the season by errant traders is strong and the CAA had netted almost Rs. 5 million in fines in a short period.
“The Sinhala and Tamil New Year season is a time when many consumers fall victim to errant traders,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said, while addressing a meeting with his officials on April 11.
“As a result, we have increased raids and collected almost Rs. 5 million as fines. CAA officials had informed that a Special Market Monitoring Programme (SMMP) is in place during this season, to safeguard consumers,” he added.
On the instructions of Minister Bathiudeen, CAA officials guided by its Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne under the said SMMP, had initiated monitoring prices of items including food sold at rest stops where long-distance passenger buses break journey midway for refreshments. CAA officials are closely monitoring defective products including household appliances prompted on seasonal discounts and sales campaigns.
The CAA is also monitoring prices of mineral water bottles and other beverages that are currently being sold. The quality of food sold by roadside mobile units, are also being monitored to ensure consumer safety.
In the pre-New Year period between March 12 and April 10, the CAA conducted 2,586 raids countrywide and filed 1,238 court cases.
If any consumer were to feel that they had fallen prey to such malpractices, they should call the CAA hotline: 1977.
