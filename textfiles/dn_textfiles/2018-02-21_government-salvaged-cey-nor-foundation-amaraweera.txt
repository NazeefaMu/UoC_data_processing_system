Government salvaged Cey-Nor Foundation: Amaraweera

Cey-Nor Foundation Ltd., which was previously at a loss, has transformed into a profit-making entity under the present government, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. It was achieved through the implementation of projects aimed at building multi-day fishing vessels, he added.
The minister was addressing a gathering at a launch of two new 59-foot multi-day fishing vessels equipped with the latest facilities at Cey-Nor Jetty in Mattakkuliya, recently.
According to the minister, the main objective of implementing these projects was to reduce post-harvest losses. The country loses around 40 percent of its daily fish harvest due to post-harvest losses.
Under this project, the foundation has taken measures to build ten multi-day fishing vessels longer than 55 feet, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. Ministry Secretary Jagath P Wijeweera and many other officials participated to the event.
