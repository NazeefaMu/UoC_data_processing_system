‘Illicit constructions increase floods’

Flooding had become common in urban areas, and it was the responsibility of local government bodies to prevent it, Water Resource Management and Disaster Management Minister Palitha Range Bandara said.
He was addressing a meeting held on Monday, at the Anamaduwa United National Party office.
According to research carried out by the Disaster Management Ministry, it was revealed that unauthorised constructions set up near rivers and tanks were one of the main causes for floods, he said and added that over 90 percent of compensation for disaster victims was due to complications caused by them.
The state minister highlighted the importance of demolishing illegal constructions without considering the political backgrounds of the people who own them. He added that the local government bodies had the authority to remove them.
State Minister Bandara said that solid waste in drains had increased due to such constructions.
“It is a result of inefficient administration of local government bodies,” he added.
