Hajj Committee refutes allegations

The Hajj Committee yesterday hit back at allegations of corruption levelled against them and stated that these allegations were motivated by agents who had not received a quota to take pilgrims to Mecca.
The All Ceylon Hajj Organisation’s Vice President Dr M.S.M. Mohammad had held a media briefing last week alleging that the Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.M. Haleem and the Committee were working together to swindle millions from unsuspecting pilgrims.
Minister Haleem addressing a media briefing at the Ministry held together with Hajj operators and the Committee, said during the last three years, several unscrupulous operators have become disgruntled with the Ministry as it rolled out a more regularized system of handling Hajj pilgrims every year. In addition, they have also managed to bring down the fee for pilgrimage from Rs 7-800,000 to Rs 4.5-500,000.
Dr. Mohammad had alleged that the Minister had appointed his brother to the Hajj Committee, the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs charged Rs 4,000 as service charges instead of just Rs 2,000, had charged Rs 1,44,000 each, last year for the extra 600 pilgrims above the quota and not issued receipts and was only allocating pilgrim quotas for those who curried favour with the Minister.
Haj Committee Chairman, M.T. Ziyad Mohamed explained that all Haj operations were handled by travel operators and that the Committee only decided on policy, “the Committee strongly felt that by awarding of a fixed number of quota (pilgrims) to each operator, gave the latter a monopoly in deciding the price as well as selecting the pilgrims. So we decided to select the operators as well as the pilgrims through a proper registration system. This in turn gives the option to the pilgrims to select the operator under a free market system.”
Ziyad Mohamed further explained that they had received the additional 600 quota last year, just a week before the pilgrimage started and thus they charged the Rs 1,44,000 as the regular administrative fee which had to be paid to Saudi officials.
