Zimbabwe appoint Lalchand Rajput as interim head coach

Lalchand Rajput has been announced as the interim head coach of Zimbabwe.
Rajput, a former opening batsman who played two Tests and four ODIs for India between 1985 and 1987, fills the role vacated by Heath Streak who was sacked, along with the entire coaching staff and captain Graeme Cremer, following Zimbabwe's failure to qualify for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup.
The 56-year-old has previously coached Afghanistan, helping guide them towards Full Member status after taking the job in 2016 before being replaced by Phil Simmons earlier this year. He was also India's cricket manager when they triumphed at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, before taking charge of Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League a year later.
Rajput's first challenge in his new role will be Zimbabwe's triangular T20I series involving Australia and Pakistan in Harare in July.
