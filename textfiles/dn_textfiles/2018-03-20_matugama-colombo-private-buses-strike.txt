Matugama - Colombo private buses on strike

The drivers and conductors of private buses operating between Matugama and Colombo went on strike yesterday protesting the conduct of Dodangoda Police Traffic Branch in the Kalutara Police Division.
On Friday, a student who travelled in a private coach had fallen off the coach and had been rushed to the hospital. Subsequently, a group of people, who arrived at the scene, had caught the conductor and driver of the coach and assaulted them. The suspects had fled.
The private bus owners allege that Dodangoda Police had not conducted a proper inquiry to arrest the attackers. All Ceylon Private Bus Association President Gamunu Wijerathna said the strike would continue until the police arrest the suspects and produce them before court.
