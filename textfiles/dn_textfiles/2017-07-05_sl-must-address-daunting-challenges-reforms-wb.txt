SL must address daunting challenges with reforms - WB

Sri Lanka faces a number of challenges that increasingly put its future economic growth and stability at risk and thus must be addressed through determined reforms says the World Bank. Presenting its Sri Lana Development Update for 2017 in Colombo they say that these key challenges are inter - linked and require a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Adopting a piece - meal solution to address the challenges is unlikely to be successful.
External risks include disappointing growth performance in key countries that generate foreign exchange inflows to Sri Lanka: exports, tourism, remittances, FDI, private portfolio and official financing. Steeper than expected global financial conditions would increase the cost of debt and would make rolling over the maturing Eurobonds from 2019 more difficult.
Faster than expected rises in commodity prices would increase pressure on the balance of payments and make domestic fuel and electricity price reforms more difficult. A strong political will and support of the bureaucracy could help advancing the reform agenda. The World Bank see that the external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+ preferential access to European Union and rapidly growing tourism, although the drought could adversely impact exports and increase petroleum imports. Foreign capital inflows to government securities and FDI inflows will help closing the external financing needs with no Eurobond falling due in 2017.External buffers are projected to improve, with emphasis placed on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a more market- determined exchange rate, using monetary policy and the sale of selected government assets.
The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 5.2% of GDP for 2017 creating space for planned increase in public investment thanks to the impact of VAT changes in its first full year of implementation.
Further revenue - increasing policy measures along with improved tax administration will help increase revenues and reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. (SS)
