NCPA to introduce foster care system for orphans

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) is working on a proposal to revamp the current system of care rendered to orphaned children through a foster care system.
The NCPA stated that the foster care system will provide orphans with the opportunity of growing up in the care of a family rather than in an orphanage.
The system of servicing orphanages is outdated. It was initially introduced to Sri Lanka during the colonial period by the British. However, according to Child Protection Authority Chairperson Marini De Livera, that system is not currently prevailing in Britain now. She added that the NCPA has taken the initiative to find alternate methods of childcare. According to De Livera, the revamped system of childcare will be introduced in the near future to provide better and more holistic childcare to orphans.
