Smith wins second Allan Border medal

SYDNEY, Monday: Australia captain Steve Smith won his second Allan Border Medal on Monday, becoming the fifth player to claim the country’s highest individual cricket honour more than once.
Smith, who recently guided his team to a 4-0 Ashes triumph over England, joined Ricky Ponting (four times), Michael Clarke (four), Shane Watson (twice) and David Warner (twice) as a multiple winners of the award, Cricket Australia said on Monday.
The 28-year-old Smith, who scored his highest test score of 239 in the third match of the series against England in Perth, also picked up his second test player of the year award.
“I‘m pleased that I can be sitting here today and be recognised for what I’ve done over the year,” Smith said.
“I don’t play for these kind of awards, I play to try and help the team win and stand up as the leader of the side... It’s been a challenging year and I‘m proud of the way I have accomplished a few things,” he added.
