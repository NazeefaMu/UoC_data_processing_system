Officials attached to the Sri Lanka Railways Sudden Raids and Mobile Investigations Division, had recorded a revenue of Rs. 6,732,933 by way of fines from errant commuters through ticket inspections and raids carried out in trains, during the past four months of this year.
According to investigation officials, the total number of fines imposed on errant commuters during the period was 4,200. The said raids and inspections were conducted covering all three railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya and Anuradhapura.
