Rs. 7,000 million to develop Dambulla hospital

The Health Ministry has taken steps to develop Dambulla Base Hospital with all facilities on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Rs. 7,000 million had been estimated by the government for the purpose.
Patients from North Central and Eastern Provinces come to Dambulla Base Hospital for medical treatment. However, due to the lack of basic facilities in the hospital, the patients are inconvenienced.
Therefore, after completing this development project, people in over five districts will be benefitted, officers said.
On the request of Matale District SLFP organizer Kusumsiri Ariyarathna, the President has instructed relevant authorities to develop Dambulla Base Hospital.
