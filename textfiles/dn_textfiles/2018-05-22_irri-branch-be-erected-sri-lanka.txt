IRRI branch to be erected in Sri Lanka

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) had made arrangements to set up one of its branch offices in Sri Lanka, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Agriculture Ministry.
According to Minister Amaraweera, the ministry had recently signed an agreement with the intention of improving the country’s rice-related research activities.
IRRI had implemented a new concept of assisting Asian countries, in order to improve their research activities by setting up IRRI branches and appointing a resident scientist for each branch.
Furthermore, the said IRRI branch is scheduled to be set up in Bathalagoda.
Through the erection of the branch, Sri Lankan scientists would be able to share their knowledge with scientists in other countries and improve their knowledge on new technologies such as the hybridisation of rice varieties.
