Kings of Leon announce new tour dates

Kings of Leon have announced the first leg of their WALLS tour.
The rockers released their first album in more than three years on Friday (14Oct16), and later announced they would begin the first leg of their tour in January (17). The tour kicks off on 12 January in Maryland, and will continue throughout the month making stops in Boston, Toronto, Philadelphia, Toronto, Philadelphia, New York, Detroit, Chicago, Broomfield, and San Francisco, finishing on 28 January in Los Angeles, Entertainment Weekly reports.
They will then head to the U.K. for an arena tour for February 2017 calling at cities Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle, Liverpool and Glasgow. WALLS, which stands for We Are Like Love Songs, is a change of direction to their last offering, 2013's Mechanical Bull.
“There comes a point when you realize you've lost that passion and that hunger,” frontman Caleb Followill told Billboard.com about their new sound.
“You're chastened and want to get it back - and in order to get it back it's like, ‘Forget about record sales, forget about the size of the venue you're playing, forget about any of that stuff,'” he added.
Caleb previously revealed the new album will focus on personal experiences, including his model wife Lily Aldridge's experiences in a creepy Los Angeles hotel, and his own alcohol addiction, which forced him into rehab after the band scrapped a 2011 tour.
