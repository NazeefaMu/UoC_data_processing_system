Portrait in  leadership

The Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum lit up Thursday night with a collection of starpower not often seen in the nation’s capitol. The museum’s IMAX theater was the fitting venue for the premiere of Damien Chazelle’s Neil Armstrong biopic ‘First Man’, drawing a crowd of Hollywood heavyweights to DC — including stars Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy — and legendary members of the history-making braintrust that helped put two men on the moon in 1969.
At the museum’s entrance, the red carpet was rolled out in front of the iconic gold-foiled Lunar Module — a prototype of the one Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon in 1969 — for both the stars and the movie’s real life subjects, including Armstrong’s children and colleagues. Notably quiet were the film’s biggest stars: Gosling and Foy zoomed through crowd and discreetly exited shortly after the film, but not before posing for a quick photo op in the museum’s Apollo 11 exhibit.
“Thank you to the National Air and Space museum for fulfilling a childhood dream of mine of getting to show something on this screen,” said Chazelle in his short opening remarks, thanking both the actors and film crew as well as the legion of NASA engineers and consultants who helped bring this story to the screen with a painstaking amount of accuracy.
The film is based on the book of the same name by James R. Hansen, but the film’s production team spent a good deal of time researching additional details of story with primary sources, including Armstrong’s first wife Janet (who died in June, 2018) and his colleagues in the Gemini and Apollo space programs.
