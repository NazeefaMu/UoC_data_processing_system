Four member UNP committee to probe Vijayakala's speech

A four member committee had been appointed by the UNP to examine the statements made by former Child Affairs State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran.
The committee comprises of Ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Kabir Hashim, Ranjith Maddumabandara and Thalatha Athukorala.
An official from the UNP told the Daily News that the committee will issue a report regarding the minister’s statement. Meanwhile, the Colombo Chief Magistrate had issued an order to five media institutions to provide the unedited video clips of the said controversial speech for the CID to investigate.
Maheswaran addressing a government on Monday in Jafna stated that the Tamils need to bring back the LTTE in order to live freely and stressed that they were safer under the terrorist organization. The statement created uproar and the state minister handed over her resignation from her portfolio on Thursday.
