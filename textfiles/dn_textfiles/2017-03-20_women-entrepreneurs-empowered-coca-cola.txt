Women entrepreneurs  empowered by Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka organised an internal event for its executive staff on March 8.
Leading women entrepreneurs in Coca-Cola’s 5by20 network converged on the venue from diverse regions such as Negombo, Hambantota, Vavuniya and Kandy, to share their success stories.
The international theme ‘Be Bold for Change’ was very evident during this session, as the women recounted their personal struggles and how they took a bold step towards entrepreneurship for the well-being and future security of their loved ones.
The women entrepreneurs shared their experiences in overcoming economic crisis, physical disabilities and society pressures and norms, to become successful entrepreneurs, only because of the support and guidance they received from Coca-Cola’s 5by20 programme.
The 5by20 programme is conducted locally in partnership with Women in Management (WIM) in the form of Business Skills Development training programmes, which are customised to suit the training needs of different women.
The inspirational storytelling session was followed by the women entrepreneurs showcasing their products ranging from handmade, leather and cloth shoes and bags, organic jams and pickles, kurakkan based products and batik and wax creations.
Both male and female executives had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with the women entrepreneurs, and purchase their goods in support of their incredible journeys, their resourcefulness and creativity.
Commenting on the 5by20 experience, Nisha from Kandy said, “To be bold, what I believe is that every woman should have both discipline and strength. This strength will help us face obstacles and overcome any problem in life. The 5by20 initiative has given me the confidence to achieve my target.”
Coca-Cola, International Women’s Day 2017 was a week-long celebration with activities where both men and women could actively join hands in creating a more inclusive work environment, conducive to their needs and creating a culture that empowers women.
