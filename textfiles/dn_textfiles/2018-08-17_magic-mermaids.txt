Magic with Mermaids

One might think mermaids were mythical creatures created by children and the imaginations of great writers, but not so in Sri Lanka, where numerous sightings have been claimed over the centuries of half-woman-half-fish-like characters. Do a bit of digging and there are even some interesting unexplained photos of fishy human-like creatures lying on rocks - even one or two sightings far out to sea - if you talk to the coastal fishermen. One hotelier, who probably also loved the 1980s film with hotter than hot Daryl Hannah playing the mermaid in ‘Splash’, decided to create a beautiful property, overlooking the ocean, in the holy of holies, Kalutara, with two swimming pools, with a separate fantastic games area, including water polo, croquet and pumping daily water aerobics. For those of you who do not want to pump up the action, you can also relax and enjoy the SPA treatments, which include having your face covered in green tea and, henceforth, looking years younger as it puts the elasticity back into the skin.
Here at The Mermaid Hotel by Jetwing, staff, some of which have been with the property for 26 years, pride themselves on repeat bookings because here relaxation is a way of life and mermaids do really exist. Well, if you believe the barman who serves up a lethal mermaid cocktail at sunset, with floating fruit pieces that look like coral the colour of a mermaid - greeny blue and totally delicious. The barman, Prasanna, with the cheekiest of grins, also has the power of magic at his finger tips and, with a well-worn Sports Direct stack of playing cards, will have you bewildered as to how he does it. “Pick a card anywhere in the pack”, he says cheekily. He then names every single one of the cards, even moving the pack to different places and shuffling them several times. Suddenly, I realised I was in the world that lies between the known and the unknown. The magical journey of tricks includes a cocktail shaker, which you can bang on anything you like to see if it has a concealed compartment inside - once checked a coin vanishes from the bar and seconds later is found inside the sealed container.
Is this real magic or the result of drinking the arrak-based coconut cocktail with fresh passion fruit juice, blue syrup and fresh pineapple, mixed with a bit of sliced mango to make it refreshing? It is hardly surprising, after a couple of these delicious drinks, that people have claimed to have seen mermaids on the beach, and part of the fun of being at the hotel is trying to find one. Twice a week, a local artist takes master classes, for the kids, in drawing and painting in the main pavilion, which they love, as they get to sketch and paint mermaids or passing whales - another theme popular with those staying at the resort.
Every morning, after a delicious breakfast overlooking the pool, one can check the board for the day’s activities and events, along with using the gym and all the other facilities managed by the hotel’s three energetic motivators. I do an energetic water keep-fit session at 11 am and can see, as I jump up and down, what fun it all is. I realise, talking to people in the afternoon tea snack area, that this is just one of the many reasons that the place has so many repeat bookings, along with great food, and staff like to have ‘a giraffe’ laugh as they put it in cockney rhyming slang.
The hotel also organises excellent city and temple tours and, on your return, they love you to indulge in the in-house ‘The Sahana Spa’, where you can have an energizing massage or full body treatment for removing the day’s impurities and opening up any blockages caused by stress in the body. The SPA team has also worked together for more than eight years and, even travelling long distances to and from work, can’t imagine working anywhere else, as they love the spirit of the place. It is like an extension of their community, which the guests feel when they are doing yoga overlooking the beach or bending it like Beckham with a spot of tropical football. Kids love the way the staff get them treats, let them run free and are always on hand to teach them fun new activities while mum has a manicure or a romantic candle-lit dinner of lobster on the beach or by the main pool before heading to the in-house disco.
The Mermaid Hotel by Jetwing loves to do creative things whether it is one off dinners, weddings, birthday parties with a twist or group hires. I am amazed, with so many hotels to pick from in the area, that so many people have returned ten, twelve and, in one case, fifteen times. That, in itself, speaks volumes about the personality of this stand-out holiday destination.
So, you have fun, get fitter, eat great food, and see mermaids – well, if you are prepared to do one of the master art classes twice a week.
