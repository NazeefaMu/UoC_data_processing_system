GMOA to strike again on SAITM issue

An indefinite island-wide strike will be carried out by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with the Anti SAITM People's Barricade after September 15 if the Government fails to resolve the issue soon, GMOA Media Committee Member Dr. Prasad Kolambage said.
He was addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo on Monday.
Prasad said an anti SAITM vehicle parade would take place covering the entire country and it would reach Colombo on September 15.
The final protest against the SAITM prior to the island-wide strike would take place on September 15 at the Lipton Circus, Colombo on the same day, he said.
Dr. Kolambage said the SAITM issue must be solved by the Government without delay.
"Over 90 percent of the committee appointed by the President comprises pro SAITM individuals who openly supported the SAITM before. One is Prof. Mohan De Silva. Therefore, a solution for the issue will not be given in this way," he said.
The Government came into power promising good governance and action against corruption and malpractices. Former Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe clearly stated that the Health Ministry was utterly corrupt before his removal from the post," he said.
