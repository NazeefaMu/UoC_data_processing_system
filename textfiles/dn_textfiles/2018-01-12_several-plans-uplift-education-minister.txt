Several plans to uplift education: Minister

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the government was prepared to do its utmost to uplift education in the country.
The minister said from next year, his ministry has plans to finish exam paper marking during the holiday month itself, so as not to disrupt education at schools which are selected as paper marking centres.
He added that a Cabinet paper will be brought to increase the amount paid for teachers who engage in paper marking.
The minister was speaking at the national school textbooks distribution ceremony held yesterday (11) at D. S. Senanayake College, Colombo.
The minister said, “The number of subjects for the Ordinary Level Examination will be reduced to six subjects from next year to minimize the pressure on Ordinary Level students.”
“The ministry assessed the current subjects according to a practical and developed method and planned to restructure the content and the syllabus to make a significant change,” he said.
Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, Educational Publication Department Commissioner General I. M. K. B. Illangasinghe, D. S. Senanayaka College Principal R. M. M. Rathnayaka, Commissioner General of Examinations Sanath B. Pujitha and National Institute of Education Director Dr. Jayanthi Gunasekara participated.
