Sri Lanka lacks  mechanism to bring  out youths: PM

Sri Lanka lacked a mechanism to bring out the youth at grass roots level, who have exceptional talents in many fields, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said the youth have multitude of talents in various fields.
The Prime Minister said he has directed the Youth Services Council and the State Minister concerned to put in place a mechanism to bring the talented youths to the limelight devoid of any political interference.
He was speaking at the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Awards (DofE) at Temple Trees yesterday. The awards programme is effective in 16 districts. It will be extended to other districts soon.
The Prime Minister said the programme equips the youth to face life. It plays a critical role in a young person’s personal development by preparing them to take up challenges, he said.
The programme comprising adventures, recreation, skills and service will help produce youth leaders at grass roots level, he said.
The Prime Minister said the programme will be implemented islandwide gradually.
“We want to integrate the youth into country’s development drive by unearthing exceptional talents within them," he said.
