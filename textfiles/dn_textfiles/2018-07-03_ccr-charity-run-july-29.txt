CCR Charity Run on July 29

Colombo City Running (CCR) is hosting a 10km run on Sunday, July 29, 2018, to raise awareness and funds for the Army Para Athletic Association.
Kicking off at 6:30 a.m., on Sunday, July 29, 2018, the route of the run will mirror the running leg of the Colombo Ironman in October 2017, which encompassed a start from Galle Face Green and followed the Port Breakwater with a return along the same path.
Additionally, CCR is providing an option of a much shorter, 5km run for those so inclined.
A community-based recreational running group, CCR aims to promote a healthy lifestyle through running while also helping build a communal spirit and connection through running-related activities. Partners for the event include Asiri Hospitals, Galle Face Hotel, Anim8, Yes FM and RBN and SIS energy drinks. With Vision Care, Zesta Tea, Wurth Sri Lanka and Child Eye Clinic being sponsors.
