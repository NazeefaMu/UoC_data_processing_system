New technology driving scramble for shipwreck treasure

US: The Spanish galleon San Jose was overloaded with 200 passengers and 700 tons of cargo on a summer night in 1631 when it smashed into a rock off the Pacific coast of Panama, spilling silver coins and bars into the Gulf of Panama. More than 400,000 coins and at least 1417 bars were lost over a 65 kilometre trail.
Four hundred years later, that shipwreck has become one of the latest to land in a legal quagmire over who should have the rights to historic artifacts trapped under the sea. This one involves the United Nations, the US Department of Homeland Security, the government of Panama and Americans accused of being pirates. At issue is whether private companies should be able to claim and profit from historic treasures.
Those questions are of particular interest to businesses in South Florida at a time when technology is making it easier to find and recover sunken loot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that there are more than 1000 shipwrecks in the Florida Keys alone.
In the case of the San Jose booty, commercial treasure hunters, financed in part by an adventure entrepreneur who runs tours to the Titanic, spent over $US2 million ($2.75 million) and 10 years recovering portions of the treasure, only to see their permits questioned and bounty confiscated.
"They called us thieves, looters, plunderers and pirates," said Dan Porter, a Florida captain who led the expedition to find the San Jose. "That's an insult. I hold this work in the highest regard."
But the industry is engaged in a battle with academic marine archaeologists and UNESCO, the Paris-based UN agency that tries to protect cultural treasures around the world. Critics say buried coins and loot should be studied and preserved in a museum, not sported around an investor's neck.
"Treasure hunters are to maritime archaeologists what astrologers are to astronomers," said Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A&M University.
The Department of Homeland Security has opened an investigation into the case, and several criminal complaints are pending in Panama. Those actions underscore the perils that often accompany maritime salvage recovery, particularly as nations become increasingly sensitive to the cultural significance of underwater treasures.
In the colonial era, Spain sent fleets to the new world to excavate gold and silver from places like Bolivia and Peru, but hurricanes and other mishaps often sent ships and the gold they carried to unreachable depths.
Pirates and plunderers have long sought to recover them. As technology to find them has improved in recent decades, many legitimate companies have begun hunting, too, only to find their discoveries challenged in court.
Panama was so committed to preventing plundering that in 2003, it became among the first countries to sign a UN treaty protecting underwater cultural heritage. But at the same time, Panama's Ministry of Economy and Finance granted a contract giving salvage rights along its waters to a company called Investigaciones Marinas del Istmo, or IMDI.
Investors included a former Panamanian governor; a Mexican-American engineer; Mike McDowell, an Australian adventure entrepreneur; and - for a different IMDI salvage project - Pat Croce, a former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.
IMDI spent about 10 years fighting legal challenges. The company prevailed, and, with permits and court verdicts in hand, the subaquatic dig for the San Jose went on. Panamanian government inspectors supervised the project, and a "world class" conservation lab was built to log and preserve each discovery, the company said.
Among other items, divers found gold and diamond jewellery, pottery, and nearly 10,000 silver coins, worth up to $US1000 each. Only one 60-pound silver bar was recovered. Based on the contract, the government got to keep anything it considered historically relevant, plus 35 percent of everything else.
Some Panamanian government officials objected to the deal and brought in UNESCO, which sent a task force to Panama to review the project. Excavation stopped. Even after the haul was divided and the government received its share, the country's comptroller noted a number of irregularities in the contract, questioned its validity and requested an investigation into how it had been obtained. - NEW YORK TIMES
