Towards a peaceful poll

Now that the long drawn out sense of suspense over the fate of Parliament has abated, the House dissolved and the date of elections announced it behoves on all parties in the present drama to act with responsibility until polling day and also thereafter. Needless to say, the political imbroglio had caused a paralysis of the nation with little or no work done in State institutions and Government offices, what with top officials waiting with bated breath for the final outcome. The stalemate also, no doubt, would have frightened away would be investors since no foreign entrepreneur would want to invest in a country going through a volatile political transition.
Hence, the Government should act fast in calming fears while clearing all hurdles that stand in the way of the economy moving forward. Above all, order should be restored in all spheres of activity in the administration so that the Government machinery would function smoothly. In this respect President Maithripala Sirisena did right when he told Government Officials at a meeting in Polonnaruwa last week to execute their duties and functions without being distracted by the current developments. He also told the SLFP/SLPP affiliated trade union representatives to desist from any unruly behaviour and misconduct in their places of work.
Now that all the Ministers in the caretaker Government have been sworn in, no time should be lost in getting down to business since all activities in the ministries, no doubt, would have ceased to function with the previous incumbents having to vacate their posts. Since all Government ministers represent a single political entity there is bound to be consensus and agreement on all the decisions taken, unlike in the past where the two sides were at variance on policy matters.
The President, no doubt, would now be at ease that his orders and decisions to ministers for the benefit of the people will not be countermanded as in the past. This resulted in the people turning against the Yahapalanaya Government as shown by the February 10 LG poll results. President Sirisena should also lose no time in getting all stalled work on the development front activated. Whatever positive work that was commenced by the previous Government should not be abandoned, wholesale, but an evaluation made and where necessary the work continued with.
Also the President, who is now in charge of law enforcement, should ensure that peace prevails in the days leading up the election. This is because this poll will be a heated affair, with both sides going all out to secure a majority in Parliament judging by the rhetoric since October 26. There is also the need to ensure the present political climate will not be used by unruly elements to break the law and engage in acts of destruction. We say this because there is no dearth of subjects in this country who seek to fish in troubled waters and wreak havoc.
The UNP which, no doubt, is still smarting from the double whammy of the sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the dissolution of Parliament- should now stop complaining and get ready to face the hustings. After all, the 19th Amendment was the sole brainchild of the UNP and the President was kept out of the loop. If they (UNP) left any lacuna in it that gave the President a way out, then it has only itself to blame.
The President has acted well within the Constitution in replacing Wickremesinghe and terminating Parliament. Independent legal experts have confirmed this fact. The 19th Amendment is clear on the course of action the Executive could take in the event of a constitutional gridlock. It is pointless for the UNP to cry foul now.
The Greens are set to challenge the President’s action in the Supreme Court. We are not speculating on the outcome, but should the ruling go against the UNP its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should gracefully accept it and vacate Temple Trees. The official residence that was graced by leaders such as D.S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kothalawela, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike et al. has been desecrated enough by the riffraff who had lain siege on it since October 26.
Wickremesinghe, who is spoken of as a gentlemanly politician even by his opponents, should not allow this honourific sullied by permitting this rather childish drama. He is not only doing a disservice to himself but also bringing the country to ridicule in the eyes of the international community by his conduct. Here is a four time Prime Minister of Sri Lanka refusing to budge from his official residence after being constitutionally deposed. Can anything be more bizarre?
Elections have been called and Wickremesinghe has the opportunity to return to Temple Trees, if that indeed is the people’s wish and also if he indeed will be the choice of the party to lead it. If so, he would rather be best advised to get started on his election campaign right away, since he has a lot of catching up to do.
