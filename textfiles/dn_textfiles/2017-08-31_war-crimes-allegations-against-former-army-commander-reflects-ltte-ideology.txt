War crimes allegations against former Army Commander reflects LTTE ideology still prevailing

The war crimes allegation levelled against former Army Commander General Jagath Jayasuriya, who also served as the Ambassador to Brazil, reflects that LTTE ideology still prevails despite its defeat militarily, said Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne yesterday.
Responding to a query by a journalist during the Cabinet briefing, the Brigadier refuted allegations levelled against General Jagath Jayasuriya.
He also added that baseless allegations had been made against military personnel since the end of the war in 2009.
“The recent lawsuit filed against former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya, reflects that LTTE ideology still prevailed though it was defeated militarily in the country,” he said. Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said they would continue to take legal action against specific allegations levelled against military personnel based on evidence.
“However, not all killings and everything that took place during the war are violations of human rights,” Minister Senaratne said.
"They think all killings during the war against the terrorists was human rights violations. But it was an operation against terrorists."
