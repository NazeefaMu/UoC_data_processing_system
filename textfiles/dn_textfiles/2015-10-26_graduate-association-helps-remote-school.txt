Graduate association helps remote school

Nagalawewa primary school in Dambulla is an underprivileged school with bare minimum necessities.
About 67 students attend the school and the authorities have paid scant attention to its pressing problems. Against all odds Principal Jayarathna Suriyagoda and his staff are dedicated to develop the school. Meanwhile several volunteer organizations had provided many facilities to the school.
One such organisation - Central Provincial Branch of Colombo University Old Graduate Association - offered school equipment including uniforms for the children at a ceremony held recently at the school.
Biyagama North Lions Club had donated musical instruments for the school band group at the occasion.The principal said, many well-wishers and philanthropists had made valuable donations earlier to develop the school. The service rendered by the Central Provincial Branch of Colombo University Old Graduate Association and Biyagama North Lions Club are commendable acts as the school was in dire need of the items received. In future, I expect further assistance to improve this school, he added.
The chairman of the old graduate association H. R. Senavirathna, secretary K. W. G. Weerasingha, the members of the association and Biyagama North Lions Club President Luksiri Paranamana also attended.
School staff in collaboration with the villagers offered a lunch for the participants.
