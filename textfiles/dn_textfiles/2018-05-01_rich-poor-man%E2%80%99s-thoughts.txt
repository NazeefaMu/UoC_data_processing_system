Rich in poor man’s thoughts

Ranasinghe Premadasa was the first Sri Lankan leader to emerge from the working class, with all his predecessors having represented the aristocratic class. This put him in a unique position vis-à-vis the common people, whose problems he could immediately identify. He did not need the advice of ministers and officials to understand the problems faced by the common masses. He did not want to rule from an air-conditioned room in Colombo and was very much a hands-on Prime Minister and President.
Once he became Prime Minister in 1978, Premadasa lost no time in seeking solutions to two of the biggest problems that existed in the country back then: abject poverty and the dearth of housing. Two of the most endearing – and enduring – programmes of the 1977 UNP Government came out as his plans for these sectors – the poverty eradication programme, later to be called Janasaviya (Strength of the Masses) and the Village Re-Awakening Programme, which later became known as Gam Udawa. The Village Reawakening Programme was launched in the 1980s with the principle that shelter is fundamental to people's physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. His aim was to build one million houses eventually.
The very first “Udaa Gama” or Re-wakened Village was opened in Badalgama, which was a poor village in Yapahuwa electorate, Kurunegala district. Each village was given an appropriate name that evoked something special about the area, such as “Isuru Gama” for Village of Prosperity. He personally went to each opening ceremony, apart from the occasions when he was abroad on official business or indisposed.
Champion of the poor
President Premadasa always reached out to uplift the living conditions of the poor
President Premadasa rightly earned a reputation as a champion of the poor due to his commitment to the Gam Udawa programme. Gam Udawa will forever be associated with the name of President Premadasa and indeed, his son Sajith is passionately carrying forward the Gam Udawa programme under the Government’s Vision 2025 concept after a re-launch in 2016. Thus the first Gam Udawa village to be opened in 22 years was vested with the people in Weli Oya in that year.
The Gam Udawa concept was rather simple. Officials identified the poorest families in a given village who had no housing facilities. A proper land area was identified and developed. Then the Government, through the Housing Ministry, stepped in to build 25-50 housing units with all facilities for these families at the given location. The construction phase itself was a collective effort of the whole village. While the Government supplied the funds and earthmoving/construction machinery, the villagers themselves had to get together to build each house using their time and labour. This brought the entire village together, enhancing their bonds of friendship. This is how the Gam Udawa concept works to this day.
Gama Hada Rata Hadamu
Seen in this light, the very meaning of Gam Udawa becomes clear – it is not only about housing, but also about developing the whole village through a purely voluntary effort. He also popularized another slogan – Gama Hada Rata Hadamu (Let’s Build the Village to Build the Nation), which highlighted the place of the village in the overall development effort. A Gam Udawa exhibition was held in each district once a year to showcase the Government’s housing and other development programmes.
Gam Udawa gained international recognition rapidly and several other countries emulated the programme with success. In fact, the United Nations recognizes President Premadasa as one of the Asian pioneers of the Shelter for All programmes. It was President Premadasa who proposed at the United Nations, to declare an International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. The proposal was unanimously accepted at the 37th session of the United Nations General Assembly and the year 1987 was declared as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. The Gam Udawa concept was recognized globally by the United Nations for its outstanding contribution to human progress.
Gam Udawa became immensely popular as it addressed one of the most basic requirements of the people. The shelter has been recognised as basic human right globally and Gam Udawa was a movement that sought to address the housing shortage. President Premadasa was keen to see all slum dwellers in Colombo resettled in their own houses, in single houses or multi-storeyed flats. While this has still not happened completely, he laid the foundation for better housing conditions for the slum dwellers.
Massive development programmes
Innovative development efforts: Garment factories were set up to improve the quality of life of the poor
Housing was just a part of his multi-pronged strategy for development. He was deeply affected by the popular slogan “Kolambata Kiri Apita Kekiri” (Milk for Colombo, Pumpkin for outstations) that arose from the embers of the 1988-89 insurrection and sought to address other inequalities that created a huge gulf between the city and the village. He was instrumental in launching many other welfare measures such as free school uniforms. He knew that the path to development and poverty alleviation lay through education for all children. He also laid the groundwork for a massive water supply, infrastructure and urban development programme that covered the entire island.
The one other thing that brought him closer to the people was his oratorical skill. Gam Udawa took him to all four corners of the island (except perhaps the North which was cut off due to the conflict after 1983) where he invariably addressed Jana Hamuwas (public meetings) after each event. He had the unique ability to speak directly to the hearts and minds of residents of any given area, identifying their wants and strengths. He would sometimes speak for over an hour but every word had a purpose. Having covered many of his meetings for the Daily News, I recall that there was something new to write every day.
Conversant in Tamil
He was keen to address the Tamil speaking communities in that language and learned Tamil, but used an interpreter to make it more engaging to the audience. Once, his interpreter made a mistake, but before any of the Tamil-speaking Ministers present on stage could point it out, he told the interpreter that his translation was wrong and asked him to give the correct meaning.
On another occasion, another speaker was taking a bit too long. Someone came up to the stage and gave him a chit, which obviously was to ask him to cut the speech short. When his turn to speak came, President Premadasa recalled that he too faced a similar experience in his ministerial days when someone gave him a chit that simply said: “stop the speech now.” Knowing very well that everyone in the audience practically knew what the chit was about, he has simply said: “I just got a chit that tells me to speak longer and make it even more interesting. But unfortunately, I have to go to another meeting and I will stop my speech now”. That showed his ability to adapt to any situation, but even more importantly, his sense of humour. He always peppered his speeches with a joke or anecdote that sent ripples of laughter among the audience. His speeches were thus never boring or uninteresting.
He felt right at home in both palatial mansions of the rich city folk and daub and wattle huts of poor villagers. It is in the latter that he felt the pulse of the common people and listened to their grievances. He made it a habit to speak to the villagers and accept their letters wherever he went however trivial their requests were. He freely mingled with the crowds wherever he went despite the advice of his security detail – which would ultimately cost his life on May 1, 1993.
An avid reader of newspapers, he took note of news items on various shortcomings in villages (dilapidated roads, lack of community halls, lack of school facilities etc) and urged officials to take immediate remedial action. This earned him a reputation as an action-oriented leader and many ministers and officials learned to be ready with answers well before the Presidential call came early in the morning.
That was the hallmark of President Premadasa. He wanted concrete action, not idle talk. Naturally, this kept ministers and officials on their toes and ensured that the whole country could enjoy the dividends of accelerated development. He did not believe in Colombo-centric development and urged his ministers and MPs to go to their villages and identify projects/ideas worth funding. His life was tragically cut short before some of the goals he envisaged (such as one million houses) could be realised, but 25 years from his assassination, his legacy still lives on in the hearts and minds of Sri Lankans everywhere.
