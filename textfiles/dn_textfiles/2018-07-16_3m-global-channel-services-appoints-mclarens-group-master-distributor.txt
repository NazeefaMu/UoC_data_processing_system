3M Global Channel Services appoints  McLarens Group as master distributor

McLarens Group has entered into a collaboration with 3M Global Channel Services (GCS) as the Master Distributor of 3M’s complete line of products relating to their Industrial Business Group (IBG), Safety & Graphics Business Group (SGBG), Electronics & Energy Business Group (EEBG) and Consumer Business Group (CBG).
McLarens Group is a well-established diversified conglomerate in shipping, marine and logistics, and is a pioneer in the shipping industry of Sri Lanka. It is the partner of choice for several multinationals with commercial interests in the island. While shipping, marine services and logistics remain at the heart of the group, the company has established a lead market presence in bunkering, oil and gas services, manufacturing, lubricants trading and distribution, property development, hotel and leisure services and other strategic investments.
The day-to-day operations of this partnership will be handled through McLarens Lubricants Limited, a subsidiary of McLarens Group, which is also the authorized distributor of Mobil Lubricants in Sri Lanka.
The move would further strengthen the group’s distribution business, and its strategy of consolidating partnerships with leading global brands.
“We are pleased to partner with 3M Global Channel Services. Together with the innovative solutions provided by 3M and McLarens, coupled with our in-depth knowledge and expertise in the local market, we see a great potential for growth in these industries in the not too distant future”, said Dinesh Jayawardana, Jt. Managing Director, McLarens Group.
A recognized leader in research and development, 3M produces thousands of innovative products for dozens of diverse markets. 3M’s core strength is applying its 46 distinct technology platforms – often in combination – to a wide array of customer needs. With $32 billion in sales, 3M employs 90,000 people worldwide and operates through 70 subsidiaries serving customers in more than 200 countries.
“This partnership enhances the solutions that we offer to our dealer network and ensures that they will be able to provide superior products and a strong portfolio of brands such as Post-it, Scotch, along with various 3M Auto Care Products and services to the end users”, said Shehara Jayawardana, Jt. Managing Director, McLarens Group.
“Adding 3M’s technology to our already strong portfolio, ensures a much wider range of products specifically in the industrial and automotive industries, providing nothing but the very best to our customers.”
Debarati Sen, Managing Director, 3M Lanka said, “We are proud to announce our formal partnership with McLarens Group for our industrial, automotive, safety, energy and consumer businesses who are known in Sri Lanka for their professionalism, island wide presence and scale. Together we look forward to a seamless transition and continued commitment to our customers in Sri Lanka”.
