Human - elephant conflict:‘Protect both parties’

The human - elephant conflict in Sri Lanka is another type of war. This conflict should be overcome by protecting and safeguarding both parties involved, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Field Marshal Fonseka made this observation when he spoke to the media during an observation tour undertaken in Sooriyawewa - an area worst affected by the human-elephant conflict, recently.
Field Marshal Fonseka said the responsibility of the Wildlife Ministry was to protect and conserve wildlife. The biggest problem in this subject area is the problem concerning elephants. "The elephant herd is a national asset. Elephants cannot be conserved without resolving the human - elephant conflict. This problem had assumed national proportions, he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said certain environmentalists in Colombo are unaware that the elephant is a fearsome animal. Others talk about using an elephant collar to keep animals under surveillance to learn about their whereabouts. These are not practical. The solution to the problem is the segregation of elephants and people by erecting fences. He said the most fearsome elephants rounded up are being relocated in the Horowpothana area. However, the two electrified fences available there are not strong enough. Therefore, those fences should to be further strengthened. A sustainable solution should be found for the human - elephant conflict without trying piecemeal solutions, he added.
Therefore, erecting strong electrified fences is a must. Farmers cannot be called upon to look after the fence.
There should be a cadre of legally responsible persons to protect and safeguard the electrified fences, Field Marshal Fonseka said.
