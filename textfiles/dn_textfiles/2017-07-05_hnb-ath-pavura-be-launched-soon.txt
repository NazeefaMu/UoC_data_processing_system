HNB Ath Pavura to be launched soon

HNB Ath Pavura is a new weekly reality TV show coming soon on ITN, Sri Lanka’s leading television channel, and is brought to you by Lanka Impact Investing Network and Social Enterprise Lanka, in partnership with Horizon Campus.
Ath Pavura is Sri Lanka's first television show to promote Social Entrepreneurship and Impact Investment through an exciting reality TV show format.
Social Enterprises are businesses that are solving social and environmental problems through creative business models and innovative products and services.
They are self-sustainable because they earn revenue and generate profit. Charities and donor-funded NGOs as well as purely profit driven companies are not considered as social enterprises. “Our vision is to build a thriving Social Enterprise sector in Sri Lanka by 2025. Ath Pavura is a giant step in our journey.
The purpose of Ath Pavura is to find and promote social entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. It’s the best opportunity for entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka to promote their innovative solutions to social and environmental problems on television and inspire many more aspiring future social entrepreneurs,” said Eranda Ginige, Founder of Social Enterprise Lanka.
Impact Investors are the new generation of investors who are willing to invest their money, time and resources in social entrepreneurs expecting a financial return as well as a measured social impact.
“Any economic development for any country entrepreneurs and enterprises are the key driving force.
Not only for products and service development for the economy but also for economic enrichment through employment generation entrepreneurs and enterprises are dynamics of the eco system. Ath Pauvra is an initiative of a ‘GAME CHANGE ‘in the financial services market in Sri Lanka directing entrepreneur
s towards more sustainable, scalable and commercially viable enterprises that can impact the society and the environment. Further Ath Pauvra is platform and place of meeting of the mind of Social Entrepreneurs and the impact investors of Sri Lanka,” said Chandula Abeywickrema, Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Network.
“As the pioneer TV station of the country and the channel which is having the widest coverage, we are proud to join hands with this concept. We changed the culture of the reality show by ‘Youth with Talent’ and we have identified new skills of the Sri Lankan youth from that programme and created new job opportunities of the country as well as outside. So with this experience we hope to build a new era of television history which would benefit the Sri Lankan economy as well from this programme,” Chandana Thilakarathna, CEO, Independent Television Network.
Ath Pavura is designed to create opportunities for Lankan Social Entrepreneurs to promote their business, products and services on television, and to pitch their new social business idea or an existing social business in order to secure investment money as venture capital.
