SLPP leader tried to  change country’s  unitary status: Minister

Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said Prof. G. L. Peiris, the leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), has suggested thrice that the unitary status of the country be removed from the Constitution.
While drafting three new Constitutions in 1995, 1997 and 2000, Prof. Peiris removed the unitary status from the drafts. Besides, Peiris further suggested that the clause, which gives priority to Buddhism, be removed from those three drafts of the Constitution.
“That is how he behaved and acted. Peiris tried to remove the unitary status from the Constitution on three occasions. It is amazing that he now talks about the unitary status of the country and priority for Buddhism,” he said.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Speaking on the political behaviour of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Perera said people do not trust the SLPP as it is backed by Basil Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa, who are mainly responsible for the SLFP defeat in 2015.
During Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime, true SLFP parliamentarians were sidelined. But persons who crossed over were welcomed by offering various benefits including portfolios, he said.
“Even now the situation is unchanged as outsiders such as Udaya Gammanpila, Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa etc. are given priority while the true SLFPers are sidelined,” he said.
State Minister Perera said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee will decide whether this unity government goes any further after the forthcoming election.
He added that it can be observed that there is a hidden agenda between the SLPP and the UNP regarding the election.
He said the majority of the United National Party (UNP) members are against fraud and corruption and therefore, they are intent on getting the name of the party cleared.
Perera added that even though the forthcoming election is not a General Election, moves can be taken by the people to change the Prime Minister with the election. According to the Constitution, the power of appointing the Prime Minister is vested with the President but it is up to the people to cast votes in favour of the SLFP to strengthen the President who could take a decision in connection with the appointment of the Prime Minister.
The Minister said the President will take up the responsibility of creating a new Constitution and handling the country’s economy soon after the election.
