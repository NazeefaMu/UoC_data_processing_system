100,000 eye lenses distributed this year

A total of 100,000 eye lenses were imported and distributed among state hospitals this year.The requirement of the eye lenses for next year, 2018, is around 150,000. Arrangements have been made to perform eye surgeries at state hospitals after 4 pm, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the number of patients who seek the services of state hospitals for eye surgeries had gone up due to free eye lenses offered to them from state hospitals.
The minister was addressing the gathering after launching a special programme to conduct eye surgeries for 150 elderly patients.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that eye surgeries will be performed at state hospitals after 4 pm to meet the high demand. The service of retired eye surgeons will be obtained and eye surgeries will be conducted at Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital, Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital and private hospitals. A mobile eye surgery unit will also be used.
Under the new programme, several elderly eye patients from the Bulathsinhala area underwent eye (cataract) surgeries.
The patients thanked Minister Senaratne for providing eye lenses free of charge.
