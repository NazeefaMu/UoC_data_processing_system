Sri Lankan waves to hit shores of Dubai

Sri Lanka’s only natural rubber flip flop now available in UAE
As a step of such expansion, Waves introduced its brand to the UAE in November 2016. Felicitating the establishment of the brand in the new market, the official launch happened recently at La Ola, Kite Beach in Dubai.
Waves flip flops are available across all lulu department stores in the UAE. The stores include three in Abu Dhabi, namely in Mushriff, Madinat Zayed and Khalidiya; and in Al Barsh and Qusais in Dubai.
The entrance to the Arabian market is an addition to the already existing brand presence in the Maldives and Seychelles, which reiterates Waves’ commitment to build a sound international platform for the local brand.
The only natural rubber flip flop in the local market, Waves is entirely crafted from genuine Sri Lankan rubber.
The rubber which is used as raw material as well as the complete process of production from harvesting, treatment to crafting, is done with total compliance to quality and health requirements.
The flip flops are battered to a special recipe to provide ultimate comfort, which makes Waves unique and popular among the users.
The softness of the rubber sole, composition of rubber content and use of modern skills have aided the brand to provide an authentic, playful and snugly product with a vibrant spirit, capturing the true tropical Sri Lankan vibe.
