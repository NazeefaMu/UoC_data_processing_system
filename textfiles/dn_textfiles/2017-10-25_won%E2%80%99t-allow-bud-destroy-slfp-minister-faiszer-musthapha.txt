Won’t allow a bud to destroy SLFP - Minister Faiszer Musthapha

“This country’s history has proved that no one who tried to break up a party has succeeded. This will be the fate of the Pohottuwa political Party,” Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party which can be compared to a giant tree cannot be destroyed by a bud. All the members of Pohottuwa are children of the SLFP. I call upon them not to commit sins by becoming traitors to their mother, Musthapha said when he opened a medical camp at Lenagala Vidyalaya on October 22.
“Some individuals try to use religion to gain political mileage. Religion and religious dogma are personal. Selling religion and dogma for personal profit is not a good thing. Selling ones religion for political gain is one of the most foolish things that a person could do,” Musthapha said.
The Minister said that those who oppose the opening of places of religious worship are silent when taverns are opened. In this world any person can be fed with racist ideas. However, the Sinhala Buddhist people who are well known for their sense of gratitude cannot be fed with racist ideas for narrow political gain. Musthapha also said that he has not seen any other race of people who are filled with compassion and love and the Buddhist way of life is not limited only to the Buddhists.
The Minister engaged in inspections of development projects that are taking place in the Homagama District after obtaining the blessings of the Maha Sanga at the Lenagala Rajamaha Viharaya. He then met students of Homagama Godagama Technical College and inquired into their grievances. He also declared open the Homagama Lenagala Road and Samagi Mawatha which were constructed under the 1000 Km Rural Road Development program, inspected the Kompayahena Road which is being carpeted under the allocations of the Minister and held discussions with the people of the area.
Musthapha said “SLFP is no single persons property and if the Party is protected everyone is protected. This is the responsibility of all the Party members. The Marriage of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom party is one that has occurred due to the wishes of the people and this marriage will last till 2020. However, after 2020 it is the wish of the people to usher in a SLFP government. Some persons are carrying out a campaign to split SLFP and at an Election this will be advantageous to the UNP. We will never allow the Pohottuwa Party to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.”
Rs. 15 million has been allocated to develop the Wilfred Senanayake Stadium which is in the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha area and this Stadium was declared open by Minister Faiszer Musthapha on the request of the former Chairman Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha and the Coordinating Secretary of the Minister, Indika Koralage.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and Speaker and Western Provincial Council member Hector Bethamge were also present.
