Ruhuna University closed

The University of Ruhuna was temporarily closed following a tense situation between students and villagers. Several clashes had taken place between the students and the villagers following a protest by the students on February 1.
The students had blocked the roads while burning tyres inconveniencing the villagers. An angry villager had assaulted a student who was hospitalised with injuries.
The students had retaliated by assaulting a youth from the village who too sustained injuries and was admitted to the Matara hospital. The University administration closed the University temporarily after the incidents. All students had been told to vacate the premises.
