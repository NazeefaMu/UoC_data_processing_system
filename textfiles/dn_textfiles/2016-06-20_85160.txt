‘Be Fit Sri Lanka’ at Arcade Independence Square

VG Eventz has taken the initiative in organizing ‘Be Fit Sri Lanka’ health and fitness event which is a “first of its kind”, to be held on 9 July from 7.00 am – 5.00 pm at the Arcade, Independence Square, Colombo 7. The focus would be on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for individuals and families.
VG Eventz is planning to conduct this program in other community locations across the country, namely Kandy, Negombo and Galle. “Be Fit Sri Lanka” will also showcase areas relating to fitness, nutrition and sustaining healthy habits.
A healthy population is a boon to any country and in today’s hectic, stress-filled, fast paced lifestyle, staying fit and healthy both in mind and body is of paramount importance. Exercise and nutrition play a vital role in enhancing physical and mental health in an individual, which in turn assist in boosting his or her self-confidence and creating a positive, dynamic and vibrant personality.
Participants can register free of charge for the event, which will commence with a warm-up, followed by a walk, run and 3km cycling spree. They can also be involved in a variety of other activities such as Zumba, aerobics and fitness programs. Eminent doctors, dieticians, neuro-surgeons, physiotherapists and gym-instructors will also be at the site to provide insight on aspects promoting healthy living and to answer queries on related issues. The health partner at this event will provide another community service by conducting medical-checkups at the venue. Prizes will be on offer for winners of three main categories whilst 25 winners selected from the audience will also be awarded.
Sponsorship is available, on a three tiered basis and trade stalls are been sold at Rs. 30,000/=. Register by 24 June and be part of VG Eventz efforts to create awareness and promote people to live healthy lifestyles in order to improve the standards of the community and build a nation of healthy citizens.
