Executive Presidency to go: Nalin Bandara

The Executive Presidency would be terminated along with the introduction of the new constitution, UNP Kurunegala district MP Nalin Bandara said.
He was speaking at a media briefing at Sirikota yesterday.
Bandara said confirmation of the delimitation committee report is being delayed.
“But effective measures would be taken to hold the Local Government polls soon,” he said.
He also said that legal action would be taken with regard to the Bond Scam in the near future.
Bandara said the Joint Opposition is solely responsible for the tense situation created at the opening of the Sri Lanka-China Industrial Zone Development Project in Hambantota.
He also said minimum injuries were reported due to the disciplined behaviour of the UNP members.
Referring to the misuse of state vehicles by former Minister Wimal Weerawansa, Bandara said 14 state vehicles were obtained for the private use of former Minister Wimal Weerawansa and his family.
UNP Puttalam district MP Hector Appuhamy said the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime would not only take legal action against the offenders but also would take all possible measures to rehabilitate them and transform them into good citizens.
He also requested the Presidential Investigation Unit to conduct an investigation against Provincial Councillors to trace the crimes committed by them.
