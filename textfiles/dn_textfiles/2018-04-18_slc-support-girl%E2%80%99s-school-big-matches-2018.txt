SLC to support Girl’s School Big Matches in 2018

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in a bid to popularize women’s cricket in the country has decided to support the big matches of 30 identified Girls Schools during the year 2018.
SLC will provide a grant of Rs. 100,000 for each game and in addition will also provide cricketing equipment for Girls Schools taking part in the big matches and pay the fees of the Umpires and Scorers covering the respective big matches.
The latest move, which is being done with the guidance of SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala is part of SLC’s vision to develop women’s cricket in the country by attracting more girls to play the game, which in turn will open them the doors for the national women’s team. This is the second time; SLC is supporting girls school Big Matches, with the first being done during last year.
During this year, 10 more girl schools will join the big match fray thus, making it a total of 30 from last year’s figure. Schools from the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Kandy, Moneragala, Ampara, Badulla, Matara and Anuradhapura will play ‘Big Matches’ during this year.
SLC will also provide its international venues such as Pallekele and R. Premadasa Stadium to work out the matches.
The matches will be a 50-over affair for each side and will be played either in tape ball, leather ball or tennis ball.
Already the Big Matches of Panadura Mahanama Girls School vs Wadduwa Central College and Gamini Central College vs Our Ladies College of Nuwara Eliya was held recently with the support of the SLC.
