Country betrayed through UNHRC resolution : Somawansa

People's Servants' Party leader Somawansa Amarasinghe today stressed that the resolution adopted at the UNHRC would have an adverse impact on Sri Lanka. He further noted that his party can join hands with the National Freedom Front and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna to fight against separatism, if these parties show a genuine interest and commitment against separatism.  
 Addressing a press conference in Colombo, Amarasinghe said that he will form the widest front against imperialism as imperialists have not given up their nasty agenda of dividing the country.
“The country has been betrayed through the UNHRC resolution”, he said.
He further added that the UN resolution adopted at the UNHRC underlines the need of having a hybrid court. “The present government itself is a hybrid administration”, he noted. Somawansa noted that all avenues for the public and the members of the think tank to discuss this resolution have been kept closed.
