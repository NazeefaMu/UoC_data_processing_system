fishing industry:

State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said that the country’s fishing industry was dwindling, although there were sufficient fisherfolk and fishing equipment.
He was addressing a gathering of fisherfolk at Kudawella, recently.
The state minister said that excessive fish imports had hindered the industry as well as the country’s economy, and highlighted the need for the country to be self-sufficient in the fishing industry.
The Pohottuwa party was attempting to deceive the nation by organising protests. Such campaigns would not topple the government; only an election could, State Minister Wedaarachchi said.
