Favourite International to distribute Sozo Gourmet Iced Teas and Tonics

Favourite International (a member of Favourite Holdings) which has been in the wines and spirits business for over 20 years and recently ventured into distribution of specialty imported beverages and food products, has tied up with SOZO Beverages as Sozo's marketing and distribution partner for Sozo Gourmet Iced Tea and Tonics islandwide.
The distribution agreement between Favourite International and Sozo Iced Tea and Beverages was signed on September 13 at Colombo Club, Taj Samudra. The agreement was signed by Suren Mirchandani, Director of Favourite International and Gianee De Silva, Partner Sozo Beverages.
“Sozo was born with the dream of creating the freshest beverages that use real ingredients made with 'home-made' passion,” said Co-Founder Dushyantha De Silva – MD of Sozo Beverages. He continued, “We identify Favorite as a company that carries and promotes specialty products, strictly those that you believe in. Seeing the success of other brands, especially Bickford & Sons (from Australia) at the supermarket level, we are confident that Favourite International would be able to roll out SOZO products to modern trade platforms with similar or even greater success.”
Favourite International distributes islandwide to supermarkets and convenience stores and HORECA (hospitality industry). Favourite International will leverage its years of experience and huge clientele to promote Sozo amongst its customers.
Suren Mirchandani, Director of Favourite International said, “We believe Sozo and Favourite are like-minded on that forte and therefore we see a lot of synergy working together. We feel that SOZO can cross promote and be cross promoted with the other beverage products that we sell.”
Favourite International today imports and distributes quality products from Australia and France such as Bickford’s Beverages and Granini Juices. It also is involved in the distribution of high quality coffee, imported water, cheese, cold meats and cigars to its customers through its sales app which can be accessed on mobile phones. Grape Expectations (Pvt) Ltd which is a sister company of Favourite International will shortly open its new wine shop in Park Street, Colombo 02, together with Park Street Gourmet, which will be the flagship shop of Grape Expectations where the best quality specialty food will be available.
Favourite International today sells all its products online through zipsip.lk beside its traditional distribution network.
Both companies are proud and happy to be partners in this new venture.
