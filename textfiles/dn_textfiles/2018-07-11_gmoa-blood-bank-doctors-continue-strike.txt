GMOA Blood Bank doctors continue strike

The strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) members attached to the Blood Bank will continue as planned, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said. Today is the third day of the strike.
The GMOA launched the strike on Monday (9) in protest of the conduct of the Acting Director of the Blood Bank and for inaction by the Health Ministry Secretary to immediately remove him from the post.
