“Buzzing November”  at Hilton Colombo

From the goodness of ginger, the seasonal ingredient of the month to the culinary carnival, a journey through the USA and Retro Nights at the Blue, Hilton Colombo promises diners and party revelers a hype of activity this November.
As part of #EatDrinkHilton, the seasonal ingredient of November is Ginger. Special ginger infused recipes have been perfected by Executive Chef Robert Mujagic and his talented team of chefs to give diners a treat at Graze Kitchen, Curry Leaf, L.A.B and Café Kai. From appetizers to mains, desserts, beverages and a range of cakes and homemade chocolates will be available throughout the month. A few of the delightful dishes on the menu would be the black pepper and ginger flavoured lagoon prawn dry curry with ginger bread at the Curry Leaf, champagne and ginger poached pears, blue cheese crumbles on arugula salad with beet balsamic drizzle at Graze Kitchen and amongst the interesting line up cakes and beverages at Café Kai one must try the ginger parfait with honey roast pear compote and butterscotch sauce. There are special cocktails and mocktail mixers with ginger and dessert at L.A.B giving you more options to enjoy.
