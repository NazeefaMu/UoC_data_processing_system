Striking staff will have job security, more benefits – SLC president

Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that the strike carried out by the ground staff at Dambulla Stadium was unreasonable and the decisions taken by SLC were for the benefit of the workers.
Sumathipala said that the ground staff will secure their jobs and gain more benefits when they are attached to the provincial and district cricket associations.
“Presently the ground staff in the country served under the administration of Sri Lanka Cricket but now we have decided to decentralize it so that they come under the provinces and district cricket associations,” said Sumathipala at a media conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
“The ground workers will get more salary and job security by this decision. They will be entitled for the Employees Trust Fund, the Employees Provident Fund and an overtime allowance as per the Labour Rule,” he said.
The ground staff in the country started a protest campaign against this decision with several workers of Dambulla International Stadium commencing a hunger strike on the roof top of the stadium while other workers at R. Premadasa International Stadium, Pallekelle International Stadium and Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium, Sooriyawewa also joined the protest campaign in support yesterday.
Sumathipala said that SLC have plans to develop national level cricket stadiums in Batticaloa, Badulla and Kurunegala very shortly.
