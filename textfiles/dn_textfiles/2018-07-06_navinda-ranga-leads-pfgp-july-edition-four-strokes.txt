Navinda Ranga leads PFGP July edition  by four strokes

The UTE Engineering Pin Fernando Grand Prix 2018, July edition got underway at the RCGC, and entered its 3rd round with Navinda Ranga leading by 4 strokes from J M D Indika.
Sisira Kumara and B A Sanjeewa share joint 3rd place at 205, eight under par.
A special feature in this July Edition of the PFGP is that two of the four Sri Lankan Professional golfers, selected on the guidelines of the NOC and the MOS approved Selection Committee, Thangaraja and Mithun Perera are also playing alongside adding the extra edge to the competition of the National Amateur Golfers. Even though the two professionals are not eligible for the PFGP prizes sponsored by UTE Engineering, their participation is a boost and sharpener of form for all players.
Thangaraja and Mithun multiple winners on the PGTI (Professional Golf Tour of India), Lalith Kumara and Anura Rohana (Silver Medal winner at Seoul Asian Games 2002) complete the team selected to represent Sri Lanka at the Indonesia Asian Games 2018 in August.
Thangaraja is also 12 under par 201, alongside Navinda Ranga, whilst Mithun Perera is on 207, six under par after 3 rounds. B A Sanjeewa produced two stunning rounds of 65 & 65 to be 12 under par after the 1st two rounds and lead Thangaraja by 2 strokes, even after a stunning 63 (8 under par) second round by Thanga.
The top 20 Amateurs made the cut and the final round will conclude the UTE Engineering 2018, July edition of the Pin Fernando Grand Prix.
