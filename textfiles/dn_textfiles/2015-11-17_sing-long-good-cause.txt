Sing-A-Long for a Good Cause

Here’s news of a great evening for music lovers who are looking for just the right kind of relaxation sprinkled with entertainment that combines two popular concepts. For those who enjoy those golden oldies plus the evergreen hits of yesteryear, there is going to be an opportunity to hear them and to join in singing them. For those who love the beat, lilt and rhythm and are infected by it in a manner that makes them itch to dance, the bandstand is going to be inviting, tempting and simply fantastic.

Anura Palihawadana
The date for it all is fixed for Tuesday, November 24 (Pre Poya Day) at 7pm at the BMICH Banquet Hall. The two in one package which mainly comprises a ‘Sing-A-Long’ and winds up with music for dancing until 11pm is tipped to go on record as an evening that will be long remembered. The song and dance exponents Nalin & the Star Combination, will belt out those popular hits that will see everyone joining in the singing with a prize on offer for the Best Singing Table. In the latter part of the evening, when the mood is right for dancing, the floor will open up to many couples who enjoy tripping the light fantastic toe until Shadow Star Anura Palihawadana who is the popular look alike and sound alike of Sunil Perera of Gypsies comes on stage for a scintillating performance that will lead up to the Baila Competition. To keep the night alive and ticking, the Award Winning and much sought after Compere, Vijaya Corea will be mike side with his wit and humour enveloped by the unique tambour of his golden voice.
The evening will be replete with rewards for those who are there. There are valuable prizes on the Entrance Ticket Draw and the Business Cards Draw. A buffet dinner coupled with no corkage and a ticket makes the evening most attractive. Naturally, there is going to be a rush on for tickets as some have already planned to gather their friends and form a table, considering that every 10 tickets purchased would entitle them to an exclusive Reserved Table.
The significance of this evening is that the money spent on every ticket will not only benefit the buyer but also suffering cancer patients for whose welfare the event is being conducted as a Fund Raiser.
The tickets, for what is anticipated to be a ‘full house’, are now selling fast at Torana, Ground Floor, Liberty Plaza and Sonata Sound, 21B - 3rd Floor, Majestic City, Bambalapitya. As the saying goes: “The early bird catches the worm!”
