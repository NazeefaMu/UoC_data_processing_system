Havies edge out Navy-22-18

Havelock sports club rugby team was really lucky to edge out a spirited Navy sports club by 22 points ( 3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) to 18 ( 2 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties ) in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby first round match played at Havelock Park under lights yesterday.
At half time Havies led 12 points to 6.
Both teams dished out a spectacular display of running rugby in the whole game but Navy was the pick of the lot where they had an outstanding game in both in attack and defence but really unfortunate to lose in the end.The Sailors staged a spirited performance in the second half but could not win due to some handling errors which occured due to wet conditions, hence they ended up on the losing side.
The victorious Havelock Sports Club scored their tries through winger Sashan Mohamed (two) and centre Iranga Ariyapala (one) while full back Rizah Mubarak put over the two conversions and the solitary penalty for the winners.
For the losing Navy Sports club prop forward Charith Silva (one) and full back cum captain Thilina Weerasinghe (one) scored the two tries while Weerasinghe put over the two penalties and the only conversion.
The final score stood at Havelock Sports Club 22 points to Navy Sports Club 18.
Referee - Priyantha Gunaratne had an off day with the whistle.
