MAS Silueta, CDB emerge MCA Cricket Sixes champions

MAS Silueta ‘A’ won the Tier ‘A’ title beating their senior sister, MAS Unichela ‘A’ in the final while the CDB team emerged Tier ‘B’ champions beating Maliban Biscuits in the finals as the annual MCA Open Sixes Cricket Tournament concluded at the MCA grounds recently.
This resounding victory comes after the jubilation of CDB clinching the championship in the D Division 40-over game organized by the MCA, which now gives team CDB an unprecedented two championship titles from the MCA tournaments held this year.
The MCA Cricket Sixes was sponsored for the first time by Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB), an award winning financial solutions provider in the NBFI sector, which had the participation of 12 teams in Tier A and 48 teams in Tier B. CDB’s versatile all-rounder W.P.D.P. Dharmasiri swept the boards by winning three of the five special awards. He was crowned with the laurel for the Most Number of Sixes scored in the tournament with his thirteen sixes and also won the Best Batsman and Man of the Tournament awards. The Man of the Final award was clinched by Buddhika Silva from CDB.
Awards were presented by Chairman of the tournament committee Sujeewa de Silva, Deputy General Manager-Finance of CDB Hasitha Dassanayake, Director and Chief Credit Officer of CDB Sasindra Munasinghe, President of the MCA Niran Mahawatte and General Secretary Nalin Wickremesinghe. CDB, which has always been a proponent of encouraging extracurricular activities as a holistic team builder to promote team spirit and camaraderie, aptly sees the fruition of this philosophy with these two wins, as its dynamic team continues to shine, not only at cricket but in the sporting arena in general.
