Boomers thrive amid thrills but keep alive!

We oldsters are known as the ‘Baby Boomer’ generation. But I prefer to think of people my age or thereabouts as the ‘Live and Learn’ generation. We threw caution to the winds when we were young and tested the boundaries every chance we had to prove our invincibility to the world. We slept in cribs that were covered in lead-based paint and consumed enough five cent ‘bull’s-eye’ sweets from the corner ‘kadey’ to fall into a sugar coma.
Our weekends were spent at beaches, lakes, and muddy pools without the protection of sunscreen lotion. Suntans were the norm. After all, aren’t the majority of Sri Lankans born naturally tanned? Cuts and burns were treated with the sap from an aloe plant. We didn’t worry too much about what we ate. We were expert flingers of rocks, sticks and stones at fruit-laden trees. How else could we have gathered forbidden fruit? Raw mangoes and half-ripe fruit, complemented with chillie and salt, were exotic snacks between regular meals. Besides, our standard food didn’t come with nutrition labels listing the number of calories per serving or percentages of fat. We ate real butter guilt-free in an age when words such as ‘triglycerides’ and ‘cholesterol’ were as alien to us as the moon.
Also an egg has to be one of the first ‘eggs-traordinary’ items of real natural food we were fed. We had them for breakfast four or five times a week and occasionally for supper. Many hundreds of dozen of eggs later this is a love affair that has not waned. And making an egg dish is as easy as breaking a leg, or rather an egg. We all shared the same ‘egg-static’ notion about eggs. We did not carry sealed water bottles with us when straying outside home. We drank it unfiltered straight off the tap to slake our thirst while ignoring its rusty flavour.
We rode in the back of station wagons without seat belts and played games on the floorboards of cars. Our Dads and uncles smoked as they drove, often with the windows rolled up, because no one propounded that cigarettes caused health problems. And yet, we survived. There are so many memories from our childhood that our kids will never experience, which I’m pretty sure they’re thankful to have missed. To them, a world without internet, cable TV, video games, cell phones and microwaves would equate to living in a cave and communicating with rocks and sticks. It would be beyond their comprehension how a family of six could share a single fixed-line rotary dialling phone.
It was a time when you had to make certain you darn well swotted for your exams because they threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed. And it was no threat because they did. Imagine there were unfortunate ‘chappies’ who were kept back in the primary fourth standard for four years on the trot.
Forty years ago, ‘Google’ couldn’t be found in the Webster’s Dictionary and ‘Yahoo’ was something cowboys yelled during a cattle drive. School projects were researched with thick books from the public library rather than by the click of a mouse. World Book Encyclopaedias lined the shelves of many homes and formal letters were pounded out on a manual Smith-Corona typewriter. Handwritten letters have all but disappeared as a form of communication these days. Thanks to technology, the messages our kids send to friends are nothing more than abbreviated texts. That is obviously the reason why if you have school-age children, you may have noticed their handwriting is horrendous.
They may communicate incessantly via written word — they can text with their heads in a paper bag — but put a pen in their hands and they can barely write a sentence in decent cursive. It's not going to be easy to decipher one either, if they think cursive might as well be cuneiform.
There’s something to be said about a six page, handwritten letter from a long distance friend who cared enough to take the time to write it. Still, today’s kids will never know the cushion of safety we felt from the world outside of our small slice of suburbia. Front doors and car doors remained unlocked and bicycles could be left out on the lawn overnight without worrying that they might be stolen. As children, we had more freedom to explore the neighbourhood with our friends and could play at the park until dusk without fear of being abducted. That was an era long before ‘stranger danger’ became both a slogan and safety program. Those lazy stormy afternoons were perfect for reconnecting with family over a rousing game of Monopoly. It was also an opportunity to discover how ruthless your siblings could be when it came to buying up prime property on Boardwalk and Park Place. From pop culture to fashion, these memories take us back in time. Do you remember the good old days of film shows starring singing cowboys sporting white hats who always beat the bad guys in black hats? Or how about when a bottle of sugary Orange Barley or Lanka Lime cost 25 cents? The latest cowboy Dell comic books were sold retail at 50 cents.
We were parent-free when we walked or rode our bikes to school whizzing past the snail-paced buggy carts conveying smaller kids while wickedly shouting the uncharitable nickname of the terribly squint-eyed carter, ‘Udaballum.’
By today’s safety standards, every baby boomer should have been dead by the time we were 12. We defied danger on a daily basis. We never knew that we were doing risky things, of course, we just thought that we were having fun. Nonetheless, we spent our days immersed in activities that we’d never for a second allow our children or grandchildren to do. Or even think about doing. We rode bikes with no safety gear. Not only did we not wear helmets, we’d never even heard of them. Bikes came with a single reflector on the back. It mostly broke off, when another maniacal biker intentionally slammed you from behind just for the heck of it and was rarely replaced. Lights existed but they were considered an extravagance used only by show-offs.
There were no bike paths or lanes offering a buffer from traffic. Many of us seldom rode our bikes sitting on the seat, particularly when there was an audience watching our high-jinks.
We would stand on the seat or sit on the handlebars or turn around backwards and ride down the steepest hill we could find. We did crash a few times and I still have momentous scars from some of the tumbles I took, but I’m still here.
In fact, for most kids, the entire concept of bike safety was reduced to a warning from their mother: “If you get run over, don’t bother to come home for dinner.”
