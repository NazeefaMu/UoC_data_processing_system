Historical Kandy Esala Perahera

The final Randoli Perahera of the historical Kandy Esala Perahera paraded the streets yesterday. Here the Tusker Indi Raja is seen carrying the casket of the Sacred Tooth Relics leaving the Temple of the Tooth in procession. The Kandy Esala Perahera, country’s premier Buddhsit procession started with the first Kumbal Perahera parading the streets. The historic Esala Festival, a tradition being carried from the eras of Kings, attracts thousands of devotees, pilgrims and foreign visitors to the hill capital of Kandy. The procession, consisting of hundreds of traditional dancers, drummers and decorated elephants is in honour of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha enshrined at the Temple of Tooth Relics in Kandy.
