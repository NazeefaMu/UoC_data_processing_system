SriLankan now offers highest number of destinations in its history

SriLankan Airlines online destination count reached 41 recently with the addition of Coimbatore, the highest ever in the flag carrier’s aviation history.
With the recently launched routes to Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, as well as the seasonal flights to Gaya and Varanasi which will resume in August, SriLankan will soon be operating 126 scheduled flights a week to 14 destinations in India – serving more Indian points than any other international airline.
This regains SriLankan the title of the foreign airline with the largest reach into India – a solid and distinct advantage that will help SriLankan’s commercial efforts and its quest to become a regional carrier of note.
In addition to opening these new routes, SriLankan has also implemented several other network changes from July 15 in line with its strategy of adapting its route network to align with the current market realities.
These include: new daily non-stop flights to Guangzhou, China (eliminating the previous Bangkok stopover); new five times a week non-stop flights to Hong Kong, China (eliminating the previous Bangkok stopover that had operated for decades); flights to Bangkok, Thailand increased from daily to three times a day, to cater to the demand and to enhance network connectivity; and flights to Delhi, India increased from daily to 11 times a week.
SriLankan’s destination count is set to increase further from the upcoming winter season, as it launches new daily non-stop flights to Melbourne, Australia. This represents SriLankan’s re-entry to Australia after a hiatus of 16 years. The airline has already seen very strong forward bookings on this route – which gives confidence that it is the right choice. Further expansion of services on strategically important routes are also planned for the winter season.
Two new A320neo aircraft and the first A321neo aircraft have joined SriLankan’s fleet during the year, with two more A321neo aircraft due to join before the end of the year.
