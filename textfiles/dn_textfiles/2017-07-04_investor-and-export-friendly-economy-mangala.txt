Investor and export friendly economy: Mangala

 
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the government intends to implement an investor and export friendly economic policy by reforming tax policies favourable to exports.
He said this at a meeting held with a Japanese delegation representing the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Sri Lanka at the Finance Ministry, yesterday.
The Japanese delegation said that their investors face several issues when various tax reforms are implemented from time to time.
The delegation also said that they export their products under the forward contract system and any sudden amendment to the tax regime affects their exports.
The Japanese delegates requested the Finance Minister to give them at least six months’ notice prior to the enforcement of any tax amendments.
Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma also participated.
