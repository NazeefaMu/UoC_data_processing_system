Party membership of those who go against Party Constitution to be suspended: Duminda

 
The party membership of those who go against the Party Constitution will be suspended, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.   
He was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday on the remark of President Maithripala Sirisena that the 51 MPs who try to divide the party and violate the party discipline could lose their Parliament seats.   
However, the minister declined to elaborate on the comment stating that it was an internal matter of the party and would be revealed in due course.   
He said the revision of electoral and district organisers was made, not considering their personal affiliations, adding that it was a move towards the restructuring of the party. "None of the new appointments was based on the fact whether they were aligned with President Sirisena or whether they hold anti-Mahinda Rajapaksa views. Some were removed as they had not performed their duties. We have no intention of removing the Joint Opposition members from the SLFP. However, all members should hold the party line if we are to carry forward the party," he said.   
Dissanayake said despite removing from organiser posts, all have been invited to take part in the SLFP 65th Convention to be held in Kurunegala. He said former Presidents Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga have been specially invited as they are senior patrons of the party, adding that as of the reservation of seats President Sirisena would be flanked by both the former Presidents. He said this arrangement was done to send a strong signal of unity and power of the SLFP.   
He said the representatives of all other parties, including the UNP have also been invited to take part in the party's convention to add their well wishes.   
He said the SLFP with its new organiser appointments would give special concern for the youth, trade union leaders, professionals and women. He said the party has expanded its activities in the North and East, adding that the vacant organiser posts in these areas would be filled shortly.   
Former MP Shantha Bandara said 95 percent of the newly appointed Electoral and District Organisers were supporting former President Rajapaksa during the previous elections.   
"All those were expecting the victory of the 'betel leaf'. If the party had been led by either former Presidents Rajapaksa or Chandrika Kumataunga, the decisions of party restructuring would have come much earlier. President Sirisena was patient for so long as he wanted to unite the party," he said.
