President’s decision to appoint PCI into Treasury bond issue timely:Shantha Bandara

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) Chairman, Shantha Bandara said yesterday, that President Maithripala Sirisena would take a suitable decision at the appropriate time after the completion of investigations by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry(PCI) into the Treasury Bond transaction.
He said the UNP came into power pledging to end corruption. But this was not done properly. Therefore, we must thank President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing the Presidential Commission to probe into the scam.
He further said if a government servant was found guilty of fraud or corruption, in addition to legal action, an investigation too would be initiated at an institutional level and appropriate punishment meted out. But, no such punishment or institutional investigations against
corrupt politicians had been taken. Therefore, instead of initiating legal action, a relevant political party should hold an internal investigation against corrupt politicians. The Yahapalan government came into power promising the people a clean and honest political journey. Therefore, we must fulfil that promise by taking appropriate action against wrongdoers,” he said.
The truth has been finally revealed to the public as a result of the Presidential Commission being appointed by the President. The Commission has always acted independently, permitting all parties to give their evidence.
He added that Judges of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond issue, must be provided with sufficient security to act without fear.
Commenting on the violence created by several criminal gangs operating in the North, he said President Maithripala Sirisena had advised the Security Forces to crack down organised crime in the Jaffna Peninsula. We still remember how the people of Sri Lanka had suffered immense hardships due to the war. We lost thousands of lives, while the country suffered a huge set back in terms of economic and infrastructure development.
He further said the Joint Opposition should have waited till the Presidential Commission ended its sittings if they wanted to bring a non-confidence motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake. But it was presented shortly with the aim of gaining political advantage.
