MERVYN’S WAY

Eighteenth Death Anniversary today:
The Philosophy of Mervyn de Silva’s Journalism:
Every journalist and most certainly every editor operates with a philosophy of journalism, whether they know it or not—and most often they don’t. A journalist who explicitly operates on the basis of a journalistic philosophy is rare. Rarer still is one who states it as such; one whose philosophy of journalism is easily traceable because it is in print. Mervyn de Silva was such a journalist.
Mervyn’s philosophy of journalism is easily accessible because of three landmark editorials in which he set it out. What is also noteworthy is that his philosophy of journalism did not remain static and instead evolved, developed in keeping with changing times and the change within the man himself. Finally, what is remarkable is that his philosophy of journalism stemmed quite transparently from a philosophy of life and existence, and that too was stated in print. This makes Mervyn not only an outstanding journalist but a thinker in journalism.
The iconic literary critic Regi Siriwardena, one of Mervyn’s two outstanding teachers of English at Royal College (the other being ‘Dicky’ Attygalle), wrote the Foreword to the ICES publication ‘In His Time: Selected Tributes to Mervyn de Silva 1929-1999’. In it he chose to reproduce in full, the Daily News editorial of June 6th 1970, which was Mervyn’s first editorial having sat in the editorial chair at age 40. Regi noted that “This one, unusually, bore the by-line ‘Editor’ at the bottom, as if to emphasize that it was a personal declaration of the principles to which the new occupant of the chair was committing himself. The heading ‘CREDO’ (‘a creed, a set of opinions or principles’, as a good dictionary defines the word) seemed to underline that emphasis further”.
Mervyn’s Credo commenced with the line “The policy of this newspaper is based on the following principles” and a representative paragraph read: “Since the perils of an administrator insulated from public opinion should now be regarded as axiomatic, fair comment and responsible criticism should be viewed by any sensible administration as a function which subserves as much the community’s general interest as its own.”
In the last paragraph of his Credo Mervyn admits that “this declaration claims neither originality nor special sanctity. It is in fact founded on the commonplace canons of good journalism.”
Having reproduced the Editorial in full, Regi confirms that “in spite of the characteristic lucidity and trenchancy of Mervyn’s writing, the ideas he was stating were, as he acknowledged in his last paragraph, not new or original. They were in fact the accepted principles of independent and liberal journalism.” Regi goes on to say that the text must be read in the context, and that context (notwithstanding the hagiography about departed Editors) was that “during the campaign preceding the general election [of 1970] the Daily News and other Lake House newspapers had not—to put it mildly—distinguished themselves by their fairness or non-partisanship”.
Independent journalism
Regi Siriwardena concluded that “Mervyn’s Credo still stands as an unfulfilled ideal of what a non-partisan Sri Lankan newspaper committed only to the public interest should be.” However, Mervyn’s adherence to the liberal axioms of good, independent journalism were to undergo evolution, development and transformation. Regi set out the external factors: “Before the decade was out, Mervyn had twice been deprived of his editorial chair, once by the management of Lake House, now state-owned, and once by the privately owned newspaper enterprise he joined thereafter. Both found him too independent, too little content to be the docile slave.”
The two editorials that Mervyn wrote for the inaugural (May 1st 1978) and the first anniversary (May 1st 1979) editions of the Lanka Guardian reveal a dramatic shift in tone and perspective. The founding Editorial of the Lanka Guardian, the equivalent of his ‘Credo’ in the Daily News of June 6th 1970, appeared significantly on May Day 1978 under the caption “Other news, Another opinion”.
“The Lanka Guardian is primarily a journal of opinion. The proper functioning of a pluralist democracy pre-supposes the free interplay of diverse opinions. The freer and more active, the better.
Given the structure of the major media, the dominance of the official and the conventional view is no aberration. What is unnatural and therefore unhealthy, is the conspicuous absence of other opinions and perspectives which by calling into question or openly challenging the all-too easily accepted orthodoxies, stimulate intelligent discussion.
…If we may dignify this exploratory venture in Sri Lankan journalism and embellish our ordinary wish with the formal ostentation of a motto, it is: OTHER news, and ANOTHER opinion.”
In complete contrast to those English language journalists and editors who were supinely Anglo-American, Mervyn’s founding editorial for the Lanka Guardian clarified that “This perspective is by no means confined to domestic issues and events”. He registers protest at the reality of “a poor nation’s essential condition of dependence”, saying “if the word means anything that is what Third Worldism is all about”.
Philosophy of journalism
Mervyn’s international affairs perspective and his philosophy of journalism are inextricable, as demonstrated in that opening LG editorial: “An informed interest in world affairs ought not to be a private occupation of the privilegentsia nor regarded as an irrelevance for the people...We believe that knowledge is the property that should be least private. The dissemination of informed opinion is a kind of sharing.”
The next year, 1979, when the new UNP government was at the height of its hegemony, Mervyn would turn 50 and see Fidel Castro, though he had done neither when he wrote his first anniversary editorial for the Lanka Guardian. It was 20 years before his death.
In it he notes in passing and bemusedly, the criticisms made in Parliament by “public figures” (such as “Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Deputy Foreign Minister…”), but as the Editorial moves on, the tone and topic change. In his concluding paragraphs he demonstrates that his commitment to “pluralist democracy” was rooted in a structural critique of the global establishment and a deep commitment to definitive change, and that this constituted a major facet of his philosophy of journalism. It was a second Credo: “One important point remains to be cleared. It has been said that in our presentation of views, in our basic perspective, we are not “balanced”. It is the same argument that the transnational news agencies which control 90% of the international news flow use against fledgling Third World agencies. Be balanced, be neutral. On questions of social emancipation, neutrality itself could be a crime.
As for our own effort, we do not work in a vacuum. We must relate our work to the national information system, the reading public and to society at large. The communications system is heavily weighted in favour of established and Establishment opinion. However miniscule, ours is a corrective, the corrective of a countervailing force.” (‘The First Year’)
What were the values that informed Mervyn’s philosophy of journalism? In a brilliant revaluation Godfrey Gunatilleke concluded that in the sustained 1972 debate in the Daily News with Mervyn’s old teacher Regi Siriwardena, “Both Regi and Mervyn were agreed on what I would call the literary critical fundamentals. But it is Mervyn who comes out more convincingly on the issue of literature and ideology. And Mervyn’s definition of the issues and the answers he gives go beyond the boundaries of literary criticism.”
Godfrey identifies Mervyn’s core values: “This was the way Mervyn articulated his own rejection of relativist nihilism and defined the “universality” to which all societies and their cultures need to be linked.”
Mervyn’s generation
What was that ‘way’? Mervyn’s concluding line in the passage that Godfrey excerpts, reads:
“The humanist’s article of faith embraces a human heritage. All literature is part of that...” (‘Pound, Poetry and Politics’, CDN, Friday Nov 17, 1972, p.4)
Universalist humanism, pluralist democracy, liberalism—all values on a continuum, and the common stock of values shared by those of his generation and educational background. These demarcated Mervyn from the nativism and resentful nationalism that was manifest in society and had surfaced even within Mervyn’s generation. What made Mervyn distinct, though not unique, in his own generation and cultural stratum, was the
dual demarcation, from on the one hand, an anti-Westernism that turned its back on the universality that the western tradition contained and the English-educated elite had imbibed, and on the other, a West-centrism that ignored or benefited from the inequities of the interlocking domestic and global orders.
“Mervyn was essentially part of the English-educated elite” as Ajith Samaranayake wrote two days after his death in the
Daily News, but not of the pro-Western liberal
Establishment. He editorially defined his journalistic endeavors as “a countervailing force” and his commitment to pluralist democracy centered on “the people”.
Mervyn definitively elaborated his perspective in the 1982 paper ‘Non-Alignment and the New Information Order’, in the volume
The Principles of Non-Alignment, co-published by the International Progress Organization, Vienna, and the Third World Centre, London. The volume is No VII in the series ‘Studies in International Relations’ edited by Hans Kochler, Chairman of the Philosophy Dept. at Innsbruck University, Austria:
“…an end to domination…the ultimate goal of course in this projected path of progress is the total emancipation of our peoples and their liberation in all spheres—political, economic and cultural…the system against which we are battling has been created by the West and remains West–dominated…Deeper down, as we touch the domestic power structure, we observe the role of local elites, their self-interest, their ideological outlook, and international linkages…a privileged English-educated minority stands at the apex of the power structure. In the countryside dwell the millions of Sinhala or Tamil educated poor, at whom the international communications system, controlled and managed by the metropolitan elite, is directed…” (Mervyn de Silva, ‘The Principles of Non-Alignment’, London, 1982, pp. 219-228)
Mervyn inscribed his core philosophical view in the final paragraph of the founding Editorial of the
Lanka Guardian, the journal that he launched, coincidentally, in the year his father died. The opening allusion is clear and the passage shows his evolution from the milieu of his childhood:
“We have been advised to be lamps unto ourselves. The press in particular has been invited to light the path of our leaders. For common humanity the possibilities of personal salvation, so freely given to the artist and the saint, can only be enhanced by the larger endeavor of social emancipation. The act of informed discussion is itself a source of illumination.” (Letter to the Reader: ‘Other news, Another opinion’,
Lanka Guardian, Vol.1, No 1, May 1, 1978.)
Aged 57, Mervyn made a further statement of his philosophy of journalism – and life-- in the message to
The Island on its 5th anniversary:
“To be engaged and yet above the fray, to lead the reader quietly, and to trust the people, your ultimate judge and jury.” (‘No island is an island’,
The Island, Saturday, Oct 4th 1986)
Journalist’s responsibility
The caption—“No island is an island”—with its derivation from Donne, expressed his settled conviction that Sri Lanka and Lankans must imperatively be internationalist, while the content of the message set out his stance (“engaged and yet above the fray”), his notion of the journalist’s responsibility (“to lead the read quietly”) and a firm unambiguous reiteration of his commitment--a commitment he commends to journalists and journalism itself -- to “the people, your ultimate judge and jury”.
Mervyn de Silva did not think that purely personal salvation was possible. He neither separated his philosophy from his journalism, nor thought that good, independent journalism was desirable or possible without a set of values and a perspective which went beyond both the personal and the purely professional. “Social emancipation” and “liberation” had become central categories. Mervyn’s independent liberal journalism had grown into an
emancipatory journalism, a
Journalism of Liberation. And yet, his abiding, almost Socratic commitment to “informed, intelligent discussion” as central to that project, placed him between liberalism and liberation, searching for a synthesis.
