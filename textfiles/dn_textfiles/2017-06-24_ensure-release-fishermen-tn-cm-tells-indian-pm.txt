Ensure release of fishermen, TN CM tells Indian PM

India's Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in securing the release of four Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu allegedly arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on Wednesday night for straying into its water.
Dashing off a letter to Prime Minister Modi, Palaniswami told him that “long periods of impoundment and idling of the fishing boats” without care will make them unworthy of sailing and unusable for fishermen.
He also complained that traditional and historical rights of the fishermen are continuously being denied consequent to the unconstitutional ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka and the consequential loss of traditional fishing grounds of the Palk Bay area.
