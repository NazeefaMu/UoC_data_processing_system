Cabinet reshuffle soon

A Cabinet reshuffle which will be favourable to the country will be made soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Dr. Senaratne was addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters to 52 new pharmacists in Colombo recently. He had also stated that both the President and the Prime Minister had agreed to a Cabinet reshuffle. Although media reported about a possible Cabinet reshuffle before Vesak Poya, it did not happen. “I stated that a Cabinet reshuffle will not take place before Vesak Poya,” the minister had said.
A total of Rs. 4 billion is required to pay overtime to health sector workers during this year. The overtime payments increased with the Rs. 10,000 salary increase granted to public sector employees, he added.
