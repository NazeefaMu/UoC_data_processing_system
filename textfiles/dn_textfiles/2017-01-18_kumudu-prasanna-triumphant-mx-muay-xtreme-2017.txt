Kumudu Prasanna triumphant at MX Muay Xtreme 2017

Sri Lanka made history in the international Muay Thai arena when Kumudu Prasanna won his match by knockout at the recent MX Muay Xtreme competition held in Bangkok, Thailand. Kumudu was the first fighter to represent Sri Lanka at a contest of this level, which saw fighters from seven other countries competing. Kumudu's participation was facilitated by the official local representative for the sport, the Muay Thai Association of Sri Lanka (MTASL).
29-year- old professional Muay Thai fighter Kumudu trained under Kru Asoka Jayarathna. His record, prior to his recent win in Thailand, was 10 fights, encompassing nine (9) wins and one (1) loss. His match at the MX Muay Xtreme was fought against a formidable Thai fighter whose record featured several more professional fights than Kumudu's, so the fact that he was victorious is a testament to Sri Lanka's rising stature of the sport. MX Muay Xtreme was a tournament that comprised seven fights in total, encompassing 14 professional fighters.
“I am proud to represent Sri Lanka at the highest level of international Muay Thai competition at the home of the sport, and bring glory to our country. I would also like to thank my teachers who have guided me on this hard journey. I will definitely be participating at more international competitions across the world, and would like to encourage many more Sri Lankan fighters to take part in international competitions”, said Kumudu Prasanna.
MTASL is the official governing body representing Sri Lanka at international Muay Thai competitions. The Association facilitated Kumudu's participation in MX Muay Xtreme, while also preparing him for many months beforehand with several Muay Thai workshops in Thailand. The Association is led by Kru Asoka Jayarathna, and supported by international coordinator / director Miran Nilanga, under the supervision of Kru Pak, the head of the Muay Thai Association of America.
“MTASL is committed to take Sri Lanka to international Muay Thai competitions while at the same time spreading the sport across the country. It is also a career path one can choose based on how far one wants to go. Muay Thai is a traditional martial art from Thailand but it is also very popular in dozens of countries with many competitions held across the world”, said Kru Asoka Jayarathna.
Miran Nilanga, International Coordinator / Director - MTASL has been instrumental in promoting Sri Lankan fighters at the international competitions and has been advising the association on how to develop and spread Muay Thai across Sri Lanka. “I have been a practitioner of Muay Thai for over three decades under the tutelage of Kru Pak and this achievement shows what Sri Lankans can achieve at international level in this sport”, added Miran Nilanga.
