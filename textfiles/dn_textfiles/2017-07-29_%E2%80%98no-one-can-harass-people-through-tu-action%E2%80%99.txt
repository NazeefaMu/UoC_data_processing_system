‘No one can harass people through TU action’

No one can be allowed to harass people and hamper their day today life through trade union action, Minister S. B. Dissanayaka said
Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said the elected government is duty bound to restore the normal lifestyle of the people and to protect them from being harassed.
The minister was addressing the media on Thursday at the SLFP headquarters with Minister Laksman Senevirathne.
He added that the public should come forward against those who are harassing people and against unjustifiable trade union actions such as the trade union action of certain employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The TU action of CPC is unethical and unjustifiable as this government never sells State properties like the previous regime.
“It was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who sold State properties to foreign countries outright. A six acre land, in which the Army Headquarters was functioning in front of Galle Face Green, was sold out for a hotel project for a foreign company. A 240-acre land of the proposed Commercial City Project was handed over to the Chinese company by him without revealing the agreement to anyone. No one knew anything about those outright agreements. Even the Cabinet didn’t know anything about the transactions as Rajapaksa didn’t reveal it even to the Cabinet. Everything was done secretly. But the persons who make a huge cry over selling State land did not dare to say a single word against Rajapksa’s outright land sales,” he added.
According to the Minister, the government has taken measure to have the best agreement for the country with regard to the Hambantota Port leasing out agreement. With the Hambantota Port agreement, the area will be subjected to rapid development including the Hambantota International Airport.
Speaking on the forthcoming Local Government elections, the Minister said the process of selecting all SLFP candidates will be completed within the next two weeks. Out of the 160 seats, candidates for 100 seats have been selected by now.
When questioned whether he can be satisfied with the investigation into the Treasury bond scam, Minister Dissanayake said he is happy with the way investigations are carried out. Investigations are being carried out impartially and all responsible persons for the scam will have to face justice.
“It was observed that certain persons tried to hamper the investigations into the Treasury bond issue until the President appointed a Presidential Commission to inquire into it,” Minister Dissanayake said.
Minister Senavirathne said the investigations have come to a crucial stage now and legal action will be taken against responsible persons.
“The impartial investigation, which is being carried out now is also a victory of the people. If this government was not in power, it is certain that there would have been no investigation into the bond scam,” Minister Senavirathne said.
Minister Dissanayake added that Rajapaksa should not try to destroy the SLFP.
Rajapaksa after giving the Chairmanship of the SLFP to present Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena, should not pull by the present Chairman’s leg, he said.
