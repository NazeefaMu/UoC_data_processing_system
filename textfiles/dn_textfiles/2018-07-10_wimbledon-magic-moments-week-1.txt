Wimbledon magic moments - week 1

LONDON : Magic moments from the first week of Wimbledon:
MONDAY, JULY 2
Federer, the $300 million man
-- Roger Federer boosted his bank balance by $300 million as he marked his 20th straight Wimbledon appearance with a new clothing deal.
The 36-year-old eight-time Wimbledon champion penned a contract with Japanese giants Uniqlo, virtually severing a two-decade association with Nike in the process.
"I was excited to wear Uniqlo today. I must tell you, it's been a long time coming," said defending champion Federer after his first round 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia's Dusan Lajovic on Centre Court.
TUESDAY, JULY 3
Bouchard's mob rule
-- Former runner-up Eugenie Bouchard was happy to be the centre of attention on Court 14 after beating British wildcard Gabriella Taylor 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.
"I felt great support. I saw a lot of Canadian flags. I got mobbed after the match, pretty much. But it's a mob of love, so I liked it," said Bouchard whose dedicated legion of fans is known as 'Genie's Army'.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 4
Bugs life for beaten Wozniacki
-- Second seed Caroline Wozniacki was knocked out in the second round, losing 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to Ekaterina Makarova and had to fight off an invasion of flying ants as well on Court One.
"They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere -- we need to do something. Is there a spray?" the Dane complained to the chair umpire.
"I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs."
THURSDAY, JULY 5
Alison in wonderland
--Wimbledon giantkiller Alison van Uytvanck said she was comfortable coming out as gay, saying "it is not a disease".
The 24-year-old Belgian stunned defending champion and third seed Garbine Muguruza 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to make the third round at the All England Club for the first time.
She then told reporters that she was happy to have come out as gay and talked about her relationship with fellow player Greet Minnen.
"We just decided to not make it personal and not keep it for ourselves. I'm happy," said Van Uytvanck, the world number 47.
"I just feel like we don't have to be ashamed of this, and that's why I also want to be free.
I'm not sick. I don't have a disease. But I just feel like it's good that I could come out as a gay person."
FRIDAY, JULY 6
Serena: "That's what makes me great"
-- Everyone knows that Serena Williams is the greatest player of the modern era, if not of all time.
On Friday, the 36-year-old American admitted it herself.
"Every single match I play, whether I'm coming back from a baby or surgery, it doesn't matter, these young ladies, they bring a game that I've never seen before.
"It's interesting because I don't even scout as much because when I watch them play, it's a totally different game than when they play me.
"That's what makes me great: I always play everyone at their greatest, so I have to be greater."
SATURDAY, JULY 7
Djokovic on the bounce
-- Novak Djokovic admitted he had to stay mentally tough as the three-time champion shrugged off a controversial call against him to beat Kyle Edmund.
Djokovic was furious when he was denied a break of serve in the seventh game of the fourth set on Centre Court when the ball bounced twice before Edmund hit what was ruled a winner.
But the Serb managed to refocus after a lengthy complaint to umpire Jake Garner and eventually secured the break that sealed his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory on Centre Court. "I was 100 percent convinced it was a double bounce in the fourth set, but anyone can make a mistake," Djokovic said.
"It was an important point. I asked the chair umpire how is it possible he plays that shot if it didn't bounce twice. It didn't make sense." – AFP
