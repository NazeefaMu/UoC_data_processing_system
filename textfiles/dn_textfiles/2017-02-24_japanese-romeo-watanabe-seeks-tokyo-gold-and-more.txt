Japanese Romeo Watanabe seeks Tokyo gold -- and more

TOKYO THURSDAY: Fresh from setting a new world record, Japan’s latest swim sensation Ippei Watanabe is plotting Tokyo Olympic glory in 2020 -- and he wants his gold medal sealed with a kiss.
The 19-year-old, who shot to fame with a jaw-dropping time of 2 minutes 06.67 seconds in the men’s 200 metres breaststroke last month, plans to set another world best in the Olympic final and celebrate by sweeping some lucky damsel off her feet with a dashing wedding proposal.
“I’m blessed that I’ll be at my peak as a swimmer when the Tokyo Olympics arrive,” Watanabe told AFP in an interview.
“My aim is to win the final in a world record and then propose to someone with my gold medal,” he added, coyly declining to elaborate on who might be the object of his desire.
“There’s only three years to go and I’m determined not to waste the opportunity to make the Tokyo Olympics the crowning glory of my career.” Behind Watanabe’s hopes for a slushy Hollywood ending, burns a competitive fire to emulate boyhood idol Kosuke Kitajima, who won 100m and 200m breaststroke gold at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.
“When I was 10 I buried a time capsule,” said the Waseda University student, who broke the world mark in Tokyo watched by the Japan swimming great.
“I put in a message with my dreams written on it: saying I wanted to be like Kosuke Kitajima and swim at the Olympics.” Having eclipsed a world best once owned by Kitajima and competing in Rio last summer, Watanabe has gone some way to reaching those goals.
But the record-breaker, who finished sixth in the Olympic final, is hungry to prove his wonder swim was no fluke. AFP
