England Women recover from 58/6 to total 240/9: Take series 3-0 as rain ends final contest

England Women staged a fine rearguard action to get out of jail from being reduced to 58-6 to total an impressive 240-9 in the fourth and final ODI against Sri Lanka Women at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
However the contest ended in a damp squib when rain prevented Sri Lanka Women from commencing their innings and the match eventually ended in a no-result.
England Women won the series 3-0 having won the first three ODIs.
Choosing to bat first on winning the toss England Women were soon deep in trouble against the right-arm and left-arm spin of Inoshi Priyadarshani and skipper Inoka Ranaweera losing their first six wickets for 58 before the tail staged a superb fight back to wrest back the initiative.
Natalie Sciver led the recovery with a fluent knock of 77 off 74 balls (10 fours, 2 sixes). She shared a seventh wicket stand of 104 with Danielle Hazell (45).
Following Sciver’s dismissal at 162, Hazell continued the fightback with Laura Marsh (36 n.o.) and Beth Langston (21) to ensure England Women posted a decent total.
Pick of the Lankan Women bowlers were Priyadarshani and Ranaweera who shared six wickets.
