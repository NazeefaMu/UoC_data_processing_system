Free vocational training from next year

Vocational raining will be offered free of charge as an extension of the free education system in the country, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
“We have found that certain institutions like the Ocean University and Vocational and Vocational Training Authority have been offering courses for a fee. Technical education, like other avenues of education should be offered free,” Minister Samarasinghe told a media briefing at the ministry yesterday.
He said the 2017 Budget had allocated Rs. 300 billion to provide investments to offer all courses free of charge from next year.
A government circular released by the Public Administration and Management Ministry also recognised the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 3 and 4 certificates as being similar to O/Ls and A/Ls qualifications when recruiting candidates for technical jobs in the government service.
The Cabinet in June approved the proposal to have the NVQ level 3 certificate to be equivalent to O/Ls and the NVQ level 4 certificate being equivalent to A/Ls.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said this will help in the policy in making 13 years of schooling compulsory.
“Not all will go into the traditional fields of study, thus we must also include technical subjects in the curriculum. With these changes, they will have the opportunity to find work in the technical field,” he said.
“We have 2,20,000 students every year not qualifying for university. Meanwhile, we need a trained and qualified labour force to meet our sustainable development goals and to make our country more attractive to foreign investors,” Minister Samarasinghe said.
