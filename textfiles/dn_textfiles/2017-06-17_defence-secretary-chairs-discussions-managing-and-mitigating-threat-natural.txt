Defence Secretary chairs discussions on managing and mitigating threat of natural disasters

Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi chaired a discussion themed ‘Managing and mitigating the threat of natural disasters in Sri Lanka,’ organized by the Institute of National Security Studies at the Ministry auditorium yesterday (16).
The aim of the discussion was to bring together all relevant stake holders in order to manage and mitigate the risk component of future disasters in the country. One of the main key areas that were focused during the meeting was the implementation of an Early Warning System as a mechanism for disaster risk reduction. Additionally, matters related to building of illegal settlements near flood-prone areas, de-forestation and sand-mining were discussed at the meeting. Effects of the natural disasters, including the recent floods and counter implementing measures were also discussed during the meeting.
During his speech, Secretary Hettiarachchi pointed out that disaster prevention should get more attention rather than focusing on post disaster work. The Secretary highlighted the improvements in rescue and relief operations during the recent floods. He also offered his expertise as an engineer, which would assist to prevent or to minimize floods and landslides in future.
Senior officials of the relevant institution, senior military officers, Director General of the INSSSL and officials of the INSSSL were also present at the occasion.
