Jishan China and Moneragala to work as sister cities

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing a sister city relationship between Jishan, Shanxi Province of China and Monaragala, was signed recently in Sri Lanka between the District Secretary of Monaragala and the Magistrate of the People’s Government of Jishan Country with the participation of Chinese delegation, including six members at the Monaragala District Secretariat.
The Cabinet Approval is expected for the MOU in due course to implement the agreement for establishing sister city relations in accordance with the principles in the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
Considering the opportunity for promotion of friendly relations and deepening mutual understanding between the two countries through the MOU, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Beijing Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku expedited the process of arranging the MOU once the proposal initiated by the Most. Ven. Chang Zang, the Chief Incumbent of Longquan Temple in Beijing where one of the Buddha’s sacred Tooth Relic is kept for reverence.
The Jishan region is considered as an important place for Sri Lanka because it is the birth place of Rev. Faxian who visited Sri Lanka during the 5th Century to learn Buddhism. The 60 acre Jujube garden was also opened last year in Ven. Faxian’s home town named “China-Sri Lanka Friendship Jishan Jujube Orchard” to commemorate the cordial Buddhist relations between the two countries and to commemorate 60 years of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
