Adopt method to exchange defaced currency: Gemunu Wijeratne

 
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association President Gemunu Wijeratne proposed the Central Bank to adopt a mechanism to exchange defaced currency through commercial banks in order to avoid inconveniences faced by bus commuters.
Wijeratne made this proposal at a press briefing held in Colombo, today.
Furthermore Wijeratne said that around seven to eight million individuals commute by busses each day and currency worth approximately Rs.400 million is exchanged per day.
‘Commuters still possess defaced currency and we can’t demand passengers who produce those notes to get down from the bus’, he said.
‘Even though the Central Bank declared that the use of defaced currency was eliminated from April 1, those notes are still circulating among the public’, he added.
Expressing their grievances, Wijeratne said that bus conductors are not capable of being peculiar about avoiding defaced notes when issuing tickets all the time.
Wijeratne urged the Central Bank to keep commercial banks open at least once a week for six months to exchange defaced notes.
Furthermore he said that the Private Bus Owners Association will render their full support to the government if they take measures to install an electronic payment method.
