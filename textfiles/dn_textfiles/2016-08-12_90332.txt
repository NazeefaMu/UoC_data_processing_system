Was Galle pitch doctored by curators? - The Australian

 
Photographs obtained by the The Australian of the wicket at Galle on the third day of the recent Test match show what are obvious efforts by curators to aid the local spinners writes Peter Lalor.
Despite the move apparently being in breach of ICC regulations, The Australian was informed last night that Sri Lanka Cricket had escaped sanction after ICC match referee Chris Broad filed his pitch report on Tuesday.
Pitch doctoring is one of the main reasons wins are becoming harder to gain on the subcontinent.
On the last day of the Test, which the Sri Lankans won in 2½ days, Broad could be seen in animated conversation with the curator in the middle of the ground and appeared to be gesturing towards the areas in front of the crease.
Photographs obtained by The Australian show an area about two metres in front of the batting crease at either end that is prepared differently from the rest of the pitch, which has more grass on it and shows less general abrasion. The practice obviously aids local spin bowlers. It’s understood the curator scraped up the grass in this patch to remove it entirely and the area might even have been brushed with a strong broom. The Australian team management refused to comment on the issue when contacted yesterday.
