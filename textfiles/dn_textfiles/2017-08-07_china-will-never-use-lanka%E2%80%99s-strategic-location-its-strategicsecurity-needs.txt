“We do not have any navy soldiers or any other soldiers in Sri Lanka.
We have no intelligence in Sri Lanka. We have no such people present in Sri Lanka except the Chinese diplomats present here and I am the representative of China to Sri Lanka.”
“But we have so many CEOs, Engineers, businessmen, teachers,professors in Sri Lanka. What are they doing here? They are
strengthening the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka and assist Sri Lanka and develop this island country and develop the economy and social affairs. We do what we say and we have kept our promise. So trust the Chinese as we are true friends of Sri Lanka,” Yi said.
