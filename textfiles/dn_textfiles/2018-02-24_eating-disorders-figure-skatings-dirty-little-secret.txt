Eating disorders, figure skating's 'dirty little secret'

Gangneung, Friday: Four years ago, Russia's Yulia Lipnitskaya had the world at her 15-year-old feet, before the ground crumbled beneath them.
The figure skater had emerged as one of the golden athletes of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, enchanting her audience to win the team title -- and a very public bear hug from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But during the Pyeongchang Winter Games, Lipnitskaya is back home in Russia, her skates gathering dust, after she retired in September due to health issues related to anorexia. Eating disorders have been described as "skating's dirty little secret" -- partly because sufferers usually strive to keep their problem well hidden.
Canada's Gabrielle Daleman said she received messages from many other skaters when she opened up about her own problems.
"I don't know if it's the sport or if it's just the way people look at themselves," the 20-year-old told AFP.
"I just wasn't happy with the way I was looked, from being bullied (at school) and everything, I was getting criticised.
"I tried to look a certain way what people wanted me to look, rather than just feel good about myself. So that's something I've learned over the past year." Daleman, who finished 15th in the women's singles in Pyeongchang, said her eating disorder started at school, where she was bullied over a learning disability. "I got a lot of messages from other skaters. Ashley Cain messaged me, Gracie (Gold) messaged me, Evgenia Medvedeva messaged me. -AFP
