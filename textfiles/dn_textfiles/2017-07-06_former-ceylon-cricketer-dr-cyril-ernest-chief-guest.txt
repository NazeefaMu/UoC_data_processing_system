Former Ceylon cricketer Dr. Cyril Ernest chief guest

At Benedictine Prize Giving on Friday:
At the invitation of Rev. Bro. Henry Dissanayake, Director of St. Benedict's College, top all-round sportsman and former Ceylon cricketer Dr. Cyril Ernest, now domiciled in the USA will be the chief guest of the St. Benedict's College Prize Giving 2017 on Friday July 7 at the College premises.
Dr. Ernest represented St. Benedict's College with distinction in cricket, hockey, athletics and tennis in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was an excellent all-rounder in cricket opening batting with Ranjit Fernando, always giving a good start to the Benedictines. He was a brilliant fielder at close leg position, at a time when helmets and other safety gear were unheard of. He was also a very useful off spin bowler. He represented the College in Combined Schools' cricket teams of that time. He also took part in Public Schools Athletic Meets and Public Schools Tennis Championships.
Dr. Ernest entered Medical College from St. Benedict's in 1961 and had a dream sporting career at the University of Ceylon. He represented the University in Sara Trophy cricket as an all-rounder from 1961-67 and captained the team in his final year. He captained the University cricket team on tour to the All-India Inter-University cricket tournament, 1966, Bangalore, India. He represented the University hockey team in the Pioneer and Andriesz Shield tournaments.
After joining Royal Ceylon Air Force as a medical doctor, he captained the Air Force cricket team, the Adastrians and also played hockey. He was a regular member of the Ceylon Government Services cricket team in the Robert Senanayake Pentangular tournament, which became the national champions in 1969. He also toured India with the Government Services side. He played for the Government Services cricket team in their fixture against Joe Lister's International team in 1969. He first played for the Ceylon national team against the MCC in 1969. He also represented the Ceylon Cricket Association team in the annual Gopalan Trophy encounter versus Madras. He was selected for the Ceylon team to tour Pakistan in 1971, which was unfortunately cancelled due to the Bangladesh problem.
In the USA, he played for the USA cricket team in the Associate Members World Cup in Birmingham, England 1982. He was manager of the USA cricket team 1995-96 and was chairman of the selection committee 1995-96. Dr. Ernest therefore has the rare distinction of playing for the national cricket teams of two countries, his homeland Sri Lanka, then Ceylon and USA.
Dr.Ernest was a keen long distance runner, running four marathons (Honolulu twice 1985-1986, Los Angeles 1987 and Beijing 1995) and numerous 5k and 10k races. He is also a Black Belt in Taekwondo/Karate.
He achieved all these sporting accomplishments, while being a top consultant physician and cardiologist and a medical administrator. He specialised in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Disease. He is a Fellow American College of Cardiology (FACC)-1985, Fellow American College of Chest Physicians (FCCP)-1985 and Fellow American College of Physicians (FCAP)-1990. He held the position of president Los Angeles County Medical Association 1984 and from 1982 to 1986, served in the Los Angeles County Medical Association Board of Governors.
The Annual Prize Giving at St. Benedict’s College is the most important event in the school calendar and Bro. Director Henry Dissanayake has rightly invited a person of rare calibre Dr.Cyril Ernest and his wife Indrani as chief guests for this event. Dr Ernest’s daughters Cheryl and Melanie will also join their parents at this memorable occasion.
Bro. Henry Dissanayake will definitely hold Dr. Ernest as a role model for young Benedictines to follow and Dr. Ernest would most likely share his experiences, some words of wisdom and plenty of advice to the young hopefuls. He has been a great benefactor of the College and has supported many infrastructure development projects and helped SBC at cricket and athletics. In fact, the Bowling Machine presently used by the Benedictine cricketers was donated by him.
