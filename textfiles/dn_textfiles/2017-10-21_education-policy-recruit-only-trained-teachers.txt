Education policy to recruit only trained teachers

An education policy where only trained teachers will be recruited to the government service will be introduced in the future, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday as he handed over teaching appointments to science teachers who achieved National Diplomas in Teaching.
Addressing the diploma holders at a ceremony at Temple Trees, he asked the Minister of Education to speedily submit necessary legislation to the Cabinet to turn the policy into law.Sixty percent of teachers in the national cadre do not have university degrees or diplomas in teaching, said the Prime Minister, as he spoke of the biggest problem in the country’s education system.
“The Finance Secretary, Minister of Education and I recently went on a tour of Finland to study their education system.
"They have the best education system in the world, and all their teachers are graduates while principals and administrators hold postgraduate degrees,” said the Premier as he noted that a Finnish teacher would spend up to four years to qualify to teach.
“Thirty one years ago, when I visited Finland, I saw the emphasis on teacher training and thus we came back and established the National Institute of Education and special streams of education.
"When the 13th Amendment was presented, we included a clause which stated that all teacher training should be conducted by the central government,” said Wickremesinghe.“If we had continued our training programmes, our education system would have been vastly improved,” he added.
The Premier explained that Sri Lanka lagged behind because politicians could not take the important decision that teacher training was a must.
“When we train teachers, the education level of students improve. With untrained teachers, the education level drops,” he said, adding that most trained teachers tend to be in urban centres while rural areas get poor quality teachers.“The Provincial Councils have to take responsibility for this. They do not recruit trained teachers into their cadre,” he added.
The Prime Minister said in future, all appointees would have to be trained and existing untrained teachers would be given training. As Sri Lanka looks to become the Education Hub of the Indian Ocean, the Prime Minister hoped that the diploma holders of today would be able to achieve that vision.
“At present, we still have the highest number of school going children in South Asia but at the same time, we have the least number of trained teachers,” said the Premier.
He expressed hope that the new appointees would choose to further their education during the course of their career to be the most qualified teachers in the country.
