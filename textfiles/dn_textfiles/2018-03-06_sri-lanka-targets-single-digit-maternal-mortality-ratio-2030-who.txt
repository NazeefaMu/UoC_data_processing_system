Sri Lanka targets single digit maternal mortality ratio by 2030 - WHO

Sri Lanka is targeting single digit maternal mortality ratio by 2030. Sri Lanka has reduced maternal mortality ratio from almost 2,000 deaths per 100,000 live births in the 1930s to 33 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015, Public Health Success in Sri Lanka published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.
According to the publication, there is comprehensive, island-wide access to MCH care. There are currently 343 health units, 77 hospitals with Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care services, 517 hospitals with Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care services and 474 primary health care units in the country.
Sri Lanka has experienced a huge increase in the number of skilled practitioners attending to births. In 1940, 30 percent of births were attended by skilled practitioners, compared to 99.9 percent of births in 2015, the publication says.
Each year, 103,500 Sri Lankans die from non-communicable diseases,such as heart disease, lung disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. NCDs account for three in every four deaths in Sri Lanka. One out of three people have raised blood pressure, one in three adults are either overweight or obese, the publication points out.
