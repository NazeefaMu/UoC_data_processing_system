Qatar opens visa centre in Kotte

The Qatar Visa Centre was opened at Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte recently.
“Having a Qatar Visa center in Sri Lanka will facilitate the work procedures of Sri Lankan expatriates migrating to the State of Qatar and also preserve and protect their rights via application of best practices benchmarked with international standards,” said the State of Qatar ambassador in Colombo, Dr Rashid bin Shafea Al- Marri at the inauguration of the first Qatar Visa Centre in Sri Lanka.
It will also encourage Sri Lankan tourists to travel to Qatar. The ambassador said Qatar Visa Centres will be commissioned in eight more countries in the next few months.
“Colombo was chosen as the pioneering country because of the friendly relationships. Many advantages in the project include, facilitating and speeding up the procedure of recruiting expatriate workers, protecting their rights, documenting employment contract and speeding up his/her work immediately upon arrival in Qatar,” he said.
Information services for visa applicants are offered in English, Arabic, Sinhala and Tamil at multiple touch points as regards appointment scheduling, requirements and procedures.
The visa center equipped with state-of-the-art biometric enrollment and medical test facility is monitored and observed by the authorities in the State of Qatar.
“Within 24 hours the whole process with regard to visa issuing will be completed which is the USP of this service.
