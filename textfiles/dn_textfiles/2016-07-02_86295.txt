Isipathana St. Peter’s should be a thriller

The confrontation between Isipathana College and St. Peter’s College in their inter-school Milo President’s Trophy knockout semi-final at the Royal Sports Complex at 4.30 pm today should turn out to be a closely fought out affair.
With both teams boasting of powerful packs and speedy sets of three quarters a terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. Isipatana is enjoying a wonderful season having emerged as the unbeaten league champions in the Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league winning all their matches. The Peterites came up with some superb performances in the latter part of the league tournament to finish in fifth position despite losing four matches.
Isipatana entered the semi-final with a walkover from D.S. Senanayake College in the quarterfinals due to them pulling out of the tournament in the very last minute. The Peterites stormed into the semi-finals with a smashing 37-31 win over St. Anthony’s College Kandy in their quarterfinals.
Isipathana skipper Kushan Indunil has led the side admirably and has been a source of inspiration to his teammates with his fiery loose play and has been ably supported by that cracking flanker Devin Gunaratne, Sharuk Manabarana, Ekanayake, hooker Hasitha Mapitigama, Lahiru Wishvajith, Kaveesha Madushan, Adeesha Weeratunge, Sashmitha Fernando and the omnipresent number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe. Today they will be confronted by equally good forwards in Rahal Delpachithra, Ravin Yapa, Harin Biyanwila, Senura Premawardene, Narendra Perera, Angelo Mendis, Sajith Seram and the indefatigable open side flanker Shane Gurusinghe.
In Harith Bandara and Randy Silva the Pathanians have a superb halves combination with Bandara’s daring breaks having the opponents defence in disarray. In Indunil and vice-captain Sumudhu Rankothge Isipathana have two hard running centres who are capable of tearing apart the Peters defence.
The biggest threat to the Peterites could be posed by those powerful runners on the wing in Chamod Fernando and Ranindu Padmasanka while full back Gayan Wickramaratne has the knack of joining the line to form the overlap.
St. Peter’s three quarters too have played a key role in their success this season.
The halves combination of vice-captain Avishka Heenpalle and Steven Sivaraj have hit it off smoothly.
Sivaraj has the ability to pick the tiniest of gaps while his long kicks to touch have given them territorial advantage. In captain Sandesh Jayawickrama as the inside centre and the two speedy wingers Ramesh Fernando and Luke Lakshan have time and again pierced the opponents defence with their deceptive runs while outside centre Theekshana Dasanayake is likely to test the Pathana defence to the hilt with his daring runs down the flank in addition to their attacking full back Diyath Fernando.
Isipatana will strive to break the one-year jinx having last won the President’s Trophy in 2014 under Shenal Deelaka de Silva while the Peterites will aim to lay their hands on the trophy for the sixth time since the inception of the tourney in 1995 when they were the first winners.
They last won this trophy in 2010 under the leadership of Keith Gurusinghe who is incidentally the elder brother of present Peterite dashing flanker Shane Gurusinghe.
