THE WHEEL OF BRISBANE IN HER WIELDING AMBIENCE

Riding on The Wheel of Brisbane and viewing Brisbane from Mt. Coottha are unquestionably and undoubtedly quotable unforgettable magic memories from the land of kangaroos. Recently, I had the good fortune to experience this rare pleasure and I had my fill. Re-visiting my landscape of magic memories in the land of kangaroos and taking you to my newly widened horizon is naturally a literary pilgrimage for me. Could you be the inquisitive pilgrims on riding the wheel of Brisbane of much fame?
The wheel of Brisbane is the most spectacular view to any first traveller to the well-kept planned city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia.
This eye catching metallic structure has been making her magical rounds since its opening to the public in 2008. One would raise his eye brows when I give the weight of this great engineering feat as 365 tons.
The total number of passengers that could ride on one sitting is 336. A rider could enjoy a panoramic view at 360 degrees as it is projected. It touches the city skyline at 60 metres.
The secret of its mesmerizing brightness is its subtle array of 60,000 lights on the structure. A wanderlust visitor could see her sister wheels in Paris, Cape Town, Malaysia and Atlanta.
Broader perspective
Let me salute the ultra-active intelligence and superb imagination of Dutch observation wheel designer Ronald A Bussink for giving mankind an enjoyable edifice to enjoy and treasure. It stands majestically in the land of kangaroos, yet I humbly think that it belongs to the human race on the broader perspective of sharing and caring unless my deliberations hurt Aussie sentiments.
A ride on it is a must experience to relish life. In a nutshell, the Wheel of Brisbane is a true landmark on planet earth.
In order to imbibe the real pleasure of the wheel experience in Brisbane one has to have a stroll in relaxation along the Brisbane River. I did it on your behalf as a writer of this esteemed newspaper. It is the longest river in South East Queensland. The picturesque winding flow of an approximate length of 346km is another piece of poetry for me.
Bridge making acumen of the Australian road engineers is inscribed in the 16 bridges over Brisbane River. It is the home for a massive population of bull sharks and so one has to take his own risk in having a dip. These aggressive creatures would pounce at you from any hidden corner and you would end in a watery grave, beware! I had the good fortune to have a relaxed stroll along the Brisbane River on the well-paved walkway for pedestrians; one has to take care as the cyclists take their rides along towards the new farm park.
It is said that every dark cloud has a silver lining.
Human imagination
The flood havoc that Brisbanehad experienced in 2011 had smashed the original walkway, but they have now rebuilt it to withstand any larger flood. The capacity of the Brisbane flood protection dam is calculated at holding twice the volume of water in the Sydney harbour.
The ravage of the flood havoc had been so catastrophic that it had almost erased the comely city of BRISBANE from the map. Human imagination builds cities and countries. Yet, its aesthetic aspect is injected to them by connoisseurs of every hue.
There lies the fun of Brisbane bridge facts. GO BETWEEN BRIDGE has been named after a local rock group. Merivale is another name of a bridge and its significance is that in the inner city of Brisbane the trains cross the river on it. William Jolly Bridge is another. The Aboriginal name for place for rats is ‘’KURILPA’’ I wonder whether my name also has originated from Aborigines as I am so attached to the land of kangaroos. Anyway, Kurilpa Bridge across this long river is a name to reckon. Halfway across the river stands Goodwill Bridge that features a café.
Brisbane could boast of zero air pollution and it facilitates the viewer atop the wheel to enjoy a land stretch of 28km. Not only the humans, but also our pretty lizards are said to have comfortably climbed the wheel! Why not you?
Australia’s only city beach is situated away from a short stroll from the wheel. The lifesavers are on their routine patrol there to rescue any bather in this huge water mass which could hold twice the amount of water than the Olympic swimming pool. I felt it as the calmest stretch of water to cool one’s body in the company of water lovers from around the globe.
Dining galleries
The south bank parklands are the destination of many wanderlust travellers who relax in eco comfort to their utmost fill. In this multifaceted complex dining galleries, avant-garde theatres, museums, shopping arcades are located for the maximum convenience of the visitor. Ever – blooming bougainvillea drape the curled spires in eye catching designs to enchant you. Brisbane ranks as one of the rapidly growing cities in Australia and caters to a huge population of more than 2 million people. Brisbane is to pronounce BRIZ-BUN to sound correct and it is said to be the third largest city of the country and the capital of Queensland. Central Plaza One, Infinity Tower, 1 William St currently under construction enhances the modernity of the city towering towards the blue sky.
The Wheel of Brisbane could also be well enjoyed on a boat ride in the BRISBANE RIVER. It is the city ambience that upholds the fun of the Wheel Ride. A single ride lasts for about twenty-five minutes and approximately six rounds to give the rider a better view. I am longing for a re-visit to refill my waning magic memory.
