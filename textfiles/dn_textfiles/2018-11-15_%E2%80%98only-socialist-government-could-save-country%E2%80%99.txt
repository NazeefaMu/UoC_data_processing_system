‘Only socialist government could save country’

Although the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) considered the dissolution of Parliament as an anti-democratic measure, it also believed that the act was warranted by the Speaker’s partisan attitude, FSP National Organiser Kumara Gunaratnam said.
He was addressing the Il Maha Viru Samaruwa commemoration ceremony organised by the Frontline Socialist Party at the Kandy Postal Department complex auditorium on November 13.
Gunaratnam alleged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was instrumental in implementing the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement through the backdoor, without submitting it for Parliamentary approval.
The former PM had failed to grant relief packages to the people as he had promised, Gunaratnam said, adding that Wickremesinghe had issued other false promises to the people as well.
Late President J.R. Jayawardene implemented a neo-liberial economic programme and introduced the free-market economy to the country. This caused irreparable damage to the economy. Nearly 60,000 youths lost their lives during his regime, which even attempted to privatise health and other public welfare services, the FSP national organiser said.
The dharmishta (righteous) rule he promised was restricted to mere words and the Communist Party, as well as the People’s Liberation Front (PLF), were banned during his rule, Gunaratnam said; only a socialist government could save the country from its present plight. He said that the country was today in peril due to the tug-o’-war between two political groups. India, the US, and the UK, which demanded the re-convening of Parliament, had no right to do so because they themselves had broken Parliamentary and democratic traditions.
Today the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had been disgraced. The PLF and the United National Party were instrumental in bringing President Maithripala Sirisena to power, he said, adding that the country could never attain economic development under a capitalist system.
Gunaratnam said that although the 100-day government introduced a relief budget, the expenditure involved had been added to the normal budget introduced later, placing an excessive burden on the people.
