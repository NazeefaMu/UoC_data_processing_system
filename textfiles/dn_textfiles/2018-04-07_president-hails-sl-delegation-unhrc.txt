President hails SL delegation at UNHRC

The Sri Lankan delegation at the UNHRC did a splendid job by presenting Sri Lanka’s position in a very positive manner.
Addressing the heads of media institutes at the President’s House in Colombo, yesterday President Maithripala Sirisena, said that his government does not support the view of the international community that foreign judges should hear matters relating to the alleged military exercises in Sri Lanka during the ethnic conflict. He said they are against it as a policy.
The President said Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana was ably assisted by Ministers Dr.Sarath Amunugama and Faizer Musthapha in this endeavour.Referring to discussions with Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, he said the Opposition Leader had not demanded anything that the majority would not approve.That was his stance throughout, said the President, adding that he was thankful to the Opposition Leader for the stand he had taken.
