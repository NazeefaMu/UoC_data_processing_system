Defensive Driving workshop to train drivers

A Defensive Driving Training workshop was conducted for drivers of Brandix buses and vans last month at the Autodrome in Pannala.
A team of five trainers from the Driver Development Academy in the Philippines (TRSDDA) conducted the workshop.
Around 150 drivers underwent the training programme, and at the end of it certificates were awarded to the drivers who successfully completed the training.
While they plan to train the rest of the drivers of the Brandix transport fleet in Jan 2018. Brandix is also looking at conducting this training all drivers as a CSR project as well.
