Kandy SC lost their discipline in the second half

 After a spectacular win over the Sailors last weekend, Kandy SC followed that up with a 34-23 win over Police SC at Police Park, Bambalapitiya on Saturday. After an entertaining first half the Cops piled up the pressure on the number two team in the league. Kandy Sports Club was able to win the game due to a fine performance in the first half through the clever thinking of fly half Fazil Marija. At half-time the winners led 31-8 and it looked like as if though Kandy would step up a gear and switch on the same style of play which they are famous for in the second half. However in this game they were able to score only a penalty in the second half and in the alternate Police SC scored 15 points to make the final score 34-23.
Thanks to some heroic performances by the Cops on their home ground a fine brand of rugby was dished out. Police looked like a revamped outfit after their narrow loss to Air Force SC which would have caused some chaos in their ranks. Anyway the winners from the hills know how to hold their heads high in a game of rugby when the going is tough. Referee Irshad Cader enjoyed a good game by being on the spot where the action was right from the first whistle. It was one of the best game's he had blown this season.
Police scored in the third minute of the game and in the last third minute. It was sad to see only a handful of committee members from both clubs present at this game but the rugby fans were there as usual. Roshan Weeraratne the skipper had to stay out of this game due injury. This also was a big loss as he reads the game well and makes the necessary changes when needed. Sad to say in this game Kandy were losing their player discipline- offloading in dangerous positions when they don't need to and committing silly mistakes. The second half was very scrappy and disappointing. There was no consistency in their play which led to mistakes where Police took advantage to get back to the game, and Kandy also made replacements when it was not needed. Police played together as a team thanks to their coach Sudath Sampath, the former Police SC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka scrum half. Kandy usually work wide to use the on-fire Richard Dharmapala who has been sensational this season but was struggling in the second half. Thilina Wijesinghe has been the unsung hero for the hill capital and was judged the Man of the Match at this game.
