Heat a big issue at SSC - Chandimal

The heat at the SSC played a big part in two stages for Dinesh Chandimal who carved out his seventh Test hundred for his country and his first against Australia.
When Chandimal came to bat his team was in a crisis having lost four wickets for 24 and Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon threatening to run through the batting.
But with newcomer Dhananjaya de Silva, Chandimal rescued the side with a double century partnership that saw Sri Lanka eventually post a respectable score of 355.
“It was a tough time to bat on. I learnt lot of things from my last four innings. I was under pressure before this innings. I didn’t play that well the reverse (swinging) ball. Because of that, I changed (my batting) a bit,” said Chandimal.
“Since we’ve lost five wickets, I couldn’t go for my shots as I usually do. My thinking was to face more balls and get the Aussie bowlers to toil in this heat. Later on I thought of going for few shots when they got tired.
“It was also a crucial time. We all know the heat here. If we could keep Australia out in the heat here, we can get the advantage when they’re batting,” he said.
However by trying to wear out the Australians on the field the intense heat also got to Chandimal physically.
He suffered from dehydration having batted for almost eight hours and was barely able to answer questions from the media at the end of the day.
Chandimal did not don the wicket-keeping gloves during the Australian innings although he was on the field. Kusal Perera substituted for him behind the wickets.
“I was feeling a bit giddy when I came off the field which I think is due to dehydration,” Chandimal said.
“The heat is really tough here in Colombo, than in Galle and Pallekele. If this is so much difficult for us, it’s definitely more difficult for them. We’ll have to make use of that and play well in the next three days.” - ST
