CA Sri Lanka, IRCSL report presented to IIRC

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) in collaboration with the Integrated Reporting Council of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) recently launched ‘A Supplement to A Preparer’s Guide to Integrated Corporate Reporting’ in the presence of Richard Howitt, Chief Executive Officer of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
The supplement aims to provide implementation assistance on the workings of the Guiding Principles to corporates engaged in Integrated Reporting covering; connectivity of information, stakeholder relationships, materiality, conciseness, reliability and completeness, consistency and comparability.
Integrated Reporting is gaining popularity worldwide as a secondary reporting framework which requires disclosures relating to many areas, such as human capital, intellectual capital, issues material to the organization, etc.
