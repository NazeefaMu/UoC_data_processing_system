Half-baked romance

Beautiful locations that take your breath away, impossibly gorgeous people, humungous homes, evergreen songs and catchy dances, the twist in tales which leave you begging for more and tear jerking endings… This is what globally renowned director Karan Johar is best known for. So there is no doubt that fans who vie for the beautiful side of cinema and life have expected pretty much the same magic that he had performed with his previous movies when they visited cinemas to watch his latest cinematic project.
However Johar’s 2016 venture ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ is a far cry from the likes of ‘Kuch Kuch Hotha Hai’, ‘Kabhi Kuhi Kabhi Gahm’, ‘Ka Ho Na Ho’, ‘My Name is Khan’ and ‘Student of the Year’. Though it encompasses most of the ingredients which makes it a Karan Johar film, what lets it down badly is its plot. There is too much of emphasis on Ayan’s obsession with Alizeh and too many scenes which remind us of previous Karan Johar films.
Committed relationship
The plot revolves around four characters Ayan is blue blood rich but his ambition is to become a singer. The fiery Alizeh seems to be the bold and easy going character but her venerable side is her love for Ali. Saba is happily single after divorce. However she is looking for love though she does not want a committed relationship.
Ayan and Alizeh strike up a friendship after meeting at a bar. They are both similar in character with common tastes. However as time passes Ayan realizes that he wants more from the relationship. When both have broken up from the relationship they decide to spend a luxurious few weeks in Paris. There Alizeh unexpectedly comes upon her long lost love.
As usual the heightened emotions and the messy love-you-hate-you and can’t-live-without moments are at the center of the tale. This is Johar’s strength as well as weakness. Such scenes are nothing new in his movies so much so that one always gets a feeling of déjà vu when one sees such a scene. On the other hand this is what makes the creation one of the most felt works in Bollywod cinema. He is one of the few Indian filmmakers who manage to jerk out a tear from even the coldest hearts.
Glamour is also one of the features connected with Johar’s work but as characters are taken over by their emotions and suffer from their losses, the glitter is kept at bay. This adds some realism to the tale.
Well-rounded character
The star of the movie is probably Anushka Sharma who plays the well-rounded character of Alizeh. She is quite remarkable in this production and shares good chemistry with her co star. One cannot help feeling that Ranbir Kapoor cold have dished out a better performance as Ayan. Aishwarya has nothing to do but look beautiful in the story. She shouldn’t have taken up a character with so little depth in the first place.
There comes a day when one wonders if Johar is bankrupt in fresh ideas. ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ is one such movie which could have been made differently but gives the same old to its audience.
