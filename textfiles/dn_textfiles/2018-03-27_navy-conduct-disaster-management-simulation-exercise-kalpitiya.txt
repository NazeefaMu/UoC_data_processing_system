Navy conduct disaster management simulation exercise in Kalpitiya

A Disaster Management Simulation Exercise conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy concluded at the Rapid Action Boat Squadron (RABS) Headquarters in Kalpitiya on March 23. The simulation exercise was held under Deputy Chief of Staff and Director General Operations of the Navy Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva.
Ten officers and 81 sailors attached to the Rapid Action Boat Squadron participated in the event.
They were educated about how to respond to a disaster and were exposed to simulated conditions of flood and landslides to augment their skills in rescue and relocation of the victims during major catastrophes. The participants were educated on analysing, planning and management of relief efforts, during the programme.
The Gangè Wàdiya area where this simulation exercise was performed is ideally suited for such exercises particularly it being located close to the lagoon and Kalà Oya. The location is one of the famous destinations of naval personnel attached to RABS who regularly performs Disaster Preparedness and Response Training Programmes.
Wanathavilluwa Divisional Secretariat Chathuraka Jayasinghe, Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management Country Director Irzan Hashim, Deputy Director (Emergency Operations) of Disaster Management Centre JAMR Jayarathna, Puttalam District Disaster Management Coordinator Lieutenant Colonel PAJ Rodrigo, Staff Sergeant - US Embassy, Captain Jeff Benton, and several government officials participated.
