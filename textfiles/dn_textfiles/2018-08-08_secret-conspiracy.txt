Death of Artygalle
Secret of a conspiracy

“Death of Dixon Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics: Sensational Trial 112 years Ago” is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotelawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for preeminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
After the ‘not so harmonious’ wedding ceremony of the eldest daughter, the Artygalles’ concern for the future of the other two girls became greater than before, prompting them to find two educated grooms from affluent families-a few years after Mudaliar passed away leaving two unmarried girls and the only son, for widow Mrs Peternella Artigalle, nee Abeykoon to accept proposals brought in by the marriage brokers for her two younger daughters.
‘Second in the family Leena married Col. T.G. Jayewardene an engineer, who had four lawyer siblings; including Supreme Court Judge E.W (JR Jayewardene’s father); the third sister Ellen to Barrister F R Senanayake, MMC, Diplomat and older brother of D S Senanayake….’ Kumari Jayawardena-2007
Each of the second and third daughters, Leena and Ellen received 2861 and 3027 acres respectively of cultivated land, out of tea, rubber and coconut estates, plus a share of graphite mines, and Rs 200,000 in cash, [more than a century ago] as dowry–[Ref.-Nobodies to Somebodies: KJ-2007- pp 288] much more than the eldest girl Alice who married Kotelawala; an inequitable and unpardonable discrimination that brew hatred and jealousy in the mind of John. The youngest in the family Francis Dixon was yet a minor attending school at Wesley College, Pettah, who won the accolades of its Head-master P C Dias.
Singhoni Perera, the loyal Police sergeant who served under John Kotelawala (Snr) in the police, resigned from the department along with his superior officer at the latter’s request who promised a job with the enormous Attygalle Estate which he was managing since the father-in-law, Mudaliar Geromis Artygalle’s untimely death.
Kahatagaha mines
Mrs Petronella Artygalle, the mother-in-law filed a case in the District Court, Kurunegala to expel John Kotelawala [Snr] from the management of properties belonging to other three children, as she considered him to be disloyal to the rest of the heir to the estate; her three other children, and also was suspicious that he was planning to take over the management in full from young brother-in-law Francis Dixon after John’s retirement from Police.
Francis left Wesley College at the age of 16, but he was too immature and inexperienced apart from being a legal minor to take over the management from the veteran police officer brother-in-law. The mother of Artygalles made a special representation through her lawyers to the colonial Governor requesting the use of Governor’s powers to grant his son Francis Dixon, a minor at the time, conferred with, ‘Letters of Venia Aetatis’, [entitling the minor to the rights and liabilities of a person of full age under Roman Civil Law] making him a major; which the Governor obliged.
Kotelawala on his own decided to assist the management of Kahatagaha mines owned by Artygalles including his wife Alice, and managed by Francis his brother-in-law, by visiting the mines with Singhoni and few other loyalists on a regular basis. On one such occasion, as designed by Francis, when Kotelawela and his men were within the perimeters, a large gathering of workers and people from the area all supporters of young man came to attack them; they heckled, jeered and finally detained Kotelawala and Sergeant Singoney in a nearby house. Singhoni, particularly and singularly was victimized as he resisted the move.
At the intervention of a friend of both parties they were subsequently released from detention after being in captivity for one full day. Kotelawela who did not have a strong or unreasoning desire for revenge did not take this humiliation seriously though with disgrace and fury, he openly declared that ‘Artygalle would be done away with soon’ in the presence of the gathering but did not retaliate immediately.
Income of enormous family estate
The second marriage of Artygalle’s Colamunne walawwa took place when Leena married civil engineer Theodore G Jayewardene. Theodore a member of the most prominent in professional class of Politico-Legal family of Jayewardenes based in the city. TG later became the first Ceylonese commanding officer of the Ceylon Light Infantry [CLI] and reached the rank of Colonel. TG was an elected member of the State Council from 1933 to 1936. Theodore had four brothers, all practicing lawyers including JR Jayewardene’s father Eugene Wilfred Jayewardene [EW], the King’s Counsel and Judge of the Supreme Court who played a leading role in the review and comparison of the new Criminal Procedure Code. Kotelawala became suspicious of Artygalles after their association with Jayewardenes of Colombo— a family of too many lawyers meant an obvious threat to his position and activities and the questionable way he handled the income of enormous family estate. His anger and bitterness of the union was exposed when he viciously decided to insult the groom’s party at the wedding held at Colummune Artigalle Walawwa itself by making some highly disparaging remarks against the groom’s party, the Jayewardenes. He also referred to them as Thambis. [TG’s grandfather and JR Jayewardene’s great-grandfather, Don Adrian Jayewardene served the Dutch rulers in the latter part of 18th Century as ‘Tombi’, meaning intelligence agent: and later under British as Tombi Mudaliar in charge of a group of Agents: the term Tombi was corrupted or misinterpreted as Thambi, a derogatory remark coined by racist elements to identify Moors or Muslims] John’s behaviour on this auspicious occasion angered Bride’s brother young Francis Dixon.
He was furious, quite natural for a youngster of his age, he could not control his temper and annoyance-Francis landed a thundering slap on John’s face in the presence of the gathering, which sealed his own fate and destiny.
Kotelawala warned the brother of his wife in his own inimitable manner saying, “Remember, this is not the first time…, mind you …, you have dug your own grave”, a threat to which most invitees present at the wedding bore witness to; but did not intend in proceeding beyond that. He decided to move away from interfering with Artygalle family fortunes and he launched a new company under the title, Ceylon-Japan Trading Co., for the purpose of engaging in import export trade with Japan. John Kotelawala then sailed to Japan in search of Plumbago importers in that country.
Singhoni Perera, the former Police sergeant now in retirement had a cousin named Baron Perera, with whom he related the story of John Kotelawala and his brother-in-law Francis Artygalle and the roles both of them, that is JK and Singhoni played in the management of Kahatagaha Mines. The saga about mocking, jeering and holding Singhoni and Kotelawala in custody overnight too was related to cousin Baron. Sergeant Singoney appeared to be very much disturbed, he did not take this humiliation trivially, and a desire for revenge was brewing in him. Baron was asked to search for a trustworthy assassin.
The name of the eldest daughter of Mudaliar Gemoris Artygalle, Alice, who married John Kotelawale [snr] was erroneously stated in a previous article. We regret the error.
