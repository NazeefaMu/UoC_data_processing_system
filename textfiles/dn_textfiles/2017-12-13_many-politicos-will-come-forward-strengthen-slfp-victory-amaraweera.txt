Many politicos will come forward to strengthen SLFP victory: Amaraweera

Many politicians would come forward to strengthen the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to confirm a clean victory at the forthcoming Local Government election, UPFA General
Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He added that a considerable number of political parties had expressed their concern to join the SLFP, aiming to create a broad alliance to face the next election.
“Discussions are being held with several political parties and politicians. Politicians from several levels including national, provincial and grass root levels, would join the SLFP in due course,” he said.
According to Amaraweera, there is no doubt about SLFP’s victory at the forthcoming LG election. The SLFP will sweep the board, he said.
He added that there was a huge demand for receiving SLFP nominations to contest at the next election. Those who wish to create a SLFP Government in 2020, are rallying round the SLFP and President Sirisena. He requested the persons who wished to create a clean government free of malpractices by 2020, to walk hand in hand with the SLFP.
The Minister added that it was reported that certain persons were trying to put the government in trouble by levelling various allegations and creating displeasure over the government.
According to him, the long standing SAITM issue and trade union actions of railway workers, may be the result of such coups launched to create displeasure over the government.
He said that it was unethical and an injustice to put the general public and students who sit the Ordinary Level Examination in difficulties through unjustifiable trade union action.
Asked whether the NFF and JO members, who joined the SLFP have demanded anything when joining, Minister Amaraweera said that they joined the SLFP only with the intention of strengthening the hands of President Sirisena.
“They haven’t demanded anything,” he said.
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana, addressing the media, said that the Joint Opposition had no intention of assisting the SLFP when they come for talks. The JO representatives requested several unfair demands at the discussion table, with the aim of not joining the SLFP.
“Even though the JO representatives demanded to quit the government, while three of the JO representatives who came for talks were ministers of the 100 Day Unity Government,” he said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, addressing media said, it had been scheduled to hold 22 political meetings at district level, based under the patronage of the President. Besides, there would be 360 political meetings at the electoral level and there would be more than 20,000 pocket meeting at GS division level.
