Over 600 expatriate workers die  abroad annually

Over 600 Sri Lankan expatriate workers die annually while working abroad, said Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake.
He was addressing an awareness programme for regional politicians and officials in Polonnaruwa, recently.
Initial discussions were also held during this programme on measures to open a ministry consular mobile service in Polonnaruwa for the convenience of Sri Lankan expatriate workers and their families.
This would enable them to get their official matters attended to locally by saving time and unnecessary hassle involved in travelling to Colombo for such work.
Polonnaruwa GA Ranjith Ariyaratne and other officials were present.
