Tense situation at filling station

A tense situation arose between the customers and employees of a filling station at Kokkawil in the Jaffna Peninsula, yesterday, due to quantities of water being mixed with diesel.
It was further reported that some of the tractors with oil tanks containing diesel filled from the said filling station, were stuck in mud when they were running on paddy fields in the area.
However, the argument which began with some customers and employees of the filling station developed to a fray. Later, the dispute was quelled by the involvement of a third party, while the customers had launched a complaint about the incident to the Kokkawil Police.
Following the complaint, officers attached to the Kokkawil Police station had visited the said filling station for an investigation and taken some oil samples.
Meanwhile, they have ordered to the manager of the filling station to avoid issuing oil to vehicles till they receive the statement on the quality of oil samples.
However, at the time of the investigation, it was also reported that the manager of the said filling station had told the Police that there was a possibility of mixing water into diesel tanks due to the heavy rain that occurred during the last few days.
