One in five public sector employees suffer from stress

One in every five Sri Lankan public sector employees suffer from stress, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. According to Minister Senaratne, the fact has been mentioned in the statistics documented in the Mental Health Unit of the Health Ministry. The number of persons who seek medical treatment for mental disorders shows an increase, according to the same statistics. He was addressing the gathering after opening the Pearl Child Guidance Centre at Aluthgama, Moragolla recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the people's mental stress and mental disorders have increased due to the problems they have in their offices and homes. Busy and competitive lifestyles have also led to this situation.
The entire society is impacted by this negative trend.
Children's mental health should also be improved.
It is the duty of all to provide all required facilities for children with special needs, ensure their safety and look after them well, the Minister added.
