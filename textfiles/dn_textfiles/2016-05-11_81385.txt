Prasad injury scare ahead of First Test

Spearhead of the Sri Lanka bowling attack Dhammika Prasad suffered shoulder niggle that saw him walk off the field in the middle of his 18th over in their 3-day tour match against Essex at Chelmsford.
Prasad the architect of Sri Lanka’s maiden Test series triumph in England in 2014 with figures of 5 for 50 at Leeds was forced to limp off the field during Essex’s first innings on the second day. His over was completed by Dimuth Karunaratne.
Team mate Kaushal Silva said that it was a “shoulder niggle” but the management later confirmed that Prasad would be sent for a precautionary scan.
“He's a big bowler for us,” Silva said. “He has been the spearhead for the last two years and in the last series against England he was the one who changed the game, so he's an important character in our bowling line-up.”
