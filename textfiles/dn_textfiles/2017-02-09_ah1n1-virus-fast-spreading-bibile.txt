A(H1N1) virus fast spreading in Bibile

A(H1N1) virus is fast spreading in the Bibile area with around 30 patients being warded at the Bibile hospital.
A separate ward has been established to house the A(H1N1) patients, hospital authorities said.
The virus circulates throughout the year in all tropical countries. The routine pattern of the illness shows peaks of infection in November, December, January, May, and in June. The death of three patients at the Kandy General Hospital is an unfortunate incident. They were victims of unexpected complications. Therefore, generally the public has no reason to panic about an Influenza A(H1N1) spread.
According to Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige, elderly people over 65 years or children below two years, pregnant women, mothers in postpartum period, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner to prevent complications.
Without panicking, the public needs to be vigilant. Some people develop complications very rarely. However, those who suffer from flu and feel short of breath or weakened health condition, should seek prompt treatments.
