A 10-month old male infant named Dewamullage Sasmitha Anuhas, died due to an insect getting stuck in his throat, around 8.30 pm on Tuesday.
The infant had picked up the insect and proceeded to put it in his mouth, while playing in the hall of their residence at Heiyanthuduwa. The mother of the child had attempted to pull the insect out, but being unsuccessful, had rushed him to the Kiribathgoda Hospital, where he was pronounced dead-on-arrival.
