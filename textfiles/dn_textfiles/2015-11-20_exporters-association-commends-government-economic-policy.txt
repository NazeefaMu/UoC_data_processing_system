The Exporters Association commends Government Economic Policy

The Exporters Association of Sri Lanka which is affiliated to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, recently communicated its fullest co-operation to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Malik Samarawickrema Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to address aspects within its purview, which will be necessary to implement the necessary methodology and mechanisms to enable the country to strengthen the economic sphere envisaged by the Government, through the Export Sector.
It welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement that he has 'proposed to adopt a competitive foreign exchange policy that will encourage and empower exports'. The EASL has frequently acknowledged the importance for Sri Lanka to link into global value chains. However it believes that this can only be achieved if Sri Lanka is acknowledged regionally, to have a stable labour policy and a workforce with a good reputation for high productivity.
The EASL has previously gone on record stating that an appropriate education strategy structured to meet the rapidly changing business demands must evolve for the country to progress economically. It therefore commends the proposed development of innovation centres, ICT and science knowledge hubs, and digital infrastructural services and to support investment in this lucrative business. The EASL opined that bringing the BOI and the SLEDB under a single Ministry will positively enable an environment of consistency and cohesion for Export enterprises to grow exponentially.
