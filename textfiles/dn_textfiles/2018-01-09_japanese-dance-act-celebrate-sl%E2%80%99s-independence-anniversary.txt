A traditional Japanese dance performance called 'Awa-Odori' will be presented at BMICH today as a part of the programme “Departure to the future of Sri Lanka and Japan” to celebrate the commemoration of the 70th Anniversary of Sri Lanka’s Independence.
Awa-Odori, one of the most popular and well-known festival dances in Japan, is a unique form of dance that originated in Tokushima Prefecture. The event is co-organized by the Honganji Foundation of Japan and the Embassy of Japan. The Embassy welcomes people to experience this traditional Japanese dance. The event is open to public from 6.00 pm to 9.00 pm and the entrance is free.
