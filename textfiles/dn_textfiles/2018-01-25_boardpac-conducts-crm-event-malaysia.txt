BoardPAC conducts CRM event in Malaysia

BoardPAC, home-gown multinational board meeting automation solutions provider, conducted a special customer relationship management (CRM) event in Malaysia recently, which attracted a number of BoardPAC customers of the country.
The meeting was a perfect platform to deliberate how boardroom level paperless automations by BoardPAC brought radical changes for their companies in 2017.
Organized with the collaboration of Maxis, the leading communications services provider in Malaysia and a main customer of BoardPAC, the CRM event was held recently at Maxis Tower (Menara Maxis).
Key clients who participated at the event include Maybank, Ekuinas, Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad, UTSB Management, MSIG Insurance, SME BANK and several other companies.
During the CRM meeting, customers shared insights and highlighted case studies on how they leveraged with the help of BoardPAC during 2017 to save time and money by automating their paper-intense board meeting processes, while reducing inefficiencies and increasing transparency.
They endorsed the intuitive meeting dashboard as well as the comprehensive yet simple back-end dashboard. While it brought immense convenience and immediate return on investment, many customers who took part in the meeting stated that BoardPAC’s iPad-enabled, paperless board communication and meetings solution gave them an opportunity to make quick decisions to rectify issues at a board level.
Commenting on the enthusiasm of many Malaysian customers on choosing BoardPAC, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of BoardPAC and IronOne Technologies, Lakmini Wijesundera said, “We are extremely happy to hear how BoardPAC has transformed our Malaysian customers in a significant way. Our easy to use, paperless platform has brought great changes for these companies in terms of improved boardroom collaboration, tighter boardroom security and synchronization of information through real time updates.”
“While thanking everyone who participated in this much-anticipated calendar event planned for Malaysia, we will be committed to provide our fullest support for Malaysian businesses in terms of state-of-the-art, convenient and secure board meeting solutions,” Lakmini Wijesundera stated further.
Maxis Head of End Solutions Syed Othman said, “The outcome of the event was as planned, and while BoardPAC has been the leader in paperless automated board meeting solutions in Malaysia, we are working closely with BoardPAC to expand its presence further across Malaysia.”
An award winning company which was placed in the IT and professional services sector as the winner across all sectors at the National Chamber of Exporters Awards 2017, BoardPAC provides users the ability to view and approve papers from the ease of a Board Member’s iPad.
The solution meets with the highest security standards including the ISO 27001 certification.
