If Govt. ignores Oversight Committees, JO will withdraw from them: Dullas

 If the Government is ignoring the Sectoral Oversight Committees in Parliament, the Joint Opposition MPs will consider withdrawing from them, UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma said.
He was speaking at a press conference at the Dr.N.M.Perera Memorial Hall in Borella yesterday.
He pointed out a copy on the draft agreement on the Hambantota Port Joint Venture has not been referred to the Oversight Committee.
He charged the Government is going to get the port agreement signed by concealing its vital information.
“If the Government is going ahead on this move without taking it up at the Oversight Committee, then our MPs will decide to withdraw from these committees” he said.
He observed the UNP and SLFP members in the Government ranks were making contradictory statements on the Hambantota Port Agreement while the Subject Minister is saying another story.
Commenting on the UNHRC proceedings, MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said a full day debate on this subject has been facilitated in Parliament on April 6 following a request from the Joint Opposition. He said the Government consented in Geneva to a resolution that goes against the country.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the MP admitted meeting the President and Prime Minister over the issue relating to MP Wimal Weerawansa. However, the MP declined to reveal to the media anything that was discussed during this meet up.
