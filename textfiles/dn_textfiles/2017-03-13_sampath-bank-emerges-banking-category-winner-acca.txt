Sampath Bank emerges Banking Category winner at ACCA

In tribute to its unwavering commitment to sustainability and corporate integrity, Sampath Bank was adjudged winner in the Banking Category at the prestigious Sustainability Reporting Awards 2016.
This was organized by the Association of Chartered Certified Accounts (ACCA), Sri Lanka, held at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, on February 28.
Being presented with this honour has asserted the dedication of the Bank towards upholding the values of corporate sustainability. Sampath Bank was recognized with the winner award for its 2015 Integrated Annual Report and has previously emerged the runner-up in the banking category category for two consecutive years.
Commenting on this achievement, Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank said, “Sustainability is an integral part of Sampath Bank’s status quo, and being presented with this award emphasizes this.
We strive to accomplish our corporate goals in sync with national priorities, while promoting global best practices for managing the economic, environmental and social impacts of the business.
We will continue to aim for excellence in our growth and performance, while maintaining the right balance between stakeholder expectations and our responsibility to the community. In this endeavor, our staff members provide weighty support to the success and long-term sustainability of the Bank.”
