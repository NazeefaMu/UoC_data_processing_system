Nation of builders

Minister of Higher Education and Highways
Sometimes we forget how far we have progressed as a nation. The Sri Lankan economy is navigating through a period of transformation, amidst global turbulence. Our country has enormous potential. Strengthening macroeconomic stability, complemented by supporting policies, has become crucial to realising our true potential.
We have strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and we are assured that under our Government Sri Lanka’s international reputation is restored and strong.
Sri Lanka has truly come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa – who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was in a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety.
For too long traffic congestion has been a daily part of the travel experience for Colombo commuters. Those travelling during rush hours endure lengthy delays and on rainy days, the situation is worse. The entrance to Rajagiriya from Kotte was one area where traffic congestion was at its worse.
The Rajagiriya flyover project, which will soon be completed, was launched with the objective of reducing traffic congestion on Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha and the Rajagiriya Junction. When completed it will be the longest in the country.
Substantial investment such as this - over Rs 4.5 Billion - is only possible because of the effective measures we have taken to transform and strengthen the economy.
Better future for all Sri Lankans
Our government is working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans. So far we have created more than 400,000 jobs and helped over 200,000 families secure a home. This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Our government’s initiatives have reduced fuel prices by 22 per cent and provided RS 20,000 to pregnant women. Strong action has meant that we have cut crime by a third and I am pleased that we have increased public sector salaries by RS 10,000. We are the builders. We are building a strong economy and now we are building homes for our people from the proceeds of endeavour. Housing is a human right and we are delivering homes for our hard working citizens. More homes, a stronger economy and we are building a better Sri Lanka.
Strong leadership
We have a proven record, a clear vision and the determination and strong leadership to build a better Sri Lanka for the future. In order to do so the economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
We know there is still more to do so that everyone can walk the streets safely, our children can get a good education, and basic food is affordable. We will not rest on our laurels and will continue our mission to transform Sri Lanka and deliver better lives for all our people. That is why the 2018 Budget has been so important. The economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.
