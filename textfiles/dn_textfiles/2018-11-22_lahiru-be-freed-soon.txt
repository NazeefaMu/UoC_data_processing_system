Lahiru to be freed soon

It is three years and a month since Lahiru Madusanka Manikkandura has been incarcerated at the Maafushi Prison in the Maldives, but he may soon taste freedom again, thanks to the efforts of Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha attended the recent inauguration of newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, where he once again reiterated his position to secure Lahiru’s release.
The promise of Lahiru’s release was renewed and it is now anticipated that he will be released in the next few days.
Lahiru Madusanka Manikkandura, better known as ‘Lahiru’, was incriminated with the charge of plotting to assassinate former Maldivian President Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom. He was accused of being a former Sri Lankan military officer with specialised training in sniping.
However, Lahiru was persistent in stating that he was innocent. At the time of his arrest, he claimed that he was recently married with a one-year-old son (now four years old), and was on the lookout for a job in the Maldives.
He had travelled to the Maldives on the promise of employment, but instead, he was framed with a major crime.
When the trial began, it was conducted in Dhivehi (the official language of Maldives), and Lahiru understood very little.
He was later given a translator. Allegations of torture had also sprung up by various pressure groups.
The Sri Lankan government constantly maintained an eye for Lahiru although there were profound limitations in respect of matters within their control.
Recently, Minister Musthapha intervened in the case and took the matter up with former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed and newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.
His efforts immediately bore fruit considering the good relationship between the parties negotiating and the countries concerned.
However, as the due process had already been initiated, Minister Musthapha also had discussions with the Attorney-General and the Maldivian Home Affairs Ministry.
The efforts yielded positive results and the Maldives promised that Lahiru would soon be released from the Maafushi Prison in the Maldives.
