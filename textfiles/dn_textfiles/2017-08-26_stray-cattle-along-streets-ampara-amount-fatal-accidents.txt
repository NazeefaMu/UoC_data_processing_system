Stray cattle along streets in Ampara amount to fatal accidents

Stray cattle in the Ampara district cause severe inconvenience to residents of the area.
A high number of stray cattle along the road lead to fatal accidents in the Ampara district coastal areas, residents complain.
Cattle owners do not maintain their cattle properly and let them wander along the streets day and night, the residents said.
The Road Development Authority and the local authorities have not taken any action to get rid of stray cattle on roads. The residents urge the Kalmunai and Akkaraipattu RDA branches and local authorities to take proper action in this regard.
