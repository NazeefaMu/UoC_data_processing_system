ACCA Sri Lanka enters North

Having established a strong presence in Western Province, Central Province and Southern Province, ACCA Sri Lanka further expanded its reach to the Northern Province.
As one of the many initiatives planned by ACCA Sri Lanka in offering equal opportunities to youth in all the regions of Sri Lanka, ACCA in collaboration with K-Aims Business School held a series of workshops in each of the zones in the Jaffna region.
The workshops were conducted by leading University lecturers. The four hour workshops conducted in each zone was based on Advanced Level exam based seminars for students studying for the commerce stream to help them eventually transit on to the ACCA qualification effortlessly.
In light of the lack of resources available for students in Jaffna wanting to enter into the field of finance, this initiative was part of ACCA’s efforts to give back to the community of Jaffna, by providing a platform and pathway for students to gain a globally accepted qualification such as ACCA.
