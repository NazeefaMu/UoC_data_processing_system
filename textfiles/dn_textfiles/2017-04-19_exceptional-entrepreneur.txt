Exceptional entrepreneur

Inner Wheeler Mala Weerasekere who needs no introduction was recognized for her outstanding contribution to society when she was awarded the prestigious Margaret Golding Award recently by non other than International Innerwheel President, Oluyemisi Alatise who flew down to Sri Lanka especially for the occasion.
“Having being in Inner Wheel for over 50 years, it has given me strength and inspiration and a meaning of togetherness and fulfillment. Our meetings bring joy and laughter and makes us one family of sisters. It takes 100 men to make an encampment – it takes one woman to make a home”, said Mrs Weerasekere speaking at the occasion.
Born to a family of great social workers and philanthropists, Mala has inherited all these qualities.
The Great Granddaughter of Mudaliyar Don Carolis Hewavitarne and the Grand Niece of Anagarika Dharmapala [ Don David Hewavitarne], Mala went on to become an astute businesswoman as well as a benevolent philanthropist whose generosity has benefitted thousands .
Mala learnt the fine art of Business Management under her father whilst working at the family firm , Don Carolis. As a result of Mala appealing to then President J. R. Jayawardena, the Parliamentary Complex Order scheduled to be given to Singapore, was instead given to Sri Lankan carpenters, resulting in both our people and the country benefitting. What was more important was what she learnt about the lives of the workforce and her efforts to improve their lot. Together with her husband, they converted Sinha Weerasekere’s ancestral home into a safe and secure home for the abandoned girl child, namely the Peter Weerasekere Home [ named after Sinha’s father ]. Today it houses 85 children whose ages range from two weeks to 18 years ! Mala herself personally supervises all aspects of the home which includes the food prepared, its nutritional aspect, their education, vocational training, physical and mental wellbeing, etc and ensures they are prepared for the outside world when they leave the home at the age of 18. Even thereafter Foster Mother Mala keeps in touch with the girls to ensure their wellbeing.
Mala is undoubtedly a role model. For those aspiring to a business career, as an entrepreneur, a home maker, a social worker, Mala is that rare person who has embraced all of these accomplishments within herself and carried out all these roles to perfection.
Amongst Mala’s many achievements are the setting up of a Dialysis Unit for Kurunagala’s Civil Hospital along with a 30 bed ward.
“Our largest project being Cancer, we set up two mammograms as well as a scanner”.
Blessed with four children and eight grandchildren as well three great grand children, Mala is a great believer in the power of women !
“I believe women can make it happen. We can recognize, prepare, activate and together navigate. Nothing is impossible. Sukarno said a 1000 men can help win a war. I say give us 10 capable women and we lead the world”.
