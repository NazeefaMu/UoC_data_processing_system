Senior citizens enjoy at HelpAge New Year festival

Unlike the elders in urban areas, in the olden days village elders were anxiously waiting for the dawn of the New Year. It was not because of anything else but because they wanted to take part in the traditional New Year games.
This situation has now changed and at present elders participating in traditional New Year games has become a common scene in the city of Colombo as well as in other urban areas. But, even in Colombo or other areas we rarely witness elders over 70 years take part in traditional games.
Last Thursday was an unforgettable day for about 40 male and female elders in H.P.Gooneratne Day Centre, Ratmalana. The Elders New Year festival was held at S.D.S Jayasinghe Ground, Dehiwala.
It was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) as a part of their social service programs, conducted annually for the welfare of underprivileged senior citizens . The festival was also witnessed by several foreign nationals who were on their way to the Dehiwala Zoological gardens.
This was not the first occasion HelpAge organized such a program. Every year various social programs are conducted by HelpAge for elders in addition to their flagship program of performing free cataract surgeries for needy elders at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta (Opposite Savoy Cinema). Helpage also organizes free mobile Medical and Eye Camps islandwide for elders welfare.
The New Year festival commenced at 9 am and ended around 3 pm. All the elders were between the ages of 60 to 73 years. HelpAge staff members also encouraged them in the games.
They were engaged in games such as the musical chairs competition, scraping coconuts and weaving cadjan competitions, placing the eye on elephant, bursting the balloon competition and breaking the pot by a blindfolded person.
HelpAge, Chirman Deshabandu Tilak de Zoysa was the Chief Guest, while HelpAge Council Member Nishantha Gooneratne was the Guest of Honour. HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge , Stores Executive Buddhika Nanayakkara , the officials and the staff of HelpAge were also present.
