President orders inquiry into Foreign Ministry statement condemning North Korea missile

 
President Maithripala Sirisena has asked that an investigation be conducted into a statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the ‘firing of a ballistic missile of intercontinental range by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 29 July.
The Ministry’s statement had condemned the missile launch and “the series of similar hostile attacks by DPRK in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions”.
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne addressing the Cabinet media briefing today explained that when the President had questioned both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister over the statement, they had informed him that they were unaware of it and had not approved it.
This is the first time the Sri Lankan government has issued a statement condemning North Korea.
The strongly worded statement had also called on DPRK to “refrain from such hostile acts and programmes, in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, which impact adversely on the stability of the region and beyond”.
The statement had further added: “The international community must unite in words and deeds to seek solutions to this grave situation which is an ever increasing threat to international peace and security”.
