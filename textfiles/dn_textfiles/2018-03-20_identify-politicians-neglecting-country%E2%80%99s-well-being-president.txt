Identify politicians neglecting country’s well-being: President

The general public should identify politicians who put political power before the well-being of the country, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
These politicians toil for personal agendas without prioritising the country, he pointed out. Such politicians are not interested in establishing peace and promote reconciliation in the country, he said.
President Sirisena was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held to hand over a new technical laboratory building to St. Patrick College, Jaffna. He handed over teaching appointments to a 197 graduates at the ceremony as well.
“I will never sever the trust people had in me when they appointed me in 2015 as the President,” the President said. He said that he would never change good governance policies due to political pressure and pointed out the necessity of honest politicians committed to solve the issues in the country.
President Sirisena said plenty of job opportunities have been opened in Japan for graduates with technology subjects. He said education is the key for a country’s development.
Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Jaffna Vicar General Very Rev Dr Justin B Gnanaprakasam,Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran participated.
