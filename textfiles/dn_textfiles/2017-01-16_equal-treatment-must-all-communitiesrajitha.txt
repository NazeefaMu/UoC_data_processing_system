Equal treatment a must for all communities:Rajitha

All communities should be given equal treatment, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said rumours spread about the government was baseless.
Tamil and Muslim communities should be given equal rights enjoyed by the Sinhalese, the minister said.
All Buddhists and Muslims should practice what their religions preached which will enable rid racism and religious and cast differences, the minister said at a ceremony in Colombo yesterday to mark Prophet Mohammad’s birth anniversary.
Minister Senaratne said the Muslims did much to create the present government.
"The government will always protect the Muslims. The government will assist Muslims during any problem and I will stand by Muslims all the time," he added.
