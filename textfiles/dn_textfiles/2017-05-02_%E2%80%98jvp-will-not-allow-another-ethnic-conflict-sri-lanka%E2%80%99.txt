‘JVP will not allow another ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka’

 The JVP shall not allow another ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka,JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. He was addressing the May Day rally at the BRC grounds, Colombo yesterday.
Dissanayake pointed out that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying to regain power by creating a false alarm about the return of terrorism to Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa is spreading racism and religious hatred to regain political power back, Dissanayake said.
Patriotism does not mean the spreading of racism among different ethnicities, which in exactly what Rajapaksa is doing, Dissanayake pointed out.
“After stepping down from the Presidency, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is still to do an analysis of the country’s economic plight ,nor has he made any remarks about the fragile situation the country is in, Dissanayake further said. “His only method is to inflict fear upon the people that the LTTE will raise its ugly head again. Rajapaksa also trying to create a friction between the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people,”the JVP Leader alleged.
“However, the JVP will assure that it will not in anyway allow the separatists to raise their heads again,”Dissanayake said.

Dissanayake further said, the Wickremesinghe-Sirisena government has a gloomy future and the JVP is awaiting a great political leap to give the necessary leadership for an independent and reconciled country.
“The May Day celebration and rally held for the first time in Jaffna by the JVP is a great exemple of national reconsiliation,” he added.
Dissanayake pointed out that the two mainstream political parties in Sri Lanka should be responsible for the country’s economic plight.
“We are at a debt crisis. We are not producing. We have privatised our production sources. We are in a situation where we cannot pay our foreign debts in the coming four years. Therefore, do you really believe these two mainstream political parties have the right to govern us?”Dissanayake asked.
Speaking on the SAITM issue, Dissanayake said there are certain groups who have an agenda to close down national universities. He said in 2015,2,200 undergraduate vacancies have not been filled. He said the rulers always try to deprive the working class of the right to education.
Dissanayake also said the 70-year-rule of main stream political parties should be held responsible for making the Sri Lankan nation a subservient one and for making Sri Lanka ‘a beggar’ in the international arena.
“We have become so enslaved by globalisation that, no responsible institute regarding foreign workers can give statistical data as to how many Sri Lankans are employed in foreign countries,” Dissanayake also pointed out.
He also challenged the government to cut taxes from the Employee’s Provident Fund against which the JVP is to launch a large scale resistance.
Dissanayeka also said the rulers need rules, or else they will not rule the nation properly.
