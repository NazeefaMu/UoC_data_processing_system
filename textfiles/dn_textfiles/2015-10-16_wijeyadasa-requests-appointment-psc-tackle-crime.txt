Wijeyadasa requests appointment of PSC to tackle crime

Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to look into the possibilities of appointing a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to tackle the country's crime wave and reduce laws delays.
"Since the public is keen to ensure that crime is contained and law delays are reduced, Parliament has the responsibility of resolving these issues as soon as possible," the minister said.
"Therefore, I make the proposal that a PSC be appointed to look into these matters and take appropriate action,"he added.
He said it is expected for the PSC to provide recommendations on matters such as the nature of crimes committed in the recent past, causes that led to the crimes, steps that need to be taken to reduce crime, necessary legal remedies,measures to reduce the delay in criminal and civil cases, and the laws that need to be amended and implemented to curb crime.
