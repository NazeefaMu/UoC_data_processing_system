Plastics:  Boon or bane?

This seems to be a pertinent question to ask these days, considering the recent news on this matter, saying that the government is seriously thinking of banning certain types of plastic containers.
But can we really live without plastics? It has become a day to day utility product which is mainly used for packaging. It is light and convenient and has become a household product that we cannot do without. There is one problem. It being low cost, we tend to dispose of it without giving much consideration to its recyclable qualities. So the waste is one of the biggest problems that the plastic industry faces. The magnitude of the problem is sometimes beyond what we can imagine. A recent investigation done by the writer in the Negombo area showed the frightening proportions in which carelessly dumped plastic waste has clogged the ocean bed in the seas around Negombo. All this is blamed on polythene and plastics coming down the Hamilton canal as well as other water ways to gradually settle on the ocean floor.
Denses Fernando from the Negombo Wallaveediya- Kudapaduwa United Fishermen's Organisation, in a recent interview said that the ocean bed in the Negombo lagoon is covered in a layer of polythene. He says that on an average one square meter of the sea bed holds 15 kilos of polythene and plastic and that various canals and waterways flowing to the deeper ocean are blocked by polythene, which has changed the marine environment of the harbour. The clogging of the lagoon and sea bed is what prevents the breeding of sea creatures, resulting in the drop of their catch. Diverted drains running across town, overflowing polythene and other waste into the ocean is another issue they face.

These fishermen say that the cleaning operations undertaken by the different government departments have not helped the lagoon or the harbour area a great deal, because only the surrounding area and the shallow waters get treated. The plastic clogging occurs on the ocean floor and that area remains untouched.
Another fisherman, Maximan Koogne also from the Negombo Wallaveediya- Kudapaduwa United Fishermen's Organisation, said the problem lay not in the use of plastics but in the way in which it was used. He says that most low income families, who live in proximity to the harbour, collect empty bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) lying on the Negombo beach for recycling as recycled plastic is used to generate electricity. The people are compliant, especially since they get paid for doing this, says Koogne, adding that they themselves should go for such an arrangement i.e. to recycle.
According to Stanley Peiris, Secretary of the Madhal Owners Cooperative Society said when they drag their Madhal nets in, most of what comes is plastic and other waste material, because the ocean floor is thickly clogged with it.
Taking these statements into account, it becomes clear that a proper solution is needed to prevent the dumping. There is no doubt that this has become a menace. Something needs to be done about it. The easiest would be to stop using certain plastic as a packaging material like the recent suggestion to ban certain types of plastic packaging like PET bottles; but that is not a solution. Nor is glass the alternative, since glass is more environmentally unfriendly in production as well as transportation. In fact, research done by Dr. Vijay G. Habbu, who has a PhD. in Polymers and Fiber science, says that “the use of PET in packaging consumes 52 percent lower energy compared to glass or metal, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent.”
PET is an environmental friendly substance that is easily recyclable. All PET containers can be collected, sorted and recycled. Due to the robustness of the material, they can be recycled into textile products or even back into bottles after melting and re-extrusion or re-molding. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in the report as of April 2015 “From Farm to Plate, make food safe” stated that PET is a safe, strong packaging material which can be recycled easily. Thus, PET gets picked up preferentially from the garbage due to its lucrative returns in the recycling business. For example, the global average is 55 percent, whereas in neighboring India, more than 70 percent of PET gets recycled. It is also preferred by the waste collectors due to its light weight, high remuneration and safe handling compared to other substances like glass which is fragile and harmful says Vijay G. Habbu, who works as an expert in the industry.
There is a crying need for a solution to handle plastic waste. Primarily, it is a matter of education and secondarily and most importantly, it is the collection and processing for recycling. In tackling this problem, we need to engage with the social aspects of it and make the people understand the massive environmental harm it causes as a waste product. This could primarily be woven into the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes of the corporate sector, particularly, the manufacturers of plastics and the companies that use it for packaging. It would also be a great opportunity for NGOs to partner the corporate sector to help government authorities to bring some sense and order to the whole system.
We need a solution soon for plastic packaging. A rational approach to the problem is necessary or else it would be a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
