Ancient Nalanda of the scientific Buddhists

Nalanda is still an obscure entity for most people in the world. Nalanda in India is famous historically for its university, which is now re-established under a joint Asian initiative. According to the Oxford Dictionary Sciential means pertaining to or having knowledge of which are still evident in Nalanda. The fact that Nalanda was a very ancient university is becoming better known. It is hard to re-establish a university after an 800-year hiatus. One can recollect the pursuit of science in old Nalanda which will inspire and guide long run efforts in new Nalanda University.
The purpose of science is continuance, improvement refinement and enhancement of the safety, and pleasure of existence through understanding the nature of phenomena. The purpose of Dhamma or the teaching of the Buddha is the extinction of inherent impermanent existence through understanding the nature of phenomena. The recollection and more challengingly assessment of the scientific tradition in old Nalanda are important right now. A scientific attitude and disciplined thought are important for the entire conception of continuing the old Nalanda University.
There are many methods and characteristics of science. Endeavour in science uses the following modes to understand, explain and control phenomena; faith in science; observation of the World from being in the world; reasoning; insight; analysis; Inference; Repetition; Hypotheses; Assumption Approximation; control of variability; ordered attention; ordered effort; serendipity; guessing; mind, tools and equipment; statistical probability; trial; verification independent of persons places and time: Is communal; public demonstration; peer review; accessible to doubt; invites investigation; liable to experimental error; Prof by falsification; going with the stream of conventional thinking; concerned with past, present, future; recording, interpretation and statement of results; objective; all grounded on exclusion of feelings and requiring little or no necessary personal commitment of the scientist to findings.
Nalanda was an old centre of learning that attracted students from many countries in the world particularly China and Tibet, Korea and Japan and the rest of Asia, but a few also from as far in the West as Turkey. Nalanda a residential university had at its peak 10,000 students studying various subjects, Chinese students in particular such as Xuanzang and Yi Jing in the seventh century. They wrote extensively on what they saw what they particularly admired about the educational standards in Nalanda.
Incidentally, Nalanda is the only non-Chinese institution in which any Chinese scholar was educated in the history of ancient China. It is also important to recognise that while Nalanda was very special it was still a part of a larger tradition of organised higher education that developed during that period in India – in Bihar in particular. In addition to Nalanda, there were in the vicinity other such institutions such as Vikramashila and Odantapuri.
