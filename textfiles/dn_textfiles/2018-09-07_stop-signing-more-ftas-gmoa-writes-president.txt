Stop signing more FTAs; GMOA writes to President

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will hand over a petition to President Maithripala Sirisena on September 20 demanding him to take action against the undemocratic process when signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the letter calls on the President to stop signing more FTAs without establishing a National Policy on signing FTAs.
The GMOA wants the implementation of the FTA signed with Singapore halted until the Presidential Committee Report is handed over to the President, and stop all types of activities now going on in connection with signing FTAs.
Dr. Aluthge said the petition will be signed all trade unions, civil organizations, MPs and clergy . A leaflet distribution campaign will take place at Fort Railway Station on September 17
President Maithripala Sirisena has already appointed economist Prof.W.D.Lakshman as the Chairman of the committee that will study the Singapore FTA, similar FTAs and the basic requirements that should be included in any FTA.
