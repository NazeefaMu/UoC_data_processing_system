Govt built 55-ft long two multi-day boats released to sea

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera released two 55 feet multi-day fishing trawlers at the Negombo Fisheries Harbour, recently.
This was part of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry’s programme to produce multi-day fishing trawlers with all modern facilities for fishing, to replace fishing vessels used by fishermen. The fishing vessels are over than 55 feet long.
The programme is carried out under the concept of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The production is carried out by Cey-Nor Foundation. The multi-day fishing trawlers are under 50 percent subsidy.
The ministry has planned to produce 10 multi-day marine vessels. The programme started in 2016.The minister addressing the gathering said, “Sri Lanka is using a large number of small fishing vessels. According to the statistics of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), our fishermen have over 65,000 fishing boats. However, we have 1,400 large multi-day boats. Although we use a large number of fishing boats, the size of our catch is not enough for the entire country. Around Rs. 70 million is spent to produce this multi-day fishing vessel.”
“Forty percent of our catch is going to waste. The reason is that small boats are not in good condition. We need to take action to avoid post-harvest wastage. If we are catching fish for the international market, we need to provide high quality fish. We have all the modern facilities available on our new vessels,” the minister said.According to international law, fishing nets are no longer being used for fishing. Instead, a method called Long Lines is used. There should be facilities to preserve fish in fishing vessels. All of this is available in the new boats. It also has the ability to share information via satellite, the minister said.
Ministry Secretary Mangalika Adikari and Deputy Minister Dr. Sudharshanie Fernandopulle also participated.
