VW Beetle Owners take to the streets

The VW Beetle Owners’ Club held the 19th Annual Pride of Ownership Drive, recently.
This year’s Drive was a resounding success with over 60 VW Beetles, vans, the much-admired Karmann Ghias, VW variants and a rare Trekker joined the event that flocked to Hilton Colombo, as in the past 10 years, which had been the venue for the Grand Start of this Annual Event.
Hilton Colombo supported the ‘Pride of Ownership Drive’ and members were greeted at the Recorders’ table in typical Beetle Camaraderie.
Members, having completed the registration, were welcomed to breakfast courtesy of Hilton Colombo. The drive was officially flagged off by Hilton Manager Promotions Gigi De Silva.
The drive took off with cheer with the Police escort that led the way along the line-up of VW’s through Galle Face turning towards Duplication Road with the first line-up alongside Ratmalana Airport. The Drive continued with two more line-ups at Panadura and Kalutara and did a right turn to the sandy beaches of Eden Resort.
