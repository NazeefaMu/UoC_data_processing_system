GMOA welcomes govt’s SAITM decision

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) welcomes the decision made by the Government to admit qualified SAITM students to the Medical Faculty of the Kotelawala Defence University, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that this is what the GMOA demanded from the beginning and it is good that President Maithripala Sirisena made the decision at least after a long delay. The GMOA will extend its fullest cooperation towards implementing the decision made by the government.
“The GMOA is not celebrating the victory and the SAITM issue is not over yet. This is not the right time to celebrate the victory. The Government should issue the gazette notification immediately on abolishing SAITM and declare the process of solving the issue. There are many things to do in connection with admitting qualified students to the KDU,” he said.
“Earlier SAITM owner Dr. Neville Fernando said he was willing to offer his hospital buildings to a charity. He can hand over them to a state university such as the Moratuwa University for the benefit of students, he added.
