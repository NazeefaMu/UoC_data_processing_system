Pakistani legend Abdul Qadir’s son aspires to play for Australia

Like Usman, Qadir’s other sons have also followed him into the game, with varying degrees of success.
As reported in The Indian Express, Usman is presently in Sydney playing for Hawkesbury Cricket Club in the New South Wales Premier Cricket Grade A league.
His performance there – 30 wickets at 24.70 in 9 matches with 3 five-wicket hauls – has won him plaudits from many cricket gurus there like Geoff Lawson and Justin Langer. Langer, in fact, even invited him to spend a few days training with the Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League (BBL). And Usman reveals that the distinguished former Australian opener has even offered him a potential opportunity to play for the Scorchers in next year’s BBL and even a stint for the Western Australia state side in the Sheffield Shield, Australia’s premier first-class tournament.
