Uva Chief Minister plays ‘Re Daniel daval Migel’: UP Councillor Senarath

The Uva Chief Minister has friendly relationship with the President during daytime and with Mahinda Rajapaksa during night time following the policy of “re daniel daval migel”, said Uva Provincial Councillor Senarath Jayasuriya.
“I got information that the Chief Minister used Provincial Council vehicles and the recently recruited employees for the Joint Opposition protest in Hambantota. I believe that the President would take action on this. Before the last year’s budget was presented, the Chief Minister met a few UNP councillors. They asked for our support.
We agreed to give 50 percent of job opportunities and development activities to the opposition. But things are not happening the way we expected. Many were recruited even in January this year,” he said. "If the Chief Minister continues to act in this manner, we will have to decide on extending our support in future," he said.
“The Chief Minister was appointed by the President, but he is not representing President’s views. We will soon inform the President and the Prime Minister about the situation in the Uva Provincial Council,” he said.
