Promise of a bruising return leg

X'mas... done, festive spirit... done, recovery through New Year... done, league 1st round... done. The promise is of a bruising return leg larger than life and much concern for coaching staff and fans alike.
The questions remain, can Sandun Herath's captaincy inspire Havies to bridge the 6-point advantage, focus practise to a defined "Lagga" plan, catch up and dramatically swing the pendulum in their favour? Will Kandy grow in strength and confidence and thrive off the Marija experience and more recently, the Ratwatte boot? Can CR, skipper Noor, and coach Marikkar, fashion up the biggest upsets, the island nation has ever seen....? Experts and masters of the Union code, can consider the immense laws of possibility, then analyze the form, before diving headfirst - let's see if the oracle speaks?
The reality for all contenders, particularly the top 3, Kandy 39 points, Havelocks 33 points, and CR 25 points....hinges much on current injuries to key players, and the process of recovery in time for those critical clashes, just weeks away. Let's address the issue of player wellness, medical care and insurance with the likes of coaches Sean Wijey, Tavita Tulagese, Imthi Mariks, Nilufer Ibrahim, and their response is pretty universal.
My mate Lasantha Basnayake, easily the most qualified physiotherapist around, with a vast record of hands on experience, specifically, sports medical knowledge, is the perfect source and ideal man to change the environment. The "A" list, the who's who of our current rugby fraternity.
Fazil Marija, Danuska Ranjan, Ratwatte, Dulaj, Omalka, Richie Dharmapala, Dinusha Chaturanga, Srinath Sooriyabandara, a growing list... National players, club and school reps, who have been past the Sports Ministry medical facility - will happily admit to how much time and care is actually needed. If push comes to shove there is massive concern about the lack of qualified sports physiotherapists on board and available. The medical facility at Torrington must have the ability to rehabilitate, advise, guide and recover players, naturally National caps the biggest priority.
Professor Arjuna as captain of that ship well understands the massive contribution required, and is responsible for the big step up, in proper care.
Sport in Sri, and particularly, an impact sport like rugby, needs that confidence and clinical care, the experts, the facilities, the equipment and the ability to inspire belief and high performance at all levels.
In case you are wondering, yes I have spent my fair share of screaming and biting pencils, as the physio expertly manipulated torn hamstrings, ultra sensitive calcified heels that have a love hate relationship with golf balls (those who know, will grimace) and broken fingers that defy description, jaws, shoulders bruised and colour-toned, ankles that have twisted and turned inside the boots beyond convention. Percentage injuries that must be sorted and timelined for return to the middle.
Thank goodness for the likes of "Lassa" and the time taken to provide expert care and advise ...much thanks also to k tape in all its fashionable go fast colours and designs. Ultra useful to all recovery and player wellness from school via club and rep rugby, to full internationals on duty for the flag, against the might of Asia in 15s, and the world's best in Hong Kong at the 7s.
Rugby is a warrior sport in every sense of the given word...perhaps the hardest we play? While the experts and pundits ponder these facts and the recently concluded...simply magnificent World cup in sunny England ...we need to turn our radar to the warmer shores here in sunnier Ceylon, Taprobana, that feisty Pearl of Sri.
Club rugby is still the pinnacle of local sport, glam to the core and skills on both sides of the touchline. Fashion is a high maintenance facility for the billboard clashes in Colombo and the hill capital. Planning will be key, to hit the stands for Havelocks v Kandy and CR's trip through the Kadugannawa tunnel ...what mouth watering prospects for pure fans ...what tantalizing possibilities for the players to shine ...the mind races, the heart beats a step faster, as scorelines flitter past. Kandy is the team to beat, the team to target and the team both CR and Havies need bonus points from. Interesting that both return matches are in Kandy @ Nittawela.
X'mas cheer for the capacity partisan supporters, who will intimidate and scream every pass, every lineout, every scrum, each tackle .but the try cheer is resounding...and matched for shock, only by the silence, when the opposition scores.
Timeless traditions that make Nittawela an intense and fiery cauldron.
First round form and skilled finishing have one clear Bilal Hassen as the leading try scorer and overall leader with 8 tries, Yoshitha Rajapaksa 7 tries, and Fazil Marija 6 tries ....much anticipation about the final top scorer, once the league concludes....but for now, Police can shine some light, on their quiet uneventful season, bar Tank Hassens low gravity skills and appetite for ripping balls at rucks and mauls. Hassen also constitutes a list of elite players, who have Japanese club scouts looking closely at the likes of ...Shenal Dias, Sooriyabandara, Gayan Weeraratne, Willarwara, Muthuthantri, Fazil Marija, Dhanushka 'Gertha' Perera, Danushka Ranjan, Nigel Ratwatte, etc...
Good news for the likes of club debutants Omalka Gunaratne, last year's Isipathana and current junior National captain who is making his league mark this year. Havies Kevin 'Kutty' Dixon, another player, certainly matching the best club players and earning respect, despite the 'new kid' status.
On the official front, there is eager anticipation that the SLRFU will sort the legal issues, get its rugby council appointed, and have our house shipshape and administrating the game at all levels, sooner rather than later.
The year 2016 is upon us and the league champion just weeks away from that distinction, a place of honour and national pride. All the months of hard work, hours in the gym and hundreds of metres clocked at pace...all part of making a complete team.
The game defines a team, the distinction between average, good, exceptional and brilliant from 0 to 80mins ...the measure of strength, effort, fight, endurance, skill, pace, power and work rate, completing the list. Consistency is the key.
All hail the experts who can predict the Dialog league champions 2016. Enjoy the intensity and the confrontation as the 2nd round kicks off. Big hand for the fittest warriors who transform the game and elevate the realms of possibility. Bula bula island rugby!!!
