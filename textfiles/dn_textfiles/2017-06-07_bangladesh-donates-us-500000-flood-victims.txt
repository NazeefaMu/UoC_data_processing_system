The Bangladesh Government has decided to provide a cash assistance of US $500, 000 to support the victims of recent flood and landslides in Sri Lanka, which killed more than 100 people and caused severe damage to livelihood and properties of thousands.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared the cash donation today in Dhaka, a Foreign Ministry press release said.
Earlier, the prime minister wrote to Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena condoling the deaths of Sri Lankan people and offered sympathy to the people who suffered from the devastating natural calamity that hit the country on May 25. Bangladesh High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Riaz Hamidullah will hand over the cash to the Sri Lankan authorities soon.
