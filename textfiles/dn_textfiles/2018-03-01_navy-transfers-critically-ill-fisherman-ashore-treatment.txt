Navy transfers critically ill fisherman ashore for treatment

The Sri Lanka Navy had promptly rendered assistance to transfer a fisherman who was suddenly taken ill at sea with a heart pain, ashore for treatment today (28 February).
The patient was onboard the multiday trawler “Vinod Krishan 6” which had left the Galle Fisheries Harbour for fishing.
Reacting to a message given by Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the Sri Lanka Navy had immediately dispatched the Fast Gun Boat SLNS “Ranarisi,” attached to the Eastern Naval Command, to the location.
Accordingly, Naval personnel had reached the trawler 54 nautical miles off the Poul Point in Trincomalee and safely transferred the patient to the Trincomalee harbour.
Thereafter, the patient was rushed to the District General Hospital-Trincomalee for medical treatment.
