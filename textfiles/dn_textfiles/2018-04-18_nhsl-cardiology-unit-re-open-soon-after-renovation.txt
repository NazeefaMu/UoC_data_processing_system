NHSL Cardiology Unit to re-open soon after renovation

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne assured that the operating theatres of the Cardiology Unit of the Colombo National Hospital (NHSL) will be re-opened soon. The renovations of one theatre have already been completed, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, heart surgeries undertaken by the unit were suspended from December 1, 2017, in order to complete urgent renovations. The Sri Lanka Army carried out the renovations. Urgent renovation was required to ensure the hygiene of the unit.
Minister Senaratne said out that the Cardiology Unit of the NHSL is over 60 years old and needed urgent renovations. The renovation activities were delayed due to time spent on importing the required machinery and equipment.
