HR Investigations under a domestic mechanism

The outcome at the UNHRC in September would have been different if the government did not change at the January 8th Presidential Election, Minister of Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathileke said in Parliament.

The Minister said this when the report of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lankas was taken up for debate for a second day.  The Minister reiterated that all investigations pertaining to the proposals cited in the report of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner will be held under a domestic inquiry.  It was former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who took the human rights issue to Geneva and brought the problem to the Human Rights Council by entering into an agreement with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in 2009 after the end of the war. Fresh commitments were undertaken but the Minister further pointed out that the previous regime remained insincere to the task, leading the international community to lose confidence and patience leading to divided the international community.
 
If there was no change on 8 January followed by good governance, political reforms and reconciliation measures enabling the international community to have a positive outlook, Sri Lanka would have been marginalised internationally by now, he added.
He said it can be observed at this debate in Parliament, that some politicians with narrow agendas and seeking cheap publicity are trying to mislead the people by incorrectly interpreting the Geneva report and flagging off unnecessary concerns.
 
The Minister while stating the government can obtain the advice of the international community also emphasised establishing a mechanism to investigate into the allegations of human rights violations and the proposed mechanism would be within the provisions of the Constitution. (Govt. Info)
