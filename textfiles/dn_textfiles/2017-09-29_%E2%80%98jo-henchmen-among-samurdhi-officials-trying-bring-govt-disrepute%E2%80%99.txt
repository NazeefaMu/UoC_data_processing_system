‘JO henchmen among Samurdhi officials trying to bring Govt into disrepute’

Some Samurdhi officials who are henchmen of the Joint Opposition took steps to cut off Samurdhi benefits to bring the Yahapalana regime into disrepute, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said addressing a meeting at Kirinda.
The State Minister said Korea is the motivator of the fisheries industry.
It was the fisheries federation in that country that supplies all the requirements of the fisher folk.
The federation has banks, insurance companies, fuel stations and hospitals. Fishing is the money spinner in Korea, the State Minister said.
He said the sea is a great resource the country must utilise. He said that the fisher folk can derive a sound income.
A lobster breeding project will be inaugurated at Rekawa in Tangalle Divisional Secretariat area, State Minister Vedaarachchi said.
