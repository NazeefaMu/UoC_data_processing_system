Two arrested with IDs and polling cards

Two persons were arrested from Kalutara and Beruwela on Sunday for having IDs and polling cards in their possession which they had obtained by paying for it, in violation of election laws.
Addressing the media at the Police Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said at the time of arrest, the two suspects had in their possession six IDs and five polling cards, which they had obtained through payment in an effort to create an advantage to a certain candidate contesting the upcoming LG elections. “The two suspects had paid Rs.18,000 for the IDs and polling cards. They were doing this to help a candidate gain advantage at the election. Further, it was also revealed that they had paid the electricity and water bills of four persons as a bribe to obtain their votes for this candidate at the upcoming election. The total paid for the electricity and water bills was Rs. 18,800,” the Police Media Spokesman said. He further noted that this offence comes under ‘causing undue pressure’ while payment of utility bills is an offence which is termed as bribing.
SP Gunasekara said the two suspects were arrested and later released on bail, but the candidate who had been behind this scam was ordered to be remanded until February 12.
“This means that he would lose his opportunity to vote as well. We will seek the advice of the Attorney General and proceed with legal charges against him.
In the event he is found guilty of the charge in Court, this candidate would have to face jail term and he would also be stripped off his seat even if he wins at the election,” SP Gunasekara said.
