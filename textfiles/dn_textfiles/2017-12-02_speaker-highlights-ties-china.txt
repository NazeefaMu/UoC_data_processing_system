Speaker highlights ties with China

The government of Sri Lanka is very serious about its friendship with China, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Friday.He was speaking at a seminar organised by the International Confucius Centre and the University of Kelaniya at the Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo.
Speaker Jayasuriya lauded the Chinese government’s “One Belt One Road” initiative, a proposed development strategy to connect China to western markets by land and sea. The modern project picks up on the historic relationship the two countries shared on the maritime silk road trading route, he said.
Sri Lanka’s location in the Indian Ocean makes it a key point of interest for Chinese development.
Recent examples of Chinese investment in Sri Lanka are Colombo’s Port City project, the Southern Expressway project, and the operations of the Hambantota port.Jayasuriya mentioned that this year marks 60 years of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
The relationship was marked by “mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty… a foundation of peace,” he said.The president of the Confucius Centre gifted Jayasuriya a calligraphy scroll as a token of friendship.
