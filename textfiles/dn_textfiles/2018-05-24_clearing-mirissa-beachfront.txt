CLEARING THE MIRISSA BEACHFRONT

“Please help those who lost their livelihood after the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management demolished unauthorised structures on Mirissa beach start afresh,” appealed Edwin Silva, the Patron of the Mirissa Tourist Business Operators Association (MTBOA) at a press conference held at the Sunset Beach hotel in Mirissa last Thursday (17).
The beachfronts of some hotels on the picturesque Mirissa beach looked like battle fields, a week after officials of the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management together with the SriLanka Police tore down the unauthorized structures on May 11, 2018. The owners and staff of 23 hotels and restaurants on the Mirissa beach that had gradually expanded their establishments without obtaining prior permission, neither complied with the demolition notices served on them on more than one occasion, watched helplessly as the authorities brought down the unauthorized structures that day.
Even though it was after a Presidential directive, the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management should be commended for finally expediting the law. The Mirissa beach will be more attractive and more picturesque once the rubble and debris is cleared, opening up access as well as a larger extent of white sand to the tourists and public.
Enforcing the law
Under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act No 57 of 1981 amended by Act no 64 of 1988 and Act No 49 of 2011, the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management has the power to remove all unauthorized temporary or permanent structures within the coastal zone of Sri Lanka. It is imperative that a permit is obtained from the Department prior to commencement of any development activity including constructions for tourism, houses, other constructions and fillings within the coastal zone. The coastal zone is defined as ‘300 meters inward from the main high waterline, 2km seaward of the main low waterline, 2km measured on a perpendicular straight base line towards the land from the entrance points of any water body, thus connected to the sea and 100 meters inland from the periphery of that water body’.
“Although for some years the Coast Conservation Department has been threatening to expedite their order to demolish unauthorized structures on the Mirissa beach, the MTBOA was able to appeal to the relevant Ministers to intervene and gain time hoping that the authorities would review the situation and be more lenient,” Silva admitted.
“But unfortunately, it was during this time that some local youth assaulted and sexually molested a group of Dutch tourists. It is the media that repeatedly highlighted the unfortunate incident so much that the President was compelled to take action,” he alleged.
“A few days before the demolition took place, we were able to discuss the issue with the private secretary to the President. He was very attentive and we were aware that he was consulting the Director General of the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management as well as keeping the President informed of the progress,” the MTBOA Patron said. “We repeatedly requested that the CCD mark out what structures needed to be removed and give the owners a day or two to remove them. This official even secured an appointment for us with the Director General of the CCD for the same evening but the DG avoided meeting us when we went to his office,” Silva added.
Losing livelihoods
Donald Weerasekera, President of the MTBOA said that Minister Faiszer Musthapha was of the opinion that if these so called unauthorized structures are demolished, many people would lose their livelihood. “Minister Mustapha even walked the length of the Mirissa Beach one evening to see for himself,” he added.
“If a youngster builds three attached toilets to the three room beachfront ancestral house he inherited from his grandparents, does it become an unauthorized structure?” Weerasekera questioned.
Damith Sisira, owner of the Sunset hotel in Mirissa said that the Department had given him notice in 2012 to remove unauthorized structures on his premises. “They hadn’t specified what buildings were considered unauthorized and we were under the impression that it was structures that were within 5 meters inwards from the high water line but they went much more than that”.
On May 11, the authorities had demolished the seaward wall of the hotel’s swimming pool and the kitchen with all its stainless steel equipment. “They didn’t give any opportunity to remove my belongings and I was helpless as they destroyed stainless steel kitchen equipment worth over four million rupees,” he lamented. “The sea side wall of the swimming pool was on the boundary of the 5 meter line and they had the right to demolish it,” he said with a sigh.
Even with the adverse publicity it has received off and on, Mirissa attracts those who love the sea, the sand and the sun. There are many tourists who visit the resort regularly. Sandra Steinlechner, an Austrian tourist is one of them who has fallen in love with the Mirissa beach,
“I love the sea and the beach and have been visiting Mirissa each year since 2003.

I even held my wedding ceremony on the Mirissa beach!” she said. “I always stay at the Summer Breeze Hotel and was heartbroken when the authorities uprooted some palm trees I had planted on one of my visits” she lamented.
Although the hoteliers claim that they lost equipment and structures valued at millions of rupees and evident from what lay on the beach, business is bound to flourish again at all but one of the 23 establishments once the tourist season in Mirissa resumes next November. But sadly, Nissan Hotel and Restaurant will not be able to resume operations again as the establishment was totally demolished.
“If the President considers our appeal for help favourably, Nissan Hotel should top the list” reaffirmed MTBOA ‘s President. “The hotel was our sole livelihood and we invested all we had in it” sobbed 49 year old Helma, wife of proprietor P. H. Gunasiri. “My husband invested most of what he saved by working as a welder in Japan to commence the hotel and restaurant in 2001. It was a three room hotel situated on 12 perches of beachfront land and better known as a restaurant,” she said.
The Nissan Hotel survived the 2004 tsunami but was razed to the ground by unknown miscreants in 2011.
It was also at the Nissan that the Mirissa Beach Party was held every Thursday during the tourist season. “We employed a staff of 35 and the hotel was my only source of income. It is with this money that I provided for, my wife, two children and my 80 year old mother,” Gunasiri said speaking over the phone.
It was the opinion of those present at the press conference that the losses would have been minimal if the authorities performed their duty and demolished unauthorized structures as soon as they were put up, rather than postpone the action in return of gratification and favours.
“We mistook the repeated postponement of expediting the demolition orders as a green light to improve the structures,” said a hotelier who had lost much but did not want to be named.
