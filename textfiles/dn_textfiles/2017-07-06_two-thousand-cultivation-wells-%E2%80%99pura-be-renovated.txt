Two thousand cultivation wells in A’pura to be renovated

A cultivation well-restoration programme is being launched in the Anuradhapura District as a drought relief measure, Anuradhapura District Agriculture Director H.L. Thenuwara told the Daily News.
‘’We have chosen 34 dilapidated cultivation wells from each divisional secretariat division on the recommendations of the Divisional Secretaries. There are 22 DS divisions in the district. Under this programme, 750 cultivation wells are to be renovated immediately.
Each well owner is granted a subsidy of Rs. 100,000 for repairs,” Thenuwara said.
Apart from this, the Disaster Management Ministry has agreed to support the restoration of another 1,250 abandoned cultivation wells as an emergency drought relief measure in Anuradhapura District in collaboration with the district agriculture authorities.
