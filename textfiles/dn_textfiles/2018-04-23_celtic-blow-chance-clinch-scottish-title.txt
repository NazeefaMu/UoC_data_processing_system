Celtic blow chance to clinch Scottish title

GLASGOW, Saturday - Celtic wasted a chance to clinch the Scottish Premiership title as they crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat away to Hibernian on Saturday.
The runaway leaders were rocked by Jamie Maclaren’s first-half opener for Hibs at Easter Road.
Vykintas Slivka headed in Hibernian’s second goal in the closing stages and, although Celtic substitute Odsonne Edouard reduced the deficit with four minutes remaining, the Hoops were unable to claim the win that would have wrapped up the title. Brendan Rodgers’ side could still be crowned champions this weekend depending on results elsewhere, if not, they can clinch the trophy against Glasgow rivals Rangers at Parkhead next week.
The build-up to the match was dominated by speculation over whether Celtic manager Rodgers would be heading south to Arsenal as a replacement for Arsene Wenger after the veteran French boss announced Friday his intention to stand down at the end of the season. - AFP
