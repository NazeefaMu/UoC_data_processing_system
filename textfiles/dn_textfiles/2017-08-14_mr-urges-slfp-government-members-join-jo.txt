MR urges SLFP Government members to join JO

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday urged the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members in the unity government to join the Joint Opposition (JO).
“If SLFP members in the Government desire forgiveness for past sins, then they should give up their positions and join the JO without further delay,” he said while addressing an event to commemorate the late parliamentarian T. B. Tennekoon, the father of former minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon in Dambulla. Rajapaksa charged that the present government had failed to deliver on its promises and as a result the country was facing a massive socio-economic crisis. The former President said the unity government was in disarray and parliamentarians and ministers were fighting against each other.
