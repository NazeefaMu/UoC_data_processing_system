“The ITB Berlin will be an excellent opportunity to promote Sri Lanka as a compact destination filled with cultural and historical values. Sri Lanka has achieved a positive growth in the tourism sector,”Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Chairman Paddy Withana said.
“Due to the peace and reconciliation process in Sri Lanka, there is a better and a safer environment for tourists to have a holiday experience of their choice. I’m sure this will be a great experience to all travel and tourism industry officials who will want to proceed further and take their fields to greater heights,’’he said.
