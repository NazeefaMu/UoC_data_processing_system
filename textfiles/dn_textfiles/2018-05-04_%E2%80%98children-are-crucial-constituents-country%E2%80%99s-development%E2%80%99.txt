UNICEF Parliamentarian Platform for Children held:
‘Children are crucial constituents for country’s development’

UNICEF hosted parliamentarians from the South Asian region during the South Asia Parliamentarian Platform for Children which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from May 2 to 3.
The programme was carried out in an effort to increase investments in children and young adults, to bring about change for millions of underprivileged individuals and to improve prospects for a healthy economic growth within the region.
The programme also aimed to strengthen opportunities for children during the first two decades of their lives.
Lawmakers from all eight countries in South Asia, met to prioritise, promote and safeguard children’s rights and discussed prospects for further investment in early childhood and adolescent years.
“While South Asia is home to one-fourth of the world’s population, its share of global income is only four percent. This fact underlines one of the biggest challenges for South Asia’s progress on the social and economic front: namely the lack of investment in its largest asset; its human capital–and especially the young within society,” UNICEF South Asia Regional Director Jean Gough said.
Three parliamentarians from Sri Lanka participated in the meeting: Parliamentary Caucus for Children Chair Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Women and Gender Sectoral Oversight Committee Chair Dr. Thusitha Wijemanna and Public Finance Sectoral Oversight Committee Member Prof. Ashu Marasinghe.
Parliament Assistant Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera was also present.
Speaking on the initiative, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle said, “Children are crucial constituents; the future economic prosperity and the development of the country depend on them. In our role as parliamentarians, we need to review legislation and especially the National Budget, through a child’s perspective to ensure that investments in the social sectors that impact children are adequate and equitable so that no child, regardless of who they are or where they live, can reach their full potential to become productive citizens of this country."
This year’s meeting focused on the region’s commitment to increased investment in children.
Three hundred million children in South Asia are called multi-dimensionally poor with too little to eat, a high risk of falling sick from preventable disease and a slim chance of going to school.
Evidence shows that investment in the young pays strong dividends to society.
Even a dollar invested in quality Early Childhood Development, would give a return of between 6 and 17 dollars.
If low- and middle-income countries ensured preschool enrollment to half of the country’s children, the result could be cumulative lifetime earnings gains of US $15 to $34 billion.
The urgent, timely and adequate investments in early childhood and adolescent years, would lead to developed brains and a productive workforce.
“There are good chances for bringing about radical and important change: in most countries in the region, children and young people make up a large part of society and even smaller investments now will give good results for children and South Asian societies,” Jean Gough said.
