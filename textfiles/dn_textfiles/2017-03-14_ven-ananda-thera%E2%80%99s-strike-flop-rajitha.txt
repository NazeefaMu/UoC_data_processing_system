Ven. Ananda thera’s strike a flop - Rajitha

Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera launched the most unsuccessful strike ever in history, maybe due to the demand of some person who wanted to make a significant change this week, or politically motivated elements, and got his image tarnished, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. Addressing a press conference at his official residence in Colombo yesterday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said over 95 percent of nurses work in almost all hospitals and other trade unions did not have any intention to sabotage this. There was no impact on the services.
There will be no sign of a strike today because a handful of nurses who took part in it yesterday will abandon it today. According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, there was an impact on services due to the strike at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and National Eye Hospital but the daily services were carried out without any interruption at the Colombo National Hospital, several Teaching Hospitals, maternity hospitals, children’s hospitals etc.
Arrangements have been made to meet the demands of the trade union which launched the strike. The Salaries Commission should send the recommendations to the Cabinet to solve salary anomalies.
They have already received an annual salary increase of Rs. 150,000 after a period of 20 years and already Rs. 5,000 added to their salary.
It was me who proposed to establish a community medical service and now they demand the same, the minister said.
