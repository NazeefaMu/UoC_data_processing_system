UNP backbenchers demand PSC on Uma Oya debacle

The UNP backbenchers have submitted a Resolution proposing to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to look into issues pertaining to Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project and report the findings to Parliament.
The Resolution signed by 13 UNP MPs has been included in the Addendum to the Order Book of Parliament issued last Friday. It proposes to appoint a 21 member committee to re-assess the implementation and effect of the project and report to Parliament within six months. The committee will be entrusted to determine whether a proper and comprehensive feasibility study was done prior to embarking on the project and whether a proper and realistic cost estimate was prepared for it. It will look into any unrealistic cost overruns in the implementation of the project.
The Committee has also been entrusted on identifying the persons responsible in preparing the project reports and whether there had been negligence on their part. The proposed PSC will determine “whether any person or persons were guilty of any fraudulent or criminal activity in awarding the contract for the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project”.
The resolution, mentioning the adverse effects of the project experienced in several areas in Bandarawela since December 2014 such as lowering of the water level in domestic wells, drying up of natural springs and development of cracks on walls and floors of houses and on the ground, proposes the Committee to find out the persons or institutions responsible for them. The proposed committee will also decide on the compensation for people affected by the project.
The Resolution has been signed by UNP MPs Chaminda Wijesiri, A. Aravindh Kumar, Ravindra Samaraweera, Sandith Samarasinghe, J. M. Ananda Kumarasiri, Prof. Ashu Marasinghe, Vadivel Suresh, Harin Fernando, J.C. Alawathuwala, Mujibur Rahuman, Edward Gunasekara, Ashoka Priyantha, and Mylvaganam Thilakarajah.
