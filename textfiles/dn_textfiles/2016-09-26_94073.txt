Maliyadeva hand brittle Dharmapala a big thrashing

Dharmapala, Pannipitiya continuing their poor form this season succumbed to yet another big defeat, this time at the hands of Maliyadewa when they were crushed by 134 runs in an away first-round traditional-match of Singer U19 D1 tournament concluded on Thursday at Maliyadewa ground.
In a match bowlers showed more promise, Dharmapala bowlers spearheaded by Mahima Weerakoon who had an amazing match-bag of 12 wickets restricted Maliyadewa’s both innings to scores under 200, but Dharmapala batsmen failing yet again very pathetically managed just 82 and 102 in their two innings to loss the batch by a wide margin of 134 runs in the end. Manelka Dharmadasa, Dananjaya Premarathne and Vishwa Dissanayake bowled well for the winners.
Maliyadeva: 143 in 36.3 overs ( Sanjeewa Priyadarshana 27, Supun Sumanarathne 25, Dilshan Kollure 23, Mahima Weerakoon 6/38, Chamith Samarsinghe 2/23) & 176 in 51.4 overs (Kaveen Bandara 44, Supun Sumanarathne 39, Dulaj Ranatunga 28, Dulaj Silva 25, Mahima Weerakoon 6/73)
Dharmapala: 83 in 24.1 overs (Amila Dayanaka 28, Hashantha Wishvajith 14, Manelka Dharmadasa 4/28, Dananjaya Premarathne 4/13) & 102 in 35.2 overs (Kavishka Hasarinda 26, Dulaj Ayodyage 18, Damitha Silva 3/18, Vishwa Dissanayake 4/13, Sanjeewan Priyadarshan 2/28)
Dilshan and Malaka help President’s Rajagiriya
Two fifties from Dilshan Sigera and Malaka de Silva helped Presidents post a competitive 265 after they were asked to take the first lease on losing the toss. Lumbini in reply amassed 320 thanks to a gritty century by Kevin Pieris. However, match dribbled to a lame conclusion on Tuesday at Colts ground when Presidents in their second innings had scored 50 for three.
President’s , Rajagiriya: 265 in 78.2 overs (Dilshan Sigera 59, Sachitha Liyanage 48, Malaka De Silva 52, Kanishka Maduwantha 3/64) & 50/3 in 11 overs (Dilshan Sigera 31*, Thanuka Dabare 2/20)

Poorna and Dushan ensure first-innings points for Maris Stella
