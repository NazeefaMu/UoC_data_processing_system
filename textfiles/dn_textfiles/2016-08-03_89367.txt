Use of eight- year-old to insult President,PM condemned

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody yesterday condemned the behaviour of certain Paada Yathra protesters who used an eight-year-old child to insult the President and the Prime Minister. The minister said that this incident completely contradicted with the policies of the SLFP since the SLFP is the party which is dedicated to protect the culture, traditions and the children of this country.
Meanwhile, National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairperson Natasha Balendra told the Daily News the NCPA will look into the matter.
