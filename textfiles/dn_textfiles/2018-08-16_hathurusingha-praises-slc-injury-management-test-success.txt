Hathurusingha praises SLC injury management for Test success

Injury management at Sri Lanka Cricket has tremendously improved over the last six months and it is a good sign for the team, head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said.
He made these remarks at a press conference held yesterday at SLC headquarters. He further said that the players did not have any major injuries over the period in question.
"We haven’t had any injuries over the past four months and that's a good sign for us and all credit goes to our trainers, physio and assistant coach who manage the training schedules well concerning player injuries,” Hathurusingha continued.
"If you compare our records, in the last seven months we have achieved a lot than before. We’ve become the first Asian team to win a Test match in Barbados (against the West Indies) and continued the winning streak against South Africa," he said.
Hathurusingha said the wins were achieved in two contrasting situations on fast and slow pitches and all credit to the bowlers who adjusted to the wickets.
"Before the New Zealand and Australia tours (in December and February) we are looking to having our training in Kandy and Dambulla on two different pitches similar to New Zealand and Australia," said Hathurusingha.
Questioned about ageing fast bowler Lasith Malinga's status, Hathurusingha said he (Malinga) has the potential to return to the Sri Lanka team provided he proves his fitness and worthiness at domestic cricket.
CEO of SLC Ashley de Silva said the team's performances against South Africa was refreshing.
"I hope the same success story will continue in the future in the next couple of series as well," he said.
