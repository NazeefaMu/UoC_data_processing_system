Navy out to redeem lost prestige

The Navy Rugby team started playing rugby in 1961 in the ‘B’ Division and in 1975 they competed for the first time in the "Division A" Rugby League, under the captaincy of P. L. B. Nandasiri. In their very first game against the 1974 Clifford Cup champions, Havelock SC they narrowly lost by 13 points to 9 at old Army grounds, Gall Face and in 1976 Navy SC competed in their first final of the Clifford Cup, captained by Ilex Perera, again losing to Havelock’s 3-15. It wasn't until 1989 that Navy SC appeared in their next Clifford Cup final under the captaincy of now slain war hero Parakrama Samaraweera, losing to CR & FC 3-6 after making a sensational entry into the finals by beating formidable Police SC on a toss of a coin in the semi finals after the scores read 6 all even after the extra time and a penalty tie breaker having scored an easy 16-4 win over Havies in the quarter finals.
In 2010 and 2011 they were again successful in reaching the Clifford Cup final, falling short both times to Kandy SC. The club capped off an undefeated league season by also winning the Clifford Cup for the first time in the club's history beating Havelocks 27-22 in the finals in 2013/14 season thus remaining as the unbeaten double champions under flanker Rohitha “Chichi” Rajapaksa. Since then they have become one of the leading rugby playing Clubs for the past four years.
Since tasting success in 2013/14 season, Navy SC has failed to reach the top in local rugby arena as they by their own standards had a rather disastrous season last time around, in the 2016/17 season. Navy SC started on a winning note but when the season progressed they never get going from there onwards and finished overall in third place. The player who stood out on top from the rest in the last season is undoubtedly their young full back Thilina Weerasinghe who single-handedly won Navy team many matches with his accurate kicking and remained as the second highest total point scorer by collecting 154 points in the concluded league tournament.
But this time around in the 2017 /18 inter club league rugby season they are in a team building stage due to player transfers to other clubs. Several of their top class rugby players left the club to join other clubs this season including their cracking centre and Sri Lanka national player Lee Keegal, strongly built Sri Lanka national prop forward Sathya Ranathunga, Sri Lanka third row forward Sajith Saranga, Sri Lanka under 20 second row forward Matheesha Sarathchandra and Sri Lanka under 20 forward Chathura Dilshan who have joined CH and FC for the forthcoming season.
Fresh new players who have already joined Navy for the upcoming season are former Police Sports Club Scrum Half / Fly Half Mohamed Abzal, Havelock’s Wing three quarter Rehan Thiyagaraja and Royal College/Police Sports Club/Sri Lanka Centre Mushin Faleel,
This rugby season the Navy rugby team will be captained by seasoned campaigner third row forward Danushka “Gertha” Perera.
Their main obligation this season is to regain the league title which they lost to Kandy SC in the last two seasons and in 2015/16 season virtually by a mere single try difference in total in the end.
Navy coaching staff comprises Head coach Mothilal Jayathilake, three quarters coach Dev Anandh together with their long serving manager Menaka Suranga will look to implement their style of game plan to take the Sailors towards success and powered Navy outfit to cause a few upsets this season and will be looking to improve their showing from last season this time around.
Navy Sports Club will come out for the first time this season against Army Sports Club at Navy grounds in Welisara on 5thNovember at 4:00pm in the Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club league rugby tourney.
