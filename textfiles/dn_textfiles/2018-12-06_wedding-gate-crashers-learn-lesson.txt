Wedding gate crashers learn lesson

Four youths who were in the habit of attending weddings without being invited learnt a lesson when they were caught by the relatives of the bride and groom at a wedding held at Modara, recently.
According to guests, the father of the groom had become suspicious of four youths who were emptying a couple of liquor bottles at a table. He had inquired about the connection they had to the married couple and the youths had told him that they had come upon the invitation given to them by the mother of the bride.
The mother of the bride seated at the next table heard the conversation and had intervened. She informed the father that she had not invited the youths.
At that time, others attending the function had realised that the four youths were gatecrashing and had the habit of consuming food and drinks at functions such as these. They were beaten by relatives of the bride and groom and had to flee without their shirts from the venue.
However, the youths had already emptied a couple of liquor bottles and some scrumptious dishes including desserts.
