Wales search for replacement contenders

Wales on Sunday considered making a complaint against England hooker Tom Woods as celebrations over their historic win over England were tempered by a rising injury toll.
At least two further replacements could be required with doubts Scott Williams (knee) and Hallam Amos (shoulder) still to be cleared to continue in the tournament after being seriously hurt in Saturday's 28-25 victory at Twickenham.
Liam Williams was stretchered from the ground after he suffered a blow to the head when he appeared to be kicked by Woods.
"There was definitely contact between part of Tom Woods body and Liam's head," assistant coach Shaun Edwards said.
"It's something we're going to look at. Obviously, as regards citing etcetera I think we'll make a comment on that later on but it's clearly obvious there was some contact with the head
"The (citing) decision will be made by our manager. We did lose one of our best players and in the position that we're in, we're quite short (on numbers), so we'll just look at that later and make a decsion."
