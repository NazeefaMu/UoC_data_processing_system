CID had no plans to arrest CDS - Information DG

Government Information Director-General Sudarshana Gunawardhana refuted media reports that said the CID had planned to arrest Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne.
The reports said the arrest was to be made in connection with allegations of the CDS protecting a wanted Navy Officer.
Gunawardhana said the CID on September 2, 2018 in a letter to the CDS had informed him to provide a statement regarding allegations of shielding an officer to evade court and or providing protection preventing him from being arrested.
The DG said that some of the print and electronic media, saying that a high ranking figure of a security force is to be arrested, was apparently providing publicity to the opinion of the Opposition that the government was on a mission to hunt war heroes.
Hettiarachchi Mudiyanselage Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias ‘Navy Sampath’ was arrested by the CID on August 13, 2018 in connection with the abduction, torture, extortion and murder of 11 persons in 2008 and 2009.
The DG recalled that investigations into the abduction incident commenced on September 10, 2009 under the previous regime.
The question arises as to how interrogating the CDS becomes an issue of hunting war heroes.
