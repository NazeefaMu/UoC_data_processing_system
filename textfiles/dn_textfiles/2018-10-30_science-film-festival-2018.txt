Science Film  Festival 2018

The Opening Ceremony of Sri Lanka’s second Science Film Festival will take place in the Sri Lanka Planetarium in the presence of Minister Sarath Amunugam and Andreas Berg, Chargé d’Affaires a.i. German Embassy on November 2, at 6:30 pm.
The festival is the largest event of its kind and with more than one million spectators in over 20 countries every year one of the biggest film festivals worldwide in terms of audience reach. In 2017, the Science Film Festival included South Asia for the first time and as a part of this extension, Sri Lanka joined the festival as a newcomer. How tremendous the interest in improving science education in the country is, was pictured by the 650 screening venues in all 25 districts of Sri Lanka reaching astonishing 85,000 spectators.
These gratifying figures are thanks to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research who stepped in as a major partner next to the Goethe-Institut to implement the festival at primary and secondary schools as well as universities. The Science Film Festival promotes science literacy and facilitates awareness of contemporary scientific, technological and environmental issues through film and television content with accompanying educational activities.
The festival presents scientific issues accessibly and entertainingly to a broad audience and demonstrates that science can be communicated in an educational, as well as entertaining matter. Some films are synchronized in Sinhala and Tamil to offer the viewers access to the content without language barriers. Under the main theme of “The Food Revolution” the Science Film Festival 2018 explores the issues around nutrition and meeting the demands of a fast growing global population as one of the key challenges of this century in general but also particularly for Sri Lanka. Out of the international pool of scientific formats, 34 with special relevance to the country have been selected. Agriculture which is among the greatest contributors to global warming – emitting more greenhouse gases than all cars, trucks, trains and airplanes combined – majorly using and polluting precious water supplies and accelerating the loss of biodiversity will be one focus topic of this year’s Science Film Festival. Along with the screenings come several activities that consolidate and deepen the learned knowledge through practical use.
For that purpose educational delegates from all over the country have been trained in the Goethe-Institut Colombo to conduct these activities. Between November 2 and December 14 the Science Film Festival will take place in primary and secondary schools and in universities in all 25 districts of the country.
Additionally in this period of time there will be screenings for the public every Friday at the hall of the Goethe Institut at 7 pm.
