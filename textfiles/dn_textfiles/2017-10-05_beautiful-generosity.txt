Beautiful generosity

The 25th Scholarship Award Ceremony sponsored by the Foundation will be held at the BMICH on October 21 at 2 pm. The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation will be held under the patronage of Mahopadyaya Maha Nayaka of the Sri Rohana Chapter of Siyam Nikaya Most Venerable Udumalagala Sri Mahinda Nayaka Thera and delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.
The Agonshu sect was founded in 1978 by Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera. Born on January 5, 1921, the Thera was in a difficult phase of life due to illness. Although he decided to join armed forces during the World War II, his health condition did not let him fulfill that aspiration. The doctors predicted that he cannot live more than 25 years. The Thera, still a layman then, was largely affected by this medical prediction. He was on the verge of committing suicide.
After becoming a Mahayana monk, Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera was engaged in extensive research on the Buddha’s teachings.
He travelled to a number of countries to pass on the Buddha’s teachings. He combined the traditions of Theravada, Mahayana and Tibet Buddhism and founded the Agonshu sect. Within a short span of time, the Agonshu sect became an instrumental tradition of Buddhist teachings across the globe. Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera became an iconic figure among the Buddhists who took up Agonshu tradition.
The Foundation has a number of noble objectives. Foremost among them is offer a helping hand to Sinhala Buddhist students with financial difficulties. Renovating Buddhist places in remote areas, equipping the youths with vocational education, providing medicines and dry rations to helpless patients and improving the infrastructure of temples and Buddhist libraries are the other core activities of the Foundation.
The 25th Scholarship Award Ceremony sponsored by the Foundation will be held at the BMICH on October 21 at 2 pm. The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation will be held under the patronage of Mahopadyaya Maha Nayaka of the Sri Rohana Chapter of Siyam Nikaya Most Venerable Udumalagala Sri Mahinda Nayaka Thera and delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.
