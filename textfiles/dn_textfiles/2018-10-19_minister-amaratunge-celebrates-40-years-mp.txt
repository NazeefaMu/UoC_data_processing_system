Minister Amaratunge celebrates 40 years as MP

Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunge completes 40 years of service as a parliamentarian today.
A felicitation ceremony in his honour will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on October 21 at 3 pm, at the Wattala Town Hall. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will be present at the event.
Minister Amaratunge is the first parliamentarian to be appointed to the August Assembly without an election, under the provisions of the new constitution. He was appointed a member of Parliament for the Wattale electorate to fill the vacancy created by the demise of the then Posts and Telecommunications Minister.
A UNP stalwart, Minister Amaratunge is a politician loved by the public, whom he meets regularly at his Kandana office to address their grievances.
