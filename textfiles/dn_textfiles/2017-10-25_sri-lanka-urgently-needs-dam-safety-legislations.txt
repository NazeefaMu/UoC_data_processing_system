Sri Lanka urgently needs  Dam Safety Legislations

Considering the poor state of the large number of dams in Sri Lanka, our country urgently needs a Dam Safety Regulatory Framework (DSRF) which provides the legal framework to manage all dams in the country.
Engineer Siraj Perera who is currently working as a Dam Safety Regulator in Victoria made these remarks at a high-level symposium and dialog conducted by Sri Lanka National Committee of Large Dams (SLNCOLD) in collaboration with eminent dam engineers in Sri Lanka.
Expressing views further on the subject, Engineer Perera highlighted a dire need of a Dam Safety Regulator in the country and to fulfill this obligation an independent Dam Safety Regulator should be appointed by the Government immediately.
Over 60 Sri Lankan dam safety expert engineers who were present at the symposium.
Eng. Siraj Perera also highlighted that a Dam Safety Regulator is immensely needed to a country considering the protection of lives, properties and valuable water resources and other infrastructure.
He said the Dam Safety Regulator concept is well accepted in almost all countries in the world where dams play a vital role in the development of economy.
“These countries not only accepted this initiative but also enforced proper regulatory mechanism to ensure safety standards of their dams,” he said.
Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, Additional Secretary Eng. DD. Ariyaratne highlighted that there are many dam operators in Sri Lanka but it was pathetic that no dam safety regulations in our country.
He said dam safety standards should be followed by country’s all respected organizations in order to prevent dam failures including cascade type failures.
Director General of Irrigation, Eng. M Thuraisingham said safety practices of dam owners depend on their experience.
World Bank, Former Irrigation Engineer Nihal Fernando recalled when the Kanthale dam failed in 1986, a commission was appointed to inquire the reasons for failure <U+200B>and they submitted recommendations to prevent such occurrences in future.
“Although they recommended that a dam safety regulation should be introduced, it did not materialize”.
According to Eng. Fernando the World Bank project on Dam Safety and Water Resources Planning was launched in 2002 and the establishment of a Dam Safety Regulation was also identified but could not be implement so far.
Agrarian Development Department, Chief Engineer Prabath Withana said there are nearly 400 medium and large dams and about 12,000 small village level dams are in Sri Lanka.
“All medium and large dams are maintained properly by the relevant organizations such as the Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority, Ceylon Electricity Board, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and also Provincial Councils”.
He further said the village level small reservoirs are operated by the Agrarians Development Department, Provincial Councils and Farmer Organizations. <U+200B>Head works of Mahaweli Authority, Director Eng. S R K Aruppola said the reasons for conducting this nature of dialogues and symposiums are to make aware of responsible officials of the Government about the importance of this national policy.
Eng. Aruppola further said that “Dam Safety Inspectorate” is the one Independent Inspectors/Technical Auditors and it was initiated under MRRP/DSWRP.
He said Dam Safety legislations have been introduced in many countries.
“In our country dam safety legislations and dam safety regulatory framework should have been introduced 30-years ago, soon after the breach of Kanthale Dam which claimed over 130 lives,”
He said we have a choice; either to act now or keep our eyes closed and wait until another disaster like the breach of Kanthale Dam.
Therefore, a joint Cabinet Paper should be prepared by Ministers and Secretaries of all Ministries responsible, namely, Irrigation and Water Resources, Mahaweli and Power and Energy.
