The ACCS was established on a decision by the Cabinet in 2015 to receive and facilitate complaints on serious fraud and corruption. It has been proposed to restructure the anti-corruption institutional structure of the country and to establish a fully-powered Serious Fraud Office which is similar to the Serious Frauds Office in the UK.

Bus fares revision
The authority of revising bus fares based on relevant criteria with ideas of private bus owners associations has been granted to the National Transport Commission. A policy for revision of bus fares was prepared and implemented by the commission in 2002.
Bus Owners' Associations have claimed that the policies and criteria on bus fares revision should be amended to suit present day needs. The proposal by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, to appoint a Committee of Intellectuals to review policies and criteria made in 2002 to provide a better public transportation, was approved by the Cabinet.

Sri Lankan Consulate General Office in Nicosia
Diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Cyprus were established in 1963 and the Ambassador of Rome has been concurrently accredited to Cyprus. Nicosian Consul for Sri Lanka is also attending to essential consular and labour issues in Cyprus.
There is a need to establish a Career Consulate General Office in Nicosia to promote employment opportunities and to ensure the welfare needs of about 20,000 to 25,000 migrant workers in Cyprus.
The proposal by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, to establish a Consulate General Office in Nicosia, Cyprus to promote trade, investment, employment and educational opportunities and to ensure the welfare of migrant employees, was approved by the Cabinet.
Amendment to Social Security Board Act
The main role of the Social Security Board established under the Social Security Board Act No. 17 of 1996 is to establish the pension and social security benefits schemes for those who are engaged in self employment. Such schemes are implemented by the board. Persons of 18-59 ages can contribute in them. By 31.03.2016, there were 497,102 contributory members and 22,973 pensioners who obtain a monthly pension.
The proposal by Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B Dissanayake, to amend the above act to include private sector employees, professionals, artistes, indigenous medical practitioners, foreign employees, persons engaged in agricultural and fishing activities as contributory members and to amend the age limit of obtaining membership, was approved by the Cabinet.
Installation of Diagnostic X-Ray Units

The proposal by Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senarathne, to award the tender for procurement for supply, installation and commissioning of Diagnostic X-Ray Units according to the recommendations by the Cabinet Appointed Standing Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.
Moves to upgrade national fishing fleet
Sri Lanka could not gain the maximum use of fisheries resources in the deep sea as most of multi-day fishing vessels out of 4,000 are of 30-40 feet long and with limited travelling distance and low capacity in storage. The proposal by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, to provide 10 new fishing vessels of 55 feet long to fishermen with 50 percent concessions by the government and to improve 50 vessels operated in Sri Lankan seas and 50 vessels in international seas with the cooperation of Ceynor Foundation Ltd, was approved by the Cabinet.
Recognition for National Vocational Qualifications
Many countries have implemented a National Qualifications Framework to recognise learning capacity and qualifications gained by a student. Sri Lanka has two qualifications frameworks as the Sri Lanka Qualification Framework, regarding qualifications awarded by higher educational institutions and the National Vocational Qualifications Framework developed by Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. However, recruitments are not made considering only the National Vocational Qualification.
Though all the students are unable to show educational/academic skills, some may build up specialisations in various fields by engaging in occupations. The proposal by Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, to issue a circular by the Public Administration and Management Ministry, to the effect that NVQ level 3 and NVQ level 4 certificates are equal to passing GCE Ordinary Level Examiniartiona and GCE Advanced Level Examination for recruitment in a relevant field, was approved by the Cabinet.
