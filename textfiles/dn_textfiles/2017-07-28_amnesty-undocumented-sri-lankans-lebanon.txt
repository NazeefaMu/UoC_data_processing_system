Amnesty for undocumented Sri Lankans in Lebanon

The Government’s bilateral efforts to regularise nearly 7,000 undocumented migrant workers in Lebanon commenced recently. After nearly a year long negotiations with the Lebanon’s government, a special resolution was passed by the host country in February to repatriate all undocumented Sri Lankan workers.
Undocumented workers who are above 60 and have overstayed beyond 15 years have been granted amnesty without any charges. The others have been granted repatriation with 50 percent payment of their overstay fines.
The Sri Lankan Embassy in Beirut extended appreciation for the assistance granted by the relevant agencies both in Lebanon and Sri Lanka.
According to the General Security of Lebanon, 90 percent of the undocumented Sri Lankan origin migrant workers are women domestic workers. The embassy in Beirut is working towards registering all Sri Lankan migrant workers in that country. Since September 2015, over 400 Sri Lankan migrant workers have registered their presence in Lebanon. The General Security of Lebanon has given approval for 55 Sri Lankan persons with exit permits. About 39 Sri Lankans have been repatriated this month. The embassy staff facilitated the repatriation at the airport.
