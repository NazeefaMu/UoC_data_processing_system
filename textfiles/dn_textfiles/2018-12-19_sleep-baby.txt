Sleep like a baby...

We all crave a good night’s sleep every once in a while. If you find yourself envying a baby sleeping soundly with not a worry in the world then fret not, that could be you.
That’s because a bunch of architect experts have got together to create a hotel room that looks like a womb, complete with muted lighting, soft pink walls and high-tech mattresses, all to create the coziness of your mother’s interiors.
The Zed Rooms have been purpose-built over, fittingly, nine months and feature bedrooms with a cocoon-like bed, inspired by the safety and snugness of the womb, to encourage positivity, relaxation and REM-rich sleep.
The rooms come as part of a collaboration between sleep technology company, Simba and serviced apartments Cuckooz.
They took inspiration from a womb as, during the last weeks of pregnancy, a baby increases its REM sleep, hitting a lifetime high of twelve hours a day in the final week before birth.
There’s no other moment during a person’s life when they will get such a huge volume of REM sleep.
Resident sleep psychologist at Simba, Hope Bastine, said, “If you’ve ever noticed that you don’t sleep as well in a hotel, you’re not alone. Scientists recognised the first night effect over a decade ago, where one half of the brain unconsciously acts as a night watchman staying more alert when in unfamiliar surroundings.
With this in mind, tapping into the emotional and physical, no stone has been left unturned trying to soothe the effects of this in the design architecture of our new cutting-edge sleep retreat.”
There’s plenty in the room to ensure a delicious night of snoozing too, including restorative scents and colours to relax muscles, air cleansing soporific plants to eliminate toxins and healing background harmonies to unwind.
And don’t worry about stubbing your toe in the middle of the night when you get up to pee as the room is equipped with rounded edges and softened corners.
Steve Reid, co-founder of Simba, added, “The Zed Rooms aren’t a traditional getaway. They are geared entirely to honing quality sleep away from home. Fine tuning you overnight to navigate at whatever life throws at you the following day.”
The Zed Rooms, located in Shoreditch, East London, are available for £190 per night.
