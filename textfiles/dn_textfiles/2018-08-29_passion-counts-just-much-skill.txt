Passion counts just  as much as skill

As we sit through episode after episode of Mahacharya Yavvanaya TV series, we tend to develop a certain bond with some of the characters. They just standout like a candle in a cave, and their actions and accomplishments impart a certain holistic kind of inspiration. They each teach their own life lessons, in their own unique ways, even if it isn't directly implied.
When episode by episode goes by, they occupy our hearts and minds with their brilliant lifestorylines. Intentionally or unintentionally I do learn a lot and apply them to some extent in my routine since I am also in my pathway to become a Professor in Entrepreneurship very soon.
Mahacharya Yavvanaya one of the most edutainment TV program to have ever made, that has influenced a lot of peopleespecially students those who thinking thriving in a particular field is merely impossible.
The best and most powerful lesson every episode of Mahacharya Yavvanaya have ever given is to Never give up as there’s always a way, even if you are in jail or someone is about to take away everything you’ve worked for in life, there’s always a way out even if sometimes you have to touch the grey areas.
Don’t fight the crazy inside you, embrace it.
