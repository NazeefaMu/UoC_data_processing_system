Three persons die every day in SL of oral cancers

Three persons die every day in Sri Lanka of oral cancers. In 2011, a total of seven new oral cancer cases were reported and this number increased to eight by 2014, Consultant in Community Dentistry of the National Cancer Control Programme, Dr. Prasanna Jayasekara said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that oral cancer tops all the other cancers in the country and more men get oral cancers than women. Oral cancers showed an alarming increase among Sri Lankan males between 2006 and 2011.
According to Dr. Jayasekara, around 72 percent of oral cancer patients seek medical treatment when the cancer reaches stage 3 or 4, which is very late. Every day around six new oral cancer patients are detected. The five-year survival rate is less than 50 percent. There are 28 carcinogens in tobacco, while there are four in areca nut.
Prof. Ruwan D. Jayasinghe said that it is arecanut and tobacco and their products which cause oral cancers. Arecanut and tobacco-based products arrive in Sri Lanka from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc, and even the importation of such products is banned. Chewing betel and chewing arecanut and tobacco products have been banned inside all health institutions since 2017 and this ban will be extended to all state institutions and schools soon. It is sad to see the number of schoolchildren addicted to these products increasing daily, he said.
