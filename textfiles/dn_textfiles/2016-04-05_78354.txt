UNP Working Committee reshuffle only after amendments to party constitution - Prof. Marasinghe

 
Whilst rumours of a UNP Working Committee reshuffle are on the cards, Head of the Strategic Political Bureau of the UNP, Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said that it would only be possible after amendments to the UNP constitution have been introduced.
'It is not likely that such an event would take place soon,' Prof. Marasinghe said.
Last week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would introduce a new constitution to the UNP by September this year as the country itself looks towards a new constitution.
He also emphasized on the need to groom more second and third level leaders in the UNP.
The Prime Minister however is to leave on a 3-day visit to Beijing on Wednesday (6) to work on several trade agreements with China. Several newly introduced positions to the Working Committee are rumoured to face some change.
