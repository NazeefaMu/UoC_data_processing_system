Moves to empower conflict affected

Rs. 1,500 m for reconciliation-focused economic empowerment project:
The National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena initiated a programme on “Reconciliation Focused Economic Empowerment Project”, Ministry sources said.
The programme aims at strengthening the economic and business linkages between North and South.
A special budget allocation of Rs. 1,500 million has been provided on the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the sources said.
The main objective of the project is to improve the production capacity of the producers of the conflict affected Northern and Eastern provinces and other regional districts and to establish links with buyers and exporters from the rest of the country through which inter-ethnic, inter-religious and inter-regional ties will be strengthened to ensure healthy integration and lasting reconciliation, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said.
The project will also provide livelihood support to conflict affected vulnerable families: refugee returnees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and war victims. Assistance will be prioritised to women headed families, families with disabilities, disabled ex-combatants, families with missing persons and those living under extreme poverty.
The project will support the micro enterprises in the conflict affected areas to enhance value chain and facilitate linkages between North and South.
The project will cover sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, livestock, self-employment, micro/small industries, handicrafts and services.
The project will support training, technology transfer, machinery, working capital, market facilitation and credit facilitation, Sivagnanasothy said.
