CB Governor urges collateral-free loans for young entrepreneurs

Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaswamy urged the management of commercial banks to consider granting collateral-free loans to young entrepreneurs with National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ).
The Governor had made this request at a meeting with the CEOs of the commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka, recently.
Dr Coomaraswamy drew the attention of the CEOs to the difficulties faced by potential young entrepreneurs in obtaining loans from formal banking institutions to begin or improve their businesses due to their inability to meet collateral requirement.
He requested the CEOs to find some way of granting small loans without collateral to those who have NVQ qualifications, so that they can purchase machinery and equipment and begin or improve their businesses.
The Governor’s request was based on a research finding that a large number of young entrepreneurs with professional NVQ qualifications have recently started businesses in the services sector in Sri Lanka. Hair dressing, beauty culture, bridal dressing, event organization, catering and delivery of goods and services, etc, have become popular among young entrepreneurs.
The study was carried out by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office together with the Small Scale Enterprise Development Division of the National Policy and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Census and Statistics Department.
“We understand the difficulty in releasing a loan without having a security against it. Although the CBSL provides 100 percent refinance facilities for some of the concessionary loan schemes targeting the micro, small and medium scale enterprises, the credit risk is with the participating financial Institutions. However, we have a collective responsibility to help these young entrepreneurs to begin or improve their businesses making them financially inclusive. They will be your future customers,” the Governor said.
The Policy Development Office issuing a press communiqué yesterday pointed out that these young entrepreneurs have been brave and venturesome enough to start enterprises without any state handouts or tax concessions. The release pointed out that the first few years of such a business are challenging and need commitment and innovation for survival.
“They now need access to funds to expand and consolidate their businesses to get to the next level. They are Sri Lanka’s potential future tycoons, the Upali Wijewardenas, the Harry Jayawardenas, the Ken Balendras, the Dhammika Pereras, the Nawalokas, the Gnanams, the N.L. Mubaraks, the Amaleans, the Omars, and the Captains, of tomorrow. They must be nurtured. They need to access funds now. Financial service providers must respond,” the release stated.
