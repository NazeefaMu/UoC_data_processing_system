Culinary history combined

The April holiday season is always a good time to relive traditions that have been passed on through generations of our people. With a rich history Sri Lanka is a proud nation that appeals not only to local but also to international visitors from around the world. Much of this history and tradition is culminated at the largest museum in Sri Lanka, the Colombo National Museum which incidentally celebrates 140 years since establishment this year.
Nestled in the museum premises is the perfect café to quench your thirst or grab a quick bite while walking through the annals of history. Barista’s signature “museum outlet” is situated on the Green Path end of the expansive museum property and serves up some of the best coffee and accompaniments in the country.
The outlet serves up some delicious wares including distinctly Sri Lankan flavours. The Spicy Polos and Cheese Sandwich, Pol Sambol with Fried Egg and Cheese Sandwich and the Jaffna Style Prawn Sandwich are among the favourites in the Sri Lankan range. Served warm out of the oven these sandwiches are filled with mouthwatering goodness. To wash it all down there’s a range of signature Barista coffees like the Caffe Mocha, Caffe Latte or the Cookies N Coffee Shake. For those who want to keep the drinks localized as well a Lime and Mint Crush, Orange Crush, Ginger Smoothie or an Iced Green Tea is ideal to beat the heat wave. If there’s room for dessert then Barista is famous for their version of the classic Blueberry Cheesecake and the Chocolate Excess both which comes in generous portions for the price one pays.
Barista provides two options for seating at this outlet. Comfy couches inside are ideal for relaxing and chit chat with a few friends as you tuck into your meal and enjoy a good ol’ board game while you are at it. For those who prefer the great outdoors there’s ample space outside under garden umbrellas to enjoy the cool breeze and the scenic beauty in the heart of the city.
