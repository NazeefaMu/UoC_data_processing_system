Sri Lankan products promoted in Bahia-Brazil

Sri Lanka Embassy in Brazil organized a series of promotional activities in Salvador, the capital city of Bahia, from March 6 to 9 to popularise Sri Lankan products. The GDP in Bahia is estimated to be over US$ 95 billion, the 7th largest regional economy of Brazil.
Sri Lankan Ambassador in Brazil General Jagath Jayasuriya and his team had an exclusive meeting with Governor of the state of Bahia Rui Costa and the key officials of the State Government where discussions were held on ways and means to enhance bilateral relations especially in the trade and industry.
Rui Costa said the importance of exchange of tourism delegations to exploit the untapped potential in the industry.
“As an initial step, I wish to visit Sri Lanka with the leaders of tourism industry of Bahia and we would indeed be happy to receive such delegations from Sri Lanka also” Costa said.
Ambassador Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka tourism witnessed a robust growth after the defeat of the LTTE terrorist group in 2009.
“We had over two million tourists in 2016 but only 1,400 from Brazil. This is due to lack of awareness,” Jayasuriya said.
He said several Sri Lankan tour companies would participate in the ABAV International Tourism show to be held in September in Sao Paulo.
Jayasuriya said Bahia’s emerging middle income market with a GDP per-capita of over US$ 6,000 and a population of 15 million would certainly be an attractive destination for high quality Sri Lankan products such as apparel, specialty food, spices and porcelain andceramic ware.
Association President Luiz Fernando said Bahia was a fast developing state in Brazil due to its strong industry base.
“Being the oldest business association in Brazil, we are capable of helping the Sri Lankan companies to get into the market here,” Luiz said.
Sharing his views at a high-tea business meeting at the Federation of Commerce and Services (Fecomércio), which was attended by over 25 businessmen, Jayasuriya said, “I am really impressed with the great enthusiasm the business community in Bahia is showing to know about Sri Lanka and its products.
I invite you all to visit the Sri Lanka Pavilion at the APAS Trade Show to be held from May 2-5 in Sao Paulo where more than 10 Sri Lankan companies are expected to display a range of products including Ceylon Tea and Coconut Products.”
The main product promotional programme held at the Hotel São Salvador was attended by over 30 identified leading businessmen based in Salvador. Commercial Counsellor Premathilake Jayakody enlightened the gathering on the Sri Lankan export products using product specific videos and presentations.
The array of product samples displayed at the venue provided an ideal opportunity for the businessmen to feel a bit of the outstanding quality of Sri Lankan products and also to taste Ceylon Tea.
Speaking at an investment promotion meeting organised by the Federation of Industries of Bahia, Jayasuriya said, “You consider whatever the prerequisite you would think of for your investment - be it the location, infrastructure, ease of doing business or even the access for utilities and services for that matter - we are the number one in South Asia.”
He highlighted infrastructure, food processing, tourism, technical education and logistics as few of many highly potential sectors in Sri Lanka for investors in Bahia.
Ambassador Jayasuriya and his team paid a visit to the ‘Industrial Park of Camaçari’, which is the home for many leading industries in Bahia. Sharing his views with the industry people, Jayasuriya said many industries in the industrial park provided promising opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters who were engaged in export manufacturing, especially auto parts.
