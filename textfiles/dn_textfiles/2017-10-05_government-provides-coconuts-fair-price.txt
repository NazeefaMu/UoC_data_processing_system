Government provides coconuts at fair price

The government has implemented a programme to provide coconuts to the consumer at a fair price as coconuts are sold at an exorbitant price in the market . The plantation companies belonging to the government launched a crash programme to sell coconuts to consumers at Rs. 65 each in key cities in the country. These companies have started selling coconuts at Rs. 65 at government institutions too.
