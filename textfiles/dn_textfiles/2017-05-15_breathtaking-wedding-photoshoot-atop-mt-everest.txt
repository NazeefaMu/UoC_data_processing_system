Breathtaking wedding photoshoot atop Mt. Everest

Destination weddings have taken the world by quite a storm in recent times and while they are really expensive, some couples just go ahead and create magical experiences with it. A travel-loving couple recently set all kinds of couple goals with their wedding photoshoot on Mount Everest and the photos look magical.
According to a media report, California couple James Sissom and Ashley Schmieder wanted to have an adventurous wedding and so they decided to tie the knot on Mount Everest. They hired an award-winning destination photographer Charleton Churchill and click some really wonderful pictures. The 30-something couple trekked through harsh conditions to reach the base camp 17,000 ft above sea level for over three weeks to have the perfect shots they had desired for the perfect adventurous wedding.
While it was a first for the couple, Churchill had attempted a similar shoot in 2015 and had quite an idea about the terrain and the difficulties but managed to do it quite nicely to produce a wedding album they will cherish for life.
