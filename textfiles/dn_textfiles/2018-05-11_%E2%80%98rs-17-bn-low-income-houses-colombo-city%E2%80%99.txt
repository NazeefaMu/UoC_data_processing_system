‘Rs. 17 bn for low-income houses in Colombo city’

An investment of Rs. 17 billion will be made for a housing programme for Colombo city. The period where pay-offs had to be made to government contractors and politicians has now ended. An investment of Rs. 5 million will also be made on each low-income group family in Colombo, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony to mark the opening of a new housing scheme with 437 flats costing Rs. 1.748 billion at Aramaya Place, Dematagoda, Colombo, yesterday. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were the chief guests on the occasion.
Minister Ranawaka said past governments had made various efforts to provide decent houses to slum dwellers in Colombo city. The late minister Pieter Keuneman, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, as well as former Minister Indika Gunawardene and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had made efforts towards this direction.
‘Now we have made a firm determination to completely resolve this housing problem of low-income groups in the city by finding a 100 percent solution. We have achieved 100 percent success in defeating terrorism and bringing peace and providing electricity to every household. The mobile phone network too had achieved 100 percent success. Today we have shouldered the task of building a 100 percent house-owning population.”
Ranawaka said the UDA would invest Rs. 25 billion on three office complexes in Battaramulla in addition to the task of house building. He was proud to state that the UDA was financially stronger and steadier than any private institution.
As much as late President Premadasa built a ‘city within a city’ at Maligawatte, the present government would build five housing cities in Colombo, with each one almost 10 times bigger than Maligawatte. The five housing cities will include the one in Dematagoda and four others - in Henamulla, Maligawatte, Kolonnawa and Kirillapone.
Although the government was deeply involved in the development programme, the message did not go out to the people due to poor publicity. Their intention was to carry the message of development to people’s hearts and minds, the minister said. He requested the beneficiaries of the housing schemes to use their houses to ensure a bright and prosperous future for their children.
