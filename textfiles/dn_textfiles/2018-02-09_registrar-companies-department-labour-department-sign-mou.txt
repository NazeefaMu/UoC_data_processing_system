Registrar of Companies Department, Labour Department sign MoU


The Department of Registrar of Companies and the Department of Labour signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in order to form a new web based Single Window for Business Registrations.
The web based Single Window for Business Registration facilitates applicants to obtain business registration number, EPF number and the TIN number by filling an online application.
The online system cuts down the business registrar process from six days to one day.
Registrar General of Companies D.N.R. Siriwardena and Commissioner General of Labour R.P.A. Wimalaweera signed the MoU.
