Macron to face Le Pen in French election run-off

Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron has topped the first round of the French Presidential election and will face the far-right Front National’s Marine Le Pen in a standoff marked by anti-establishment anger that knocked France’s traditional political parties out of the race.
Macron topped Sunday’s first round with 23.75% of votes, slightly ahead of Le Pen with 21.53%, according to final results from the interior ministry. -THE GUARDIAN
