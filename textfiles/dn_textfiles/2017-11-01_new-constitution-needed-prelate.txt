NEW CONSTITUTION NEEDED - PRELATE

The constitution making process should not be reversed due to the wants of a small minority of monks who want to bring back defeated politicians into power. The government should instead work to fulfil the aspirations of the 6.2 million people who voted for them, Asgiriya Chapter Deputy Parivenadipathi, Kadugannawa, Karuduwatte Sri Sudarshanaramadipathi, Ven. Yatiwaldeniye Medhankara Thera said yesterday. “The President and the Prime Minister have made it clear to the country that neither the unitary state of the country nor the place given to Buddhism would be harmed by a new constitution.
The Ven Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter too has stated that there was nothing wrong with power devolution.
Thus it is clear that a few monks are working according to a political agenda to sabotage the new constitution”, he added. The Thera explained that there were greater numbers of monks in favour of a new constitution compared to those who were against and that needed to be highlighted.
