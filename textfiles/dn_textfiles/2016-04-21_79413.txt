Sri Lanka to christen Canberra with a Test in 2018/19

 
Finally, Canberra's Manuka Oval has passed the Test. After narrowly missing out to Hobart on playing the game's long form in the ACT next summer, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland announced on Wednesday Australia will play a Test against Sri Lanka there in the 2018-19 summer.
It came on the back of the announcement Australia will play New Zealand in the second of a three-game series for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in December.
The Test will replace Canberra's ODI for the 2018-19 summer in the four-year agreement between the ACT government and Cricket Australia to hold international cricket in the nation's capital.
It could affect the roll-out of Greater Western Sydney's proposed $800 million Manuka Oval redevelopment, if the Manuka Green project is given the green light.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr told Fairfax Media Manuka Oval would not be a construction site during the historic Test. That could delay any potential starting date of the Manuka Green project.
Instead, the government will invest $3-10 million to upgrade Manuka, which could include increased capacity, bigger replay screens and improved media and player facilities, as well as the widening of entry gates.
Barr was "delighted" to have finally landed an historic Test for Canberra.
"The ACT government has been working towards the goal of hosting international Test cricket in Canberra for many years," he said in a statement.
"It is a significant win not only for Canberra cricket fans, but the broader community who will benefit from the increased coverage of our city during the test match and a boost to the local economy.
"We are committed to ongoing investment in sport in the Territory, and we have invested significantly in Manuka Oval in recent years to ensure that the venue is well placed to host Test match cricket. "Canberra has proven itself an ideal city for hosting world-class sporting events.
"For cricket alone, over the past couple of summers we have hosted men's and women's One Day International games, the Cricket World Cup and year after year we host a successful Prime Minister's XI."
The ODI against New Zealand will be played on December 6, as part of the Australian men's team summer schedule announced Wednesday morning.
Sydney will host the first of that ODI series on December 4, and Melbourne the potential decider on December 9, and a second ODI series will be played in New Zealand in 2017.
New Zealand will be one of four international sides to travel to Australia this summer, with South Africa, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka also playing here.
The summer schedule will break from tradition by starting in Perth with a Test match against South Africa on November 3 at the WACA
The three-match series against the Proteas will continue in Hobart from November 12 to 16, before a Test at the Adelaide Oval from November, 24-28 which CA says has "potential" to be a day-night Test, as it was last year.
Cricket Australia says it would like the Adelaide Test to be played with the pink ball, due to "enormous expectation" from fans, but said "understandably, there is some concern from the South African players", and they are working with Cricket South Africa to come to an agreement.
Brisbane will host its first Day-Night Test with a pink ball from December 15 against Pakistan, that three-Test series continuing as per tradition with day Tests in Melbourne for Boxing Day and Sydney from January 3.
A five-game ODI series against Pakistan will then start with Brisbane (January 13), Melbourne (January 15), Perth (January 19), Sydney (January 22) and Adelaide (January 26) to host.
Sri Lanka will visit Australia at the end of the summer for three T20 Internationals on February 17, 19 and 22 , with venues to be confirmed. - SMH
