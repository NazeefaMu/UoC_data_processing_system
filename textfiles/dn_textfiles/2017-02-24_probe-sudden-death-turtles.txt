Probe into sudden death of turtles

Tangalle Magistrate and District Judge Mahee Wijeweera ordered Tangalle Police and the Tangalle fisheries inspector to conduct an investigation into the sudden deaths of turtles.
He ordered them to submit a report to him on the deaths of the turtles and produce the suspects to court if unruly activities of human beings have led to the deaths of the turtles.
A large number of turtles were found dead in the costal belt from Hambantota to Tangalle for unknown reasons. Kalametiya Wildlife OIC Uthpala Adaranga appearing before the Tangalle Magistrate said the turtles had no wounds on their bodies, but they had died under unnatural circumstances. He said the turtles must have got entangled to the fishing nets thrown by the fisher folk to catch Madu fish and the turtles must have died of suffocation.
The bodies of 30 turtles that died have been sent to the elephant transit home at Udawalawa.
