[APPRECIATIONS - (11-09-2017)]

Harold Herat
A genial politician
Above any flaw, a much celebrated politician of our time, clean both in body and mind, Harold Herat was held in high esteem not only nationally, but internationally as well. He was a total politician with an ability to speak virtually on any subject matter that amazed everyone who came in contact with him.
His style of delivery and wisdom sat well on any medium, be it politics, English, religion, law, culture and even philosophy. Literature was his favourite subject and I as his wife shared many happy hours talking it over. He was a coloursman in tennis and represented his college, Joseph Vaz, at school and at national level. He brought much credit to his club, Marawila Sports Club, which he represented at Masters annually until his last year before death claimed his beautiful clean life.
He was a handsome man who carried his magnetic personality with ease, striking an impact on anyone. He came from a line of politicians such as Sir Claude Corea, Shirley Corea and even the late President J.R. Jayawardena. During hectic sessions in Parliament, he found time to go to church with us at St. Stephen's Church, Marawila, unless he was out of the country. A devout Christian who trusted in God, he led us on a path of spiritual belief which made our lives happy.
Born into an affluent planting family in the North-Western sea belt of the country, Harold chose law for his career though his father was a foreign-qualified physician. While practicing law at Marawila Courts, Harold was attracted to politics. He was picked for Nattandiya electorate in the 1977 General Election by J.R. Jayawardena against many other formidable aspirants.
It is perhaps this soft corner that JR had for Harold that made him to appoint him a Minister within one year of election as a Member of Parliament. He was the first non-Cabinet Minister to be appointed under the Second Republican Constitution of 1978. He was assigned the subject he had the greatest potential to perform, the coconut industry. Having inherited vast and excellent acres of coconut lands in the Marawila/Mudukatuwa area, though later diminished with the land reforms of the previous regime, he was expected to revitalize this important segment of our economy which was essentially indigenous in nature. He proved to be a worthy successor to that great politician though of a different genre, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, who as Minister of plantations in the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government and had laid the institutional foundation to uplift the coconut industry.
Harold not only improved and rationalized this network, but also introduced new impetus through additional local investment and much needed foreign investment and innovation. The coconut statistics for the era (1978-89) not only in plantation, but also processing and marketing would amply demonstrate the contribution that Harold Herat made as Minister of Coconut Industries.
Fluent in both Sinhala and English, he could speak to a local crowd using their own idiom and to a forum abroad in polished dictum. I have watched him in both. With local audiences he may use pithy language. It is really as a gentleman that he impressed anyone who came in contact with him. Neat in appearance, but appropriately dressed always, he was an embodiment of decency. As a rule, he was courteous to his staff, deferential to those with expertise in relevant fields and considerate to all. Scrupulously honest, he had a high sense of decorum and correctitude.
It is ten years since the demise of our husband/father, planter, lawyer, politician, minister, though he may have been, we shall always remember him as a gentleman of the first order.
May the turf on his grave remain greener everyday.

Tuan Hadjie Jaldin
A compassionate individual
Born in the healthy climes of Hatton on December 12, 1943, my grandfather was named as Tuan Hadjie Jaldin by my great grandparents Zainul Abdeen Jaldin and Gnei Seenar Jaldin. He married my grandmother Zareena Meedin in 1967 and they were blessed with five children. I wish to write a few words in memory of my beloved grandfather on his sixth death anniversary which fell on September 2.
My grandfather obtained his primary education at Royal College, Colombo and then entered Greenlands College (Isipathana), where he was a standout performer in sports and was the first rugby captain of the school. Thereafter, he played for CR and FC for many years and subsequently was its rugby manager for several years. Whilst working at CR and FC, he was in the company of many Sri Lankan and European players.
He used to relate many stories about the games during that era. Especially about the rivalry between CR and Havies. Being a reputed athlete in school, my grandfather’s pet event was the 400 metres and he took part in the Asian Veterans' Games held in Singapore in 1986, finishing fourth.
He was a very caring husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He was such a caring person and loved us; his grandchildren; more than anything. Whenever a visitor came to our place, he used to relate our mischievous deeds with them. We used to address him as ‘Kakey’ and he was always there to support us showing his love at all times. His grandchildren (numbering 15), some of whom he was not fortunate enough to see for they were born after his demise, do resemble him and have qualities similar to him.
We are indeed fortunate to have him in our lives since he shared all his stories and memories of his career. We will not meet any other person like him and we all miss him so much.
May almighty Allah grant him Jennathul Firdouse.

He was a caring grandfather
As a tribute to my late father Terence Ashley Peiris, I am writing this appreciation on the 60th death anniversary of my grandfather, which falls on the September 15.
It is sad as I only faintly remember him, as I was only three years old when he left this world to be with our Lord Almighty. My brother Trilanth was born 11 months after his death and my grandmother’s wish had been to give him my grandfather’s initials; T. M. Peiris. In keeping with her ardent request, he was named Trilanth Malkantha.
He was ‘seeya-daddy’ to myself and my brother. He was also referred to by that same endearing term by my Peiris cousins; Ninesh, Nilendirini, Sharika and Dilhani. ‘Daddy’ was the term used for him by my Aunt’s children.
I still remember one special occasion where he brought me a toy; a doll on a bicycle; which he specifically showed me how to operate whilst keeping me on his lap. I could still remember the white full suit he was wearing on that day. This is the only memory I have of my dear seeya-daddy.
I also recall my thaththa telling me all of seeya-daddy’s good qualities and the love and devotion he had for the family. He had a good voice and used to play the violin while singing. Sometimes my grandmother would also join him and the two would sing hymns together.
Even my amma used to tell me that seeya-daddy treated her as one of his own daughters and he had been very close to my maternal grandparents too.
My two uncles (loku bappa Tilney and podi bappa Dudley) were very young when seeya-daddy passed away and they must have missed him badly at that time. Nevertheless, they followed seeya-daddy’s footsteps and served God to the best of their ability and they were both local preachers in the Methodist Church.
More than anything else, I am thankful to seeya-daddy for giving my malli and I a loving and caring father who loved us so much and did everything for us.
Dearest seeya-daddy, we rejoice as we are certain that you are with the Lord Almighty. You will remain in our hearts forever. May your soul rest in peace until we meet again on that beautiful shore.

Farewell to a cherished friend
Harold was my closest friend and he was also the best friend I ever had in my life. Ten years ago this time, I spent each day by his side at the hospital as he lay in hope that he would recover. However, God needed Harold near him and he was taken away from his dear wife and three lovely children.
With his passing, I lost a dear friend who helped me in numerous ways, especially when times were tough and things were hard for me and my family. We loved each other from the beginning and no one can ever take his place as my dearest friend.
Those who shared his life will always remember the many precious moments and special memories that revolved around him. He will not be forgotten and we were truly blessed to have him in our lives. May the Lord grant him eternal rest. Deanna Jayasuriya
Romsan Deegayu Dissanayakea
He was a beacon of light
‘Pahala Lelwala, Dandunna’ nestles in the backdrop of the Kirindalahena mountain range on one side and the greenish paddy fields that spread along the Wanduramba-Baddegama highway like a green carpet on the other, naturally sandwiched to sooth the village folk in the Galle District. The cool breeze that takes its natural path, sweeping the paddy fields, the thickets and the rustling bamboo leaves are poetry in motion in this bucolic hamlet. Tranquility and the religious fervour of the locality provide the much-needed springboard for anyone to unlock his or her potentials and rhythmically strive to be a genius and serve one’s fellowmen.
Romsan Deegayu Dissanayake, born on September 26, 1915, was naturally blessed with all of nature’s blessings to make his journey in life to be evergreen in the hearts of the villagers forever. It is veritably true and my concern in this piece of writing is to rekindle my nostalgic memories of him, as I felt, when I was an inexperienced youth in the formative years of my childhood. For me, he was a colossus guru and for the village in the vicinity; a beacon light.
The late Benjamin Dissanayake and Karaline Weeragunarathne Sahabandu from the adjacent hamlet Urala would have never thought that their youngest son could make a long walk to success in his life. He has had one brother and two sisters who had predeceased him at their ripe age. He had his primary education at the village school, Lelwala Wickramasinghe Primary School. This promising village prodigy became a teacher in his own alma mater at the age of 19. He thought to himself that it was his bounden duty to work hard to uplift of his native village. ‘Mangala Youth Society’ was his stepping stone in this regard. At the outset of the society, he had only 12 members; yet with the passage of time, it became the umbrella organization that enveloped almost all the social services activities of the hamlet.
I fail in my duty if I don’t mention here that he donated a huge portion of his own land to erect a permanent building for the society. This historical record is of paramount importance to us because in the modern society people are in a mad rat race to grab more and more lands for selfish aims. His farsightedness in planning for rural development is quite visible in the programmes he drafted for further expansion. He had a special education programme to improve literacy among the adults. It was a step taken in the nick of time. The village library programme in the locality was his brainchild. Listening to the radio, followed by reading was very instrumental to keep the people abreast of time. Listening to dhamma discourse on the wireless on Sunday was made virtually compulsory to the villagers and thus he was able to tame the rustic villager to a great extent. He firmly believed that the development of the village depended mainly on agriculture.
He took the initiative and introduced modern agricultural methods to village farming. Their annual programmes ended with a village sports gala that gave the opportunity to people from all walks of life to enjoy to their heart’s content. 'Sangabo' mutual benefits society was another welfare organization greatly benefited by his benevolence. Dissanayake was the unanimous choice for their chairmanship. In recognition of his yeoman service to the village, they held its fourth anniversary in a grand manner. His contemporary ex-MP for Baddegama, one-time the deputy minister of finance late Neil De Alwis; was one of his close associates, but he never sought any personal favour from him. He exploited his faith on him to have one of his life desires fulfilled. Irrigation of the lowlands in the village was a long felt need. Thus, he was very instrumental in building a dam across two hillocks at Kirindalahena and making a large reservoir for the benefit of the farming community; ‘Kirindalahena Wewa.’ Its cool water is a soothing balm to the weary farmer and numerous birds.
The rippling waters in this picturesque tank tell us the legend of the hydraulic saga that ignited rural development in the area. It is synonymous with the two great names Neil De Alwis and Romsan Deegayu Dissanayake. Inland fishing became very popular with the humble villagers and nutrition of the rising generation took a new turn. The no man’s land in the middle of the tank became a birds’ paradise, giving birth to a new ecosystem that is a real treat to the eye of the beholder. Dissanayake deserves our credit for leaving a living legacy for us.
After gaining his initial teaching experience at G. Wickramasinghe Primary School in Wanduramba, he entered the then famous Kalurata Katukurunda Teachers’ College for his professional training in 1951. He cut his teeth as a well-trained teacher there and passed out with flying colours to serve the nation. He specialized in teaching music and art.
He assumed duties as an assistant teacher at Badulla Kadndubudulanda mixed school in 1953. The following schools and the people in the vicinity still appreciate his untiring efforts to develop their schools. His teaching career was unblemished to the letter; a legacy to be emulated.
Matara Maha Vidyalaya was greatly benefited by his expertise. The old generation of Padiyatalawa Maha vidyalaya still remembers his contribution to education.
In 2013, the Government named the primary section of the said school as ‘Deegayu Dissanayake Primary School.’ This memorial building still remains as a living legend in recognition of his yeoman service for the uplift of the school.
Galidde Govt. school, Nugalanda Maha Vidyalaya, Mayadunna Vidyalaya, all in Ampara; Welideniya Primary School and Vidyananda Vidyalaya in his own area in Indurupathwila and Mahalapitiya Primary school very near to his home, were immensely benefited from his service to the nation. A special mention deserves to be made with regard to Padiyatalawa Maha Vidyalaya because of the very fact that it had been almost irreparably raged by communal disturbances originated from language policy in 1958 and Dissanayake left no stone unturned to develop it to a very great extent. He lit ‘Aladin's magic lamp’ to do it within a very short time. Community participation in school development gained a new dimension with his untiring efforts.
His dignified service in the capacity of the principal of that school from 1955 to1965 is written in golden letters in the cherished history of the school.
His youth ended in marriage on November 7, 1956. He tied nuptial knots with L.T.G.S. Dissanayake from Bamunugama in Matara, with the blessings of both sides of parents according to the age-old customs and their life story deserves to be bio-graphed for the next generation to read and emulate. They epitomized exemplary living. His widowed wife is a successful nonagenarian now, in the evening of her life.
Her graceful ageing illuminates the locality. She is a highly respected teacher retiree not in uncertain terms. Her forte is also teaching cum social service and the people in the vicinity wish her long life. She is a paragon of virtue.
Madura Mohan, who works in the capacity of works director of The Colombo Municipality, is their eldest son and Paduma Ranjan, his second son, works for Kelani Cables in the capacity of an engineer. They have two daughters; Nayana and Perna; both are veteran teachers of English. Their grandchildren are Amoda Milani, Praveena Nimani, Kehan Nandaja, Eroshan, Lakeesha Sammani, Tharushi Nadheesha and Dhanuja Rukmal. Chathuri Ramyakumari Kumarasiri, Pridharshani Rajapathirana and Sameerathna Hanthi, Lalitha Dahanayake Yapa have been fortunate enough to be daughters-in-law and sons-in-law, respectively, of this great family.
He ceased to be on April 2, 1993. His beloved wife and all his children and in laws were at his deathbed with sorrowful eyes, yet absorbing his inspiration to take the baton to serve mother Lanka with the same spirit. The unending mourners that made a bee line to their simple abode spoke volumes for the greatness of his soul.
Honour and fame, from no condition rise,Act your part well, where all the honour lies.
- William Shakespeare.
