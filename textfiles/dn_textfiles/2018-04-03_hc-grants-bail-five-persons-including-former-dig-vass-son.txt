HC grants bail to five persons including former DIG Vass, son

Five persons including former DIG Vass Gunawardena and his son Ravindu Gunawardena, were ordered to be released on bail by Colombo High Court (HC), yesterday, over an alleged incident of possessing firearms.
However, the bail order of this case would not be effective for the five suspects, as they were already on death row for the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam.
The suspects were granted bail following an application made by Counsel Vishwa de Livera Tennekoon.
Tennekoon had prepared an application in support of a petition dated August 7, 2014, by which he sought bail for former DIG Vass Gunawardena and four others in respect of allegedly committing offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979, The Offensive Weapons Act No. 18 of 1966 and the Firearms Ordinance as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996.
Counsel for the petitioner former DIG Vass Gunawardena’s wife Shamalie Priyadharshani Perera, de Livera Tennekoon brought to the notice of Court, that although an application was made for the aforementioned petition, no order was made in respect of the case as the suspects were convicted and sentenced to death for a connected murder by a Trial-at-Bar.
He submitted inter alia that;
(1) The High Court has the power to make a bail order in relation to the suspects.
(2) Section 2 of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 states that the grant of bail is the guiding principle in implementing the Bail Act and that the refusal of bail should be the exception.
(3) Although the suspects are condemned prisoners (pending an Appeal before a five-judge bench in the Supreme Court), the suspects are being produced before the Magistrate in respect of these alleged offences every two weeks, which is a threat to the security of these suspects and also an additional expense on the State.
(4) As per Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person can be detained for more than 12 months in custody and as per Section 17, this period can be extended every three months for an additional year, on the special request of the Attorney General and no person can be held in remand custody for more than two years, as confirmed by Judge Sisira de Abrew in the case of Wickramasinghe vs. AG 2010 (1) SLR 141.
Tennekoon submitted that the suspects had been arrested in or around June, 2013 and that they had been held in remand custody for these alleged offences for over four years. For that reason alone, the suspects should be granted Bail.
(5) A condemned prisoner is not at risk of committing any of the situations mentioned under Section 14 of the Bail Act, which provides the reasons for which court may refuse bail or cancel a subsisting order for release.
He further added that the purpose of bail is to ensure that a suspect/accused is present and available to stand trial at court hearings and that considering the status-quo of the suspects, that they are not at a risk of absconding. Tennekoon informed the court that the said grounds may be considered as exceptional circumstances which entitle his clients to bail.
High Court Judge Lalith Ekanayake agreed with the submissions made by de Livera Tennekoon and granted bail for the suspects. Accordingly, each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of Rs. 200,000.
Six suspects; former DIG Vaas Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Vaas Gunawardena, Sub-inspector Indika Bamunuge, Police Constable (PC) Gamini Sarath Chandra, PC Priyanka Sanjeewa and PC Kelum Ranga, were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam in 2013 at Dompe.
