Eguardian Lanka launches local technical assistance centre

Eguardian Lanka, a value-added distributor of Fortinet cyber security solutions in Sri Lanka, unveiled the country’s first Fortinet Technical Assistance Centre (TAC) at World Trade Centre recently.
Staffed by a dedicated team of certified engineers, Eguardian will be providing its clients and partners with level 1, 8x5 technical support for all Fortinet products and services through the TAC.
“We are delighted to open Sri Lanka’s first Fortinet Technical Assistance Centre to support our clients and partners who have trusted us with their business. Working together with Fortinet, we look forward to ensuring that they receive a timely response to any technical issues and that their Fortinet security infrastructure maintains the highest levels of performance to protect their critical assets and data,” said Suresh de Silva, Chief Executive Officer of Eguardian Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. “This TAC also underscores Fortinet’s commitment to providing a team of certified engineers who will be on hand to offer the highest levels of service.”
“The launch of the Fortinet Technical Assistance Centre in Sri Lanka will ensure support is readily available to customers at any point of time to ensure business continuity,” said Rajesh Maurya, Regional Vice President, India and SAARC at Fortinet. “The Fortinet Security Fabric positions us well to provide industry-leading technology to protect our customers against aggressive threats. With our local support centre, we are complementing our best of breed solutions with enterprise grade support to ensure our customers stay secure and protected.”
As the first cyber security solution provider to offer such a service locally, this move by Eguardian and Fortinet will enable customers and partners to receive faster troubleshooting for their day-to-day issues. They will gain fast and easy access to technical support via a web portal and email including processing of returns and replacements for hardware failures.
Eguardian has also made significant investments in maintaining an ample supply of hardware components in its local stores to minimize clients’ downtime. This, together with the fact that the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process will now be handled by the local TAC, will let Eguardain further speed up ticket resolution.

With its head office in Colombo, the company has operations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Oman and Bangladesh as well as a strategic office in Atlanta, USA.
