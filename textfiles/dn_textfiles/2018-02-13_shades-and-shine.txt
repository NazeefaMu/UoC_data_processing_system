Shades and shine!

Kevin Murphy announces revolutionary new Color Me by Kevin Murphy, the brand’s first hair colour range for salons, stylists, and their clients. The brand is born from stylist and founder Kevin Murphy’s vision to fuse styling with fashion and hair colour. A compact colour line, Color Me delivers high-performance, natural-looking results with optimum colour functionality. In keeping with the brand’s heritage, Color Me also features gentle, natural ingredients to moisturise and rejuvenate hair while imparting shine.
Color Me by Kevin Murphy launches with 80 honey-based, versatile, multi-tonal
shades. Colourists have the ability to mix shades and create custom colours that are semi, demi or permanent based on client needs. Colours in the compact line offer natural looking results, full grey coverage, and up to four levels of lightening.
“I am thrilled to launch Color Me by Kevin Murphy,” states Kevin.
“The compact, flexible line offers unbelievable results with natural looking colour, multi-tonal effects and a glossy finish.”
“As with everything produced by Kevin Murphy, performance and ingredients are of the utmost importance,” explains Kevin.
“When developing Color Me by Kevin Murphy, we looked at the colouring process as a treatment for the hair. The colours in our line are PPD-free, ammonia-free and full of naturally-derived ingredients including Shea Butter, honey and pomegranate.”
The carefully formulated colours feature a three-step technology:
rMolecular Couple Guarantee means that all colouring molecules form secure bonds, lessening skin irritations and/or allergic reactions
rOxidation Delay Function helps delay the oxidation process when the cream activator is added to the Color Me by Kevin Murphy shade, allowing an even and precise application and colour coverage
r Special Micro Pigments means that extremely small colour pigments are deposited onto the hair, which penetrate deep into the hair shaft for shinier, healthier looking hair
Color Me by Kevin Murphy features five variations of cream activator,
two variations of a powder lightener, clay based freestyle lightener
and a cream lightener for an alternative to the powder formula.
