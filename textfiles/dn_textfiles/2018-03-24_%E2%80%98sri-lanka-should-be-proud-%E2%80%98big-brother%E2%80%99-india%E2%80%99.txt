‘Sri Lanka should be proud of ‘big brother’ India’

Top-level officials from Sri Lanka and India used the occasion of an International Education Day to highlight what they said were deep ties between the two countries.
“The bond that exists between Sri Lanka and India, from time immemorial, always we should keep that bond alive,” Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said on Thursday evening.
He was speaking at an event commemorating India’s Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and International Students’ Day at the Taj Samudra Hotel.
“This (day) is a celebration as much of our abiding faith in the role of knowledge and skills in development, as it is of the unique relationship between our two countries,” Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.
Sri Lanka is one of the largest beneficiaries of India’s technical assistance scholarship programme, he said, with 400 short-term and around 750 long-term scholarships for higher education in India.
“We have helped Sri Lanka write her development story by training her scientists, economists, engineers, and policy-makers in world-class universities across India,” he said.
High Commissioner Singh Sandhu said the Indian government is trying to strengthen the scholarship programme. Last year, for the first time, Indian university entrance exams were held in Colombo.
Minister de Silva said the rise of India and Indian institutions gave countries across the global East something to be proud of.
“We had a mentality to look at the West all the time, to talk about Western scientists, Western doctors, Western professionals,” he said. “But now that era has changed, because Asia has produced the greatest scientists, technical people, professionals, and doctors.”
He said some of the best doctors of scientists working in Western countries now are of Indian origin.
“We can be proud,” he added. “We have our own big brother on the other side of the ocean, on whom we can depend.”
