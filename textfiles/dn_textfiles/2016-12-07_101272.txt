Team Sony outwits Newton’s law to win Red Bull Gravity Challenge

Team Sony, a group of friends from various universities emerged victorious amongst 192 teams when they outwitted gravity in the Red Bull Gravity Challenge in front of the Dutch Hospital Shopping mall on November 25.
Teams Sony, ABCX, Kude Kudu and Team Empire scored the highest points, but with the creativity and their technical savvy Team Sony landed their egg-landing device to the ground in a perfect manner. They clinched the first place with 45 points and won Rs. 125,000, followed by Team ABCX with 44 points winning Rs.75,000 and with an equal score of 42 points, Team Kude Kudu and Team Empire tied for third place walking away with Rs 25,000 per team.
“We are so happy to win the Red Bull Gravity Challenge. We tried out so many different designs before sending our sketch in and after we got a green light from the organisers we practiced this drop a couple of times at college. Seems like practice made it perfect,” said Darmeega Selvarajah, captain of Team Sony.
The Red Bull Gravity Challenge attracted 242 teams with over 1000 spectators. Not all the teams managed to get their eggs landing safe and sound but some dropped it unscathed from 15 metres without being damaged.
Each team of three was given one minute to climb the 15 metre platform and drop their device. An independent jury evaluated their creativity and the idea behind the egg-landing device. The jury consisted of Lee Bazalgette (Director of Colombo Design Studio), Anjuli Flamer-Caldera (CEO of Agency Sri Lanka - Talent Management Firm) and Savindri Talgodapitiya (Co-founder Field Travels Company).
Points were awarded to each device on a 1-20 points scale. Being a part of this event required the team to submit a sketch of their egg-landing-device with a weight of no more than 5kgs and a size no more than 1 cubic metre.
