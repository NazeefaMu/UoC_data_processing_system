First among the Anandians

Ananda College is celebrating its 131st anniversary on first of November 2017. It is quite evident that the contributions made by Anandians were quite remarkable in many disciplines .You refer anything about victory against terrorism , sports, literature ,science, Arts to politics you could not ignore Anandians with their achievements. What was the success story of Ananda College? This is all about making -up a sensitive person with love, affection and passion towards to the nation.
History of Ananda College
An educational organization identified as the ‘Buddhist Theosophical Society’ was formed in Sri Lanka under the leadership of Colonel Henry Steele Olcott who was a founder member of the Theosophical Society of New York. The names of Ananda College and Henry Steel Olcott always go together in Sri Lankan literature. Olcott was born on August 2, 1832, in Orange, New Jersey. After an early career in agricultural science and journalism, he served during the Civil War as a military investigator of fraud and corruption.
This was followed by a career in law, which he later combined with journalism, reporting on spiritual phenomena. Olcott is especially admired for his work among the Buddhists of Sri Lanka, Burma, and Japan, helping them realize the essential value of their own heritage (that is, one of the essences which is inculcated by Ananda throughout the last 131 years. The patriotic love for the country!) . The administrative skill and public activities throughout the world were largely responsible for the society's growth and organizational success.
The Buddhist Theosophical Society opened a number of schools in different parts of Sri Lanka for the higher education of Buddhist children.In 1886 the first of those schools was opened on a modest scale with 37 students in a private house in Colombo. Later this school was named Ananda College after Arahant Ananda, the most devoted disciple of the Buddha. Ananda College has its memorable events in the school's history. One was the visit of Asia's first Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, on November 10 ,1922, as chief guest at the annual prize giving. He declared on that occasion: “I acknowledge that the life of Ananda is its humility and unassuming nature.”
First student at Ananda
It is interesting to discuss about the first student of Ananda College names as Jinarajadasa. He was born on 16 December 1875 and year 1889 was one of the remarkable year for young Jinarajadasa. This is the year, when Charles Webster Leadbeater, the first principal of Ananda College was asked by A.P. Sinnett (English author and theosophist) to come back to England to tutor his son, Leadbeater agreed and also brought one of his pupils, Jinarajadasa, to England with him. Jinarajadasa went to St John's College, Cambridge where he studied oriental languages and after four years graduated in the Oriental Languages Tripos. He then came back to Ceylon and became the vice principal of Ananda College in Colombo. Jinarajadasa returned to Europe, to study at the University of Pavia, Italy. Hereafter this Old –Anandian has become proficient in Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Jinarajadasa has enormous contribution to world in terms of literature, knowledge and Wisdom. The story and some life events of this intellectual is always worth to study .See following remarks by Surendra Narayan,
“C. Jinarajadasa (C. J.) was the fourth international president of the Theosophical Society from 1945 to 1953. He was born and raised in Sri Lanka until he came into contact with his brother from a past life (said by some to be Bishop C. W. Leadbeater), who took him away from Sri Lanka to guide and help him to grow spiritually and become a dedicated worker for the Theosophical Society.
As many know, the TS was founded by Colonel H. S. Olcott and H. P. Blavatsky, but the inner founders were two Masters of the Wisdom, with one of whom, as C. Jinarajadasa mentions, he had bonds of love and gratitude that extended from past lives and whom he regarded as an incarnation of love and power.Since my parents were members of the Theosophical Society, I invariably accompanied them as a child and later in my college years to the annual conventions of the Theosophical Society at Adyar and Varanasi. There I used to observe and respectfully admire C. J. as a charming leader of the Society. He once came to north India on a lecture tour and wanted a young theosophist who knew Hindi (the language of that area) to accompany him. My eldest brother volunteered and, to his great delight, was chosen by C. J. for that glorious job. Thereafter, when C. J. visited our hometown, he readily accepted my father's invitation to come to our home for lunch. I felt thrilled to be so near him, for he was to me an embodiment of grace and goodwill. He seemed to radiate uplifting currents of bliss and benediction. C. J. was a messenger of love and beauty and carried that message all his life through his writings and lecture tours around the world. He was a rich linguist and, through his fluency in Spanish and Portuguese, greatly expanded theosophical work in South and Central America. Apart from being a linguist, an international lecturer, and a beacon for the TS and many young people, C. J. was also a poet. So I would like to end with one of his beautiful poems, which truly delineates his outlook on life:
Word that is true and voice that is kind,Thought that is just from a selfless mind;Help that is swift and hurt that is spared,Grief that is hid and joy that is shared.These be the flowers that I cull this day,Smiling at eve in thy hands to lay. ”
(Source : Narayan, Surendra. “C. Jinarajadasa.” Quest 93.6 (November-December 2005):228-229.)
As scholar, lecturer Jinarajadasa was awarded the “Subba Row Medal” for his contribution to Theosophical literature. He has immensely contributed for exciting domain of knowledge with many publications on areas such as Theology, philosophy, literature, art and science.
The story of Jinarajadasa, first student of Ananda college need to be read by all Sri Lankans to study about a great human being with love ,affection and passion towards to world. We need to motivate our children to read .They need to read about their nation, history and about people . ‘A love for tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril.’- Winston S. Churchill
