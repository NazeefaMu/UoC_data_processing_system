Army SC ‘A’ crowned Limited-Over Tournament champions

When two Army SC’s Women’s teams, Army (A) and (B) qualified to play in the finals of 2016 Women's D1 Limited-Over Tournament that was played on 29th June at MCA ground, Army (A) proving the strength of their first-tier contingent recorded a huge 189-run win over Army (B) to win the Championship with ease as expected by many. However, this final could not match the excitement normally generated in a final as it was just a testing tussle between two teams of a same club.
Navy SC (A) and Air Force SC (A) finished the first-round of this Women’s Limited-over tournament as top two teams in Group ‘A’ and ‘B’ respectively when they remained unbeaten winning all three matches they played in the preliminary round. These two teams dominance throughout competition helped them easily clinch two semifinal berths whilst Army SC’s (A) and (B) teams secured other two spots in the semifinal lineup.
Despite the fact that the two table leaders won semifinal berths with little challenge from other competitors of the tournament, the other two semi-finalists Army (A) and (B) had to wait until they beat their oppositions in their last two encounters that were played on 25th June.
In two semifinals played on 27th June, Army SC (A) beat Air Force SC (A) ending Air Women’s unbeaten run whilst Navy (A) recorded a huge 174-run victory over Army SC (B), but according to a decision taken by the Tournament Committee, Navy SC were disqualified and Army SC (B) were given the opportunity to play in the final.
Navy SC, the only unbeaten team in the tournament, though they failed to play in the final produced tournament’s most successful batter and the bowler both when Lasanthi Madhushani topped the tournament’s batting list with 230 runs at a healthy average of 76.67 scoring one of the three centuries recorded in the entire tourney whilst Inoka Ranaweera became the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets to her credit including two five-wicket hauls.
Hasini Perera of Navy, Chamari Atapattu of Air Force and Rebecca Vandort of Army scoring over 150 runs also did well with the bat whilst Niluka Karunarathne of Army, Darshani Darmasiri of Air Force and Madushika Mettananda of Army became other top performers with the ball.
Meanwhile, Chamari Atapattu finished a good all-round show bagging 6 wickets in addition to her 168 with the bat which included a century. The third century maker of the tourney was Nipuni Hansika of Army who claimed the fifth slot in the batting list with 144 runs.
