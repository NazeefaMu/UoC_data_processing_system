Two young women found guilty of unruly behaviour under the influence of liquor in a public place in the heart of Matara were fined Rs. 3,500 each, totaling Rs. 7,000 by Matara acting Magistrate Upali Ranasinghe.
As the two accused stated that they were financially not in a position to pay the fines, the culprits were sentenced to an imprisonment of one month by the Magistrate.
According to investigation officers, the two accused are residents of Akuressa.
Matara Police officers, who were on mobile patrol in the Matara town, made the arrests and prosecuted in the Matara Magistrate’s Court.
