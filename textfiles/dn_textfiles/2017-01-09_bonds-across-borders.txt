Bonds across borders

A policy of closer integration with the world
After the near isolationist policies on foreign relations followed by the previous government, Sri Lanka continues to make progress in Foreign Affairs with the strengthening of relations with the world, and international organizations that are most relevant to the development strategies of the Government.
The presence of President Maithripala Sirisena in several countries from East Asia to the West, and neighbouring India, too, showed the interest that Sri Lanka has in building new relations with the international community, as well as strengthen neighbourly relations, which would help the country in its path to progress in both economic and social development. President Sirisena visited Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, and Austria in the efforts to build new friendly relations, had discussions with national leaders and did sign important agreements of understanding, as well as winning the interests of those countries on investing in Sri Lanka. The relations with India continued at good neighbourly levels, with Sri Lanka displaying a position of friendship and interest in closer cooperation between the two countries, while maintaining the country's good relations with China, too.
He also visited the United Nations for the General Assembly (UNGA) Sessions, in what the important 70th anniversary sessions of the UNGA, and renewed Sri Lanka's commitments to the United Nations on its resolutions on peace and understanding; especially in the context of Sri Lanka moving towards strengthening peace building and reconciliation among its own people.
Sri Lanka was among the countries that endorsed the Climate Change Agreement that was agreed in Paris, the previous year, and made clear the country's commitment on protection of the environment and the use of renewable energy, taking an important place in the South Asian moves to battle Climate Change.
PM's foreign tours
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too made visits to many countries, and had meetings with international organizations with an interest in promoting democracy and the Rule of Law, in keeping with the spirit of the Commonwealth on these issues, and Sri Lanka's own commitment to be a strong democracy in Asia. His visits took note of the necessity of making the best of Sri Lanka's strategic location in the Indian Ocean, and the possibilities this opened for a stronger economy and better understanding with the larger world community, with the importance of the Indian Ocean sea routes in the advance of international trade.
The new trends in international affairs that were emerging in the past year saw the Ministry of Foreign Affairs look at new directions in the country's foreign relations, which saw settling down of good relations with near decade of antagonism with the international community, the United Nations and many UN and other international organizations, under policies of the previous government.
Busy year
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera did have a very busy year with the necessity to renew good relations with the world and also give leadership to the implementing of policies that Sri Lanka had agreed to with UNHCR and other organizations, as the country moved to give meaning to the principle of better relations with the world.
An important aspect of this change of direction in Foreign Affairs was the participation of Minister Samaraweera in the "Our Ocean Conference 2016" held at the US State Department, at the invitation of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The Minister said that Environment was a matter of major importance for Sri Lanka, which would play its part in dealing with issues relating to Climate Change and the Environment in a responsible manner, both locally and in the global context.
2016 saw an unfortunate development in foreign relations in the South Asian region, with the failure to hold the scheduled Summit of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which was due to be held in Pakistan, due to rise in cross-border terror attacks on India, that India saw as having created an environment that is not conducive for the Summit. South Asia saw Pakistan being isolated over the issue, as Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and the Maldives, decided to keep out of the October 2016 Summit, which resulted in Sri Lanka not participating in what would have been a non-event in international relations.
NAM summit
Sri Lanka did participate in the 17th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) held in Venezuela, which reaffirmed NAM's determination to continue opposing any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity or territorial integrity of a State as well as their commitment for the respect of the sovereignty, the sovereign equality of States, the non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the abstention from the threat or use of force, in accordance with UN Charter.
Another international event of significance for Sri Lanka in 2016 was the "G7 Outreach Summit", in Japan, where Sri Lanka was a special invitee that saw the participation of President Sirisena. In his address to the Summit the President said that with a revolutionary change of governance, his government has succeeded in creating the path for a viable development environment and for reconciliation in a multifaceted society.
Now, the people are free and human rights are respected. Sounding a most practical note he said that Sri Lanka lacked finances for extensive development efforts and therefore seeks developed nations and multilateral and bi-lateral investors to invest in Sri Lanka.
Thanking Japan for the invitation to Sri Lanka to attend this important Summit, President Sirisena said this invitation would yield real benefits beyond bounds, if serious attention is drawn to our problems Sri Lanka faced.
Sri Lanka moves to 2017 with much expectation of even better relations with the world as it seeks to fashion its foreign policy to the major changes that have taken places in the West, and the rise of new populist political trends in both the US and Europe, that are key international investors; and also looking at the relations with South and East strengthened, as the world possibly enters a new phase of closer trade and economic relations among countries, rather than wider international agreements.
