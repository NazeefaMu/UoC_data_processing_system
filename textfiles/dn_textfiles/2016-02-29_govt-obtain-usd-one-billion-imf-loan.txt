Govt to obtain USD one billion IMF loan

 
The government is set to obtain a standby loan facility of US dollars one billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka yesterday said.
"IMF has agreed to release the loan facility to us. It will be used to move forward the country's economy," the minister told the Daily News.
The loan is expected to boost the country's sagging foreign-exchange reserves. The first tranche of the loan is expected within the next couple of weeks, Finance Ministry sources told the Daily News.
The ministry is planning to reduce the debt burden that grew under the previous regime, they said.
Minister Karunanayaka said they are planning to move forward the country's economy through strong macroeconomic stability, financial discipline, increased investments and elimination of corruption among other things. Asked if this loan could mean added taxes being imposed on the public, a ministry official said that elimination of corruption and taxing on the super rich are on the cards under the ministry's programme to achieve economic growth.
President Maithripala Sirisena is keen on reducing the interest costs on the public, which is a staggering US $ 55 billion in total debt, he explained.
