Rosy meets Sri Lanka Tourism to discuss Colombo Tourism Development Plan

A delegation from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, headed by its Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka, held a discussion with Colombo's new Mayor Rosy Senanayake on revitalizing tourism related sectors in the commercial capital.
The meeting was initiated by Senanayake as part of larger plan for Colombo city development.
During the meeting, both parties agreed to develop the Colombo Fort as a major tourist attraction in the city. Senananayake said the Colombo Fort area, with its iconic heritage buildings and newly established hotels and restaurants, had immense potential to boost tourism industry.
She also stated that relatively fresh concepts such as theme parks should be incorporated into Colombo's tourism development plan.
'Most tourists who visit Sri Lanka only pass over Colombo without spending a night or two in the Capital city. We want to turn Colombo into a vibrant place where every tourist visiting Sri Lanka will spend a couple of nights - with good food, shopping and entertainment activities," SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said, appreciating the Mayor's interest in the tourism sector.
The SLTDA Chairman also added the importance of a comprehensive approach from all sides, ranging from top government ministries to garbage collectors on the streets, to uplift the tourism sector as the industry is well-positioned to become the country's largest forex generator by 2020.
The tourism authorities also stressed the need for attracting new investments to develop tourism-related industries in Colombo, especially hospitality.
Senanayake said they, as the municipal authorities, would walk an extra-mile to encourage such projects and facilitate their implementation.
The two parties also agreed that domestic tourism is another important segment that will drive up and support economic activities in Colombo.
The SLTDA and the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) pledged to work with mutual cooperation when it comes to the tourism development in Colombo and engage in a continuous dialogue on the ongoing projects concerning the industry.
