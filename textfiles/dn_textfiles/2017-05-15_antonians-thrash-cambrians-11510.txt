Antonians thrash Cambrians 115/10

St. Anthony’s College had very little to worry against Prince of Wales as they ran up over a century of points winning by 115 points (10 goals, 9 tries) to 10 (2 tries) victory in their Plate competition inter-schools rugby match played at Trinity College grounds, Pallekelle yesterday. The scoreline was the highest for the season.
The Antonians finally playing as a team dominated their opponents in the loose and mauls as they had a bulk of possession to humiliate the Cambrians who suffered the ignominy of losing by such a large margin.
Even before the second half began the Katugastota supporters knew the game was good as over as Antonians took firm control of the game by leading 74-0.
The Antonians played a good game and their forwards won the ball and the threes worked the line beautifully.
They were more in the opponent’s territory doing all what was possible in rugby - rucking, driving and keeping the ball with them for a major part of the game.
