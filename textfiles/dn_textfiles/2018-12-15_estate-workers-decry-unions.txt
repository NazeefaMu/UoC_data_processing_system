Estate workers decry unions

Estate workers who had been in a protest for nine days demanding a daily wage of Rs. 10,000 recommenced work yesterday.
Their unions that started the protest had asked them to commence work even though the workers did not receive the increment they demanded so far, workers said.
They said the unions deceived them and will do so in the future as well. Therefore, they will not do blindly what the unions ask them to do hereafter.
The workers said many of the unions in estates compel workers to take union actions but the workers suffer at the end without gaining anything they demand. “Such trade unions are deathtraps for workers,” they said.
