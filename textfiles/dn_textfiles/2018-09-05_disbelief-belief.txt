Gharasarapa
Disbelief in belief

‘What is always, what is everywhere … what is by all people believed’
St. Vincent of Lerins
‘Believed where we cannot prove’ -Alfred, Lord Tennyson
‘There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio…
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy’ William Shakespeare: Hamlet
And here comes Gharasarpa the one who enters a human body and makes all misbehaviour. I can recall a North Indian Hindi film, Sanjay Leela Bansali’s Juke Gaya Asman where the ‘good’ hero suddenly meets with an accident, and after his death, his soul enters into ‘bad’ and mischievous villain. Suddenly he becomes a ‘disciplined’ person! The character portrayal is by the same actor, Rajendra Kumar. The song Oh Priya sung by Mohamed Rafi in the background, the music is composed to suit that situation… It became a popular Sinhala film love song copying the same tune!
Jayantha Chandrasiri in his film uses all these social beliefs with pop and pageantry for the foundation of a serene love affair of a Tamil girl and a Sinhala boy in their blossoming youth.
After so many years the memory of their affair seems to be the same after some racial extremist elements tore their relationship apart. The girl has disappeared to an unknown destination and the boy in another path! The portrayal of the young lovers by the filmmaker may attract the audience with ‘believe it or not’ happenings! Does the ghostly power exist still? Is it still happening? I have a different view of the socio-cultural and religious impact of his theme. It all depends; How will the audience respond?
Chandrasiri proves his ability as a filmmaker in handling the actors and actresses. Especially in the crowd scenes, the actors are simply moulded into shapes and rhythms which the director aims! The audience is kept tight with curiosity.
There are Hollywood films in the same horror genre tried in various forms. Will it appeal to all sections of the Sri Lankan film audience?
With all these ingredients Jayantha Chandrasiri has woven into a heartwarming love story to all young at heart. The Tamil girl and Sinhala boy vice versa there were so many films on racial harmony. The enmity exists between two ethnic groups like Montagues and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet. In Gharasarpa the lovers are surviving, but time has passed and made changes. They are so close but they are too far in a way! Is it because of the ill omen or not?
Any film producer may take a risk to produce an ‘out of the ordinary’ film, but Arjuna Kamalanath –being an actor of popular films mostly - has come out as the producer of Gharasarpa. We wish him good luck and hope the audience will also patronize his effort!
