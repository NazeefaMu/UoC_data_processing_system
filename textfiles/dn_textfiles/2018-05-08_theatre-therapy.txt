Theatre therapy

Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation (LCYTF) or popularly known as Somalatha Subasinghe Play House commences its latest programme of “Drama Beyond the Classroom” on June 11.
The prime objective of the event is to make drama and theatre learning an enjoyable experience for the participating children. All aspects of drama and theatre are presented to the child in an easy-to-understand way so that the artistic taste, cheerfulness and playful sense of the child is enhanced. The programme is based on created activities and they give the child the opportunity to experience the most important learning outcomes of drama and theatre such as sense of caring, world awareness, experience in human relationships and socio-cultural values, a sense of basic art forms and more importantly confidence and dignity.
The event is designed primarily for grade seven to eleven children who offer drama and theatre as a subject at school. However, since the programme is activity-based any students who has the knack to be creative and adventurous too can join the programme.
For such students the activities of the programme can be considered supplementary to the formal education the child obtains in schools.
The programme is conducted by Kaushalya Fernando, Dr. Chandana Aluthge, Mayura Perera and Nilanka Dahanayake. The Late Mrs Somalatha Subasinghe founded Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation in 1981 to promote theatre productions and performances specifically for children and youth, training of actors, and research on theatre studies.
This organisation presently is the top most institution for children’s and youth theatre productions in Sri Lanka. Since 1981 the organisation has produced a repertoire of mainly musical theatre for children and youth and mainstream art theatre productions and performed them in the island as well as abroad.
This institution was incorporated in the parliament in January 2007 under the Act of Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation, No. 3 of 2007 to further its quest for the young audiences in Sri Lanka.
This programme is conducted on Mondays from 3 pm to 6 pm at Battramulla Lion’s Club Activity Centre situated in Jayanthipura main road.
