Royal baby ON THE WAY!

Kensington Palace announced the pregnancy on Monday morning with a statement that said: “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.
“Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.”
But another apparent statement did the rounds, where it was mentioned the couple had told the Royal Family at Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s wedding on October 12.
Some royal etiquette experts had criticised them, branding it a major “faux pas” to overshadow Eugenie and Jack’s big day. Etiquette expert William Hanson said: “Whether they are royal or not, they committed a faux pas. They did slightly upstage the bride and that is a complete no-no.”

But no, the couple did not actually tell their family during Eugenie’s wedding - it seems this was just a case of the royal rumour mill in overdrive.
BAZAAR.com has been told by a source close to the family that most of the family actually knew about the pregnancy before the wedding.
The Duke and Duchess are said to have shared the news before Princess Eugenie’s big day as they were set to jet off on their royal tour shortly after.
The source told BAZAAR.com the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and Eugenie and Jack all knew about Meghan’s pregnancy before the wedding.
They hadn’t seen them in person yet so were only able to congratulate them on the wedding day, but they were already aware of the happy news.
Whether the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge knew about the royal baby hasn’t been made clear, but with Harry’s extremely close relationship with his brother, it is likely.
A representative for Kensington Palace said Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge “are delighted for the couple.”

Princess Eugenie is yet to make a statement but is said to be close to her cousin Harry.
There were a few rumblings of the Sussex’s having stolen Eugenie’s thunder, however.
Just 40 minutes after the baby news broke, Eugenie’s mum Sarah Ferguson posted a tweet of the wedding with the caption: “So proud of Eugenie and Jack.”
Some speculated this was an attempt to get the attention back on her daughter after her moment in the limelight over the weekend. Eugenie’s father, Prince Andrew also retweeted one of Fergie’s tweets featuring Eugenie and Jack, also making no mention of Harry and Meghan.
But it’s hard to see what Harry and Meghan’s other options were.
They waited until after the wedding, but knew they would be photographed on a daily basis during their tour and Meghan’s bump is beginning to show.
