Parliamentary Group to meet on June 6 to discuss NCM against Ravi

The Parliamentary Group will meet on June 6 at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to come to a final decision on the No Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Vocational Training and Development Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said. Addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo yesterday he said that his personal view on the matter is that no minister should vote for it because if the ministers are in the Government they have a collective responsibility not to let down a fellow minister.
According to Minister Samarasinghe, if we raise our hand against a fellow minister, we have to resign from the Government. If we accept the fact that the Finance Minister had done something wrong, we cannot stay in the Government any longer. We have a collective responsibility.
“I will express my personal view during the June 6 meeting. The final and correct decision will be made there. There are only 30 or 40 MPs in the Joint Opposition who think politically,” he dded.
