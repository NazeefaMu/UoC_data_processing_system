Relegation of powers would reduce conflict: Shan Wijeyalal

State Minister and Deputy Ministers in the consensus government have not been given any powers. As such they have been somewhat disappointed. This has created a false impression that certain problems have cropped up within the government, said Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva. He was addressing a meeting held in Galle on July 16. The Chief Minister said a majority of ministers in this government belonging to both parties had failed to assign part of their powers to the state and Deputy Ministers under their wing. This had created disappointment and problems. If all Ministers realise the fact that they belong to a consensus government and take steps to relegate some powers to their deputies, such problems and issues could be easily averted.
Chief Ministers Wijeyalal de Silva said SLFP Parliamentarians joined the government according to a division of the party's Central Committee. If they were to resign from the government, it too should be done as a group and not individually."They should not try to work according to private agendas outside any collective decision," he said. He said as rulers, they should not steer clear of people in a roughshod manner. They should heed criticism and be prepared to even take a step back without being hasty in their decisions. If this was done, the opposition would lose slogans and run out of steam automatically, he said.
