Sing-a-Long: Is just the remedy for charity

In our government-run mental hospitals several patients seem doomed to life within these institutions’ walls, either because they have no family to return to or have been abandoned. The lack of enough rehabilitation programs and reluctance of families to accept a cured patient has put an additional burden on government-run hospitals.
This is the unhappy lot of 40 such female residents at Ward One of the Mulleriyawa Hospital whose families have abandoned them. It's not that they are suffering from any mental ailment any more. They have been cured and are fit to be discharged from the hospital. They have nowhere to go. No one comes calling and no one is willing to take them back. For years some of them have been languishing in Ward One of the hospital which needs extensive renovation.
Now the Lay Missionary Association of Our Lady of Fatima, Dean’s Road, Colombo 10 has decided to throw a lifeline to salvage the dignity of these hapless residents and make their lives more comfortable. And what better way to do it than with a sing-a-long fundraiser that bonds and connects a community together in the most delightful way imaginable. Sohan and the Xperiment will be in attendance at the BMICH Banquet Hall on July 15 dishing out an eclectic repertoire of irresistible toe-tapping melodies to unite with the audience in the best tradition of audience participation.
The songfest will feature some of the nation’s greatest legends in show biz including Mignonne Fernando of Jetliner fame in the guest spot. Together you can change the world for these unfortunate residents and have a heck of a good time in the process. Tickets are available from the following contacts: 0716313781, 0776274872, 0773687782 and 0778835557.
