Nobel Prize 'tribute to martyrs of democratic Tunisia': co-winner

The Nobel Peace Prize awarded Friday to Tunisian national dialogue mediators is a "tribute to martyrs of a democratic Tunisia", the head of a labour union within the quartet said.
"This effort by our youth has allowed the country to turn the page on dictatorship," said Houcine Abassi, secretary general of the UGTT, part of the National Dialogue Quartet that was recognised for building democracy after the 2011 revolution.
