Badge  of dedication

Head Boy of Loyola College, Negombo, Rayan Fonseka and Head Girl of Loyola College Negombo, Radeesha Fernando do not compromise when it comes to commitment and fulfilling their duties. This is what has been instilled in them by their school. Perfect Prefects features Fonseka and Fernando who are bold enough to do what is expected of them.
When Head Girl of Loyola Fernando, speaks up, she does so with conviction. Steadfastly believing that one needs to do the right thing at all times, she presents her ideas with little inhibition.
“We need leaders who are honest and committed. They must be unafraid to speak out when they are required to. One must rise to the challenge. Being able to think and act independently I feel is a pre-requisite to leadership,” said Fernando.
Taking decisions
Fernando points out to the power of prayer when seeking guidance and also relies on the help of her well-wishers when taking decisions.
“We are human and we have all made mistakes in our past. This may be through poor judgment. We have to do the best we can, in the present, and do it to the best of our efforts, and do the right things at the right moment. Basically, do the right thing in life,” stated Fernando.
Fernando pointed out that at Loyola, religion is honoured. The education at Loyola builds up the spiritual side of a child while educating him/her about the world. Fernando’s ambition in life is to become an accountant and is now making her way through step by step.
“Our School focuses on the spiritual aspect of a student’s personality. A lot of leadership programs are being offered in my school. These leadership programs are available to all students and inclusive of all students,” pointed out Fernando.
Fernando explains that God is her refuge, rock and strength and that God has a plan for everyone.
Fellow human beings
“I admire Nelson Mandela because he did his utmost for other people. He stood for the rights of others, his fellow human beings. He did so without resorting to violence. Fernando feels that the memory of gaining independence and winning the Civil War can unite us as a country,” added Fernando.
Fernando points out that the leaders should be self-sacrificing doing their best for society. They should not run after personal benefits. There is no point going around in cars with tinted windows in a long procession. You need to be in touch with what is going on in your own country.
“There are so many people in this world who are suffering. Leaders should listen to them. Leaders should open their eyes. People are struggling with their lives. There are people who have so many different problems. They need help. They need attention,” explained Fernando.
Fernando is optimistic. She says that young people can do many things if they put their mind to it. They need to believe in themselves and know that if they work hard they can make a change,” said Fernando.
Powerful way
If there is one thing Fernando believes in, it is the power of motivation. She believes that motivation can change lives in a powerful way. Motivation is the name of the game.
“I feel that one of the biggest problems in the world is poverty. We need to think about others. There are people out there who are starving. Very few people spare a thought for them. We need to examine our priorities,” stated Fernando.
Fernando also expressed her undying gratitude for the Rev. Fr. Rector, the sisters, the teachers of Loyola and her parents for where she is in life and what they have done for her.
“Last September we had our investiture 2017. In February we went on a three-day camp. On June 30, we had our prefects’ day, inviting many schools from Colombo and Negombo. We also did a charity project to help some people blind from birth. The roof of their home needed repairs and we were glad to help,” stated Fernando.
Head Boy of Loyola Fonseka feels that the three pillars of leadership are Responsibility, Punctuality and Honesty. To be a leader you need to be in order. You need to be able to handle responsibility. In order to execute the plan, you need to be punctual. You need to be honest if people want to work with you.
Self-assurance
“I usually arrive at the best solution after spending time with God in prayer. There is help for those who ask for help. I confidently face my challenges with self- assurance,” said Fonseka.
Fonseka feels that his strength is above and next to him. He points out that the reason for his success is God Almighty.
“What I have been able to do is because of God’s touch in my life. Also, I cannot forget my parents who have supported me right throughout. My prefects’ guild has also done a wonderful job in supporting me. I want to become a doctor, that is my goal in life, and I am trying my level best to achieve this. I think it is very important for having dreams and goals in life and you need to achieve them. You need that kind of determination. That commitment” stated Fonseka.
Fonseka feels that the teachers’ cooperation and their dedication has been crucial to forming his personality.
Valued discipline
“There is support at all times of the day and the teachers are always ready for counselling. I know how to behave in society because of the values and discipline instilled in me by my school. They have taught me how to be virtuous and how to live in the proper way. I believe life is a gift from God and it is a relationship with him,” explained Fonseka.
Fonseka’s role model and God is Jesus Christ. Fonseka points out that this is because Jesus had so much influence yet he never misled the masses. He admonished what was wrong and taught what was good.
“Again I must point out that being a responsible person is important for society to function well. You cannot pass the buck. You need to shoulder your responsibilities efficiently. Selfishness is a major problem in society because unfortunately people simply do not think about others,” explained Fonseka.
Fonseka feels sacrifice is a must if one is to see results. There can be no compromises. As much as the effort matters the results also matter.
“Leaders need to manage their time and need to properly manage their lives. You cannot and must not procrastinate. You have to work according to a plan. Lastly, I wish to thank Rev. Fr. Rector for all his guidance, support and motivation. I wish to thank my prefect body because without them this badge is useless,” said Fonseka.
