‘Reggie Ranatunga sacrificed his life for the SLFP’

My father Reggie Ranatunga was a great people’s leader who sacrificed his life for the SLFP, said Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, at Reggie Ranatunga’s 81st birthday remembrance at Udugampola, yesterday.
He condemned the use of his father’s birthday for political benefit.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa did not care about my father when he was living. Rajapaksa left him to die as a Parliamentarian. I’m happy that at least he’s paying tribute to my father’s body.”
A journalist queried whether Rajapaksa was trying to divide the Ranatunga family.
“Reggie Ranatunga saved the SLFP continuing with the principles of Bandaranaike,” Minister Ranatunga said. “But the Rajapaksas are trying to ruin our brotherhood.”
“My father never allowed my family to be divided. Some politicians are doing it after his death. Their politics depend on selling some characters. They are trying to ruin our brotherhood. In the Gampaha district, our family is the political family after the Bandaranaike family.”
“It’s good that my father has died. If not he would have died after seeing this situation. My father never tried to divide the party or leave the party. He was not a corrupt politician and we can be proud of him as sons. There is no disharmony in my family.”
“We are just following different political paths. Prasanna has a different political path and Ruwan is with the SLFP continuing with the principles of Bandaranaike. We will take one path together at the right time.”
