Inaugural LAYA Annual Awards Night in December

The LAYA Chain of Hotels will hold its inaugural Annual Awards Night ceremony in mid-December at the LAYA Beach Wadduwa, under the aegis of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, Lieutenant General AW J C De Silva.
Inspired by the Sanskrit word LAYA, which evocatively suggests REPOSE, that aura of tranquility is what the World of LAYA offers as it welcomes all travelers to its chain of hotels. Founded by the Sri Lanka Army to initially cater to the welfare of its war heroes, with the introduction of the LAYA concept, the Welfare Directorate thought it fit and proper to throw open its doors to local and international visitors at large.
The LAYA Chain of Hotels came into being with the opening of the popular Wadduwa Holiday Resort opened on the April 5, 1991, which was later renamed the LAYA Beach on the November 8, 2012.
Since then, the LAYA brand has extended to four idyllic locations island wide, LAYA Leisure at Kukuleganga, LAYA Safari at Yala and LAYA Waves at Kalkudah.
The LAYA Annual Awards, also called the LAYA Jayagrahi Nawa Mawathaka, is a concept mooted by its CEO, Maj. Gen Mahinda Hathurusinghe.
The event is designed to recognise the outstanding work of staff and associates as well as showcase the contribution made by the Sri Lanka Army via its LAYA Chain of Hotels to Sri Lanka Tourism in general and the Hospitality trade in particular.
LAYA Jayagrahi Nawa Mawathaka is expected to be an unforgettable evening for the associates of LAYA as well as the Sri Lanka Army community who will participate in this event.
Along with the Army Commander, who will be the event's Chief Guest, there will also be a Guest of Honour, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism and Hospitality Institute, and Director/CEO of the BMICH, Sunil Dissanayake, who will make the Keynote Address, “Why LAYA is relevant to Sri Lanka Hospitality.”
