‘Use Colombo’s garbage as landfill for Financial City Project’

Finding a site to dump garbage is not an issue as there is a ready-made venue for the port city project in Galle Face said former President of Chamber of Commerce, Tissa jayaweera. He said that the port city project uses sand and rook to reclaim sea investing a lot of money and machinery. “Instead the port city project can use the sorted out garbage collected from Colombo and use in the filling of the land.”
He said that though many consider garbage as an issue, both the private sector and government have not made use of garbage to generate revenue. Garbage is a valuable recourse for land fill. “A quick and cheap solution would be to use this garbage as land fill for the Financial City Project that is taking place as port city. By this method we will be able to save on sand which is currently being used,”he said.
A simple Rotary Separator can be designed depending on mesh size of grit required. Unwanted material can be collected at end of the Rotary Separator and taken away for separation as glass, metal, polythene, etc.
The Grit can be mixed with sand and used as land fill at the port city as well as other projects that require land fill. The Grit will be perfect top soil which will be mostly decomposed vegetation or bio fertilizer.
“Many countries of the world are now turning garbage to energy, compost being the outdated method. We have done none and many projects have been formulated, but none have been implemented.”
Garbage in the country have detonated to such as extent that the garbage has been converted to solid waste ideal for land fill other than a limited amount of polythene, plastic, styrofoam, glass, and metal (SS)
