Top pick Fultz recovering from ankle sprain

Los Angeles,Sunday: First overall draft pick Markelle Fultz is not expected to play any more summer league NBA games as he recovers from an ankle sprain suffered on Saturday night in Las Vegas, the US media reported.
The Philadelphia 76ers draft pick was helped off the court after rolling his left ankle in a game against the Golden State Warriors in Las Vegas.
Fultz, who recorded eight points in 15 minutes in Philadelphia’s 95-93 win, landed on Warriors guard Jabari Brown’s heel while trying to stop Brown from driving to the basket.
Fultz was well enough to walk around after the game and the injury is not believed to be serious, American sports broadcaster ESPN reported.
“I’m ok, thank you for all who were worried!” Fultz tweeted Sunday.
Earlier Saturday, Fultz signed a contract. Details were not disclosed, but he is slated to make $5.8 million in his rookie season.
The 6-foot-4 Fultz averaged team highs of 23.2 points and 5.9 assists to go along with 5.7 rebounds during his first and only season with the University of Washington.
Philadelphia have dealt with major injuries to high draft picks in recent years. Third overall pick Joel Embiid missed his first two seasons and played in just 31 games last season.
The 2016 number one pick, Ben Simmons, missed his entire rookie season with a foot injury.AFP
