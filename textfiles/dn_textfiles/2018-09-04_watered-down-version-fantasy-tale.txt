The Little Mermaid
Watered-down version of the  fantasy tale

Disney’s animation ‘The Little Mermaid’ has never ceased to enchant both young and old. Therefore the spell-binding fairy tale is currently in the process of being made into a live-action film. However even before work is complete in the much looked forward to project Conglomerate Media and Kingsway Productions beat them to it by launching their own version of ‘The Little Mermaid’.
Thankfully this tale is based on the 1837 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale rather than the 1989 Disney movie. The film follows a young reporter and his niece on a journey of discovery as they encounter a beautiful woman who they believe is the real “Little Mermaid.” Cam Harrison, the journalist, has his doubts at first and is on hot pursuit of a story related to a healing potion. He visits the circus which sells the medication and is curious to witness the ringmaster displaying the object that is the center of attraction in the circus – a real live mermaid.
Soon Cam’s niece, Elle, and the mermaid named Elizabeth form a close alliance. Cam discovers a prophecy in which a little girl born on land with the heart of a mermaid. They fight to save Elizabeth’s soul which is on the possession of the evil ring master. This is what binds Elizabeth to him and his evil deeds. This good versus evil story is told in flashback mode by a grandmother to her little granddaughters.
Though this is no extraordinary tale Blake Harris could have made a tolerable production with what was in hand. However the outcome is an uninteresting storyline full of clichés and loads of bad acting. A fantasy adventure story featuring a mystic creature like a mermaid provides the filmmakers with a wide scope to run wild with their imagination. But what we get is a slow pacing tale which is as dull as ditch water. There is a hardly an interesting moment in the tale which generates laughter or wonder.
Although it’s a serviceable enough story, the script by Blake Harris, who co-directed with Chris Bouchard, is often too earnest and forced to prove sufficiently fun or wondrous.
William Moseley and Loreto Peralta, both who play the prominent roles of Cam and Elle in the film do not do justice to their roles. The latter overacts her role with wide eyed expressions and bleating out her lines like an excited toddler while the former’s acting is lifeless and he hardly utters his words with any feelings.
Armando Gutierrez is not given much room to expand in his role as the villain, Locke. The only silver lining in the project is Poppy Drayton. She manages to add a little charm and beauty to the project.
The visuals do not stand out either. Neither do the camera angles. It all seems like an amateur production done in a hurry. Banking heavily on its title this production might have garnered a majority of its viewers due to the success of the Disney hit rather than its own merits.
