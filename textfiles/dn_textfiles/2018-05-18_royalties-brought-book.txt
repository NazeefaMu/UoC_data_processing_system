Royalties brought to book

Not many authors are familiar with that sheet of paper. Not many publishers are interested in providing such material for reasons unknown. The sheet of paper has a name: royalty statement. Only a few publishers in Sri Lanka provide the authors with a royalty statement. The statement is something that triggers hope for authors of any exam-oriented textbook, translation of some popular fiction, a novel in Sinhalese, a coffee-table book and a limited range. Otherwise, be ready to bury your head in the sand.
Book-writing is hardly a lucrative industry if you fail to reach your audience. Everyone is familiar with that ground reality. That’s why the recent announcement of a tax imposed on the royalty stirred a hornet’s nest. The tax was likened to the daylight robbery of the beggar’s meal on the social media referring to the vernacular idiom.
The government decision underwent an amendment in the wake of a public outcry. Authors with earnings exceeding Rs 50,000 per mensem and Rs 500,000 per annum will be taxed at 14 percent. The percentage was a four percent increase from the previous 10 percent. Rs 50,000 and Rs 500,000 will be exempted per mensem and per annum. Only the exceeding amount of the royalty will be taxed.
The Inland Revenue Act No 24 of 2017, certified on October 24, 2017, offers a definition to royalty – or book royalty - in a broad perspective.
“Royalty” means a payment, including a payment of a premium or like amount, derived as consideration for –
(a) the use of or right to use a copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films, software or video or audio recordings, whether the work is in electronic format or otherwise;
(b) the use of or right to use a patent, trademark, design or model, plan, or secret formula or process;
(c) the use of or right to use any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment;
(d) the use of or right to use information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience;
(e) the rendering of or the undertaking to render assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d); or a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e).
The Inland Revenue Act definition aside, the book royalty payment is a percentage of a book's sale or a flat fee per book sold, that is paid to a book's author to compensate them for publishing and/or distribution rights. The royalties are usually paid by the publisher after sales are confirmed. There could probably be a lag time between a book's sale and when an author actually gets paid. That lag time could even be months or probably years. The publisher has the sole right to decide the payout period and threshold based on the book’s movement in the market.
Take a deep breath! Rs 600,000 per annum, or Rs 50,000 per mensem, as a royalty, is a breathtaking figure to the book-length wordsmiths of our country. It is a bumper dividend limited to a privileged few, admit both publishers and authors.
But what worries both categories is the withholding tax, according to Sri Lanka Book Publishers’ Association President Vijitha Yapa.
“We need to pay a certain levy with every royalty as a part of the withholding tax. But it is not clear how and where we can claim it back,” Yapa remarked.
On that premise, Yapa also noted that imposing a tax on the royalty payment is against the norm especially as Sri Lanka is the signatory to the Florence Agreement where the government agrees not to impose any taxes on royalties.
Increasing book prices
“Majority of Sri Lankan authors are amateurs. Unlike professional authors settled elsewhere, they do not generate many sales. What happens in Sri Lanka is that people engage in authoring books as a leisure time activities rather than a professional industry. And to tax such an endeavour is wrong,” Vijitha Yapa noted.
Yapa indicated that drastic measures such as increasing the book prices would have to be taken if the taxation continues to be in force.
“We are trying to improve the literary standards of this country. Any royalty is considered an income tax. This is like a default tax that the publisher has to remit to the government,” Yapa added. The publishers should be the benefiting cluster from anger over the tax on book royalty, but it is struggling to capitalise. Finally, it affects the author’s meagre fee gained from a creative exercise.
The royalty percentage varies in Sri Lanka, though the agreed figure seems 10 percent. If an author is to earn a sum of Rs 600,000 (six hundred thousand) per annum, the sales of his book should be 10 fold of the same. Add another zero, and you get the amount: Rs 6,000,000 (six million). Such a figure for a book sale within a year will be a landmark achievement in the book publishing industry.
Knowing well that such an amount cannot be amassed, the authors engage in the field mostly owing to either the passion or as an extra source of income. Only a handful of authors have permanently settled down in the industry.
According to Dayawansa Jayakody, a past President of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers’ Association, an average Sinhala book-length fiction is priced at Rs 500.
“Any publisher would price the book treble the printing cost. Then only can we generate the income to sort our expenses before thinking of a profit. An average book is about Rs 300 or 350. We used to print 1,000 copies. But now we have to restrict that number because of the sales failure.”
Books take time to sell. Books don’t sell like hotcakes unless under special circumstances. That said, a book won’t generate more than Rs 30,000 as a royalty payment to its author. An author has to produce many books within one year to reach the 500,000 figure.
The first print of 1,000 copies, on the other hand, would hardly make it to the second print. In the second print, the figure will most likely be 500 copies.
Keeping the records of royalty payment is not a habit of the publishers save a few. However, most writers have not so far scrupled about it. The writers, mostly struggling with financial difficulties, bank on the publishers for some advance or another sum which would later be deducted from the royalty payment.
Alternative sources of income
National Property Office Director General Geethanjani Ranawaka, Attorney-at-Law, observes the move as an encouragement for the publishers to streamline their royalty payment process.
The taxation is not unique to the book royalties. It will be relevant to other sources of income. Employees of public and private sector alike depend on alternative sources of income. The government generates income from taxing on those areas. Book royalty payment is only one such area, according to Ranawaka.
According to the Inland Revenue Act, the income of a resident or non-resident individual for a year of assessment will be taxed at a certain point. For instance, four percent will be taxed on the income of Rs. 600,000 while eight percent will be charged when the income exceeds Rs 600,000 up to Rs 1200,000.
“We know very well that some writers earn more than Rs 50,000 a month. They will be charged 14 percent from the royalties. The writers earning below that amount are exempted from the taxation.”
Every government officer gets a certain amount deducted from their salary according to the PAYE tax. If that applies to the government sector, then why not people of the private sector, Ranawaka questions. As she points out, writing a book is only a source of income for most writers as they are permanently employed elsewhere.
H D Premasiri, immediate past president of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers’ Association added that the taxation is an odd move.
“The creative writers do not have a colossal market here. It’s so tough to trace creative writers who earn more than Rs 50,000 a month. It is an unlikely source of income for the government,” Premasiri said.
As Professor J B Disanayaka pointed out that the move offers the writer a chance to have a detailed version of book sales. Most publishers would not provide the book sale details, and the government’s decision would force the publishers to maintain a record, Professor Disanayaka said. The authors would at least get to know the progress of the book sales albeit at the cost of a tax imposition, he added.
There is a however in this case.
The university don cum author is contradicted by another author. Kamal Perera, Lanka Writers’ Organisation Secretary, maintains that the creative writers should not be subject to taxation.
“We need to find a definition for the writer. He is someone who does things to awaken the creative mind. He guides the society. For that, he uses his mental and physical strength. It is different to what others do physically,” Perera elaborated.
Perera cited various advertisements where doctors and other professionals have come forward claiming to be paying tax. What would the writer gain from the society in return to his writing?
Even if an author earns more than Rs 50,000 a month that would not be his net income, Perera said.
“Creative writers do not just write. They engage in research. They use their own funds to travel. Some writers have to pay for typesetting as well. Some have to finance the maintenance of their computers. They burn the midnight oil to produce high-quality work. That earning of Rs 50,000 a month, if there is any, would not just come. It comes at a price. It is not a nett income,” Perera elaborates.
The move offers a false picture of writers living in the lap of luxuries according to Perera. There could be writers of that calibre abroad, but not in this land, he emphasises. In essence, Perera pointed out that writing is not a lucrative career.
Some writers earn quite a lot, Perera was quick to draw attention to another facet. They write to the advertising industry. But the creative authors won’t earn that much. Perera also questioned the worth of Rs 50,000 as a monthly sum.
“Even a labourer would earn more or less the same amount. With a cost of living on a higher pedestal, you cannot consider this half-lakh as an amount at all. No writer can survive alone with creative work,” Perera elaborated.
“On the other hand, the writers don’t get their pay on a monthly basis. They get their payments randomly. Sometimes they get the payment in advance. Sometimes they get their payment on sympathetic grounds. Some leading publishers issue a monthly report. Some publishers have information available on their ledgers,” Perera said.
Although the leading publishers issue cheques in favour of the authors’ names, Perera added that the otherwise is the much-preferred option. Cheques make things harder as most authors do not have current accounts. They prefer handed over money. If these handed over money enters any records remains a matter worth discussion.
On this premise, Ranawaka directs attention to the publishers.
“It is a common factor that most publishers do not settle the royalty payments properly. Taxation or otherwise, this is where the government intervention is required. The taxation encourages the publishers to pay the royalty to authors. Then again, the publishers will also be benefitted from this move,” Ranawaka denoted.
According to Ranawaka, the move is not solely meant to target the writers. The royalty could be considered as another source of income.
Lankan Book Writers’ Association
Vijitha Yapa begs to differ at this stance.
“On a personal income tax basis, it is all right to tax your income. Many people have many sources of income. Some earn extra from cultivating lands. There are many sources of extra income. Writing books could be considered in a similar manner. But not in terms of a withholding tax imposed on every royalty payment,” Yapa explained.
Ranawaka justified the act of taxing a considerable income.
“We all know that most writers are professionally settled elsewhere. For them, writing books is one source of income. The government’s intention is to impose a tax on this source of income. There are writers who get a fat royalty. There are writers who don’t get much of a royalty. If there are writers who get a fat royalty, then they would have to pay a certain tax. If there are writers who don’t get much of a royalty, they don’t have to worry. They are exempted,” Ranawaka added.
Much of this does not make sense to the Lankan Book Writers’ Association. The Association will launch a protest movement at Dr NM Perera Mawatha on May 22. The streets have long missed the Booksmith. They would now come up in arms to secure their own rights.
One thing is certain. A monetary move could consolidate two groups, publishers and authors, into one faction. Determining the fate of this drama is up to their audience: the readership.
