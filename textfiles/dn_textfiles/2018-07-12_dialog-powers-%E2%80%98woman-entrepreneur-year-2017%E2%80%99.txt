Dialog powers ‘Woman Entrepreneur of Year 2017’

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, partners the Women’s Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) to power the 10th installation of the ‘Women Entrepreneur of the Year’.
WCIC is a non-profit organisation instrumental in channelling change and providing a platform for Sri Lankan women to become successful entrepreneurs.
Dialog aims to support the WCIC in identifying successful business women across multiple categories including Female Startup of the Year, Most Promising Entrepreneur and Woman Exporter of the Year.
As part of its premise to enrich Sri Lankan lives and enterprises, Dialog will support the WCIC to give flight to budding and established businesses run by female entrepreneurs.
Some of the past winners include successful women in the field of technology such as Iron One Technologies, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Global Operations, Lakmini Wijesundera and Jayomi Lokuliyana of zMessenger (Pvt) Ltd.
In an effort to increase participation and recognition for female entrepreneurs operating in their respective spheres, the WCIC also partnered the ‘Good Market’, a curated community of social enterprises and responsible businesses.
Chathuri Ranasinghe, Chairperson, WCIC said, “We are grateful to have Dialog help spearhead and encourage women entrepreneurs. We need responsible corporates to empower women and champion this cause, as the success stories of past winners are endless. The Woman Entrepreneur of the Year opens opportunity to multiple budding and established entrepreneurs, helping to shed light on their venture, and at times to expand operations globally. As the award garners recognition for women – it also provides the perfect platform to take their business to the next level.”
At the recently concluded Google I/O Extended Sri Lanka 2018 hosted by Dialog, encouraging female participation in the developer community was seen through the introduction of a Tech Startup Female Entrepreneur of the Year. In line with the thrust to support Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, Dialog has also facilitated an incubation programme, the Dialog Axiata Digital Innovation Fund, providing investment and mentoring for businesses selected by a panel.
The ‘The Woman Entrepreneur of Year 2017’ was officially launched and a total of 21 Women Entrepreneur Achievers will be recognised at the awards ceremony to be held on August 4, 2018, at the Grand Marquee, Taj Samudra Hotel.
