GDP grows by 3.3 percent

The GDP growth rate for the third quarter of 2017 has slowed to 3.3 percent compared to the same quarter last year, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement yesterday. GDP growth in December 2016 stood at 4.6 percent, official data shows.
The Census Department said that agricultural activities continue to suffer, mainly due to the unfavourable weather conditions of periods of severe drought pocketed with heavy rainfall.
Two sectors in particular, though, have shown signs of rebound. Tea and rubber growing reported significant positive growth rates, census data shows, bucking a three-year trend.
Growing of rice, fruit, coconut, vegetables, spices and marine fishing have decreased in value, however.
Industrial activities expanded marginally, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
Significantly, service activities grew at a faster rate than the same quarter last year, especially in the financial services, telecommunication, health and human services and insurance sectors.
