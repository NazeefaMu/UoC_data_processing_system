HEALING OURSELVES AND A NATION
The two hardest lessons I have had to learn in life are these:
• I can’t change other people, I can change only myself
• If there is something wrong, it is wrong with me
These principles come from the opinions of people from all walks of life and on our need as a nation to take stock of ourselves and arrive at some new goals.
A shared sense of direction and a determination to excel to achieve these goals must be more that material prosperity. It would have to grow out of a set of shared basic values or ethical principles.
It is comforting to know that throughout our society there are men and women who are gravely concerned about the direction in which this nation is going, or not going.
Which is all very good and plausible, as long as we all realise that it is up to every one of us personally and individually to make better place to position itself among social and economic excellence.
It cannot be done by any of us trying to tell others what they should or shouldn’t be doing. It can be done only if enough of us are prepared to do the right things for ourselves and for others in our homes, our workplace and our community.
It cannot be done by any of us blaming any others of us for the conditions we find ourselves in. We have to come to understand that we are all personally responsible for who and what we are and that if we don’t like it, only we can change it.
If we believe we can change things by telling others what they should or shouldn’t be doing, we haven’t been watching what’s being happening in the world for centuries. That’s what you get for trying to tell others how they should live – anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and, in the end, alienation.
And as for blaming others for our situation, people in general have been blaming the government and the weather for just about everything since only God knows when and more recently political correctness has instilled in many of us the victim mentality that tells us that someone or something else is to blame for anything and everything that happens to us that we don’t like. Where has that got us? It has created among us a large group of people who spend their lives in anger, resentment, bitterness, frustration and, ultimately, alienation, which breeds broken marriages, fatherless children, venereal disease, child abuse, violence, disrespect for others or their property, overfilled jails, declining economic output and an even widening gap between the haves and the have nots.
So, what’s to be done in order that we might right the ship and get all of us sailing in the right direction? The answer is simple: if enough of us are prepared personally to live the sort of lives that are attractive to others, in less than a generation we will have repaired much of the damage that has been done.
If we set standards for ourselves personally and do what we can to live up to them, others will be encouraged to do the same. So, let us be real people – faults and all. Let us make changes in ourselves and therefore the betterment of ourselves and others.
