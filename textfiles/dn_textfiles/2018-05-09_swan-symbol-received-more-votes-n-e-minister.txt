Swan symbol received more votes in N-E - Minister

The swan symbol received more votes from the North and East than Sinhalese areas in the country, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the swan symbol recorded a landslide victory in the North and East and the flower bud did not get any votes there. Around 45 percent of Muslim votes in the country were in favour of this government. This government cannot walk forward forgetting the Tamils and Muslims, he said.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after opening the 37th Osu Sala outlet at Akkaraipattu recently.
Minister Senaratne said that he will fight until Muslims are given equal rights. A Sri Lanka where all ethnicities enjoy equal rights should be built. Some groups of extremists create trouble here and there from time to time, but no one should be worried about it. Such efforts should be defeated. Some still cannot understand what ‘good governance’ is about. This government made several positive changes and is dedicated to serving the people. As the Health Minister, my vision is creating a health service which is friendly to the poor people in this country, he added.
