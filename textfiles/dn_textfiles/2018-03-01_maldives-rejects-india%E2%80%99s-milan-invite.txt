Maldives rejects India’s MILAN invite

India might have been snubbed by the Maldives, which on Tuesday, February 27 declined New Delhi's invitation to participate in the biennial naval exercise, MILAN 2018.
Meanwhile, the Maldivian envoy has said that his country cannot participate in the naval drills due to the state of emergency in the island nation. India will be hosting navies from at least 15 nations for the eight-day mega naval exercise, which is set to begin on March 6 at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Maldives has been regularly participating in the biennial exercise, which was started in 1995. The development was revealed by Indian Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba and comes amid strained ties between India and Maldives, which has been gripped by an ongoing political turmoil.
Countries participating in the exercise include Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, New Zealand, Oman, Vietnam, Thailand, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, and Cambodia.
