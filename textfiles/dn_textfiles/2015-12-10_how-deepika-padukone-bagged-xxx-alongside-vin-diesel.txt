How Deepika Padukone bagged XXX alongside Vin Diesel

Deepika Padukone sent social media into a tizzy after she posted a picture on Friday. The Bajirao Mastani actress posted a picture on Facebook tagging Vin Diesel, one of the key cast members of the XXX series, without letting him face the camera! Since their picture had the famous XXX logo in the backdrop, there were speculations if the beauty has signed her first international project.
Things were clearer when a source close to the actress confirmed this development. The source was quoted saying, “The night after the success party of ‘Tamasha’, Deepika flew to America for a meeting with Hollywood star Vin Diesel. No wonder, Ranveer Singh is still promoting his next release alone! But who knew Deepika would surprise everybody with this photograph! It is a big achievement for her and she is finishing all formalities in America.”
While the development is a HUGE deal for the actress, we can exclusively tell you what happened behind the scenes and now DP bagged the project. A source exclusively told BollywoodLife, “In the past, Deepika had given up Fast and Furious 7 with Vin Diesel for Happy New Year with Shah Rukh Khan. She was quite upset that she wasn’t able to be part of the action film.
But being someone who honors her commitment, she decided to give HNY priority over the international film. But Vin personally told her not to worry and that they would soon collaborate in the near future. They had discussed the XXX film at that point and Diesel’s agent stayed in touch with the actress and signed her for XXX: The return of Xander Cage.”
