Excelsior Residencies launched at Polhengoda

Excelsior Residencies was launched at Polhengoda Terrace, 800 metres off Baseline Road, Colombo 5.
The entire complex comprises 32 apartments, with 4 penthouse apartments on the ninth floor, providing an excellent view of the city and its suburbs.
The remaining 28 apartments in four different floor plans, covering 1,450 – 1,500 sq. ft. are located on the second to eighth floor levels.
Below the apartment floor levels is a mezzanine floor together with a ground floor and a basement floor, providing parking facilities. Two parking slots will be available for any buyer.
In addition to large living and bedrooms, apartments at Excelsior have been designed around the concept of maximizing natural light and ventilation, bringing nature into living spaces.
Toilets have imported sanitaryware and other amenities, with residents having the option to choose their own brands. A separate maid's toilet has been included in every apartment.
A well-equipped gymnasium caters to a wide range of fitness needs – from free weights, treadmills and machines to areas for yoga, aerobics, zumba, and more. There is also a swimming pool with an adjacent kiddies' pool. The space surrounding the apartment complex has been converted into a natural foliage area for residents to relax and enjoy the feeling of nature.
Excelsior Residencies is developed by Kitra Space Developments, whose Founder and Managing Director counts over 35 years’ experience as a civil engineer in the UK and Europe, having developed several multi-story housing blocks across Southeast London and low-rise housing estates across the region.
The company will invest around Rs. 900 million for this project. They hope to build two more projects. NK Construction are the design and building contractors with a portfolio that includes projects for the Colombo Museum Gallery Complex, CHOGM Entrance Suites, Presidential Suite, refurbishment for Colombo Hilton and Laksala, Galle.
Ongoing projects include two luxury condominiums and a multi-story office complex.
The principal architect behind Excelsior Residencies is Darnie Rajapaksa, who counts over 20 years’ experience.
Dayananda Associates with 30 years’ experience in structural and civil design and consultancy services function as structural consultants.
