Right of reply by National Shooting Sport Federation: Ace shooter Samarakoon’s bottom

 
We refer to the article title “Shooter Samarakoon blames federation for poor show” (Dinesh Weerawansa reporting from Rio). In view of the article being totally inaccurate and false the National Shooting Sport Federation wishes to exercise its right of reply referring the comments made by Samarakoon regarding his shooting Jacket being old and unserviceable.
The fact is that Sri Lanka Army had imported the highest quality jacket and trouser incurring a cost exceeding Sri Lanka rupees 150,000/= in the year 2013. Shooters kit needs “breaking in” over a period of one year and is serviceable for 8-10 years if cared for in the proper manner. Since then he has performed extremely well in many events where the shooting Jacket and Trouser has been tested and passed by many different Technical Delegates and Equipment Control appointed by the ISSF.
The most recent being the Special Olympic Quota competition held in Delhi in January 2016 and the South Asian Games held in Guwahati in February 2016 where he performed at his best. However, at present the National Sport Shooting Federation is also very disappointed with his performance at Rio. We have been reliably informed that the Technical failure of his shooting bottom was due to an unauthorized and illegal modification that Samarakoon had performed along with his coach by fixing an additional strip of Velcro at the waist band despite colleagues of the Army strongly advising him not to carry those alterations through (any device or material modification that gives an unfair advantage to the shooter, violates the rules of ISSF and is therefore illegal). This altered the permitted specifications of the bottom which had successfully passed several international equipment controls at the recent foreign competitions.
Samarakoon as a previous Olympic competitor as well as an experienced international competitor should be well aware of international rules and regulations. Further, more his personal coach Pushpamali Ramanayaka being a veteran shooter and handpicked by Army to coach the Army team has failed miserably by not performing her duty as a Coach nor as a Manager both titles which she carried at this particular competition. The shooter’s and coach’s comments are very unfair towards the Sri Lanka Army too which have supported its shooters with 1.2 million .22 ammunition of the highest quality imported in 2013 in addition to a brand new Air Rifle imported at a cost of Rs.650,000/= in 2013 as well as a brand new .22 Rifle imported at a cost of Rs.700,000/= in 2013, as well as the fact that he is paid a monthly salary to perform NO other duty except training for shooting competitions daily as his primary and only job description.
Therefore, Samarakoon and Pushpamali’s comments reflect very badly on the Sri Lanka Army which has done so much for them by way of facilities, equipment and finance purely for competition shooting. None of the Sri Lankan shooters earned a Quota place for this particular Olympics. However, due to the excellent rapport the National Shooting Sport Federation has maintained with the International Shooting Sport Federation we were fortunate to receive a tripartite invitation for Men 60 prone event which was supposed to be Samarakoon’s primary objective based on the invitation.However, the International Shooting Sport Federation was good enough to accommodate Samarakoon in the Men’s 10 meter Air Rifle event also.
The National Shooting Sport Federation with the help of the Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee conducted a coaching program for coaches at which Ramanayaka too participated. Samarakoon too benefited from a another initiative launched by the National Shooting Federation with the help of the Ministry of Sports where two foreign coaches extended their services in preparing our shooters for the Olympic Quota place event as well as for the South Asian Games.
In order to further facilitate Samarakoon, the National Shooting Sport Federation imported and installed on an urgent basis four Electronic Targets for training which Pushpamali Ramanayaka (coach) refused to make use of despite several calls by the General Secretary of the National Shooting Sport Federation urging them to further fine tune their skills in preparation of the Olympic Games. As for their grievance with regard to the inaction by the National Shooting Sport Federation regarding clearance of weapons it was in fact the General Secretary of the National Shooting Sport Federation who obtained the Sports Ministry and Defence Ministry clearances while Captain Ranawaka of the Sri Lanka Army worked tirelessly in liaison with the General Secretary in obtaining all other approvals.
It must be mentioned that these were the primary duties of the Manager/Coach Pushpamali Ramanayaka who did not move a finger in this instance.
In previous instances it was the officials of the National Shooting Sport Federation that grabbed the privilege of being the Manager or Coach. However, in this instance the National Shooting Sport Federation heeded to the request of the shooter and his alliance the Sri Lanka Army Small Arms Association to permit Pushpamali Ramanayake to be his chosen Coach/Manager. Unfortunately contrary to the intuition of the Sri Lanka Army she has failed Sri Lanka Army, National Shooting Sport Federation and her country. Unlike on previous instances the officials of the clubs affiliated to the National Shooting Sport Federation went to the extent of even donating personal funds as pocket money as a special gesture of encouragement and solidarity to our competitor.
Therefore, it is very deeply regrettable and sad that unwarranted, unfounded and biased comments leveled against the National Shooting Sport Federation which has really been their benefactors in more ways than one.
