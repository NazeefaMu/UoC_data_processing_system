WRIT SOUGHT AGAINST ALLEGED Rs 16 bn revenue fraud ON BMW IMPORTS

A writ petition was filed in the Court of Appeal seeking an order compelling the Customs Director General to conduct a formal Customs Inquiry into Rs 16 billion revenue fraud while importing 1675 units of high valued BMW motor cars during the last regime.
This writ petition was filed by Murugesu Thayabaran, a former Director of the Central Investigation Directorate attached to Sri Lanka Customs through his counsel Nagananda Kodituwakku. The petitioner Thayabaran cited Customs
Director General Chulananda Perera, Customs Additional Director General T.W.A. Senanayake, Customs Deputy Director Saman de Silva, Prestige Automobiles Chairman and Managing Director Heinz Adolf Reuter and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that during his tenure in the Customs Department he had conducted a number of revenue fraud inquiries among which the matter referred to in this petition is the biggest fraud ever detected by the Customs.
The value of this fraud runs into over Rs 16 billion of government tax revenue defrauded by Prestige Automobiles, the fourth respondent. The Petitioner stated that the revenue fraud reported involves the importation of 1675 units of high valued BMW motor cars during the the period commencing from March 2011 to Oct 2014.
Thayabaran said that all the vehicles referred to in this case have been imported on tax concessions granted to permits issued by the government to certain categories of people holding public office, wherein strict conditions had been stipulated in the permits, which included the specified sealing on the engine capacity and the value of the vehicle.
The Petitioner states that the investigation findings had revealed that the total number of 1675 units of BMW motorcars had been imported under the tax concessionary permits with false values declared in order to be qualified to claim tax concession, thereby evading the payment of levies actually payable on those vehicles. “Yet, it was further revealed that the 4th Respondent had recovered the true value of the vehicles from the permit holders under a false pretence that the said recovery was for handling and after sales services”, he added. The Petitioner stated that had the true value of the vehicles been declared, the permits would have become a nullity since one of the primary conditions of the permits, the specified valuation threshold has been violated.
The Petitioner stated that the 4th Respondent had been engaged in this fraudulent trade practice for a considerable period of time and in some cases where BMW motorcars had been imported on concessionary permit schemes, the Customs Department has been able to recover the Original invoice sent by the BMW car manufacturer in Germany to the 4th Respondent’s Company and also the fictitious invoice generated by Navigare International GMBH in Germany for the identical vehicle, to claim the special concessionary rate of levy chargeable for permit cars.
The Petitioner states that there is a deliberate failure on the part of the first Respondent and the third Respondent to perform their offices as required by law which clearly amounts to abusing, exceeding or misusing of the powers vested in the 1st and 3rd Respondents for improper purposes.
The Petitioner states that therefore, on April 27, 2017 he made a formal complaint on this serious abuse to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption drawing its due attention to this major revenue fraud running into over Rs 16 billion.
