ECU Australia looking at introducing courses to Sri Lanka

Edith Cowan University (ECU) an Australian public university located in Perth, Western Australia is looking at introducing some of their Sports, Medicine, Engineering and journalism courses to Sri Lanka.
Associate Professor ECU, Hallam Pereira said that there is a huge demand in Australia and in most developing countries for sports trainers.
“Sri Lanka too needs high quality sports trainers and our university has conducted two programs with Sri Jayewardenepura University involving Sri Lankan athletes.
“This was aimed at scientifically identifying their talents and weaknesses and offering their scientific advice through modern technology.”
“We will now tie up with an local university and introduce this subject to Sri Lanka and students who pass out from this new medium of education could gain high paying employment anywhere in the world.”
He said that they will also introduce several education programs targeting the youth following engineering and Media.
The ECU was named after the first woman to be elected to an Australian Parliament, Edith Cowan, and is the only Australian university named after a woman.
