Brexit: Tough negotiations ahead

Negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) took place in Brussels this week. Talks were stalled soon after they began due to differences. European Union Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier charged that Britain has come unprepared for the talks.
In their first meeting Barnier agreed with British Brexit Secretary David Davis agreed that the exit process and terms must be negotiated before talks on the future relations between Britain and the European Union could be discussed. Davis left in few minutes and talks were continued by officials.
EU has insisted that three issues should be given priority in the negotiations and that they must be taken together and not in isolation. They are 1) financial settlement 2) rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom and 3) Northern Ireland border.
EU has estimated the amount Britain would have to pay for commitments to the EU at around € 100 billion. Britain, however, is not ready to pay that amount. In fact it has so far not considered financial settlement seriously though Brexit Secretary Davis has acknowledged its commitment to pay.
EU also insists that its citizens in the UK must be granted the same status that they enjoy now even after Brexit, It will maintain the status quo of UK citizens in the EU even after Brexit, said Barnier.
The UK, however, proposes to grant “settled status” to EU citizens after five years of residence. There are 3 million EU citizens in the UK.
Britain is facing a difficult situation at the Brexit talks. It is not only the financial settlement that is its worry. EU says that after leaving the EU Britain would not have the privilege of internal market rules in its trade with the EU and British exports to EU would be subject to custom duties in the 27 member countries of the EU transport costs also would soar. Barnier warned that it would not be possible for Britain to keep all benefits of the common market after they leave. No sector by sector participation is also possible, he added.
Time is also a constraint on the negotiations. With or without any agreement Britain will have to leave the EU on March 29, 2019- two years after Britain’s decision to leave was communicated to the EU. “Time flies,” said Barnier.
EU is also apprehensive of a change in Government in Britain before the exit date. Hence it desires some participation by the Opposition in the talks. This is especially because of the internal divisions within the Conservative party.
Iran fulfills JCPA commitments
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has certified that Iran has followed to the letter all commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA) agreed by Japan with five permanent members of the UN Security Council -the United States, China, Russia, United Kingdom, France- and Germany on July 14, 2015 during the second term of the Obama presidency.
According to the agreement Iran pledged to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear development programme and the other party agreed to remove all nuclear related sanctions on Iran. The agreement does not prevent Iran from proceeding with its ballistic missile programme.
During his election campaign President Trump pledged to withdraw from the agreement.
However, that would have meant the US reneging on the Agreement which would place it in an embarrassing position as an unreliable State party to international agreements.
The certification by the AEIA and the advice of senior officials of the administration compelled President Trump to reluctantly certify that Iran has fulfilled its obligations. Yet he imposed new sanctions on Iran contrary to the undertaking given in the JCPA.
These sanctions include listing several individuals and certain entities including the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as terrorist.
North Korea ignores call for talks
North Korea has ignored the call of South Korean President Moon Jae to hold military talks between the two Koreas last Friday (21) as a means of lessening the tension in the Korean peninsula. North Korea insists on the ending of joint US-South Korea military exercises as a pre-condition for talks with the South. President Moon promised to engage the North in dialogue during the election campaign. The offer for talks was made subsequent to North Korea successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, which has earned the wrath of the United States, Japan and most countries of the world. It is the fifth in a series of nuclear tests it conducted recently. President Moon’s call is in contrast with the policy of the former South Korean regime’s practice of imposing sanctions on the North in retaliation for the latter’s nuclear tests. President Moon Jae has said that the offer stands and called upon the North to respond. US President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has even threatened to use all options, including military strikes to halt North Korea’s nuclear development programme.
North and South Korea technically at war as no peace treaty was signed between the two Koreas at the end of the Korean War.
