Vinod Weerasinghe wins Gold Division in dramatic finish

Vinod Weerasinghe annexed the champion's trophy in the Gold Division,(age category 15-17+) when the Prima Regional Junior Open Golf Championship was concluded at the scenic Nuwara Eliya golf course recently.
After two rounds, there was a 3-way ‘tie’ for the lead between Armand Flamer Caldera, Taniya Minel and Vinod Weerasinghe, all bunched on 167.
Champion Vinod takes his aim
The tie for the lead, forced a Sudden-death ‘Play-Off’ to decide the winner and on the 2nd Sudden death hole Armand bowed out, leaving Taniya Minel and Vinod to fight it out. The 3rd sudden death hole was halved and the 4th sudden death hole (18th) saw Taniya sitting pretty to make a Putt from about 8’ to win. Vinod was three off the green and danger looming. However, Vinod displayed a calm and collected attitude to chip into the hole from off the green, piling the pressure on Taniya Minel to hole the Putt for a half, which was too much pressure for the 14-year-old, who proved her potential standing up to the boys with a great performance. Vinod deserved victory having lost out in a similar sudden death play-off to Armand Flamer Caldera in the Regional Junior Open played in Victoria Golf & Country Resort in August.
In the Silver Division, age category 12 -14+, Yevin Samarartne studying in Australia displayed great skill to overcome another rising star Kayla Perera to win the division by one stroke over the two rounds.
Nirekh Tejwani beat Danushan by one stroke to win the Bronze Division, well clear of the rest of the field. The Bronze Division was worked off over two rounds of 13 holes per round.
N.W.G. Shanal Binushka was the clear winner in the 9 & under age category, Copper Division beating the runner –up by 12 strokes.
The two round aggregate over 9 holes of 93 was very impressive.
