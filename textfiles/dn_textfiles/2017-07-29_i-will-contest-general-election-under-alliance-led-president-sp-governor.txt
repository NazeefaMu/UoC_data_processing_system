I will contest general election under alliance led by President: SP Governor

Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said he would not be involved in party politics as long as he holds the position of the Southern Provincial Governor. He said he will take part in politics after his term as the governor ends.
He made these remarks while responding to allegations by Southern Provincial Councillor Chamly Witanachchi. The councillor accused the governor for being engaged in party politics using the powers of governor at the council meeting on Tuesday.
"I had been in both the main political parties of the country. Now, I am leading my own political party, the Mawbima Janatha Party. As I am the governor of the Southern Province, I have not established any branch of my party in the province during my tenure as governor," Dr. Nanayakkara said.
"However, I will contest the next Parliamentary election. But I will never contest in the Galle district.
"I will compete under the ticket of a political alliance led by President Maitripala Sirisena," he said.
