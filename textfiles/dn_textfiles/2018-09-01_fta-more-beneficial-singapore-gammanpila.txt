FTA, more beneficial to Singapore - Gammanpila

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary and MP Udya Gammanpila said the Sri Lanka, Singapore Free Trade Agreement is more advantageous to Singapore than Sri Lanka.
The President has empowered the committee to submit a trade policy that is appropriate to the country, he said yesterday.
Gammanpila made these remarks before the Independent committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade agreement at the BMICH yesterday.
MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana said the agreement had no legal basis and that it had been initiated for personal financial benefits of a Minister and his supporters.
