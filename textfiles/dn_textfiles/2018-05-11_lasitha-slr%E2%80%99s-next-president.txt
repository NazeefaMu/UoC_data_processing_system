Lasitha, SLR’s next president?

Former Royal College, CR & FC and Sri Lanka player Lasitha Gunaratne is tipped to become the next president of Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) uncontested, when the annual general meeting of SLR is held on May 30 (Wednesday).
It is learnt that Gunaratne’s name was the only nomination received for the post of president when nominations closed on May 8.
Gunaratne has been the long standing vice president of SLR for the past several years.
He played as a prop forward for his alma mater Royal College in 1985, 1986 and 1987 before captaining and playing as a number eight in his final year when he led a team of invincible who beat all and sundry.
He will probably take over as SLR president with effect from 31 May from incumbent president Asanga Seneviratne who has held the post for the past six years.
From Gunaratne’s camp others who are contesting for posts are Rizly Ilyas (deputy vice president), Nazeem Mohamed (vice president) and Thusith Perera (general secretary).
