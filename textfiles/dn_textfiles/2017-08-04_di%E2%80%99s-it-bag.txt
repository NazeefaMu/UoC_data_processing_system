Di’s IT bag

 
First, there was the Kelly bag, named by Hermes after Princess Grace of Monaco in 1977. Then in 1984 came the Birkin, the Hermes tote designed for English actress Jane Birkin’s busy life as film star, mother and fashion icon.
After that, couture houses largely stopped naming bags after glamorous clients — until Diana became a truly international star in the Nineties.
Two brands are still making fortunes from the bags she carried: Dior’s Lady Dior and Ferragamo’s Lady D chain-strapped shoulder bag are classics — and remain marketed in her name.
Diana was always a bag connoisseur. As a young bride-to-be, she loved the informal quilted bags in sunny Provencale prints sold by fabric shop Souleiado on London’s Fulham Road, once buying five in different floral designs for £30 each. Later, she followed the example set by the Queen — the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, too — whose day bags, made by Royal Warrant holder Launer, stand as a symbol of monarchy.
The rule here was the co-ordination of an outfit. As the Sloane Ranger Handbook summed up in 1980: ‘Any well brought-up girl tends to think, as she was taught to, in terms of matching shoes and bags.’
At first, this formal way of dressing proved a daunting task. Designer David Sassoon recalls Diana arriving in tears at his Bellville Sassoon studio after her 1981 wedding rehearsal at St Paul’s: ‘It’s all too much!’ she wailed.
She’d ordered her going-away outfit from him, but realised she didn’t have a bag to go with it. Sassoon set about making one.
But Diana was a quick learner, and as a young princess she complied with the matchy-matchy royal rules. To get a precise colourmatch, her discreet evening envelope-style bags were often made by her dressmakers rather than designer handbag firms.
Yet in 1990 she began buying from Italian brand Salvatore Ferragamo. Diana had more than 20 calfskin Ferragamo bags with distinctive gold-hooped Gancio clasps, retrospectively named the Lady D.
By the mid-Nineties, an emboldened Diana side-stepped royal protocol completely by wearing foreign couture labels. Her bag wardrobe took in Dior, Versace, Chanel and Gucci. It was among these labels that the Bag Wars of the 2000s were launched.
If Launer represented established royal protocol — a brand Diana perhaps pointedly never carried — the glossy European status bag was a symbol of independence after her separation from Prince Charles.
Chanel - her first foreign label
As the most famous of Parisian fashion houses, Chanel was one of the first foreign labels Diana was able to wear.
Royal protocol — which normally demanded she sport British-made bags and clothing — allowed the Princess of Wales to wear Chanel as a tribute to her hosts on a visit to France.
She was seen in a red coat with classic, quilted chain-bag from the fashion house, on her official visit there in 1988.
Though she looked self-conscious that day, Chanel bags, especially those which had a chain strap, remained very much a part of her own private wardrobe, particularly in the post-Charles years.
For one of her final public appearances, left, speaking in support of the Red Cross landmine campaign in Washington in June 1997, she chose to wear a white quilted top-handle Chanel bag with her business-like lilac Versace suit.
And her shoes? Chanel, of course.
Versace - A mark of friendship
Forward to the mid-Nineties and Diana was moving in different circles. Surrounded by fashion sophisticates including Liz Tilberis, editor of U.S. Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue photographer Mario Testino and designer Gianni Versace (whom she met through her relationship with Elton John and their work for Aids charities) Diana began to epitomise pared-down chic.
It was the beginning of a new international jet-set aesthetic that still prevails today — simple, colour-blocked clothes, worn with luxe ‘hero’ bags.
Now, her accessories didn’t have to match all of the time — in fact, they often looked cooler when they didn’t.
Her glossy Versace bags, for example, often lifted her sleek tailoring. She was carrying a black version, left, when she went to the Duomo in Milan for Gianni Versace’s memorial service. Her friend had been murdered in Miami in July 1997 — just over a month before she lost her own life in Paris.
Dior - Lady Dior just for Diana
Originally a diplomatic gift from a visit to Paris in 1995, the Lady Dior bag was a major score for the French LVMH luxury company.
If not exactly designed for her, the cane-patterned, patent bag with its gilt hardware and double handles was a prototype only Diana could initially be seen with.
Rather than being simply delivered by a Christian Dior PR, however, the bag was presented to Diana by Bernadette, wife of French President Jacques Chirac, at the Grand Palais in Paris.
It was the fateful year of Diana’s Panorama interview and her marriage was well and truly over. Any qualms she once had about being seen with foreign-made fashion brands were fast fading.
When Dior speedily rolled out the bag to its stores, Diana stocked up with plenty more. She is seen above with a black one in 1996.
The popularity of the bag, now re-christened Lady Dior, skyrocketed, and it became a best-selling house classic. It is still available for about £3,000 today.
“D” Clutch
Diana’s bags were deployed as protective devices.
As her evening wear necklines got lower and sexier, she worked out how to dip out of cars with what she called her ‘cleavage bag’ clutched across her chest to avoid any unfortunate photographs.
The young designer she called on to create them was Anya Hindmarch. ‘They were in satin,’ Anya remembers. ‘We embroidered a “D” inside for her.’
