JUDGE GIHAN KULATUNGA OVERULES OBJECTION

The Colombo High Court yesterday rejected a request made by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who sought an order to transfer the controversial almanac case from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another High Court. High Court Judge Judge Gihan Kulatunga overruled preliminary objections raised by defence and fixed the case to be heard on a day-to-day basis beginning November 24.
The Court had been informed that Basil Rajapaksa had filed a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the controversial almanac case before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding at Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court.
The High Court Judge observed that there is no legal basis to transfer this case to another High Court. He further observed that so far there is no order by the Court of Appeal regarding this transfer application and moved the High Court to proceed with the trial.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC), which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal was thatt he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
Accordingly, the case filed against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was yesterday re-fixed for trial on November 15 by Colombo High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and former director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material, during January 2015 Presidential election.
The Attorney General alleged that by printing these almanacs between November 23 and December 31, 2014, these accused had attempted to influence citizens of this country to vote for presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa. The AG maintained that the act of the accused deems him guilty of the offence of bribery in accordance with the section 79 of the Presidential Election Act No 15 of 1981.
Furthermore, the two accused had been charged under the Public Property Act No 12 of 1982 to file misappropriation charges. The AG had listed 32 people including former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya as witnesses in the case.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Anil Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.
