Mindfulness CEO forum at Waters Edge

Mindfulness bestows emotional development on people of a country that is on fast track towards sustainable development, said globally renowned Mindfulness Guru Lydia Kan at Mindfulness CEO Forum held at Waters Edge.
Kan, a coach for IMD Business School's flagship High Performance Leadership course, teaches emotional intelligence, mindfulness, creativity and leadership in business schools and innovation academies.
The tailor-made session titled, ‘Global Business Benefits’ was aimed at empowering CEOs in the corporate sector to enhance performances of their teams. Participating CEOs expressed how mindfulness has changed their lives.
“What motivates you and what motivate others is important to a leader. Psychological safety is of utmost importance. Distractions hamper constructive communication and you must offer and accept feedback. Every participant in a meeting must be motivated to speak. Before responding to someone, be mindful to stop, breathe, notice, respect and think,” said Kan at the interactive session.
She added, “More than professional qualifications, titles and achievements, trustworthiness, warmth and ability to control situations help you in meetings. Always nurture one-to-one talk in communication and avoid resorting to constant communication via e-mail.”
Meditation, regular exercising and yoga help a great deal in developing skills of attention to detail, she further commented.
The Mindfulness Centre for Wellbeing Sri Lanka unveiled in March 2017 by its Managing Director/CEO Peter Lalith Pinto is envisioned as a centre that caters to people from various walks of life to incorporate teachings and practice of mindfulness into their day-to-day activities.
“By living in the present moment, you will see a vast purview of things that matter to your life. My life was in chaos when I got into the mindfulness bandwagon to calm my mind. I am determined to spread the message of mindfulness to the corporate sector for it to achieve enhanced productivity and wellness,” said Pinto.

Mindfulness has been embraced by Apple, Google, GSK, Goldman Sachs and Aetna to witness revolutionary enhancement of productivity and wellbeing of their staffs.
The Mindfulness Centre for Wellbeing having chapters active in Sri Lanka and UK strives to make mindful living accessible. Programs that empower persons regardless of their age or profession greatly impact their overall performances.
