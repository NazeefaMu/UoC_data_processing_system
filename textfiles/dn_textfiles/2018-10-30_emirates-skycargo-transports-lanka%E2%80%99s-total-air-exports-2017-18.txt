Emirates SkyCargo transports  Lanka’s total air exports in 2017-18

Many of Sri Lanka’s exports are colourful, tasty or fragrant and must arrive at their destinations on time and in pristine condition, a service Emirates SkyCargo continues to provide with distinction.
According to figures released by the Colombo office of the award-winning airline, its freight division transported 27,000 tonnes of cargo from Colombo in 2017-18, a significant 23 per cent of the 118,000 tonnes of goods the island exported by air in the year.
With 28 flights from and into Colombo weekly, and the capacity to carry approximately 20 tons of cargo in the belly hold of each Boeing 777 aircraft, Emirates SkyCargo is one of the main carriers of Sri Lanka’s trade commodities and thus makes a noteworthy contribution to the national economy.
Edible fish, fruit and vegetables, flowers and other cut foliage and readymade garments are among the principal exports that SkyCargo transports from Sri Lanka to markets around the world.
An important volume of Sri Lankan exports are perishables and Emirates SkyCargo offers specialised air transport solutions under the ‘Emirates Fresh’ umbrella that help maintain the freshness of the goods being transported. Emirates Fresh is backed by Emirates’ modern fleet of over 270 aircraft, robust processes, experienced staff as well as state of the art cool chain facilities at its hub in Dubai.
“In 2017-18, Emirates SkyCargo carried more than 7,500 tonnes of fish, which is about 40 per cent of the 17,500 tonnes of edible fish that Sri Lanka exported to USA and Europe,” said Kapila Santhapriya, Emirates Cargo Manager Sri Lanka & Maldives. “Our flight frequencies and our global network reach from Colombo support the local fish and seafood exports industry,” he added. The types of fish exported on Emirates SkyCargo include tuna, shrimp, prawns, crabs, and lobster to markets including the UK, France, Italy, Netherlands and the USA. Sri Lankan exports of fish are valued at close to US$ 250 million.
Emirates SkyCargo is the world’s largest international air cargo airline operating a fleet of 257 wide body passenger aircraft and 14 freighter aircraft.
