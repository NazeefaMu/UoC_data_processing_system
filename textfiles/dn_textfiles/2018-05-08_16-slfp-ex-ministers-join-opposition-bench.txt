16 SLFP ex-Ministers join Opposition bench

 
The 16 SLFP Members of Parliament who resigned from their ministerial positions and left the Unity Government in the aftermath of the unsuccessful No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister took their seats on the Opposition bench in Parliament this afternoon.
In the aftermath of the NCM, they received permission from President and SLFP Leader Maithripala Sirisena to step down from their positions, and requested to be seated with the Opposition instead. They did so for the first time today as President Sirisena ceremonially opened the second session of the eighth parliament today. 
The 16 SLFP MPs who defected from the current government have said they plan to vote with the opposition while still remaining part of the SLFP. They are: Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S B Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, T. B. Ekanayake and Sumedha Jayasena.
