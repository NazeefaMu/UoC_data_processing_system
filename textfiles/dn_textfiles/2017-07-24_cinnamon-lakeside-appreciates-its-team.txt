Cinnamon Lakeside appreciates its team

Cinnamon Lakeside held its Quarterly Associates’ Meeting to appreciate team members who went beyond the call of duty when carrying out their tasks.
Star associates were recognized by the management for the fourth quarter of the last financial year 2016/2017 and first quarter of this financial year 2017/2018 for their outstanding performances.
The associate of the fourth quarter award went to Sanjeewa Samarathunga (F&B) for his customer oriented, personalized service for the Executive Floor guests, whilst the team award went to the Banquet Kitchen Team for the commitment towards preparing great feasts, which has resulted in consistent, positive customer reviews.
The associate of the first quarter (2017/2018) award went to Nipun Thilakaratne (F&B) for his exceptional customer service and for the implementation of several training initiatives for new recruits. The positive comments he had received were also contributory factors for the award.
The Team Award, for the fourth quarter were jointly shared by Engineering & Gardening Teams for their innovative ideas to decorate the hotel during the Vesak festival. All `Star’ award recipients were rewarded with a cash price and a certificate of recognition from Cinnamon Lakeside General Manager Dermot Gate.
