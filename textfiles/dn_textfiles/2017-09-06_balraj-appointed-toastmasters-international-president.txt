Balraj appointed as Toastmasters International President

DTM Arunasalam Balraj has been appointed as the Toastmasters International President for the period 2017/2018 on August 26, 2017 at the Toastmasters convention held in Vancouver in Canada British Colombia.
Balraj addressing the gathering said “ growing up in Sri Lanka, a small island nation at the tip of the Indian sub continent, I am humbled to stand here before this distinguished gathering. Toastmasters has been progressing and changing with time. That is tangibly visible today, when you elect as your president a simple person like me. In doing so, you have established that in the eyes of Toastmasters, every member stands equal, irrespective of ethnicity, gender, creed, community or country. That, by itself, is a beautiful tribute to the magnificence of our great organization.” Balraj said Toastmasters was the only organization he knew that had gone beyond teaching communication and leadership. “To do this, we must have a “People First” attitude,” he said.
