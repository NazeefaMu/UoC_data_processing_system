COPA commences real time evaluation

The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has commenced real time evaluation of the performances of public institutions enabling the Committee to question and hold the relevant officials accountable on financial malpractices occurring in them.
“The COPA has already commenced evaluating the audit reports of 2016. It will soon present to Parliament a report relating to 857 public institutions coming under its purview based on 2015 Audit Reports. After 1972, it is for the first time that the COPA is presenting real time reports to the House,” Information Systems and Management Director of Parliament Mahesh Perera said.
“Previously, the COPA was dealing with old records as it waited years and years until the annual reports come out. In some cases the annual reports were delayed upto 15 years. By questioning on old records, you can hardly expect the Committee to make any change as many responsible officials may have retired or moved to other institutions by then,” he pointed out.
He pointed out real time evaluation has enabled the Committee to monitor whether its recommendations are being implemented or not, adding that this has helped to enhance the productivity and efficiency of public institutions.
The real time evaluation is being done using an Intranet Portal to which all Parliamentarians and Parliamentary Staff have access to from wherever they are in. This portal has been connected to the official Parliament website and the public can direct their observations, complaints and proposals with regard to each of the institutions being summoned before the Committee. All Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils, Local Authorities, District Secretariats and Divisional Secretariats are coming under the scope of COPA.
