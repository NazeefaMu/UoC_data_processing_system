Solar power for state institutions in Kegalle

Solar energy is a very economical. But introducing a concept of this nature to society is a difficult task, like trying to swim upstream, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He made this observation at a ceremony to distribute solar power systems to all divisional secretariats of the Kegalle District.
The minister said that the ministry has already taken measures to provide solar power systems to all main state institutions and religious places.
“Religious places and state institutions such as divisional secretariats play a leading role among the people of Sri Lanka. By providing solar power systems to those places, we can educate our people in villages about solar power and direct them towards using it,” said the Minister.
Minister Siyambalapitiya further said that the Ceylon Electricity Board has pledged to pay Rs. 22 per unit (Kwh) which is added to the national grid by consumers who use solar power.
“The ultimate target is to establish one million solar-powered houses,” he said.
