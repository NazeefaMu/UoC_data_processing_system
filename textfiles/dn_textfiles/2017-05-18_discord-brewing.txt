Discord, brewing up

The arena of Sri Lankan politics could be accused of many lapses, but it can never be blamed for being dull and tedious.
This week, even as United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was battling in the Supreme Court to save her seat, the theatre of conflict shifted to the provinces.
Kumarasinghe was granted temporary relief by the highest court in the land. A three judge bench, by a majority verdict, granted her leave to appeal to challenge the verdict of the Court of Appeal unseating her because of her dual citizenship.
The matter has been fixed for hearing in September and Kumarasinghe will be able to function as a parliamentarian until then. That decision calmed the frayed nerves of the Joint Opposition (JO), at least for the time being, but its leadership was also battling with the government- more specifically with the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP) - on another front.
Trouble was brewing in two Provincial Councils, in the Central Provincial Council (CPC) and the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC). While events in the CPC were not directly triggered by the government, that was the case in the NCPC, where most of the drama unfolded.
The first salvo was fired when the NCPC’s Health Minister K.H. Nandasena was removed from his portfolio. It has been reported that Nandasena attended the JO May Day rally at Galle Face and the SLFP hierarchy was attempting to send a message to the party membership that those who defy the party leadership would be dealt with in a decisive manner.
North Central Province Governor
This dismissal however had a chain reaction. Nandasena was to say that he was not officially informed about being removed from his portfolio but came to know about it from the North Central Province Governor’s secretary during the swearing in of his replacement, M. Herath Banda.
Shortly afterwards, another Minister in the NCPC, S. M. Ranjith, who is a former Chief Minister and a loyalist of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced he would be resigning his portfolios. Ranjith arrived at this decision within a few hours of the removal of Minister Nandasena. A few days later, a fellow Provincial Councillor, Susil Gunaratne, was sworn in as his replacement.
However, in the interim, the NCPC was a hive of political activity. That is because the JO, sensing a political opportunity brought about by these developments, made an attempt to grab control of the NCPC.
Shortly after Nandasena was dismissed and Ranjith resigned, The JO made it known that it would move to nominate a Chief Minister on the basis that its group commanded a majority in the NCPC. The 33-member NCPC has 21 UPFA members. The JO claimed that it had the support of 18 members, which if it did, gave it a clear majority.
The current Chief Minister of the NCPC is Peshala Jayaratne, loyal to the mainstream SLFP. Jayaratne replaced Ranjith as Chief Minister, following the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015.
Acting promptly, the JO group was able to muster 17 affidavits- still a majority of the 33 member Council- calling for the dismissal of Peshala Jayaratne as Chief Minister. The affidavits were submitted to North Central Province Governor P. B. Dissanayake. The Governor however rejected the affidavits and the status quo remains, with Jayaratne continuing as Chief Minister, at least for now.
It is unlikely though, that the JO group within the NCPC will let the matter rest there. Already Anuradhapura district Parliamentarian S.M. Chandrasena- the brother of S. M. Ranjith- has threatened to take the battle to the streets.
“The government has resorted to undemocratic measures contrary to the policy of good governance. We are not prepared to let them go ahead in this manner,” Chandrasena said and declared that he would “mobilise the masses” against the current Chief Minister. What is more likely though is a legal battle.
Provincial Council elections
The current strife in the NCPC has longstanding antecedents. The most noteworthy SLFP politician to emerge from the NCPC was Berty Premalal Dissanayake. He was an avowed loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Dissanayake was Chief Minister from 1999 to 2012 and ruled the NCPC with an iron hand, maintaining the SLFP’s stranglehold in the region. Prior to Dissanayake assuming office, his wife Jayani Dissanayake was Chief Minister of the NCPC for a few months.
Due to his loyalty to Kumaratunga, on occasion, Berty Premalal Dissanayake was in conflict with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. When Dissanayake’s son Duminda Dissanayake took to national politics, he too wasn’t offered much encouragement by Rajapaksa.
After the last Provincial Council elections in 2012, Rajapaksa as President appointed S. M. Ranjith as Chief Minister, overlooking Dissanayake, who was also elected to the Council, much to the chagrin of the Dissanayakes.
Berty Premalal Dissanayake passed away in September 2013, but by then Duminda Dissanayake had acquired a reputation of not being popular with the Rajapaksas. At his father’s funeral, Duminda Dissanayake made pointed reference to the fact that his father’s “happiest day” when he fell ill was when Chandrika Kumaratunga visited him in hospital. Many saw this as a thinly veiled criticism of then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
When Maithripala Sirisena resigned as Minister of Health in the Rajapaksa Cabinet and announced his candidature for the 2015 presidential election, Duminda Dissanayake was one of a handful of parliamentarians who defected with him. For his anti-Rajapaksa stance, Dissanayake has been rewarded with the powerful post of General Secretary of the SLFP, at the relatively young age of 38.
Thus the tussle that is being played out in the NCPC is, in a sense a battle between the pro-Rajapaksa and the anti-Rajapaksa factions of the SLFP, fighting by proxies. Sadly for the party, it is eroding its popularity and credibility in the region.
A similar battle looms in the Central Provincial Council (CPC), though it hasn’t erupted into open conflict as yet. Following the dismissal of SLFP senior Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as organiser for Dambulla, his son Pramitha Bandara Tennekoon resigned as a Minister of the Central Provincial Council. It is understood that the JO is exploring a NCPC-style move in the CPC as well.
The JO hopes that its bids to capture control of the NCPC and CPC, if successful, will pave the way for a return to power. It believes that trends in the provincial councils could be translated into victories at national elections.
They must be encouraged from Chandrika Kumaratunga being elected Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council in 1993 and winning the general elections a year later. JO stalwarts also point to Harin Fernando who, although losing the Uva Provincial Council elections in 2014, enlisted the support of some UPFA councillors to oust Shashendra Rajapaksa and become Chief Minister.
Political parties
That move provided the United National Party (UNP), which was floundering until then, with much needed momentum and set the stage for the party’s successful presidential and general election campaigns in 2015.
The final arbiters of the popularity of political parties are the voters who will indeed have a chance to express their views because provincial council elections are due. Those polls will set the tone for national elections and will be eagerly awaited, also because it will shed light on how much support the two warring factions of the SLFP command.
If however, the SLFP continues to be its own worst enemy and engage in tussles within the party, as it is doing now in the NCPC and the CPC, there can be only one winner: the UNP. The next provincial council elections, when they are held, may well see a phenomenon that has not been seen before: a three way tussle for supremacy between the UNP, the SLFP and the JO which may foretell which way the winds of political good fortune are blowing, two years after the last major elections and three years before the next major polls.
