Dumping garbage from Colombo at Karadiyana halted

Kesbewa Chief Magistrate Gihan Ranawaka yesterday (28) ordered that the dumping of garbage from Colombo at Karadiyana be stopped.
The Kesbewa Magistrate’s Court on April 17 had accommodated the request from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to dump 350 MT of garbage a day from Colombo at the Karadiyana waste management facility given the disaster situation at the Meethotamulla landfill. The dumping however was allowed only from April 17-28.
Residents of the area on April 26 submitted a petition to the Magistrate asking that the term of the order not be further extended.
The Magistrate thus ruled it in their favour.
