Late President wanted undivided country: Sampanthan

The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was firmly committed to a united and undivided country, Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan said yesterday.
He was addressing the ceremony held to commemorate the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The Opposition Leader pointed out that the late President Premadasa was committed to promoting unity and harmony among all. “He wanted all people to live together in one undivided indivisible country that celebrates equality, rights and justice,” he pointed out.
“The late President Premadasa also believed that the 13th amendment to the Constitution does not provide a solution to the ethnic issue. So he appointed a select committee to look into it and made a senior SLFP member its Chairman. It clearly showed that he wanted both the UNP and the SLFP to work together to find a solution to the national problem,” Sampanthan pointed out.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the occasion said, “I have worked closely with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa for over 30 years. I know his expectations. He is a great example to young politicians. The late President Premadasa never considered the ethnicity, religion or political parties when serving people. He utilized skilled officers in these endeavors. He believed that the people will be content if their pockets are filled with money. So he generated employment opportunities for the people,” he said.
“During his time, the export sector thrived. Industries came into the country. He discussed issues in relation to development measures on a monthly basis. He had smart and skilled people around him. Accordingly, the present government is upholding a similar approach in developing the country,” the Speaker said.
