Frontline Socialist Party join GMOA, JVP  battle against SAITM

 
The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) pledged support to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA)'s battle against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The FSP said this today (9) at a discussion held with the GMOA in Colombo.
At the meeting, both parties agreed that SAITM should be shut down.
The GMOA and the JVP held a discussion on Tuseday (7) and agreed to fight together on a common platform to defeat SAITM.
SAITM puts the medical service and patients' lives in a great danger, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said at that meeting.
