Court rejects plea to reduce Sakvithi’s bail conditions

A request made by alleged billion-rupee fraudster Abhaya Ranasinghe Arachchilage Chandana Weerakumara alias Sakvithi Ranasinghe to relax his bail condition was yesterday turned down by Colombo High Court.
Defence Counsel Ravindra Senarath appearing for Sakvithi Ranasinghe moved court that a Rs.500,000 of cash bail imposed on the accused be reduced enabling him to fulfill his bail condition.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General raised objections to the request and proposed it to be further increased citing the accused had cheated innocent people by millions of rupees.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments on Sakvithi Ranasinghe, Kumari Anuradhani, Darshani Maduwanthi, Sandeepika Adhikaram, Upeksha Jayasuriya, Asitha Prabhath, Don Nalaka Thushara, Chathuri Apsara, Sithruwan Dhananjaya, Chanaka Suresh and Keshara Saamakumara for committing a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,628 million worth funds of the depositors at Sakvithi Housing and Construction (Pvt.) Ltd between 2006 and 2008.
