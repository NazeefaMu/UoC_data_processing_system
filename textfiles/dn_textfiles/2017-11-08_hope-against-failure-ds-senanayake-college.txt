Hope against failure : DS Senanayake College

To believe in yourself, to have the strength and wit to realise your ambitions, to rise above your fear and terror when it is at its strongest and to win the hearts of men and women regardless of the language they speak are the qualities of a great leader.
In the end, it is one’s attitude that wins the day. Understanding that others have won their battles, and that if one is confident others around him/her become confident, one understands how to lead. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of DS Senanayake College Inura Samarawickrama who is always looking to expand his horizons.
A genuine guy and having an affable personality, Samarawickrama prefers not to be judgmental and feels that he is always learning as a leader. He certainly believes that one should lead by example.
Good leader
“From what I have learned in my life it is clear to me that people are different from one another. It always helps to assess a situation before reacting to it. Also one must refrain from giving judgments or opinions before actually putting oneself into someone else’s shoes. Being a genuine person makes others trust and follow you. This is the best way of leading. It hurts no one being humble, and getting to know the unknown even from a youngster, helps all of us to expand our horizons. I’m always curious to know more and develop myself in many ways, so I can be a good leader and a person others can rely on,” said Samarawickrama.
Fear can help you in life, yet fear is something most people battle against. It is the one enemy that is most difficult to defeat. The one enemy that is always there. Sometimes before you and sometimes behind you. Always with you. The greatest enemy.
“The fear I have is to be a failure in the eyes of the people who believe in me. It has become my habit now to work hard and do my utmost. I also believe that I will be able to do the right thing at the right time. I also appreciate the guidance and the support I have always received from the people all around me. It has molded me and been my pillars of strength at rough times,” explained Samarawickrama.
Again Samarawickrama points out that it is confidence that brings new hope. He points out that if we believe in our own strengths and are aware of our weaknesses it will give us the incentive to stand up on our own two feet. We should believe in ourselves before anyone can believe in us.
Samarawickrama faced his Advanced Level examination in the physical science stream. He pointed out that mathematics always gives one the needed analytical powers to see a situation through. But he also pointed out that it is not the subject matter which helps you to make the most appropriate decisions quickly. It is the environment and the people around you that enrich your life.
Born fighter
“D S Senanayake College is the second mother of my life and it has always nourished and molded me. I thank all the teachers who have given their utmost in shaping us for the betterment of this country,” said Samarawickrama.
We all have our heroes in life. For Samarawickrama it is that great competitor, New Zealand Rugby player Richie McCaw, a giant in the field of rugby. McCaw was known for his brilliant captaincy and his courage on the field. He was tough and a born fighter.
“I would be thrilled to meet Richie McCaw. It’s not just because he is an honorable human, but also he is a personality we all can learn from. He was a great leader on the pitch and the stats speak for him. He is a person who struggled through his life and became the best, through hard work and compassion. He is a figure of humility and honor and is a perfect role model,” said Samarawickrama.
Let’s face it. Most of us have had dreams of becoming a billionaire. But what would we do with all that money? What would we spend it on? Or would we spend it on others?
“Sri Lanka, being a developing country, needs all the hands it can get in lifting the country up. I would like to build an educational institute that focuses on the skills and the capabilities of our children including streams that they have a desire to follow. It will help this country to have a variety of professionals to help this country to grow,” stated Samarawickrama.
When we were kids we all had dreams of changing the world. But at that age did not realize that only a few will have the greatness to bend history. But the rest of us in our own small way can change a part of this society we live in.
Equal rights
“I think it’s time people change their perceptions about others and also judging others according to stereotypes. It will help people to see all humans in a different way and break down these barriers we have created that separate us. I believe women have the strength and the intelligence to work head on with men. There should be no glass ceiling. They have equal rights and must be appointed to positions in which they can make a difference in this country. I think in a Democratic country, people should have their freedom. But with that great freedom comes great responsibility. Freedom does not give you the right to harm anyone with your actions,” stated Samarawickrama.
Samarawickrama’s ambitions are not only for himself. He believes in being a good citizen. The rights of children make him very passionate. This is because children are vulnerable and need protection. With them, they carry the hopes and dreams of our generation.
“It is especially the children who face unthinkable difficulties, also losing their lives. Children are the next generation. The victim becomes the oppressor at times. The victim grows up to become the oppressor. It greatly saddens me to know that children in Sri Lanka suffer because of the actions of adults,” added Samarawickrama.
The field is where a different learning takes place. Men taking on men. Rugby one of the greatest contact sports of all times. Where injuries take place and where brains and brawn are important. Indeed some have gone as far as to say that these boys are gladiators. They tackle and score. They collide with each other and they grow in toughness. It is a fast game that requires wits and physical strength.
“I was a part of the School’s 1st XV Rugby team for the last 5 years and last year I was the vice-captain. I’m currently a member of the Sri Lanka Navy Rugby pool. Rugby has taught me that the team is everything. One mistake can destroy the dreams of the rest of the team. It has taught me to stand up for others and to safeguard my own brothers. It has taught me time management, given me courage and provided me with the strength to be the best, even at the rock bottom,” explained Samarawickrama.
Specific challenge
Life is the greatest adventure. Face it. Never give up. You need to see it through. You have been given your problems because you can handle it. You have been given your specific challenge because you are strong enough to bear it and face it. Otherwise, it would not have been given to you.
“This is what I would like to say. Believe in yourself. Always think twice before taking a decision and don’t hesitate to seek advice from experienced personalities. It will help you to make the most appropriate decisions. Be humble enough to learn from anyone and to thank them. This will help you to have a long and a successful journey,” added Samarawickrama.
“I would like to appreciate my Ammi, Thaththi, Akki, my family and the special people in my life for always standing by me and helping me out and being pillars of strength during tough times. I would like to thank the Principal and all the teachers & coaches who have inspired me and guided me in my darkest times. I also would like to appreciate the help and the guidance of the past prefects, Old Boys’ Association of D. S. Senanayake College and my fellow brothers of the current guild. My gratitude goes out to my Rugby teammates for their compassion and faith in me through difficult times.”
