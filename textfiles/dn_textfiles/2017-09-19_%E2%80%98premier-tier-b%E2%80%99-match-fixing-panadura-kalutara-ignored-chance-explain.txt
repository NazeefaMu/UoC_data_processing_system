‘Premier Tier B’ match fixing : Panadura, Kalutara ignored chance to explain - Mathivanan

Sri Lanka Cricket has punished the players and coaches of Panadura Sports Club and Kalutara Physical & Culture Club because over a period of six months given for explanations they evaded the investigation all along, said Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) vice president and District Cricket Development president K. Mathivanan at a press briefing held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
The SLC held investigations after the Premier ‘Tier B’ match between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC played at Surrey grounds, Maggona from January 23-25 and both clubs guilty of misconduct and not playing to the spirit of the game.
“We don’t accept certain statement created by some people regarding this decision,” Mathivanan said.
The President of Investigating Committee Asela Rekawa also confirmed the vice president’s statement. “Any party has a chance to get judicial action against this decision and can also make an appeal to SLC,” said Rekawa.
“The Investigating Committee did not decide on the punishment. We have confirmed some misconduct in the game. We only produced the investigation report to the Executive Committee of SLC,” he said.
All the players and coaches of from both teams received a one year suspension from all cricket related activities while being imposed a fine of Rs. 500,000 each.
Ports Authority became the top team after the result of the match was declared null and void and they were promoted to play in the top tier of the inter club Premier Cricket tournament the coming season beginning in December. Kalutara PCC has been demoted to third division.
In the related match Kalutara PCC batted initially and scored 390 runs and in reply Panadura scored 180 for 2 wickets at the end of second day. The third and final day of the match Panadura team collected another 243 runs in 23.3 overs to be all out for 423 in the first innings. In the second innings Kalutara PCC made a quick 197 runs in 22.5 overs. The Panadura team chased the target of 165 in 13.4 overs, scoring at a run rate of 12.4 runs an over and won the match to replace Ports Authority at the top of the points table. The skipper of Panadura SC Chamara Silva did not bat in any of the innings reporting sick.
On the final day the two teams produced 607 runs for 23 wickets lost in just 60.4 overs which led to suspicion of the manner in which the match was played.
