Nations Trust Bank American Express rewards cardmembers

Nations Trust Bank American Express has extensive benefits lined up this holiday season exclusively for its Cardmembers via the iconic Membership Rewards platform.
The Membership Rewards Program entitles Cardmembers to special privileges and savings from time to time with a plethora of well known lifestyle brands. The program which is also the only non expiry credit card loyalty program in Sri Lanka also entails the ability to transfer points to other compatible travel loyalty programmes and can result in extended benefits if the Cardmember already holds loyalty points in those partner programs.
Membership Rewards Points can be transferred to FlySmiles, Asia Miles, Cathay Pacific’s frequent flyer programme and Hilton Honours, a guest loyalty programme offered by Hilton Hotels and Resorts worldwide. Points can also be redeemed at well known local shopping, dining and leisure brands offering Cardmembers more flexibility and choice in the way they can use points.
Leading the season of joy Nations Trust Bank American Express partners with Findmyfare and Dinapala Group to bring impressive rewards to Cardmembers via the Membership Rewards Points plus Pay program.
The limited time offer enables Cardmembers to avail savings by redeeming membership rewards and charging only the balance on their card.
Discussing Membership Rewards program, Niluka Gunatilake, Head of Cards, Nations Trust Bank said, “In addition to many unique and valuable benefits you as a Cardmember enjoys with your Nations Trust Bank American Express Card, you can now enjoy greater benefits and exclusive rewards for your everyday purchases with the Membership Rewards programme.”
“Presently, we are offering you a Points plus Pay option to redeem exclusive deals.
The beauty of the program is that we offer everything from extravagant to the most basic household item, because we believe that it is what our Cardmembers expect from their rewards program.
This special offer enables you to pay for part of your purchase with the Membership Rewards Points accumulated thus far and pay the balance using your American Express Card.
