UNP has not politicised the Police - Hector

The UNP has not politicised the Police or meddled in its administrative affairs while working in the Unity Government, UNP backbench MP Hector Appuhamy said.
The MP was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday. He pointed out that no Police officer was transferred or unduly interfered with due to political reasons during the last three years.
“Such transfers and interferences were rampant under the previous Government. Some of the Joint Opposition politicians are still engaged in extortion, he alleged.This is when they do not have the ruling power. What would be the plight if they held power?” he remarked.
With reference to the IGP, the MP said a decision must soon be taken on the allegations regarding his conduct and certain statements. He also demanded to expedite the investigations on the alleged plot to assassinate the President and the former Defence Secretary.
“We see a huge conspiracy here. It is not clear whether it is to ruin or protect the country or to grab power or whether it (Opposition) is acting as a cat’s paw of a foreign country. The truth must come out,” he noted.
MP Appuhamy said the UNP backbench group is getting ready for a fresh fight in the coming days to project it’s true achievements to the people.
“We waited patiently and contained our activity keeping in mind that we work within a Unity Government. However, the SLFP Group of 16 attacked the UNP throughout this period and now their allegiances are clear. We are not ready to restrict ourselves anymore, we will start a revolt,” he added.
When asked about the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee Report on UNP Party reforms, MP Kavinda Jayewardena said its recommendations are now in the implementation stage.
He said the Politbureau Committee headed by the Prime Minister would come up with a timeframe to implement its recommendations, adding that the responsibility of party reforms are now with that Committee. Asked by journalists as to whether they are frustrated that the party reforms were not made, MPs Jayewardena and Appuhamy replied in the negative.
