The topics covered under the Green Belt in Retail level included retail strategy, planning and metrics, resource productivity in stock space and staff, merchandise planning, financial analysis and contextualizing data.

The affiliation with the Global Retail Academy was an initiative we are honoured to be a part of as it set the course for upgrading and upskilling the standards of the Retail industry in the country. We hope that the rest of the organizations too will reach the Green Belt stage and thereby work towards achieving the Global Black Belt in Retail accreditation”
