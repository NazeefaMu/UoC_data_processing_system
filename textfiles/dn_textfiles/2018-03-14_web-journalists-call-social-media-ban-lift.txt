Web journalists call for social media ban lift

The Professional Web Journalists’ Association (PWJA) yesterday urged the government to lift social media restrictions and to bring in a code of ethics for these platforms as soon as possible. The PWJA also said restrictions on social media have now taken the shape of media censorship. PWJA said they hope to explore possibilities of taking legal measures against this prolonged restriction in the coming few days.The association is also to launch a programme called Face-to-Facebook to voice protest against this limitation.
These observations were made at a press brief held at the Center for Corporate Social Responsibility at Colombo 1 yesterday.
The PWJA pointed out that there are about 400,000 persons making a living out of social media in Sri Lanka including marketers, designers, photographers and models.They also said a large number of persons who are abroad have found the continued restriction to be an obstacle when contacting their loved ones at home.
The PWJA also demanded politicians to unpublish their social media campaign pages and requested the public to unlike these pages.They alleged that the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister has been misled by his team of social media experts who has given him wrong advice.
The PWJA stated that politicians are not taking proper action to curb fake news while using racism to fulfill their own agendas.PWJA Convener Freddy Gamage, Secretary Kelum Shivanta, members Pramod Ratnayaka, Nuwan Hettiaarachchi and several other members spoke at the press briefing.
