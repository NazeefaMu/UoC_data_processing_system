Civil Security Department celebrates Thai Pongal

The Civil Security Department (CSD) celebrated the Thai Pongal festival at Hindu temples in Killinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Vishvamadu, recently under the patronage CSD Director General Chandraratne Pallegama.
The CSD Killinichchi Brigade Headquarters has employed around 3,500 rehabilitated ex-LTTE combatants and is extending a significant contribution to the country’s economy through their agricultural projects. Subsequent to the end of the war, the CSD recruited a large number of these rehabilitated personnel and deployed them to their camps in Killinochchi, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and Jaffna and successfully engaged them in farming thousands of acres of lands that were destroyed and abandoned during the war.
The Wattakachchi farm in Killinochchi held its harvest festival according to Hindu rituals with the participation of the CSD Director General concurrent to its Thai Pongal festivities.
In addition, dry rations were also distributed among pregnant mothers in Killinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Vishvamadu, and school books were also distributed among schoolchildren in the areas.
Further, the kovil complex in Bharathipuram, Killinochchi, was also declared open by the director general and eight Hindu religious statues were also placed within its premises.
