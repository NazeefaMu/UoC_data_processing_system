Designing details

Playing with colours made her the iconic designer that she is today. With over 45 years of design experience, the name Yolanda Aluwihare Holm is synonymous with haute couture fashion in Sri Lanka. She has taken the Sri Lankan design label to the world by showcasing her designs on the runway on international platforms. Veinert Holm talks about what drives his elegant and stylish wife towards success.
First impression
Yolanda and I met for the first time at her sister’s house in Negombo in 2001. It was the day before the New Year.
I am from Sweden and I migrated to Sri Lanka in 1994, employed as a Managing Director for an electronic scales company. Yoland’s sister and I were neighbours and we have known each other for a long time.
However I have never met Yolanda before that. She was already into designing and had made a name for herself by then. Though I knew about her family, I did not know much about Yolanda herself.
The first thought that ran through my mind when I set eyes on Yolanda was that she is a very beautiful lady. When we began chatting I realized that she is smart and witty as well.
I had planned to go to Bangkok with her sister and her husband to play golf. Yolanda joined us to go for a shopping spree. We were in Bangkok for two weeks and she too developed an interest towards golf. I taught her how to play the game.
Marriage
Yolanda and I shared the same interests. Both of us have travelled all over the world. We had a lot to talk about. We found common ground in many subjects. After a three year courtship we got engaged in 2004 in Singapore. Our wedding was on 2006 in Bangkok. We married under the Swedish law at the Swedish Embassy there. Our reception was held on a boat on the Chao Phraya river. Both our families were present at the event.
Success formula
Yolanda is very dedicated to her job. Whenever she takes up something she wants to give 100 percent of herself to it. She works hard to improve her designs and her brand. She does not laze around but is very eager and strives to do her best to make a better future for the fashion industry.
Her work is a combination of hand crafted batik and hand paintings. She also incorporates different techniques she has learnt from abroad into her work. All these features led her to success.
Most spectacular outfit Yolanda had designed
Yolanda has designed countless outfits so it is difficult to choose one out of the lot. She normally wears her own outfits only for a competition or when she wants to promote the brand. The outfit she wore when she got the Best Selling Brand of the Year award at the Asian Fashion Awards held in China in 2012 was one of my favourites.
Daily schedules
Yolanda usually goes to work between 8 and 9 am. She comes home for lunch because the factory is in Pelawatte and within 10 minutes drive from our home. She goes back to work and is home by 6 pm. Then she cooks dinner.
She loves to go to the gym to work out during her free time. I am retired. I get up and start my day the same time Yolanda wakes up. We have breakfast together and then I read the local English newspapers and check the global news on the Internet. I also read the Swedish newspaper online. I love swimming so I usually go to the pool in the afternoon. Sometimes I help out when Yolanda needs help with the maintenance of the factory.
Fashion tips
I am not into fashion but I have been dragged into it! Yolanda advices me on my fashion sense. The most valuable tip she has given me is about matching colours. I have never considered this before because I usually grab what I have before going to work.
She has told me that black becomes me. I like blue but I do not have many blue outfits in my closet. There are mostly white and black outfits there.
Yolanda chooses what I should wear for a special occasion. Even when I go retail shopping, she joins me and chooses my clothes. She knows the best way to dress a man!
Life companions
Apart from me Yolanda is very close to her children and grandchildren. Her son, Major Tissa Aluwihare, owns a security firm which is working for a multinational company. Her daughter, Nisadevi Karunaratne, is a law degree holder. She works with her mother in her factory. She has three grandchildren: Casimira, Nela and Maya. Casimira is a graduate from Harvard and is working for a company in Australia.
Happiest moment in life
One of the happiest memories we have together is when Yolanda went to China to get her award. She did not know that she would win because there were 12 other countries competing for the Best Selling Brand of the Year title at the Asian Fashion Awards 2012.
Foodwise
We have similar tastes in food. That was one of the many reasons why we get along together. I love the crab curry that she makes. It is so delicious with rice. Like most Sri Lankans, Yolanda too cannot live without rice and curry. Dining out, we would go for Thai or Chinese food.
Travel time
We are mostly on the go traveling abroad. It is pretty much our hobby. We just came back from Switzerland after visiting my daughter. We usually visit my motherland, Sweden, once a year. We also travel to Thailand at least three times a year. Singapore too is one of our frequent holiday destinations. We have two favourite holiday hotspots: Spain and Switzerland.
Most memorable traveling experiences
We have only had one bad traveling experience and that was in Bali. It is not a country that people believe it to be. It was not quite up to our expectations. Yolanda became ill on that trip too.
We explored the Chu Chi Tunnels in Vietnam. I was feeling sweaty and uncomfortable because the tunnels were small and I am big made. It was a scary experience too.
An alternative profession for Yolanda
Apart from designing clothes Yolanda loves to build houses. So she would have made a great architect or interior designer. She has built five houses already and they have been featured in local and international magazines. The first two houses were renovated. They are in Kandy and Bagatale. The first house she built from scratch is in Sarasavi Lane, Borella.
Once she visited Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. It was a massive hotel and she was motivated to build a house like that. So she bought land in Pelawatte and built a house according to that structure. She took four years to build that house. She named it ‘Shangri-La’. The last house she built is in Negombo. It is titled ‘El Paradiso’.
One change
I don’t want to change anything about Yolanda. She is not perfect but she is what I want.
a little known fact
Yolanda is passionate about playing golf. This is something others do not expect of her because, as a fashion designer, you do not think she would like to go out into the hot sun and become tanned. Almost everyone in the fashion scene wish to become fairer rather than browner!
