PCOI into SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering, Mihin Lanka
Series of discrepancies in selection of inflight duty free service provider

A series of discrepancies pertaining to selection of an inflight duty free service provider for SriLankan Airlines in 2012 were revealed yesterday before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
These revelations came to light as Senior Manager Commercial Procurement Gihan Silva and Senior Manager (Revenue) Accounting Upeka Abeysekara of SriLankan Airlines gave evidence before the Commission yesterday.
According to the board paper dated March 14, 2012, the national carrier has entered upon a contract with a company named Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd for the supply of wine and champagne for onboard use in SriLankan Airlines. Following a delayed tender procedure, Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd was selected out of 17 shortlisted bidders. However, the payments made to this service provider were directed to a Canadian bank account holder called Phoenix Rising Ventures of Canada Ltd. The latter’s name does not appear in the said agreement.
It was also revealed that the payments were credited to an account number which was not included in the referred agreement as well. Invoices pertaining to such transactions were submitted to the Commission by the witnesses. There have been several payments made to another entity under the title Phoenix Duty Free Lanka Pvt Ltd, it was observed.
According to the then Senior Manager (Finance) Accounting Upeka Abeysekara, they did not received any correspondence or verification from the service provider of a change of company name or anything relating to such an alteration. Abeysekara said that the Phoenix Duty Free Company informed her of an email in relation to this subject in 2015. However, the transactions took place from 2012.
It was also revealed that a US$ 1.6 million loss was incurred by SriLankan Airlines due to the change in the method of calculating the minimum guarantee commission paid to the same service provider after one year of the original contract. According to the evidence led before the Commission, a decision was taken to change the method of calculation of the minimum guarantee commission from sector passenger basis to origin to destination passenger basis.
According to the audited financial statements, earlier when SriLankan Airlines managed the duty free services in 2011-2012, it recorded arevenue of Rs. 721 million, whereas when Phoenix Duty Free took over, the revenue dropped to a Rs. 526 million.
It was also revealed that there was a conflict of interest with regard to the proposal forwarded by Phoenix Duty Free Company Pvt Ltd. According to evidence, the wine tasting event was organised by the bidder itself. The event and the panel of experts were selected by the bidder as well. The panel also included representatives of the bidder. Witness Gihan Silva said that usually such events were previously under the care of SriLankan Airlines.
State Counsel Shantha Bandara and Shakila Gunatilake led evidence for the day. The Commission is to sit again on Wednesday, July 4, at the BMICH.
