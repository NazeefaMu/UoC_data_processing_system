Dengue risk in Matale

The risk of dengue spreading in the Matale district had resurfaced with the prevailing inclement weather, health officials said recently.
Hence, authorities had made preparations to launch a dengue-prevention programme in the district. A sharamadana campaign had been planned to be held in the district, recently. Government officers serving in rural areas as well as volunteer organisations, were to participate in the programme.
A team of health officials were to carry out door-to-door inspections as well.
