High Octane powerlifters create new Raw Powerlifting records

Sri Lankan powerlifting champions Darin Weerasinghe and Ransilu Jayathilake stole the show at the first round of the National Raw Powerlifting Championship held recently at Bandaragama Youth Centre.
Raw powerlifting is a sport of pure strength as it does not permit any support gear. Darin was in unfamiliar territory as it was the first time he took part in the Over 120kg class.
Darin went on to break the Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift and overall total record with combined lifts of 630kg. Darin has also secured three Sri Lanka bench press records in the 105kg, 120kg and Over 120kg classes.
Ransilu Jayathilake broke the Squat and Deadlift record in the Under 120kg class. Dhanushka Kodikara broke the Squat record in the Under 105kg class.
Ranga Wimalasooriya was 1st runner up in the novices event in the Under 120kg class.
This meet was conducted under the Sri Lanka National Sporting Code, along with the guidelines of the International Powerlifting Federation.
All three athletes have booked places to represent Sri Lanka at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships, which will be held in South Africa in September, 2017.
