CEBEU to intensify trade union action

The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) has threatened to intensify their ongoing work-to-rule strike action by refraining from attending to breakdowns or other issues after office hours from next week.
“We have so far had several rounds of discussions with the government. Two main demands among them, the approval of the Long Term Generation Plan and the appointment of competent professionals to the Public Utilities Commission remains unresolved,” it read.
In light of the failure on the government to make its move, the Union had met on May 25 and decided to call for a special General Meeting this week. “There is a possibility of reaching a decision, where we would not attend to any breakdowns after office hours and on holidays under any circumstances.”
The unions adds that the PUCSL’s refusal to approve the Generation Plan since 2015 and the failure to construct new power plants has dragged the country as well as the power sector into crisis.
The CEBEU met President Maithripala Sirisena last week. CEBEU member Athula Wanniarachchi told the Daily News that they had conveyed their concerns and the President had said he would take necessary action. According to the engineers who attended the meeting, the President has sought advice from the Attorney General over the ongoing dilemma.
According to the PUCSL, the Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan 2018-37 was approved under the least cost principals in Section 43 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 to ensure energy security and continuous supply of electricity in Sri Lanka.
The Transmission Licensee (CEB) was directed to commence the procurement process as per the provisions of the law for the new plants within the period 2018- 2028 to avoid power shortage. Therefore, no new coal power plants were approved exterior of the approved plan.
