Two brothers sentenced to death for patricide

Two brothers who were found guilty of killing their father 21 years ago were sentenced to death by the Negombo High Court Judge Ravindra Amal Ranaraja recently.
Warnakulasuriya Kithsiri Premalal Ranjith Fernando and Warnakulasuriya Preethi Sanath Collin Mathew Fernando alias Suddhiya of Bulawatte, Waikkal, Wennappuwa were the accused sentenced to death.
They had killed their father, Warnakulasuriya James Fernando of Bolawatta, Waikkal, on or around February 8, 1996.
High Court Judge Ravindra Amal Ranaraja, who held the non summary inquiry into the case in his capacity as Chilaw High Court Judge, gave the judgement in his capacity as the Negombo High Court Judge.
Recording evidence in the case began as the two accused pleaded not guilty.
The plaintiffs submitted that the father had two wives.
He had two sons (the accused) and two daughters by his first wife and two others by his second wife.
The father had been constantly harassing the two accused and on the day in question he had summoned the first accused to his house and assaulted him. When he wailed in pain, the second accused had rushed and the two had hit the father with a club after stabbing him with two sharp implements.
The father had succumbed to his injuries on admission to hospital.
The first accused in his evidence said he killed his father due to sudden provocation as he assaulted him.
The second accused submitted that he killed the father and the first accused was not involved in the murder.
Both accused were given death sentence since they were proved guilty beyond doubt, the judge said in his judgement.
