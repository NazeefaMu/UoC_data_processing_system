Kerawalapitiya power plant construction
Interim Order sought to stay tender proceedings

A Fundamental Rights petition was yesterday filed in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order directing the respondents to stay all further proceedings of the tender to construct the 300MW HFO/NG fired power plant at Kerawalapitiya.
H.W. Ranjith Pushpa Kumara, the Charman of National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection in Sri Lanka, filed the petition pertaining to the tender to construct the plant on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis.
The petitioner cited 82 parties including GCL Intelligent Energy (Suzhou) Co. Ltd., Windforce (Pvt.) Ltd., Renewgen (Pvt.) Ltd., Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Cabinet Ministers as respondents.
The petitioner stated that he and the citizens of the republic would suffer grave and irreparable loss if the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary and Cabinet Ministers were permitted to take further steps to issue letter of intent and agreements in respect of the fired power plant construction at Kerawalapitiya.
This petition was filed through counsel Sanath Wijewardena.
