Kapil Dev’s message to Sri Lanka’s cricketers:
“Believe in yourself there’s  no one better than you”

India’s 1983 World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev who was the guest of honour at the Dialog Cricket Awards 2017 held at the Waters Edge on Tuesday told the cricketers representing Sri Lanka to believe in themselves because it was that belief that enabled them to win the World Cup in 1996.
In a glitzy night attended by distinguished members of the cricketing fraternity where Rangana Herath was crowned the Dialog Cricketer of the Year and Asela Gunaratne (4) and Chamari Atapattu (5) bagged the highest number of awards in the men’s and women’s categories, Kapil said: “I know you had a rough time recently and you are not playing well because great cricketers have just gone it is difficult, but that’s how cricket goes. The young cricketers who are sitting on my left side who got lots of rewards they have a lot of responsibility. I can only say one thing to all the cricketers who are going to represent the country and who are playing for your country, make sure you believe in yourself. Respect your opponent but once you wear your country’s colours and you walk into the ground there’s nobody better than you, you produce the result.”
“I’ve seen your cricket growing from a very young age. I was very young when I started playing but that’s the time you got recognition in international cricket and in such a short spell how well you people have done,” Kapil continued.
“It’s not only because of the cricketer, it’s the affect of everybody, the passion of the people of your country, spectators, despite the first 15 years you were losing most of the matches, but the people used to come back to the ground and loved you with a passion they would like to see Sri Lanka cricket go up. Eventually you emerged one of the best teams in the world and that in such a small island you started doing wonders.
“Why you did that was only one thing, during that period you started believing in yourself that you can win. Your captain (Arjuna) Ranatunga had given that belief to everybody that during our time we are not less than everybody we are better than everybody despite of your very simple life, very subdued, not very aggressive race by nature, but on the field the way you played the cricket it was hats off to everybody.”
Kapil said that he did not want to follow in the footsteps of two other Asian cricket captains – Imran Khan and Arjuna Ranatunga who won the World Cup for their country and later turned to politics because he was not a great speaker.
“When I started playing cricket if somebody says you come and talk I rather say I want to play, I can’t talk. I am not a great speaker that’s why I didn’t join politics like both the captains Pakistan and Sri Lanka. They joined politics because they love talking, I am not, I don’t like to talk too much,” Kapil said.
“Before I come here I talk to my teacher and said I have to go to Sri Lanka and I have to give a speech. He said you will have only seven minutes vocabulary of English so you can’t talk more than seven minutes, your speech should not last that long.”
While thanking Sri Lanka Cricket for inviting him Kapil said, “Normally I don’t come I am very shy to come out since I stopped playing cricket. I stay away as much as I can and hope to remember my good days that’s gone and that’s history. My memories start coming back what I did in Sri Lanka good and bad it was a wonderful time. It’s a wonderful nation and wonderful people it’s not because I am here because I believe from my heart. I enjoyed playing here against you people and I made wonderful friends in this country.
“You are going to come to India next week or so I just want to wish you all the luck but not better than my country, I have to be honest. I want to say go out and play the best cricket and let the best team win. I want you to play tough cricket, don’t be overawed by any of the players. I know India is a large country and distractions are there but you have responsibility towards your country. At this stage when your team is not playing so well somebody has to stand up and take the lead, it’s not the captain it’s the team, it’s very important. I like to wish you all the best in the next month and a half. When you play cricket winner-loser is a separate thing, play cricket so that people will look up to you that’s how cricket is played.”
Referring to former Sri Lanka cricketer Aravinda de Silva who was present at the occasion Kapil said, “Talking about Sri Lanka that man sitting there Aravinda de Silva has given me a lot of rough time and I can’t forget Roy Dias who in my time was one of the finest batsmen I’ve bowled to.”
Whilst wishing the women’s cricketers ‘good luck’ Kapil said in a lighter vein, “To the administrators of your country it is not easy when you don’t have so much funds and your neighbour has a lot of funds. Get it from them, go and meet them and take it by hook or by crook it will be fun.”
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who was the chief guest and Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala also spoke.
