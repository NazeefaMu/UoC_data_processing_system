Religions are to guide, not to fight!

Religion is defined as the set of beliefs, feelings, dogmas and practices that define the relations between human being and sacred or divinity. Though there are atheists, mostly, each and everyone has some faith in his or her own religion. At the same time, one should respect each others’ religion. However, above all religious rites and practices, love is God.
Be that as it may, whatever calamities take place in turn in our country, some miscreants are still there to create the ethnic and religious conflicts, when looking back the history or past incidents. Obviously, some bad eggs, politically strengthened mob, mislead the younger generation by poisoning their delicate minds for their own benefits. They fail to realize that they are pouring kerosene on ablaze. As a result, younger generation ruins their lives by engaging themselves, obliviously, in violence, brawl and picketing for their demands for various reasons.
For instance, at Vavuniya Campus, a group of students created an unrest situation by placing an idol case to seat a Buddha statue at the Campus premises without the prior approval of the Campus Authority. So far, no land has been given to any religious construction though the premises are allowed for all the religious activities of the students from all the religions for the last two decades.
The land for the activities of all the religions has been allocated in the Master Plan of the Campus, waiting for the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education. Then only the lands can be utilized by the students of respective religious faith. Instead of waiting for the approval, they violated the law and order of the Campus. As a result, the students created the disharmonies by misbehaving and bullying the authority using unparliamentary language. This resulted in closing the Campus indefinitely to bring the situation under control, with the intervention of the police. Unfortunately, nearly after a two-month time of the non-academic strike, the educational activities started smoothly just two days back.
Most importantly, Buddha teaches about love and harmony, in contradiction, sadly, every time somewhere in the country, the extremists create a tragedy using the ‘Buddha statue’ to ‘disturb the peace’ of the country. This unpleasant situation is not a good sign, after bitterly experiencing a three-decade of war losing a large number of lives and limbs. Frankly speaking, Tamils are not at all enemies of Sinhalese or rejecting the Buddha’s statues or his principles. After all, the Hindus believe that Buddha is incarnate of Lord Krishna. We, Tamils, spiritually admire his philosophy of love, and we care for our Buddhist brothers and sisters, no doubt. Recently, the whole country shivered because of the Kandy incident. University students are here for learning and they should not be used, at any cost, as means by the political parties to disrupt the tranquillity of the country. In universities, there should not be any interference of religious or ethnic politics at any level to destroy the students’ future.
Religions were formed to maintain the harmony among the people and not to bring clashes among them for many reasons. The Buddha should be a symbol of love and sheer harmony and no one should turn it a symbol of bloodshed and disharmony. All responsible citizens have the bounden duty to protect our nation from politicizing the religious issues.
