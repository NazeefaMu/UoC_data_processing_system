Sensational teenage rider Aaron burns the track at Coimbatore

 
Thirteen-year-old Aaron Gunawardena riding his semi modified Suzuki Gixxer 150 stunned Indian riders when he posted the fastest timing at practice and qualifying in the under 24 one make event at the Kari Speedway Circuit in Coimbatore. Most of the Indian riders were amazed as Aaron has never seen or ridden the circuit before and never had a go on a Suzuki Gixxer.
The young pacesetter not only ended up winning both his events but helped many Indian riders improve by using his racing lines to corner and exit faster. Suzuki India has their eyes glued on the young Lankan and fervently hopes he would be able to participate at their championships in future, as most of the under 24 riders ended up bettering their all-time lap records, and beating all riders from the open event too.
Aaron’s performance has not only secured a slot for him in the Indian Championships, it has also opened doors for elder brother Jaden to run in the higher capacity events in India.
