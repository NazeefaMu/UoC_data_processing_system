LEASE OF HAMBANTOTA HARBOUR AND LAND
There had been several letters for and against the government leasing out Hambantota and acres of land in Hambantota area to set up industries by a Chinese government company, culminating in the removal of Minister for Justice and Buddhist Affairs, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the grounds that he had violated collective decision of the Cabinet in criticizing the Cabinet.
It brings to my mind of nearly similar issue when our country was administered by the Britishers, where the government was accused of alienating land to planters.
The then Governor of Ceylon Sir Hugh Clifford, when addressing the Second Annual Agricultural Conference on March 11, 1927 had this to say.
“The Land Question, moreover, is a matter of such tremendous moment and, I might add, of such stupendous difficulty, that it is essential that its complexities should be explored with the calm and with the metal detachment of statesmen, not with the fire and fury of political partisans;”.
The most important statement he makes is “The government of Ceylon may be constituted, it will always be one of its primary and most imperative duties to guard and defend the land – this great asset of the people, of the taxpayer – from encroachment by individuals or groups of individuals; and further, to the best of its ability, to see that it is alienated in the manner most nicely calculated to promote the prosperity of the island and the highest interests of its inhabitants.” This shows the interest they showed to safeguard the land for the people of this country and develop same for prosperity.
Not only that, it was made mandatory that Indian labour employed in estates to go back to India after termination of their services, for which a special train service was provided to Danuskodi so that those numbers did not add to the population of the country. Sadly, our politicians to remain in power granted them citizenship rights and today, they are a power to recon, to form governments.
All in all, the people are not aware of the conditions under which the agreement was reached to lease Hambantota Harbour and land for industries. It is presumed the Chinese labour brought to Sri Lanka, will be asked to leave after their period is over and not given citizenship rights as done in the case of Indian labour. It is also hoped that our personnel will be trained to carry on when the Chinese employees leave after the expiry of the lease.
Let our political leaders and those interested in the welfare of the people and the country learn a lesson from what the colonial rulers displayed to safeguard the interests of the country and its inhabitants.
