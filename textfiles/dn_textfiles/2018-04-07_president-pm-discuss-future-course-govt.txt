President, PM discuss future course of Govt.

President Maithripala Sirisena, yesterday, admitted that he held extensive discussions with the Prime Minister on the course of the government, following the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion.
The President was addressing the heads of media institutes at the President’s House in Colombo, yesterday.
He said that a committee has been appointed to decide on the modalities and the way forward. The President added that there would be a Cabinet reshuffle and the subjects will be allocated on a scientific basis.
He said that the functions of the Economic Management Committee had now been absorbed by the Cabinet and the Economic Management Committee had been scrapped through a consensus.
The Cabinet, as one unit, will discuss these matters in the future.
“Therefore, there would be only one institution to take decisions instead of two,” he said.
