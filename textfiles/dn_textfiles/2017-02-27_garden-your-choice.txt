The Garden of your choice !

We instinctively love to be surrounded by the beauty of nature. Because it soothes the mind and it benefits us in so many ways. It gives us our food and in today's urban environment - in a world of concrete jungles - it preserves our sanity. Today Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture, District Agriculture Instructor Ratmalana K.N.K Jayathilake on Edible Landscaping - creating gardens that benefits the mind and body.
"The creation of gardens is a scientific process as well as a form of art. It is about planning your garden and beautifying it by growing a variety of plants. This gives you great satisfaction. Most people in Sri Lanka are engaged in this activity and receive great pleasure from it. It stimulates the mind and helps one live in harmony with the natural environment," said Jayathilake
Planting flowers
When beautifying one's garden one can grow many flowers, bushes and trees that provide shading and one can maintain ones lawn. In addition to this you can even include waterfalls.
"When it comes to Sri Lanka, the beautification of gardens has been practised throughout the centuries and we have had a history of beautifying our gardens from the time of our kings. One good example is the Water Gardens of Sigiriya. Another example is Anuradhapura Mahameuna Uyana. The designing and planning our home gardens is our Sri Lankan Pride," stated Jayathilake
Bio Diversity has been a feature of our home gardens. While living in harmony with nature, the gardens have been an economic strength, serving the needs of the family.
"These home gardens reduce the tension in the mind. They also create a pleasurable and refreshing coolness. When beautifying your home gardens, why not even grow some vegetables? In addition to making the garden attractive you can also use these plants for consumption. Flower can only project beauty but if you grow vegetables it will serve you economically providing a healthy food intake," added9 Jayathilake

Take the Anuradhapura Era, Sigiriya Era, Pollonnaruwa Era and Mahanuwara Era, beautification of gardens was practised right throughout.
"When beautifying gardens we must follow certain principles. If we can follow those principles we can achieve our goal."
There has to be unity.
When growing plants there needs to be uniformity. Similar flowers have to be collected together. There need to be borders. Plants of similar height and type need to be put together. Similar plants in pots should be put together. It has to match well with each other.
There needs to be balance
If you split the garden by one line, varieties of vegetables and flowers on one side should match with the vegetables and flowers on the other side. That makes it look more attractive.
Scale
The garden must be in proportion with the building. If the building is tall and the plants are small, then there is less attraction. If the buildings are small and the plants are large, then the building is covered. The roads, beds, lawns have to be in proportion. Features need to be in proportion.
There needs to be diversity
There needs to be a variety. There should be flowers, fruits, bushes, vegetables, ornamental plants, medicinal plants. There needs to be a diversity and variety. That is what makes a great garden.
Important factors
The soil is important. How fertile it is. So depending on that you administer organic manure. This is for the development of the plant.
There needs to be a good drainage system. If with the rainfall the garden gets flooded, it will be difficult to maintain it. There needs to be a good drainage system for the water to go out.
Sunlight is important for the growth of plants. You have to see where the sunlight falls in your home garden and use those places to grow plants.
Plants need sunlight in varying degrees. Some plants need a lot of it and shade loving plants need a less amount. So you need to identify in your gardens where the sunlight falls and its amounts.
If you are mindful of these factors then your productivity will go up.
"We need to also consider the environmental problems we face. If your house is near a road, there may be a lot of noise pollution. Then there is also the dust. So you need to have a plan as to what you can do to prevent these things. Also the sunlight that falls may be too intense. The wind may be too strong. For this you need to grow appropriate plants. So you need to identify the location. We can organize our garden to shield us from these problems by growing plants," explained Jayathilake
Concealing imperfection
Sometimes there could be an imperfection in the view. We can use the trees to conceal this.
"It may be an old dilapidated building. We can grow the trees to hide the view. Sometimes the garden can have natural benefits. The Garden may have ponds. So we must make use of these natural attributes to make our garden beautiful," pointed out Jayathilake
We can also use colors to our benefit. Various plants have flowers with various colors. Even fruits and vegetables have their own colors. You need to use these various colors to your advantage when designing your garden.
"Primary colors are Red, Blue and Yellow. Secondary colors are Purple, Orange and Green. Tertiary colors Yellow Orange, Red Orange, Red Violet, Blue Violet, Blue Green and Yellow Green. So we need to think of these color combinations and grow our plants. We can grow fruits, flowers and Vegetables with these different colors. We can grow fruit trees that produce flowers with these different colors. With these you can create a contrast in the garden. You can create so many color combinations," noted Jayathilake
