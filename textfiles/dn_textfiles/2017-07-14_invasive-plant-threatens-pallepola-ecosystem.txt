Invasive plant threatens Pallepola ecosystem

A giant invasive plant 'Mimosa Pudica' (Nidikumba) has invaded 10 villages in the Pallepola Divisional Secretariat division and the Nalanda reservoir threatening people's agricultural pursuits and the environment. Residents said the plant had spread into the Nalanda reservoir which supplied irrigation to agricultural land limiting its capacity to hold water.
Punyasiri Dassanayake, a resident of the area said agricultural lands in Mananwatte, Ebawala, Kirioruwa, Demade Oya and Walmoruwa villages have been devastated due to the heavy growth of the invasive plant.
About 300 acres in the Nalanda reservoir is covered by the plant.
A campaign launched to destroy the plant growth in the region five years ago failed.
D. M. Herath Banda said the plant had affected the living standards of nearly 2,000 families in the area.
This thorny bush grows to a height of 5 to 6 feet.
People earning a living through inland fishing cannot use nets in the reservoir as they get entangled in the thorny bushes.
Nearly 100 fisher families had been affected by this.
Attempts made by some NGOs to destroy the plant growth had proved a failure, Banda said.
