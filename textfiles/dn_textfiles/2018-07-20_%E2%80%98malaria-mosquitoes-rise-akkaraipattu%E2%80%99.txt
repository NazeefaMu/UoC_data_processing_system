‘Malaria mosquitoes on the rise in Akkaraipattu’

Malaria mosquito numbers had been on the rise in the Akkaraipattu and Alayadivembu Divisional Secretariat divisions recently, Akkaraipattu Medical Officer of Health (MOH) Dr. Farooza Nackfer said.
According to Health Department officials, malaria mosquitoes had been discovered to have spread across a range spanning one kilometer away from the Sri Lanka Transport Board’s Akkaraipattu depot office. Larvae of these mosquitoes had been recently discovered in wells, water tanks as well as buckets in the area.
The Kalmunai Malaria Control Division and public health inspectors attached to the Health Department, are currently taking measures to eradicate the mosquitoes. Sri Lanka had been declared to be free from malaria by the World Health Organisation in 2016. Malaria mosquitoes were discovered in Thalaimannar and later, in the Jaffna and Vavuniya districts as well during last year.
