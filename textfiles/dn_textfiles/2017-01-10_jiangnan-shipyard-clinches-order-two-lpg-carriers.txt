Jiangnan Shipyard clinches order for two LPG carriers

Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard has received an order to construct two fully press liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers for an Algerian shipping firm, according to data provided by VesselsValue.
Under the deals signed with Hyproc Shipping, the Chinese shipbuilder is scheduled to deliver the new ships in January and June 2018, respectively.
Featuring 14,500 dwt, the ECO vessels will have a capacity of around 13,000 m3.
Although the financial details of the agreement were not disclosed, VesselsValue data shows that each LPG carrier has a market value of over USD 26 million.
The ships will become a part of Hyproc Shipping’s fleet of five LPG carriers. The company also operates two tankers and eight liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers.
The shipowner has two LNG ships on order at South Korea’s Hyundai Heavy Industries, scheduled for delivery in January and February 2017, respectively.
