British Minister’s attempt to save stabbed police officer fails

A UK foreign minister and ex-soldier Tobias Ellwood rushed to the aid of a police officer who was stabbed in the wild terrorist attack at the British Houses of Parliament, giving the cop mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before he died.
A blood-stained Tobias Ellwood, Britain’s Minister for the Middle East, can be seen in photos performing CPR on the officer on Parliament grounds surrounded by first responders after a knife-wielding madman stabbed the cop following a chaotic series of events that left two other people dead and several wounded. Ellwood said the officer, whose identity was not immediately released, died at the scene, according to the BBC. The Tory MP attempted to give the officer mouth-to-mouth and “stemmed the blood flow by applying pressure to the wounds” as he waited for an ambulance to arrive, The Telegraph reported.
A source close to Ellwood told The Telegraph, “[He] tried to give mouth-to-mouth and stem blood flow from multiple stab wounds to the officer until the chopper and medics arrived.” Photos of Ellwood at the scene show him wearing a blue suit with blood on his hands and forehead. Ellwood, a former soldier, lost his 37-year-old brother in a terrorist attack in Bali in 2002, according to reports.
Ellwood was lauded on social media as a “hero.”
Meanwhile, the Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for an attack in London that killed three people, the Amaq propaganda agency linked to the jihadist organisation said on Thursday. The claim marks the first time the group has taken responsibility for an attack in Britain.
“The perpetrator of yesterday's attack in front of the British Parliament was a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to calls to target coalition countries,” Amaq said citing a “security source.” Britain is a member of the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria that the jihadist group has urged its followers to target with attacks.
