Cocktails and Mocktails of Marmite

They have you Chocolate mite…then they moved on to Noodle-Mite and now Unilever Sri Lanka Brand Marmite brings to those people who are adventurous in trying ‘new drinks’, their very own Marmite Cocktail and Mocktail for the ones who prefer the light drinks.

Marmite has indeed gone from one thing to another coming up with some crazy creations. Simple yet no one ever really thought about – unless you are the experimenting kind and like to try to something new every now and then.
This time, the team got together with Cinnamon Grand’s Restaurant’s & Bar Manager Namal Jayalath to come with this unique drink that will be served at their Cheers Pub and Breeze bar.
Just last month they unveiled Chocolate-Mite getting together with celebrity Chocolatier Gerard Mendis and it was well received by many Marmite fans followed by Noodle-Mite that they created together with celebrity Chef Koluu. And today they added it to something more than just hot water.
“On behalf of Cinnamon Grand Colombo, I like to thank Unilever for giving us the opportunity to create something unique with Marmite. Bianca came to me and asked ‘shall we make a cocktail out of Marmite’ to which I responded ‘Why not?’”, Namal stated at the launch. “After trying and trying making nearly 50 cocktails we finally got the right mix – which turned out become a beautiful Cocktail Mite. The base is Vodka, Grapefruit juice, Tabasco and Marmite. I must add that the saltiness of the Marmite really balances the citrus of the Grapefruit and the Tobasco gives the right spiciness and enhances one’s palette. The Mocktail Mite ”.
“We had to do a mocktail for the ones who don’t drink alcohol and I accepted the challenge. Again it was a tough journey trying it so many times. But finally I found that Fresh Orange really enhances the flavour with a little bit of Marmite”, Namal stated.

Namal also added that this cocktail can actually be taken before a meal as it really enhances the appetite. Kumar de Silva also stated that this is one drink that you can drink and drink and not feel any guilt as its absolutely healthy and totally good for your health.
“Marmite has undergone a magical metamorphosis these past few weeks in Sri Lanka. And now Marmite takes Sri Lanka’s F&B circuits with this double-barrelled experience. These are two distinctively contrasting yet complementary beverages which challenge one’s taste buds. Shaken and stirred they give the experience a fabulously adventurous dimension and are exclusively available at the Cinnamon Grand”, Unilever Sri Lanka Marmite Brand Manager Bianca de Silva said in a press release.
