A VILLAGE IN THE WAKE OF A TSUNAMI WAVE

I had the good fortune of visiting the foundation of goodness (FOG) through the kind courtesy of its founder Kushil Gunasekera .The Director- Sports Management Anura De Silva was gracious enough to take me around to various FOG sectors including the two cricket grounds, despite his busy schedule.
Isn't there a yawning gap between the rural and the urban sectors? It is prevalent even now let alone then.
To bridge this gap The Foundation of Goodness was set up by Kushil Gunasekera whose family came from Seenigama. The aim was to give holistic support to the poor rural community.
PRE TSUNAMI DAYS
In the early days, it provided the basics such as English & Computer Classes.
Sports Training to village children, upgrades to villagers’ dwellings (including water, sanitation and electricity supply) and a provided educational scholarships to poor but talented students.
Rebuilding lives: 2005-2007
When the dreaded Tsunami struck in 2004, Kushil gifted his ancestral home and garden to the village, setting up firstly an emergency response centre and then, with sponsorship from the Marylebone Cricket Club - UK developing the MCC Centre of Excellence, which is now the hub of the Foundation of Goodness work.
Woth the help of tsunami international funding the foundation of Goodness provided facilities and opportunities which have been open to all for free of charge
Holistic Community Development: 2007 onwards
With most tsunami disaster response work drawing to a close, the focus shifted to ensuring long term sustainability of the model that was originally envisaged when the Foundation was set up in 1999. The work continues to target improving the lives of rural communities across 20+ villages. Special emphasis is placed on developing children through the provision of Pre-School, education, English and Computer Classes and a significant Sports Programme in Seenigama.
Vocational training is provided for youth and adults through training courses in IT, business skills and English classes and special woman's wnterprise classes in industrial and domestic sewing cookery and beauty culture to enable them to support their families and in some cases to go into business. Medical, dental and psycho social care is also offered free of charge.
Expanding North
Since 2011, the Foundation of Goodness has expanded its development activities to the post-war North. The FOG plans to emulate the Seenigama MCC Centre of holistic development model in the North through establishing the North Learning and empowerment Institute in the future.
The FOG currently carries out development and humanitarian activities in the North via monthly consecutive visits to the North and East to carry out development and humanitarian activities including the Neethipuram Water and Sanitation Project, The Murali Harmony Cup Cricket Tournament for unity & reconciliation, sports camps, development of school grounds and libraries, micro-finance, developing a pre-school, distribution of solar power bulbs and livelihood projects.
The Foundation of Goodness has touched over 310,000 lives, via 30 sectors in over 200 villages across the island free of cost.
Figure 1 Ishari
Out of the countless number of beneficiaries, I would like to quote one example taken from the souvenir “ Rebuilding Better after disaster” published by the FOG to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Tsunami,” My case in point is Ishari; she was born in Seenigama, and was the youngest of four siblings.
She completed her GCE Ordinary Level Examination in the village school and then she moved to a school in town to complete her Advanced Level Examination.
Her fondness to work with computers attracted Ishari to join the FOG.
She followed all the IT courses the Foundation had to offer and is currently following a course on soft ware engineering. She also followed an English course offered by the Foundation and eagerly looks forward to improving her language skills..Ishara recalls how elated she was when her teacher coordinated with the Foundation to get her a new laptop for her use.
She applied for a job in data entry which handles accounts of a leading conglomerate in Sri Lanka.
She is employed in this project and her team is stationed at an office space within the foundation. Enthusiastic and ambitious, Ishara hopes to gain experience in her current field and establish herself as a software engineer.
It is interesting to note that over the course of 2011 to 2017 The Foundation of Goodness has worked relentlessly to make a difference to the lives of people in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka; helping rebuild lives and communities following years of conflict.
The Foundation of Goodness now impacts over 35, 000 beneficiaries from 200+ villages via their 30 empowerment activity sectors free of charge, every year.
