Another Indo-Sri Lanka series this year

Sri Lanka scheduled to play 13 Tests in 2018:
Sri Lanka will play India twice this year when they make a tour to India in November-December.
Currently India is involved in a series of three Tests, 5 ODIs and a one-off T20 in Sri Lanka.
The tour is expected to end on September 6 after which Sri Lanka is due to undertake a tour to UAE where they play Pakistan in a series of 2 Tests, 5 ODIs and 3 T20Is in September-October.
Following this tour will be the one to India in November-December where Sri Lanka are billed to play a similar series of three Tests, 5 ODIs and a T20I.
“The Sri Lanka tour to India has been brought forward from February next year because we are hosting the tri-nation Independence Cup during that period,” said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
“Sri Lanka was due to tour India from February end to the first week of April next year and the dates would have clashed with the Independence Cup. That’s why we requested the India Board for a change to bring the tour forward and they have agreed to it,” said De Silva.
“The dates for the Pakistan series and the Indian tour are currently being worked out,” he said.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka have a full program of Tests and ODIs for 2018 where they are billed to play 13 Tests (both home and away) in addition to a series of ODIs that includes bilateral matches as well as the Independence Cup tri-nation and Asia Cup.
