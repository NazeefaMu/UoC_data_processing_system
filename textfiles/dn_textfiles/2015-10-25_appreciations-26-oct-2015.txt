[APPRECIATIONS - (26-Oct-2015)]

Sir Cyril de Zoysa:
His foresight was laced with wisdom
Among the great lay Buddhist leaders born in Sri Lanka Sir Cyril de Zoysa indeed commands a unique place, and this, for no other reason but for the invaluable services he rendered to the Sambudddha Sasana and the Sinhala community.
His services were not confined to any one single arena. It is my conviction that the reach of the call that steered him from the past to the present and from the present to the future remained equally steady. Among the unsurpassed services he has rendered, his efforts to preserve and conserve the Kalutara Bodhi have earned a very special place.
Sir Cyril who led a purposeful life in the cause of the Sasana and the Buddhist community in Sri Lanka was born on October 26, 1896 in the village of Welitota in the Balapitiya electorate of Bentara Wallalavita Korale in the Galle District.
Sir Cyril was a heroic son of the soil, a luminary who lit up not only the District of Galle but the entirety of Sri Lanka, traditionally known as the Thunhelaya.
He had his early education at St. Thomas’ College, Matara. Soon he left for Richmond College, Galle, continued his studies there for about one year and then entered Royal College, Colombo.
He passed the Cambridge Senior Examination and entered the Ceylon Law College to seek a career in law. After successfully completing the course of studies he took leave of Law College and in 1921commenced his practice at the Police Courts, Balapitiya.
Fate had it that before long he moved from Welitota to Kalutota (Welitara to Kalutara). Here he soon earned a reputation as an honest and clever lawyer.
During this period when the British reigned supreme, there was no quarter given to any one at all to offer devotions by offering a flower or lighting a clay oil lamp at the Bodhi.
The Government Agent of Kalutara had ordered the Police should instruct the watcher at the Bodhi to chase away Buddhist pilgrims and worshipers who venture to approach the place.
When the young lawyer, Cyril de Zoysa, learnt of this, he forcibly built an unauthorised altar before the Bodhi tree to enable devotees to place flowers upon it. This service that he commenced continued unabated. He believed that the development of the precincts of the sacred Bodhi would succeed day by day because he himself receives the benign graces of the deity who has chosen this place as his abode.
He made the Kalutara Bodhi the centre from where a broad spectrum of his services radiated for the progress of the Buddha Sasana. This place that caught the eye of young Cyril has today turned out to be a beautiful place in a pleasant setting where devotees and others could freely make their offerings and otherwise enjoy its sanctity. Right now, the Kalutara Bodhi has reached the level of a place of Buddhist worship of the prime order.
Young Cyril’s aspirations did not end with a contribution towards Buddhist revival. He also aspired to bring about community development.
He realised that social service cannot be performed with the income earned by practising the law alone. He therefore started a bus service called ‘Swarnapali’ bus service, which was later transformed into the ‘South Western Bus Company’. Buses of this company plied right up to the Southern end of the Western Province and back. This saw nothing but success day by day. He appealed to the passengers in his buses to drop a coin at the Kalutara Bodhi.
By this means he hoped he could instil a sense of piety and devotion in their minds and also perhaps to command community support for the maintenance and preservation of the Bodhi. He provided a prime service to the community and ploughed back the income towards the progress of the Buddha Sasana and towards community service.
As with the Buddha’s exhortation Dhammo Have Rakhathi Dhamma Chari (those who live by the Dhamma are protected by the Dhamma), before long, governing authorities of the land, the Sangha and various leaders of the business world were impressed by him.
All that he touched turned to gold was the adage that came to be associated with him. Many were those that saw him and continued to see him as a rare being with a golden heart full of the twin qualities of human kindness and benevolence – karuna and metta.
He at no time sought after honour, respect or high office but embodiments of these concepts sought him out.
Sir Cyril was a Buddha-aspirant or Bodhisattva as it were, who dedicated his life, his wealth, his time, labour and wisdom to the cause of the nation, governance and the Sasana.
His services were invaluable when he worked as a member, office bearer or chairman or president of organisation such as the Scout Movement, Sinhala Sports Club, Kalutara Town Club, Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT), National Council of the Blind and the Deaf, Child Protection Association, Law Society, Mahabodhi Society, Young Men’s Buddhist Association (YMBA), Colombo and other such organizations.
Sir Cyril de Zoysa’s prime resolution was to ensure that every programme initiated by him was developed and sustained, thereby providing a broad service to society. This, he achieved to the last letter. Among the many memorable services rendered by him, two that may be cited as examples are the leadership taken to construct a hall for the Young Men’s Buddhist Association in Colombo Fort and for the Bar Association.
He founded Kalutara Vidyalaya and Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya to help meet the educational needs of the children of the nation. The benefits that accrued to the region are immeasurable. Centred round these schools many children received their education and reached the highest echelons of society. It is an undisputed fact that this was the result of Sir Cyril’s foresight.
He made a vast contribution towards the restoration of the Kiri Vehera in Kataragama by taking the leadership in this matter as well.
So has it been in the matter of the development of Buddhist temples such as the Bellanvila Raja Maha Viharaya, Kuppiyawatta Jayasekhararamaya, Bamabalapitiya Vajiraramaya and the Kaluvamodera Kadarada Viharaya.
When Prime Minister Bandaranaike’s government came into power in 1956 bus services were nationalised by 1958. On this occasion he was magnanimous enough to replace worn-out tyres of the buses belonging to the South Western Bus Company with new ones, just before the take-over.
This act too is an example of his intentions of rendering service to the community. Thus Sir Cyril de Zoysa may be seen as one who prized selflessness over selfishness.
His foresight was laced with wisdom. This is evident in his act of setting up a Trust Fund with the initial contribution of Rs. 200 million. His vision was the commitment of the interest accruing from this Fund towards the furtherance of the Buddha Sasana.
Many of Sir Cyril’s aspirations were fulfilled during his lifetime.It is praiseworthy that the Kalutara Bodhi Trust continues to fulfill all these in a number of fields, all calculated towards the progress of the community and the sustenance of the Buddha Sasana. Contribution towards the restoration of the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) when it was destroyed by a terrorist attack, inauguration of the Bodhignana Library, the grant of scholarships to Bhikkus who follow courses of study in Oriental Languages, provision of shelter for those displaced in the tsunami, setting up a Fund to release cattle from slaughter, the construction and maintenance of an Aramaya or residence, near the Kalutara Urban Council, for Buddhist nuns, the construction and maintenance of a Ward dedicated to Bhikkhus, in the Nagoda Hospital, conduct of English Language Teaching (ELT) programmes, free of charge, in Dhamma schools, provision of alms food and other facilities to those who observe the eight or 10 precepts on scheduled days are among such services that the Kalutara Bodhi Trust provides.
The name of Sir Cyril de Zoysa who provided such noble service remains immortal.
May Sir Cyril de Zoysa attain the peace of Nibbana.

Ana Senevirathne:
He brought vision and meaning to Police Force
I was the Headquarter Inspector of Police at Nittambuwa in 1979 when I received a message from the Director / Personnel at Police Headquarter Douglas Ranmuthugala, then Senior Superintendent of Police that IGP Ana Senevirathne wanted me to meet him the following day at his office.
Ranmuthugla informed me that that the IGP had selected me, on his recommendation, to take over the Vavuniya Police Station as HQI for special reasons, which the IGP would explain when I meet him in his office at Police Headquarters.
I was rather apprehensive of this message received from Ranmuthugala as I knew that Ana Senevirathne was a very strict disciplinarian and steadfast in his decisions. On my arrival at the Police Headquarters, I was produced before the IGP by Ranmuthugla. The IGP briefed me on the importance of Vavuniya area explaining the circumstances which led to the murder of a team of CID officers led by Inspector Bastianpillai at Madu Road between Mannar and Vavuniya in April 1978.
He further explained that a permanent Army camp would to be established at Iratteperiyakulam closer to the Vavuniya Airbase towards Medavachchiya as a buffer to prevent any terrorist infiltrations or attacks on villages up to Anuradhapura.
The IGP had also recommended that the Police Farm at Vavuniya to be taken over for the proposed Army Camp, which is now a permanent Army camp.
After the briefing , he told me that he would be visiting Vavuniya within a month. On February 10, 1979, I reported at the Vavuniya Police Station as the Headquarters Inspector of Police. Exactly within a month, I received a personal message from IGP Ana Senevirathne about his visit to Vavuniya with strict instructions only to inform the SP Division.
He arrived at the Vavuniya police station at about 5.30 hrs from Anuradhapura and took me and the SP Division in his jeep to a hamlet called Bogaswewa bordering Padaviya. In fact, he was driving the jeep on the gravel road till we reached this hamlet with an abandoned small tank.
There were only five families living around the tank. He walked around the tank and rested at one small house of which walls made of wattle and daub, roof thatched with iluk.
He then explained the reason for his visit to this place located between Padaviya and Vavuniya. His proposal to the then government was to renovate the tank and the Army to construct a road from Padaviya to Vavuniya as a barrier to provide security to the villages, particularly to Weli Oya and Padaviya areas.
However, this proposal could not be implemented due to political protests with complaints that the government was planning to colonise the area.
Ana Senevirathne had a thorough knowledge of the geography of police areas in the North and East when he was the DIG, Northern range.
With his experience as the Head of Intelligence, then the Special Branch, he properly assessed the northern terrorist problem brewing in the north and east. I explained the facts to assert that Ana Senevirathne was a leader of clear vision.
During the 1971 JVP insurrection, he was the Superintendent of Police in charge of the Kegalle Division which was a hot bed of insurgency. He handled the situation with an indomitable spirit preventing attacks on police stations. After the situation was brought under control in the country with the assistance of the Army , he was transferred to police headquarters, on the recommendations of then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, to handle the rehabilitation work of the arrested insurgents and other related duties.
As IGP, he personally knew the officers-in-charge of important police stations in the island and sometimes he contacted the OIC directly to ascertain facts on important incidents /cases reported to the police. In the city of Colombo, he made an order for all OICs of police stations to be on peak hour duty to ensure that traffic was controlled properly without any delays or traffic jams.
This order kept all OICs aware of traffic flaws in their respective areas and to maintain an efficient traffic control plans
The IGP took various routes to go to the Police Headquarters to ensure that there were no rush hour traffic snarls and blocks.
In fact, all senior officers too patrolled their districts and divisions supervising the OICC during this period.
Being an officer with fierce commitment to his profession and later as Inspector General of Police, he brought vision and meaning to the Police Force. The delight and spirit he derived from his profession was his driving force in his quest to make the Police Force a practical outfit and restore some lost pride and prestige.
Once he told me the best District he served was Tangalle and the best IGP under whom he worked was Eleric Abeygoonawardane. He was indeed a giant of our times, indomitable in courage, steadfast in purpose, total in commitment , clear sighted in vision, irreproachable in character and simple in manner. My clearest memory of him as a Senior Officer was his sharp and probing mind. He was an epitome of gentility who was ever unassuming and unpretentious.
In recognition of his professionalism and vast contribution to the Police Force and the country, after his retirement he was appointed by the government as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia. He was also appointed as the member of the Public Service Commission (PSC) on two occasions and he served as a member for many years.
Ananda Seneviratne was born on April 20, 1927 and passed away on September 26, 2015 after a brief illness. Ana Seneviratne was born to Irwin and Irene Seneviratne from Sapugaskanda, Heiyanthuduwa in Gampaha District.
He was educated at Royal College, Colombo from 1938 to 1946. He entered the then University of Ceylon, Colombo and completed his LLB (Hons) Degree.
After graduating from University, Seneviratne joined the Police Force in 1951 as a probationary Assistant Superintendent of Police and he was appointed as the Inspector General of Police in 1978.
He married Krishna Weeratunga from Matara. His brother-in-law was General Tissa Weeratunga, former Commander of the Army.
In the midst of life’s challenges and upheavals, my close association with Ana Senevirathne, who was my mentor, will ever remain as a shining memory.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana !

Pat Manikkavasagan :
He was a friend, an asset
I was bewildered to read the obituary notice of my esteemed senior colleague Pat Manikkavasagan at Bank of Ceylon. Immediately to ease my anguish I informed another senior close friend Terrence Hettiarachchi in Sri Lanka.
Pat as everyone addressed, was a senior colleague of mine whom I got the opportunity to work initially at Bank of Ceylon Hulftsdorp branch when he was a staff assistant in 1976. I observed that his commitment for work was excellent which inspired others.
His leadership and pioneering philosophical qualities were appreciated by all. He possessed a sturdy personality. His wisdom was innovative. The domination of the English language was supreme. On any given theme even apart from routine matters other than banking, he took only a few seconds to sketch a letter.
His vocabulary was very extensive and he knew the meaning of all English words in an English dictionary. Until 40 years later, I have yet to meet a person who had such a philosophical and passionate familiarity of the English language.
He was simply an asset to the institution. He taught us unique leadership behaviour and had the aptitude to acquire the best out of subordinates and the approach how to work as a cohesive consistent unit.
Pat led always by example. This strategy made him as an indispensable employee to the prestigious banking tradition as the maximum yield was extracted from each employee who were beneath his purview.
It was a pleasure to work with him as he obsessed an incredible wisdom of humour. Hence all subordinates rendered their unsurpassed aptitude as they felt least exhausted working under him.
This facilitated to enhance the efficiency projected of any individual which was an authentic boost to the institution. He was a son of a station master who had to change schools frequently when his father was transferred to various places.
He finally studied at St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena where he excelled in English language. After completing his studies he successfully completed a proficient course in ‘Journalism'. He worked as a sub-editor in a reputed institution for a short period before opting to join Bank of Ceylon in 1953 when he was 22 years.
His full name is Selvam Manikkavasan although popularly known as ‘Pat’.
He retired from the bank’s service at 55 in 1986 and since he lived at his ancestral home BRAEMAR, Sri Jayanthi Mawatha in Wattala.
His premature retirement in particular was as he was not eager to get promoted and to be transferred to outstations branches.
He was the only bachelor of a family of seven. After retirement he had the habit of reading all English newspapers which were delivered to him daily.
Whenever I wanted to know the significance of an English word instead of referring to a dictionary I used to telephone Pat. I was instantly provided the meaning.
He once told me that he knew every meaning of words in the dictionary. This could be perhaps a Guinness record. He also requested me to publish his appreciation after his death.
He used to visit the YMCA Colombo daily after retirement where he had many friends. His death was abrupt and peaceful.
Pat lived a healthy and cheerful life.
His death is a loss to all his friends. The members of the YMCA would miss his fluent oratory at the YMCA.
We wish him eternal rest.
