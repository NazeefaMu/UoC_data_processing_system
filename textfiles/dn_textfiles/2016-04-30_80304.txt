Du Plessis out of IPL with broken finger

NEW DELHI, THURSDAY: South African batsman Faf du Plessis was Thursday ruled out of the Indian Premier League with a broken finger, raising concerns about his availability for the upcoming tour of the West Indies.
Du Plessis was the second-highest run-getter for his IPL side Rising Pune Supergiants before getting injured in his sixth game of the season on Tuesday.
“And so my ipl tournament unfortunately comes to an end. Broken finger and out for 6 weeks. Thanks India and @RPSupergiants. It's been fun,” the Proteas Twenty20 skipper wrote on his twitter handle. If Du Plessis takes six weeks to recover from his injury then he might miss the start of the West Indies tri-series starting June 3, which also involves Australia. Incidentally it is Australian batsman Usman Khawaja who has been named as his replacement in the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side. AFP
