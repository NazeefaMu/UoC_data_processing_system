COURT STRICTURES ON IUSF PROTEST

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday issued an order preventing the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) from causing public nuisance or entering government institutions.
However, the Magistrate maintained that protesters have no obstacle to engage in a peaceful protest without causing disturbances to the traffic and public peace.
The Magistrate observed that police can take action in terms of section 95 and 106 of the Criminal Procedure Code, if protesters behaved in a violent manner.
The Magistrate made this order following a request made by Colombo Fort Police. In response to a query made by the Magistrate, police told court that government has allocated an area adjacent to the Kollupitiya railway station to carry peaceful protests.
The Fort police informed court that the protest campaign was organised by the IUSF Convener Lahiru Chathuranga Weerasekara, Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Rayan Jayalath and Inter University Bhikkhu Federation (IUBF) acting Convener Rathkarawwe Jinarathana Thera.
The Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF) staged a protest in Colombo yesterday against the government’s move to convert the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) into the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT).
