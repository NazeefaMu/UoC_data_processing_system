‘Drought relief for Anuradhapura families will continue’

As drought conditions prevail within the Anuradhapura district, the 137,000 affected families would continue to receive relief packages worth Rs. 5,000, every month, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake said.
He added that even though the area is experiencing a few scattered showers, they would provide the families with aid until the drought improves.
Since August, 2017, to date, the Disaster Management Ministry had spent Rs. 200 million for providing relief to such affected families within the Anuradhapura district.
In addition, the government had also taken steps to identify those who work in the state and private sectors, so that they could be provided with relief. Divisional Secretaries had also been instructed to provide dry rations and drinking water to all families that meet the required criteria.
According to initial calculations, 159,000 families had qualified for relief, whereas today, that number has decreased to 137,000 families.
Those most affected are residents of the Medawachchiya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Kebithigollawa, Vilachchiya, Thanththirimale and Rambewa areas.
In addition to the said relief packages, 300 metric tonnes of rice donated by the Myanmar government is expected to be distributed in the Padaviya, Maha Vilachchiya and Rambewa Divisional Secretariat divisions.
Wanninayake said that each family would receive 25 kg of rice. Prior to this, the government had distributed 50 kg of rice each to 58,000 families. It had been a donation from the Pakistani government.
In Maha Vilachchiya, Nochchiyagama and Thirappane, the government had also taken steps to provide up to 20,000 residents with drinking water, Wanninayake added.
