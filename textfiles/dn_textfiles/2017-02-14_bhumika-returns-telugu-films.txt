Bhumika returns to Telugu films

Popular actress Bhumika Chawla is all set for a comeback to Telugu, but not as the female lead. According to a source, the actress is all set to play a key role in a film that stars Nani, directed by Venu Sree Raam.
“She is playing an important role as sister to Nani’s character in the film,” says the source.
Initially, the actress wasn’t keen on the role, but when the director narrated the script to her, she liked it and agreed to do it. “The makers are also planning to rope in a popular actor to play her husband,” added the source.
Bhumika was last seen in the film Laddu Babu with Allari Naresh, which was a disaster. Post that, though she had not signed any Telugu films, she did work on a couple of Hindi films. “This is like a comeback for the actress and she is open to do more character roles,” added the source. TNN
