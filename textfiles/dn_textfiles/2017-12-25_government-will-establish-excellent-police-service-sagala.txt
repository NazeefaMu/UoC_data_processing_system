Government will establish excellent police service: Sagala

The government’s objective is to establish an excellent and well-disciplined police service and enable people to lead their lives fairly and lawfully. The Police Service was able to regain its image of excellence with the advent of the ‘Yahapalana’ government,” Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Aluvihare grounds of the Kalutara Police Training School to mark the passing out parade of 476 police trainees including 275 Tamil male constables and seven woman constables on December 22.
Minister Ratnayake said he was honoured to attend the parade since it included policemen and women from the three main communities.
“It was noteworthy to see village children of two rival camps who were at war joining hands to protect the country and people in a spirit of togetherness,” the Minister said.
He said the Police in Sri Lanka had a 151-year-old history.
“The period of war had been the most difficult and demanding. Officers and men had to face various difficulties in the period. They were away from their homes and loved ones for many years. Exigencies of service cut the training period for new recruits. Police officers could not get their due transfers,” the Minister said.
“Now all that were resolved and they were able to churn out a well trained police outfit with the advent of the Yahapalana government,” the Minister said.
He said the Police Commission effected a fair and scrupulous transfer scheme. “The government had streamlined police welfare activities and refurbished police barracks and resolved issues regarding quarters of the married police personnel. Cabinet approval were obtained to build 193 houses in Habaraduwa,” the Minister said.
He said the Police Hospital would be developed and equipped and an insurance scheme would be provided for constable drivers. “Salaries of the police personnel were increased by 41 percent for a start,” the Minister said.
