Citrus Waskaduwa celebrates World Tourism Day 2015

World Tourism Day is celebrated on September 27 every year. The date has a special significance as it was chosen to mark the anniversary of the day when the statutes of the United Nations World Tourism Organization were adopted in 1970. This is considered a major milestone in the history of global tourism. The World Tourism Day is observed to create global awareness about the importance of tourism and its impact on society in various fields. The theme of World Tourism Day 2015 was “one billion tourists, one billion opportunities”.

Citrus Waskaduwa celebrated World Tourism Day 2015 on September 25 by conducting an awareness programme for school children. Seventy five Advanced Level students and ten teachers from Pothupitiya Maha Vidyalaya, Thissa Central Wadduwa, Kaluthara Vidyalaya, Holy Family Convent Kaluthara and Balika Vidyalaya Kaluthara participated in the day-long programme held at the hotel.
The goal of the Citrus Waskaduwa World Tourism Day programme was to make young adults more aware of the industry and show them the prospects that exist in the industry for a future career. The main activities for the day included building awareness on various aspects of the hotel industry and the overall operation of a five star hotel.

The programme began with the accurate and appropriate guidance for the children in terms of career paths in the hospitality industry, career expectations, achievements as well as highlighting the skills and opportunities to follow a lifelong fulfilling career.
The students were also directed through the operations of the hotel, including Front Office Operations, Housekeeping, Food & Beverage, Banquets, Finance & Accounting, Human Resources, Security and Administration.

To add in a bit of health awareness for the children, Executive Chef Buddhika Ranjeewa Dayananda highlighted the importance of a healthy and balanced meal required to develop physical and mental needs of a student, whilst demonstrating ways and means of how they can prepare such meals on their own.
“We identified that students don’t often get the practical experience which helps them in securing employment but most importantly of all, helps them to ascertain in which area of the industry they’d like to pursue a career. It is also important that we continue to promote hospitality as a great career option, for the future of tourism lies solely in the hands of the young ones. Therefore, it is imperative that we not only bring about awareness to them, but also stretch out our hands and give them all the support they need to be a part of this growing industry”, Citrus Waskaduwa General Manager Palaka Perera said.

Prior to this programme, on September 21 and 23, Palaka Perera along with the staff of the Hotel engaged in an environmental cleanup including a complete cleanup of the beach. Deputy General Manager Chef Sudusinghe stressed on the importance of environmental sustainability in the operation of a hotel.
“The very essence of tourism is based on a clean and natural environment. The hotel industry represents one of the major pillars of travel and tourism, and hotel facilities have been documented as possessing a negative impact on the environment. It is therefore crucial to induce a more environmentally sound development, operation and performance in this sector. As leaders of this sector, Citrus Waskaduwa strongly believes in the propagation of green tourism and the sustainable future of the sector”, he stated.
