SLFP supporter in village will never raise placard of Darley Road: GL

The SLFP supporter in the village will never raise the placard of Darley Road, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
Prof. Peiris addressing a gathering at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella said the SLFP supporter in the village had no affinity or loyalty towards the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
“For the last two years, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has been fighting against the delay in the Local Government elections," he said. The May Day Rally of the Joint Opposition on Monday was the best ‘test of public opinion, he said.
“We will never pick up the SLFP board and neither will we join them. The Joint Opposition will join hands with all parties to form a new alliance to form a government under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa. This is the need of the hour," he said.
Prof. Peiris said they were working fast to achieve the goal of forming a Rajapaksa government once again.
