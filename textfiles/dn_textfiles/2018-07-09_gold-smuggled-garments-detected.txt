Gold smuggled with garments detected

Modera Police has detected gold biscuits weighing around a kilogram worth over Rs 10 million into custody from a house at Rajamalwatte area in Modera following a search operation carried out on a tip-off last evening.
A businessman, who imports apparels from Singapore and India, was taken into custody in connection with this racket. Police believe that the suspect may have smuggled the gold biscuits under the guise of importing garments.
