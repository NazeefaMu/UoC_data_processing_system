‘Corruption of previous regime  aggravated economy’

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Chamal Rajapaksa said corruption, waste and theft committed during the previous regime has aggravated the economy.
During the previous regime, trafficking in weapons and illicit drugs became grave threats to the people. Expenditure on projects that did not bring any financial dividends was the reason that the country was saddled with an enormous debt burden, Minister Rajapaksa said, speaking at a meeting in Tissamaharama.
A fully-fledged general hospital with 900 beds will be opened at the earliest possible date. The hospital was funded by the Netherlands and has remained unopened for a few years. While there is an acute shortage of beds and medical facilities, the 900-bed general hospital still remains unopened, he said.
The Minister said certain sectors tried to highlight Sri Lanka as an undemocratic country to the world. President Maithripala Sirisena had appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister to shoulder the legacy of the problems of the Ranil Wickremesinghe regime, and forge ahead with development projects.
“We must condemn the imprisonment of war heroes and monks without valid reason,” the Health Minister said.
