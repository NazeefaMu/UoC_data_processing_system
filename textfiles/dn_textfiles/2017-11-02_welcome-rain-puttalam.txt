Welcome rain for Puttalam

After experiencing a heavy drought for many months, a welcome rainfall was experienced in Puttalam and nearby places on October 31.
The drought that was experienced in the past few months affected the crops as well as animals that had to undergo tremendous difficulty due to lack of drinking water.
Animals walking across the villages hunting for drinking water were a pathetic sight that was witnessed during the past few months.
But since October 31, the rainfall that had been experienced in Puttalam and nearby areas has caused difficulties to carry on daily village affairs outdoors.
Puttalam business centres and street vendors have been immensely inconvenienced by the heavy downpours.
