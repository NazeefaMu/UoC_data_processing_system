Children’s Day treat

Majestic Cineplex has yet another surprise for Children’s Day with the premiering of ‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’ which began screening from September 30. It is a movie intended to challenge the idea that everything has already been discovered, that the world has been completely stripped of its wonder.
It takes the audience to another world where it transcends the bounds of human possibility, imagination and dreams. Magic, myth, wonder, escapism and the extraordinary becomes a reality in this fantasy world.
‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’ in 3D is screening at Majestic Cineplex 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, Fri/Sat 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex 1.30 pm 4.30 pm 7.30 pm Fri/Sat 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun 10.30 am.
