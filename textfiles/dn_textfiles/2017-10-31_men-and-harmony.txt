Of men and harmony

Their music is like Cupid’s well directed arrow! C Plus is one of the most ‘in demand’ bands when it comes to weddings. C Plus cover all types of weddings with music ranging from classical to pop. Their umbrella covers Jazz and the blues, 70’s and 80’s and old country stuff. Their music is full of good feelings and positivity.
They do rock as well, but are known mostly as a band that specializes in weddings. Melodies features C Plus the quintessential wedding band and speaks to band leader Chandumal Fernando.
“Maintaining a good level of music is definitely on the top of our priority list in addition to making a good income. Both are equally important since obviously we need to support ourselves in life. So we do events, weddings, dinner dances and parties,” said Fernando.
Fernando started his career in the choir being a catholic. He spent 25 years in hallowed surroundings. From a very young age he loved music. It is food for his soul. It is the most important part of his life and gives his life powerful meaning. By profession he is an engineer.
“Our originals definitely contain a message. When it comes to love, physical appearances are not important. Love is love. It is a feeling. So let it be a feeling. Music is an international language that people understand. It is universal. It is the melody and the words combined, that gives a very different meaning than words simply spoken,” stated Fernando.
Though they do cover versions of Western Music, C Plus have put out three original singles – ‘Kelle’, "Oba Ha Ya wela" and "Mal Dunen" and are planning to release a Christmas Song at the end of this year. When the band started out, it was not very easy, but 2014, 2015 and 2016 were very good years. This year too was a good year.
The predominant theme of C Plus is love. But the love they speak about cannot be fully expressed by words no matter how wonderful words can be! Which is why music can be a different medium to convey this concept of love. They have been influenced by the 70’s and 80’s bands like Queen. That music inspires them. They love Bruno Mars and Michael Buble.
“As a band even though we do a lot of English songs we understand the value of doing Sinhala songs as well. Then we can connect with the people. We have a plan to do one English original next year. When we talk about love we often think that the lady is pursued because of her physical beauty. That is the general idea. But the message we want to give is, to look at love as something that runs deeper. That is a connection between two souls. It has a deeper meaning. Music is the perfect medium to express this love,” explained Fernando.
Fernando loves artistes such as Rookantha Gunathilake, Sunil Shantha, Sunil Perera, Lionel Richie, Elton John and Enrique Iglesias.
“I would advise a guy or a girl who wants to enter the music industry, to do quality music and listen to good music. You have to study music. A proper study of music is important. You have to understand music and do it in a proper way. Music always gives my life meaning. Because of music I understand so many things about life. I learnt of men and of harmony. It is a part of our lives. I don’t think we can live without music, I and my band members. Music keeps us going and the last three years have been amazing,” pointed out Fernando.
Fernando pointed out that 31st night is always a big day! Foreigners dance to their music even though they do not know the words! They understand the melody, even though they do not understand the language.
They enjoy every bit of it.
“Music speaks to each and every person. Everybody loves it. People all get together. When we play at 31st night, all the people local and foreign come together and enjoy it,” summed up Fernando.
