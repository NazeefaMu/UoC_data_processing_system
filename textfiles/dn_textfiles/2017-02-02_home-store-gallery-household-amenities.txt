But, now, no longer, as the Home Store Gallery, located at S.D.S. Jayasinghe Mawatha, Kohuwala is just the right place to help you find contemporary household amenities at reasonable prices.
Home Store Gallery is a little showroom that had catered to the supply of beautifully designed wallpaper to clients who seek that added touch of luxury to their homes.
