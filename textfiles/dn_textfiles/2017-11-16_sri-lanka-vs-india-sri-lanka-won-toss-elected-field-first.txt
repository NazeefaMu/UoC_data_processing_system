Sri Lanka vs. India: Sri Lanka won the toss, elected to field first

 
The Sri Lankan team won the toss and elected to field first in the first test match against India at the Eden Garden grounds in Kolkata, a short while ago.
After today’s test match, two more test matches, three ODI and three more T20 will follow.
Today’s match was scheduled to begin at 9.30 a.m. but was suspended due to rains.
