Schokman & Samerawickreme launch first online live auction portal

Well-known Sri Lanka’s pioneering Chartered Auctioneers Schokman & Samerawickreme launched their first online live auction portal.
The country’s first live auction site via its unique auction portal, www.shopandselllanka.lk to go live by August, will revolutionise the auction industry in Sri Lanka where clients can view a wide gamut of products from motor vehicles to furniture, antiques, jewellery, art and even real estate, bidding live in real time. Overseas buyers too would be able to make purchases.
Schokman & Samerawickreme who celebrate 125 years in auctioneering, realting and valuing was also the first to obtain ISO certification in auctioneering, valuation and real estate in South Asia and the Pacific. The century plus company also has partnerships etched with international real estate greats Savills Australia and Cushman & Wakefield. The 125-year journey began when a planter in Hatton met Shirley Samerawickreme, the Sales Manager at Tuckers/Millers at the horse races in Nuwara Eliya, fuelling a common fascination for auctioneering.
Celebrating the milestone, the third generation of the Samerawickremes, grandsons of Edwin De Alwis Samerawickreme and Shirley Samerawickreme’s sons, Navinda and Anuja, have taken the business into the 21st century.
“The business was built on a mutual fascination for auctioneering between my grandfather and Schokman, whose partnership formed the foundation for the bedrock of auctioneering in Sri Lanka,” stated Managing Partner Navinda Samerawickreme.
“This wasn’t simply auctioneering, but a business that spoke of trust, high quality and strong relationship building.”
Edwin’s sons, Lloyd, Derrick and Carl possessed the vision to expand the business from Kandy, where the Head Office was, into Colombo.
As Navinda recalls, it was Shirley Samerawickreme who was the visionary. “Our father was a master auctioneer, born to his craft. Since his entry into the business in 1955, his half century in the trade ensured that the business will become accessible more geographically.”
The Auction House now has the addition of a flagship auction sales facility in Colombo 5, where clients can either walk in and purchase items or engage in an auction according to preference.
“Our specialty now covers a wide gamut of fields including parate auctioneering and valuations. Being the most experienced and qualified in the market, we have now firmly etched ourselves as the preferred auctioneer among the diplomatic corps, NGOs, individuals and the private sector. This includes the valuation of both movable and immovable property.”
“Our strength in vehicle auctions is well evidenced in the fact that we conduct at least 100 auctions annually for about 300 to 400 vehicles monthly,” said Partner/Chief Executive Officer Anuja Samerawickreme.
