Japanese Defence Minister visits Colombo harbour

Visiting Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera yesterday inspected the operations at the Colombo harbour.
This is the first time in history that a Japanese Defence Minister visited the Colombo harbour.
The visiting Defence Minister was impressed with the progress achieved by the Colombo harbour. Attention was paid to enhancing maritime development cooperation between the harbours of the two countries.
