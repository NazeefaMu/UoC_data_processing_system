THE RIDDLE OF AFTERLIFE
One Niel Perera has inquired whether those who claim to be Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists go their separate ways after death. The Christians believe in God guiding or steering their destinies. So are the Muslims. Buddhists and Hindus believe in Karma which also guides and steers their destinies based on how they had lived in previous births. Therefore, does not God, Allah and Karma perform the same task in guiding us in this life? If so, all of us, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus tread the same path, though identified separately in this world, to reach the so called Heaven or Nirvana?
If only this is understood, there would be inter-religious harmony, instead of competing religious doctrines shattering our world into separate religious communities. These divisions have become a continuous source of human conflicts.
