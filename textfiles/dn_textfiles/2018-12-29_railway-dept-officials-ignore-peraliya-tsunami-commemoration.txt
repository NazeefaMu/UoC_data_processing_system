Railway Dept officials ignore Peraliya tsunami commemoration

A gathering at a tsunami commemoration in Peraliya was displeased over the absence of any officer from the Railway Department at the event.
The event was organized under the patronage of Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva along with Galle Government Agent Somaratne Vidanapathirana, Assistant Government Agent Kamal Ranasinha and Senor DIG Anuruddha Bandara Hakmana. A chair was reserved for the Railway General Manager as well but he was absent, participants said.
A train has arrived on time to the location but none had come for the commemoration from the Railway Department, they said.
President of the memorial committee A.J. Preethi Ruwan Kumara said a decorated train had arrived with senior officials from the department to each tsunami commemoration so far. “We invited the department officials this time as well, but they had discarded our invitation. We expressed our displeasure in this regard on behalf of the people in Peraliya,” he said.
He said he asked Ambalangoda Railway Station Master a clarification in this regard but he denied a comment.
