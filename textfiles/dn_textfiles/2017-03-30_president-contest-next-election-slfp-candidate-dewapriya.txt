President to contest next election as SLFP candidate: Dewapriya

President Maithripala Sirisena will contest the next Presidential election as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Presidential candidate, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said.
He added that the decision to nominate President Sirisena as the Presidential Candidate at the 2020 Presidential election
will be taken at the Central Committee and the Executive Committee meetings of the SLFP in due course.
He said so while addressing the media at the Western Provincial Council complex in Colombo yesterday. When Chief Minister Devapriya was noticed by media that President Sirisena has said that he would not contest the next Presidential election, he said that the President made that statement when contesting the last Presidential election as the common candidate.But,he will contest the next Presidential Election as the SLFP candidate.
He further said that Executive Presidency should not be abolished when a people-friendly leader like Maithripala Sirisena holds the post.
“Eventhough there are various comments on the Hambantota part, no decision has yet been taken relating to the Hambantota port,” he said.
“The President said when the Chief Ministers met him recently, that no decision on the port has been taken. The discussion on the Hambantota port is being carried out but a final decision has not yet been taken yet. The best option, which benefits both the country and the port will be taken,” he said.
The Chief Minister said that the President’s attention is also been drawn on a Cabinet reshuffle. “The Cabinet reshuffle will probably be carried out prior to May Day,” he said.
“At the meeting we had with the President, he (the President) said that his recent visit to Russia was successful and fruitful. Four MOUs were signed between the two countries,” he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted a Sri Lankan sword as a sign of friendship during President Sirisena’s state visit. The United Kingdom should also take measures to hand over thousands of valuable items taken to their country from Sri Lanka during the Colonial rule.
Dewapriya added that at the discussion the President highlighted that he has no intension of postponing any election. The President has instructed the relevant parties to hold the Local Government election as soon as possible. The Provincial Council Election will also be held at the due time, upon the completion of the term.
Speaking to media Devapriya said that SLFP has taken measures to hold the “Youth Convention” which has been scheduled to be held on April 2 and the May Day Rally, which held at Gatambe, Kandy in a grand scale with a participation of thousands of people.
The Chief Minister speaking on big match fever said that Police should take sternaction against students who behave in an unruly manner during big matches.
“The behavior of these students cannot be tolerated,” he said.
Speaking about Pannipitiya Dharmapala school issue, he said that a decision on school education is taken by education administrators and not by parents or students. The parents together with students of the college did not allow the qualified and selected Principal to assume duties.
“This situation has a bad impact on the country’s education. There is a hidden conspiracy against Buddhist schools,” Devapriya noted.
