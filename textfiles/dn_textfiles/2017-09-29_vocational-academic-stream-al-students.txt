Vocational academic stream for A/L students

The Education Ministry will introduce its novel pilot project of vocational academic stream for the students who wish to follow the stream from October, 2017.
The ministry will launch the new stream aiming 5,000 students at 42 selected schools countrywide covering 25 administrative districts of the country.
Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister AkilaViraj Kariyawasam told the Daily News that the students who complete the vocational academic stream will have NVQ 04 qualifications.
They can get lucrative jobs locally and globally as there is an increasing demand for skilled and professionally – qualified technologists and technicians. A technologist can earn around Rs. 350,000 monthly, the minister said.
