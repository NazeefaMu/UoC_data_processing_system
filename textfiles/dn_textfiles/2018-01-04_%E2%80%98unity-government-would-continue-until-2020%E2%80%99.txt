‘Unity government would continue until 2020’

Co-cabinet Spokesperson Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said both SLFP and UNP leaders have expressed that the unity government would continue until 2020.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has also said that the UNP would contest separately by 2020 and will decide later on the unity or separation of the two parties.
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the SLFP would face the local government polls separately, and the party’s decision would take after the election.
“We would not allow any injustice to come to our party members or supporters, through any of these decisions,” he added.
