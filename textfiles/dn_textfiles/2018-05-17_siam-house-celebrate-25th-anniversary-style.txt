Siam House to celebrate 25th anniversary in style

Colombo's Siam House is set to celebrate 25 years of authentic Thai food in grand style with a week-long Thai food festival from May 24 to 31 featuring delicacies from the four regions of Thailand along with authentic street food. A team of Thai Chefs will come down to Sri Lanka especially to cater for the food festival, which will take the opportunity to showcase Thailand’s diverse culinary delights including dishes that are not regularly served at Siam House.
The 25th anniversary celebrations will officially commence with a gala event on May 23 and Siam House will issue a special commemorative postage stamp to mark the milestone event.
“In 1993 we were the first restaurant to introduce Thai cuisine to Sri Lanka. We were a revolutionary restaurant at the time as we brought down our whole production team from Thailand, headed by a Thai Executive Chef. To this date, Siam House enjoys unparalleled reputation for the authenticity of cuisine it offers as well as the consistency and standards we uphold. Our commitment to consistency and upholding our high standards has been the key to our success. We look forward to the next 25 years, energized and ready to serve great Thai cuisine to generations of Sri Lankan diners to come,'' states Chairman, Benjarong (Pvt) Ltd Lionel Fernando in a press release.
The famous authenticity of Siam House Thai food is derived from the professional expertise the place possesses as well as their use of only authentic Thai ingredients. To this end,Siam House imports all ingredients directly from Thailand and they still prepare their famous curry pastes in-house using fresh ingredients.
Siam House is located at 17, Melbourne Avenue, Colombo 4 and is open 7 days a week from 11 am to 11 pm.
