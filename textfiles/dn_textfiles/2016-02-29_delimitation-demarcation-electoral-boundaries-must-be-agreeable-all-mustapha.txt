Delimitation, demarcation of electoral boundaries must be agreeable to all - Mustapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha yesterday said he has been instructed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the delimitation and demarcation of electoral boundaries in Local Government wards must be agreeable to all.
Minister Mustapha said this on being asked why that the process of demarcating electoral boundaries seemed to be getting all that late and the local poll that he said would be held in June, this year is unlikely to be held this year.
"I said as the minister handling the subject that the process of demarcation of boundaries would be completed and the Local Government election would be held in June.
But, there are certain issues that need to be agreed upon and resolved in view of the system of demarcation," explained Mustafa.
On being pointed out that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had recently stated that the local poll will be held next year after demarcation, the minister said this was due to key facets that need deliberations before the poll can be held under the new system.
Both Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and President Sirisena have said that 25 percent of all elected representatives of Local Government bodies should comprise women under whatever system the poll will be held.
President had said that the delimitation process must be carried out properly and correctly regardless of time constrains.
Mustapha said the UNP has its concerns and discrepancies about the system of demarcation-so does the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"The final result of the delimitation of boundaries of local wards and the system as a whole must be agreed upon by everyone before it can be amended to the Constitution and put to operation so that the Local government poll can be held properly with the confidence of the public," he said.
"The LG election will be held once the demarcation is agreed upon by all, which will take time," he added.
