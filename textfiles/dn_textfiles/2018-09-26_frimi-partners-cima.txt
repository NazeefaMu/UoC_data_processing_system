FriMi partners with CIMA

FriMi recently partnered with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Sri Lanka, part of the world’s largest and leading professional body of management accountants.
This collaboration among two leaders in technology and education promises great potential for the future, and will provide a complete digital banking solution to all students and members affiliated to CIMA.
All CIMA Members with a FriMi account can enjoy exclusive offers to pursue Continuous Professional Development (CPD) courses, particularly the CIMA ‘Master Courses’ and flagship conferences such as the CIMA Business Leaders’ Summit, with additional lifestyle offers.
CIMA Students will be able to make their course fee payments via the FriMi app while enjoying exclusive deals on their tuition fee payment. Furthermore, a co-branded FriMi – CIMA platinum debit MasterCard will be offered to CIMA students and members to access their money conveniently at no additional cost.
Commenting on this partnership, Nazeem Mohamed, Head of FriMi Digital Bank said that “Digital initiatives such as FriMi go hand in hand with the progression of advanced technology in our country, and so, partnering with CIMA to provide its students and members a complete digital banking solution with multiple benefits seems to be quite a timely initiative since it caters to everyone operating in a world that is quite demanding in terms of time. We are sure that FriMi would give all CIMA members the convenience they would surely enjoy in terms of making payments – be it for their courses or conferences at their convenience from literally anywhere.”
Zahara Ansary, Country Manager for CIMA Sri Lanka stated “We believe in making the most of the opportunities created within the digital space to provide additional services to our students and members. This partnership with FriMi enables greater convenience as well as benefits to our members. As a professional body that is at the forefront of using cutting-edge technology, this is one more step in our journey towards making our members’ lives convenient. The additional benefits envisaged by FriMi in terms of the cashback offered to our students and members, will help them to continuously invest on their CPD and thus remain relevant in this increasingly changing world.”
