Bond Commission bars hacking into Aloysius’ Apple account

 
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed to investigate the Treasury bond issue this morning issued an order preventing any person or entity from hacking into former Perpetual Treasuries Director Arjun Aloysius’ Apple account. 
Former Perpetual Treasuries Director Arjun Aloysius’ Apple phone is currently in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Police attached to the PCoI for forensic investigation.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda on Monday informed the PCoI that there had been an attempt to hack into Aloysius’ phone and delete backup data stored in his Apple account.
