It always seems impossible until it's done - Nelson Mandela
Leadership lessons from a legacy

“There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires”. Such are the words echoed by a man who gave so much for his people so that even his harshest critics agree he was irrefutably an extraordinary man.
Known as the first black President of South Africa, Mandela dismantled the institutional legacy of apartheid and racism which had been reining the country for decades. An anti-apartheid activist, he became the joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work. His life, more than any other, has symbolises the struggle for racial equality and self-determination of the diverse peoples of South Africa and the African continent.
He sought to unite the whites, blacks, and other minorities. His vision was for a rainbow nation which resulted in enriching South Africa’s economy, intellectuality and culture. He did not have favourites either. He served the poor and the rich, the academic and illiterate equally. Instead of favouring his own – the Xhosa tribe, Mandela chose to empower the beings of his country.
“South Africa and Sri Lanka both have painful pasts. We were subjected to a lot of killings and disappearances. There were different sets of rules for the Blacks and the Whites. Blacks were regarded inferior then. We were not even allowed to be buried together! Mandela gave his life to struggle against apartheid,” said South African High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Robina Marks at the launch of Nelson Mandela Centenary 2018 Programme.
She notes that his legacy should be reflected upon to inspire the current generation.
“One of the things that struck me when I stepped into Sri Lanka two years ago was that anyone here can relate to his lessons. He was a symbol of someone who was able to turn his back on resentment for the past doings,” she noted.
Mandela forgave his greatest adversary - the Apartheid government which not only caused tremendous suffering to himself and his family but also to his countrymen. By choosing this higher route Mandela left a legacy of forgiveness and reconciliation for the world.
Mandela was a gifted visionary. He used a full range of cognitive, emotional and behavioral abilities to bring about profound change in South Africa.
One of Mandel’s key principals was that he always put his people and honour before worldly gain. While many political leaders from yesteryear as well as during present times are making fortunes through corruptive activities, Mandela took a different route. His estate was roughly just US $2.9 million and he even left money for his staff as well as his family.
“Leadership is not something which goes on forever. It is something you serve for your term at office. Then you leave that position vacant for another - which is exactly what he did. Our later presidents would hold onto power and refuse to let go of it. Leadership is about serving your term, make your country a better place and then retire,” Marks stressed. She says that Mandela saw himself as a part of a collective rather than a leader.
“No person leads on his or her own. We all stand on the shoulder of others who have gone before us,” she opined.
Another striking aspect about this iconic leader was that he looked ahead and could see that South Africa’s system of apartheid would not survive into the future. He strategically assessed his moves and anticipated reactions from his prison cell. The prisoners and prison guards often describe him as a man of principle and dignity, willing to sacrifice his life for his beliefs.
Even during his years in prison Mandela sharpened his knowledge by reading smuggled books. Since political books were out of reach, he turned to books on gardening and horticulture. The result of this was that he was able to cultivate food not only for his fellow prisoners but also for the prison officials.
Apart from this Mandela was also keen to educate all those around him. His experience as a lawyer helped him to give legal advice to his fellow prisoners as well as the prison staff. His passion for learning and teaching was so great that Robben Island gained fame as ‘Nelson Mandela University’.
He spent 27 years behind bars on Robben Island, hammering on rocks in the scorching heat during the day, only to retire to a tiny eight-by-seven-foot concrete cell with only a straw mat to sleep on. This harsh prison life did not break him. Rather he took it as a means of challenging the system which denied him his liberty. When he was offered freedom in 1985, he refused by saying “I cannot and will not give any undertaking, at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated!”Such attributes made others dub him as a saint. However Mandela himself never denied his humanity. He wanted others to see himself as a human being with flaws.
“Though he towered above others, due to being around six feet tall, he was also very humble. Once at a workshop we were conducting, he pulled one of us aside and requested to meet the people who had prepared the food at the event. We were stunned by his words and the kitchen staff whooped for joy. He came and shook their hands,” Marks recalled one of her experiences with him.
Another anecdote she shared was that Mandela’s special relationship with Queen Elizabeth.
“Mandela was regarded as a terrorist in some countries including the US. It is natural that one person’s freedom fighter becomes another’s terrorist. Many people are formal with the Queen and always address her as ‘Queen Elizabeth’. Mandela stuck to calling her ‘My dear Elizabeth’ in public and in private he called her ‘Lizzie’. Her cheeks would grow pink with delight on hearing him address her in this manner because she saw someone who regarded himself her equal and recognised her humanity. She also recognised him as someone who is a leader,” Marks mused adding that he was not afraid to voice on subjects that are taboo to the society.“For example he was the first one to admit publicly that his son has contacted HIV,” she explained.
“After 24 years after the end of apartheid we can see how the life, the legacy and the lessons of Mandela have impacted the life of today. Even though we have democracy, freedom, justice and one of the most appropriate constitutions in the world, we still have challenges to face in Africa,” Marks added.
Mandela’s birthday, July 18, has been declared as United Nations Mandela Day. Had he lived today he would have scored a century this year. However the timeless lessons from his life story will endure for years to come. So make everyday a Mandela Day.
