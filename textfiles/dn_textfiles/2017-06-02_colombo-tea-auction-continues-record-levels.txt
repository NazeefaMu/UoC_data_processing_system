Colombo tea  auction continues at record levels

At the end of May prices at the Colombo tea auction continue to realize record levels in both Rupee and US dollars terms primarily due to the deficit in availability.
Sri Lanka tea production is likely to be further impacted as the country experienced its worst disaster from torrential rain since 2003 last week.
The worst affected is the Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces. Needless to say, the current scenario would adversely impact the tea production particularly in the Low Grown sector.
