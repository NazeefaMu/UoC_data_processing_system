Sepalika Panagoda re-appointed Country Chair of MDRT

Financial Advisor of Ceylinco Life, Sepalika Panagoda has been appointed Country Chair of the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT), the world’s premier association of financial professionals, for the fourth time.
A qualifying member of MDRT since 2008, Panagoda was previously appointed as Country Chair of the Association for three consecutive years since 2012.
Having received eight Court of the Table (COT) qualifications, Panagoda became a Life Member of MDRT last year. She has addressed MDRT members and aspirants in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines and India. As the Country Chair, Panagoda will lead the MDRT membership promotion and communication efforts in the country; nominate members to serve as area, local and company Chairs and delegate assignments; identify and train successors for MDRT Leadership; report ideas, recommendations and concerns of members to MDRT Zone Chair and Headquarters; plan MDRT member gatherings so as to sustain membership and motivate MDRT aspirants to become members; distribute MDRT promotional tools among companies; attend the MDRT Annual Meeting and MDRT Experience and Global Conference; compile the Country Chair report to be submitted to the Headquarters; attend MDRT Zonal Meetings on the Membership Communication Committee; complete and submit MDRT Committee standard assignments; complete MDRT surveys; and support activities of other MDRT committees as requested.
Panagoda joined the Life insurance leader in 2004. As a top achiever at Ceylinco Life, she was recently presented with a luxury car for meeting the Company’s ‘Hall of Fame’ criteria.
She was also the winner of the Silver Award in the Front-liner Category in the Life Insurance sector at the 2015 National Sales Congress (NASCO) Awards of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).
Sri Lanka’s first MDRT qualifier was produced by Ceylinco Life in 1993. The company was also the first to produce a MDRT ‘Life Member’ by achieving the stipulated sales targets for ten straight years and the first local insurer to produce an MDRT Top-of-Table Member.
