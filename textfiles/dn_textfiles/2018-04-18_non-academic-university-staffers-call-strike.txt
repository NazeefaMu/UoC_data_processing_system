Non-academic university staffers call off strike

A significant number of university non-academic staffers have reported for duty yesterday after concluding a 44-day strike.
Members of the university non-academic staffers’ trade unions had been engaging in a continuous strike making several demands including a salary hike. However, the non-academic staffers have decided to report for duty from yesterday after the discussion they had with the Higher Education and Highways Minister became a success.
Due to the strike, almost all the academic activities of universities and all higher educational institutions were on a standstill for a quite a long period. Besides, university examinations and various tests had also been postponed.
When contacted, University Grant Commission (UGC) sources said that university activities will come to normal by the next few days. Accordingly, all the examinations and tests postponed will be held promptly in due course.
