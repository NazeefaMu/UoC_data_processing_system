Mexico's insect food festival

Scorpions and fly larva are just two of the crawling, wriggling lunchtime specials available at Mexico City’s Insect Food Festival.
Visitors flocked to the event to feast on a wide variety of pre-Hispanic plates featuring protein-rich insects. According to historians, ancient Mexican tribes such as the Mexicans and Mayas combined traditional tortillas and beans with ants, locusts, fireflies, butterflies, worms and a wide assortment of flowers for a balanced diet, especially when meat was scarce.
Today, that tradition remains alive. Even mainstream restaurants in Mexico City offer gourmet menu options including gusanos de maguey (century plant worms) and chapulines (grilled crickets). In addition to these deliciously crunchy crawlers, some market merchants sell crocodile, iguana and armadillo meat, as well as ostrich eggs. -AFP
