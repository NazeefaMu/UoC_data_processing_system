Meaningful Vesak celebration

The annual Vesak festival is tapping at our doorsteps. If one were to walk on the highways or on byroads right now, one would see the country getting ready to display the life events of the Buddha by erecting storytelling pandals and close to them dansel or almsgiving halls coming up or already set up. Also, there are special Vesak zones as well.
However, does it really display the true meaning of the great life events of Gauthama Buddha who showed the path to live in peace and harmony, with oneself and with others as a social animal; to live in unity with nature?
At Colombo Narahenpita Temple premises recently (May 7), the public witnessed a truly novel way of celebrating Vesak. Narahenpita Eksath Velenda Sangamaya (United Merchants’ Society) had something different to offer.
The health camp
The chief organizer of the Society Nimal de Silva, on whose concept was born the novel idea to celebrate Vesak, said he was troubled by seeing the way some youths were throwing ice cream cones haphazardly inside his vehicle, being distributed freely at one of the Vesak dansal in the past.
He said, thinking of the incident, he realized that there are better ways to celebrate Vesak where the Buddhist world can recall with reverence the birth, enlightenment and passing away - the three cardinal events of the Buddha’s life.
“One day, it struck me that there are many elders thrown out of their homes by their own children and relatives and neglected by neighbours and society. For them, it is no easy task to bathe by themselves, owing to their old age and fragile bodies.
Why not we think of ways to help them, console them and come out with a viable project where they would enjoy a nice bath and at the same time impress on them that they are being looked after instead of being thrown to the streets. We need to give them consolation by taking care of them and assure them that they are precious and wanted,” de Silva said.
“With this thought in my mind, I canvassed United Merchants’ Society President Piyasena Hewawasam and forwarded him the idea of treating our neglected elders. The members were highly impressed and enthusiastic.
They wanted to implement this proposal and held discussions with the incumbent monk of Sri Maha Bodhi Temple Ven. Kahatagasdigiliye Dhammarathana Thera. The venerable thera encouraged us to pursue the idea and offered the temple premises to be used for the project.”
De Silva said, for several years they had been conducting dansal during Vesak changing the food from time to time but found that this was monotonous.
“This year we have changed this and instead of running dansal this Vesak, we decided to treat 100 neglected elders by giving them a bath and providing them medical attention.
“We did not choose the beneficiaries on religious, ethnic or other criteria but took into account how deserving they are. This is our first experience and it is very satisfying. This is an act that draws great merit than only serving a plate of rice. Bathing the elders with our own hands, conducting a health camp to their benefit within the premises of the temple and feeding and clothing them, have brought us satisfaction, pushing us to do similar things. We hope to conduct such camps in the time to come with the assistance of the public, the generous contribution of the business community and our strength,” de Silva said.
“We are glad that we were able to get the temple premises for the project and provide all facilities to the elders. The presence of Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara was an honour.
We are grateful for the police force, the maintenance unit of Telecom and staff members of Asiri Hospital who supported us with the project. We are also thankful for all volunteers who bathed the elders and looked after them,” de Silva added.
The project by the United Merchants’ Society was highly attractive and full of meaning.
