Commenting on the development, CSE Market Development Head Niroshan Wijesundere said they are pleased to see the events in Australia having a positive effect on the turnover flowing in from the county.
"This is consistent with a trend that we have experienced with Foreign Investor Forums conducted in the past, where these events almost immediately rejuvenate the interest in the Sri Lankan capital market. The presence of the stock brokers who traveled with the delegation to Australia also played a vital role in following up and securing such investments.”
He also pointed out that partnering with event sponsors and the Sri Lankan High Commission in Australia, the Australian High Commission in Sri Lanka, bilateral associations and business councils was critical to hosting three successful Forums in both Sydney and Melbourne.
A strong community of individuals with a Sri Lankan origin eager to look at new Sri Lankan investment opportunities and the celebration of 70 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Australia presented the CSE with a unique opportunity to promote the capital market in Australia.
