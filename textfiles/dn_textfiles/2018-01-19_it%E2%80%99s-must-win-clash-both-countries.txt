Sri Lanka v Pakistan ICC U19 Cricket World Cup:
It’s a must-win clash for both countries

It’s a clash of the subcontinent giants in Group D at the Cobham Oval on Friday (19 January) when Pakistan and Sri Lanka face off against each other for a place in the quarter-finals.
Both teams have followed the same script, winning against Ireland and losing to Afghanistan, and know that victory will secure a spot in the last eight. Pakistan have a slight advantage with a higher net run rate and with some rain around in Whangarei the weather could add some drama to proceedings.
Pakistan didn’t have the best of starts to the tournament, losing to Afghanistan by five wickets in their opening fixture, but three days later they got back on track with a comfortable nine-wicket victory over Ireland. In the earlier warm-up games, they beat Namibia by 190 runs, while the game against Bangladesh was washed out.
Sri Lanka also registered a comprehensive win against Ireland, prevailing by seven wickets, but were beaten by Afghanistan by 32 runs on DLS method. In their warm-up games, they lost to Australia by 53 runs while their fixture against England was abandoned due to rain.
In six previous ICC U19 CWC meetings dating back to 1988, Pakistan have the upper hand with five victories, including at the 2014 and 2016 editions. In all U19 cricket the two countries have met a total of 34 times, with Pakistan winning on 18 occasions, 13 victories for Sri Lanka and three no results.
Pakistan are the third-most successful team in ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup history, having taken home the title twice, in 2004 and 2006, behind only India and Australia. They have made the final on a further three occasions, including at the first-ever tournament in 1988, with a team including future legends Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed.
In 11 previous appearances, Sri Lanka have reached the final once, against India on home soil in 2000, only to lose to a team that included Mohammad Kaif and Player of the Tournament, Yuvraj Singh. They have reached the semi-finals twice since, in 2010 and 2016.

Pakistan: Hasan Khan (c), Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Ali Khan, Ammad Alam, Zaid Alam, Ali Zaryab, Arshad Iqbal, Muhammad Mohsin Khan, Muhammad Musa, Saad Khan, Rohail Nazir (wk), Munir Riaz, Suleman Shafqat, Imran Shah, Mohammad Taha.

England top Group C with win over Bangladesh
Captain Harry Brook scored a fine century as England defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets at the John Davies Oval in Queenstown today to put themselves in line to top Group C in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup.
Brook’s 102 not out was supplemented with a fine all-round effort of 48 not out and three for 26 by Euan Woods as the 1998 champions completed a second straight win. England are at par with Bangladesh on four points and a win over Canada on Saturday will enable them to top the group with six points, also making Bangladesh as the second side to qualify for the Super League quarterfinals.
Canada remained in contention for a place in the Super League quarterfinals from Group C when they defeated Namibia by four wickets at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Christchurch. However, to reach the Super League quarterfinals, they will have to convincingly beat England so that they can improve their net run-rate, which currently sits at -0.277 as compared to England’s +3.27 and Bangladesh’s +0.43.
While Canada are still in the running for a place in the Super League quarterfinals, Namibia, who had qualified directly for the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 as the highest-placed Associate in 2016, will now play in the Plate Championship after succumbing to their third straight defeat.
