Presidential Commission of Inquiry  to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud:Probe into 49 complaints Completed: PM

 The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud has completed probing 49 complaints, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday. He said the findings of the investigations have been referred  to relevant authorities to take necessary legal actions. The Premier made these observations yesterday responding to a question raised by JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2). MP Dissanayake demanded to know the current situation in relation to the functions of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud.
The Premier said the Commission has received 15,599 complaints. He said these complaints had been studied and categorised for the purpose of investigations.
“The commission has dismissed 1,180 complaints as allegations which have no basis for further investigation,” Premier said. “The commission has referred 400 complaints to investigating officials to commence probes. So far, the commission has completed investigating 49 complaints while investigations into 158 complaints are in progress.”
The Premier said the findings of some complaints have been referred to various authorities to initiate action against the accused. He said the commission has no legal powers to determine punishment for those found guilty of fraud. He said the commission’s mandate is to report the results of their investigations. “The powers to take punitive action or instituting legal action on the basis of the findings are vested with the Attorney General or the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “The Commission, therefore, has referred the outcomes of their findings to those authorities. Considering the number of complaints received by the Commission and the workload, the mandate given to the Commission has been extended to September 03, 2017,” he said.
