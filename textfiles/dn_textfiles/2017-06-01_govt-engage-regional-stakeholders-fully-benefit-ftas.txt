Govt. to engage regional stakeholders to fully benefit from FTAs

Government embarked on a number of development initiatives to open up new doors for the country to move Sri Lanka towards advanced economy in the world by adopting private sector led, export-based, FDI-driven development strategy.
As part of this overall strategy, negotiations of Free Trade Agreements with India, China and Singapore are currently being carried out taking possible costs and benefits of such engagement into account through stakeholder consultation.
In line with that, to raise the awareness and obtain inputs, stakeholder consultation meetings for industry chambers, professional associations and other stakeholders are regularly conducted in Colombo. The importance of raising the awareness of regional-level trade chambers, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders has been identified.
Therefore, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade has decided to broaden the stakeholder consultation process to regional level.
Accordingly, the first regional level consultation meeting will be held collaboratively with the Kandy District Secretariat from 10.00 am to 12.15 pm at the Auditorium of Kandy District Secretariat tomorrow (June 1) .
These consultation sessions will be conducted by the members of National Trade Negotiating Team. It would be an ideal platform to regional level trade chambers and entrepreneurs to raise their concerns and be alerted about the potential business opportunities of the proposed FTAs.
