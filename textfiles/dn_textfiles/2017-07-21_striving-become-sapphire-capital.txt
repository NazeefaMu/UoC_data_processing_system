Striving to become the Sapphire capital

Last year, Sri Lanka raked in over Rs. 19 billion in exports of its famous gemstones, data from the National Gem and Jewellery Authority shows.
But, government officials say the real value of the gem industry is probably much higher.
That’s because Sri Lanka’s trade in coloured gems supports a booming black market.
Some estimates by the Gem Authority put the total number of people employed by the industry, both directly and indirectly, and 500,000. And because the state owns the rights to anything extracted from the ground, that’s potentially a lot of government revenue.
But, out on the ground, in the supply chain linking miners and local gem traders from the interior to the big showrooms and buyers in Colombo, the gem trade remains kind of a Wild West.
A former chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority told the Daily News this week that he believes a “majority” of gems are sold on the black market, to avoid paying taxes.
This is backed up by a 2015 study, by the Oxford Business Group, which found that the actual value of gem exports is probably “significantly higher” than the reported numbers, due to unofficial business, smuggling, and undervaluing.
The government agency that regulates the gem trade wants to implement a stricter gem certification scheme to wrangle business out of the black market.
But, a unified solution seems far down the road.
 
Blue gems, black market
Sitting in his home in Ratnapura, which means, literally, “city of gems,” former National Gem and Jewellery Authority Chairman Asoka Jayawardena said he believed only a small percentage of excavated gems are sold on the open market.
“Many usually sell it to people they know,” he said. This way, they avoid paying taxes, he added.
To declare a gem’s value in an official sale, at an open auction, “for this people have to feel patriotic and that they are doing something for the country,” he said. “Only then will they care to pay their dues properly.”
Jayawardena said the government is losing a lot of value amidst a global sapphire boom.
Forbes reports that sapphires are now rivalling diamonds in popularity for engagement rings. This surge is largely driven by the fact that Prince William of England proposed to Kate Middleton with a Sri Lankan blue sapphire engagement ring.
The ring previously belonged to Princess Diana, after Queen Elizabeth II was given it as a gift on a visit to Sri Lanka. The publicity has driven up demand for Sri Lankan sapphires specifically.
 
Putting a history to the stone
But, right now there’s no official way for an international buyer to be sure their blue gem is actually an island sapphire.
“When you take a diamond, their processes are extremely strict. Every stone has a history,” Jayawardena said. If Sri Lankan sapphires had to go through a similar certification for origin as diamonds, he said, a lot more value would be brought back into the official market. Buyers would be assured their blue sapphires were authentic, and from Sri Lanka.
Back in Colombo, current government officials say they are working on creating such a process.
“That’s a good idea,” Director of Valuation K.L.D. Dayasagara said at the headquarters of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority on Thursday. “But that’s a lot of work.”
Dayasagara said to develop a mandated certificate to ensure a sapphire’s Sri Lankan origins, the government authority would have to develop a deep database of information about sapphire composition worldwide.
He said that they’d have to obtain primary samples of sapphires from other gem-producing countries, like Nigeria and Madagascar.
Every gem has distinctive features, like birth marks, that indicate the place they were formed, Dayasagara said. These are called “inclusions.”
To certify sapphires as Sri Lankan sapphires, data on the gem inclusions need to exist in a single place.
Dayasagara could not say when exactly such a certificate would be rolled out, or if there is a specific programme spearheading this work.
“It’s probably two years down the road,” he said. “It’s part of a broad effort … to promote Sri Lanka as the sapphire capital.”
He agreed with former Chairman Jayawardena that a lot of sapphires and other gems are lost to the black market. “It’s probably about half and half,” he said.
To export gems, “it’s a small payment, half a percent,” he said. But people smuggle gems to get around the fee.
“That is nature, human nature,” he added. “It happens when you can carry a stone worth billions just in your fist.”
 
Certification: it’s a crazy world
Out in the myriad gem showrooms of Colombo, gem sellers don’t have much of an appetite for the government’s plan.
“Whatever we export already goes through the Gem and Jewellery Authority,” said Ihthaisab Hussein, a jewellery manager at Zam Gems.
Zam is one of the largest gem and jewellery exporters in the country, according to their promotional materials.
“The government values it, we can’t even undervalue it,” he said. “Any way, it has to go through them.”
He pointed to the many ways of certification that already exist. Hussein said that for their largest pieces, they get certificates from large international labs, like the Gemmological Institute of America or Gem Research Swisslab.
These labs analyse gems for colour, carat, clarity, and cut. They also can tell if a gem is a fake or not. For smaller pieces, Zam has three to four in-house gemmologists, Hussein said, who can issue a certificate for a buyer.
But ultimately, it’s the buyer’s choice of where they want a certificate issued from, if they want one at all. Private labs exist in the city, like the Gemmological Institute of Colombo and the French Gemmological Laboratory.
Both the GIC and FGL turned down requests by the Daily News to speak about their facilities.
Dayasagara, of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, says that the lab he directs is the domestic standard.
 
Fake stones
But, there are complaints about the government lab. A small-scale gem seller in Ratnapura, the heart of the gem trade, said he and other merchants have been asking the National Gem and Jewellery Authority to set up a facility to test for fakes in their city for years.
Now, they have to send their products to Colombo for certificates, which can add unnecessary delays and kill sales.
He wished to remain anonymous as to not compromise his business.
Testing and certification is important because gem sellers dealing in fake gems “is a real problem,” according to Dayasagara. He said that even on Wednesday, a gem owner came in with a certificate from an Indian lab that did not say whether the stone was fake or not.
In May, police arrested a gem shop owner for selling fake blue gemstones to a tourist in New Zealand.
The jewellery authority is beginning to make it mandatory for all gem shops to have certificates, Dayasagara said. To obtain a permit next year, they must show that 15 percent of their stock has certificates.
To issue that many certificates, “we’ll have to work around the clock,” Dayasagara said.
Mahmood Farook is a gem seller at Serene Gems, in Bambalapitiya. He said many of his shop’s stones already carry certifications from the government gem authority.
“Our most important product is trust,” he said.
He added that he didn’t have an opinion on certifying sapphires for origin, as most of his business was focused on selling to local buyers and tourists face-to-face, and not through the export market.
On a wall on the back of Farook’s shop is a picture of Kate Middleton, now Duchess of Cambridge, displaying her Sri Lankan sapphire ring. In display cases, sapphires glittered in all shades of blue, offset by red rubies and garnets, and yellow topaz.
“This is our Sri Lankan pride,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to sell good gems … because we have a reputation, no?”
