Parliament will not be re-convened on Monday - UPFA

UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said Parliament will not be re-convened on November 5.
Addressing the media yesterday at the office of the Joint Opposition he said that on Monday November 5, there will be a public demonstration near the parliamentary roundabout to express solidarity to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said according to the constitution, the President has the power to summon Parliament as and when he wishes but has to gazette it before three working days.
"The President had decided to convene Parliament on November 16 and if he wishes he can convene before that. But Parliament will not convene on November 5, that is a false statement", he said. Premajayantha said the President has all powers constitutionally to prorogue Parliament.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the new government cannot go ahead with the budget prepared by the yahapalana government and added that a new Budget will be prepared for the well being of the people.
