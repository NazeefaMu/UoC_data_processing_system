Not only will the Retreat offer guests with a holiday haven and the feel of a home away from home but will also pose as the ideal setting for those individuals and groups who crave a quiet and peaceful environment that would allow them to unwind and reflect on their thoughts and lifestyles for a change.
The Retreat is set to attract guests such as yoga and meditation enthusiasts, scholars and research students who would prefer to find a composed and silent location to engage in their research and study work and birdwatchers and photographers looking to explore the area for their recreational purposes.
