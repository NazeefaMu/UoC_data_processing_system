Jab Harry Met Sejal : Misses the zing!

Imtiaz Ali is known for enthralling hits with out of the box themes like ‘Jab We Met’, ‘Love Aaj Kal’, ‘Cocktail’, and ‘Highway’. Therefore when film buffs got the news that the filmmaker is going to direct Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and the talented Anushka Sharma, the project was much looked forward to indeed.
Masses flocked to the theaters when it released only to return disappointed by the film which stretched on too long and was full of annoying clichés. The title itself is bland. The film was bound to be miserably mushy. It is so oblivious and predictable that you almost feel like fast forwarding to the end and just being done with the act.
The film canters around a tour guide named Harry who is forced to accompany a rich and spoilt and thoroughly annoying stereotype called Sejal back on the tour that they just completed to try and find her engagement ring which she seems to have lost on the way. She has apparently told her parents that she will get back to the country only when she finds the ring.
Shah Rukh does nothing in the film that he hasn’t already done earlier. What is new for Anushka Sharma is only the Gujarati accent. Imtiaz Ali manages something he has not tried earlier. He collects fragments out of films of the recent years gone by and stitches up a patchwork that makes up ‘Jab Harry Met Sejal’.
Another downside in the movie is the unlikable female lead who does not go through much of a transformation to make her more likeable at curtain call. Sejal is a pure caricature and her Gujarati accent is hard on our ears. Though she tries hard to make her character cute and be ‘sexy’ as she so desperately wants to be for Harry, the audience cannot help wishing her to be out of and out of ear shot too. In addition to this we feel a sense of mockery towards Harry for actually falling for the dame.
The only plus point in ‘Jab Harry Met Sejal’ is the journey. The scenic beauty of Budapest, Prague, Berlin, Lisbon, Vienna, from the Amalfi coast to the Atlantic is captured bon camera and brought before the audience. However SRK and Anushka’s annoying acts spoil the background beauty.
The story is peppered with so many songs that you lose count of them after a while. You actually stop caring for what will happen next or the plight of the characters.
‘Jab Harry Met Sejal’ is a lost cause from the word go. The ring is, of course, just a metaphor. Both are, of course, searching for the other. This is like the stuff that a very badly written ‘Mills and Boon’ novel is made up of.
Watch this film if you are strictly a Shah Rukh Khan or Anushka Sharma fan. However this might take the cake and put you off them for a while too.
