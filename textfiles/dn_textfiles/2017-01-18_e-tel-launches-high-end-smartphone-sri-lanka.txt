E-tel launches  high-end smartphone  in Sri Lanka

E-tel, the home-grown mobile phone brand in Sri Lanka, has consolidated its position in the smartphone segment with the launch of an all-new high-end 4G smartphone with a curved display and Virtual Reality feature.
The E-tel L3 has a Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex – A7 64-bit processor supported with Internal Memory of 16GB and 3GB RAM, and is powered by Android OS, v6.0 (Marshmallow), a feature exclusive to high end smartphones that deliver consistent performance.
The phone has a 5-inch full touch screen with a 2.5D curved display, and is designed for Virtual Reality games and videos. A 13MP rear camera with flash and a 5MP front camera facilitate high quality video calls and selfies.
“The E-tel L3 perfectly represents our philosophy of supporting human bonding in the era of the smartphone with cutting-edge technology at an affordable price,” a Spokesman for brand owner Brantel said.“The phone packages the latest features and processors with great design aesthetics and reliability, to suit local conditions and purchasing abilities.”
The E-tel L3 and other E-tel phones can be purchased online via www.brantelonline.com at a special discount, the company said.
Brantel has been in operation in Sri Lanka since 2004 and launched the E-tel brand in 2008. E-tel phones are available in nearly 2,000 dealer outlets in Sri Lanka and via a Brantel owned aftersales service network of five service centres in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Kandy, Matara and Jaffna.
