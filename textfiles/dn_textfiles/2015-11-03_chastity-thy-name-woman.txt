Chastity, thy name is woman!

Are females often bound to committing adultery? Are they a weak species who roam in this blue planet and beyond? Goddess Paththini brings answers to all these queries. She represents all women…mothers…sisters…daughters in this universe who dedicate their lives towards love. Purity and Chastity of a woman is a significant aspect in the disposition of Goddess Paththini.
Prof Sunil Ariyaratne’s newest film revolves around birth of Goddess Paththini. The film made in the Blockbuster genre and named as Paththini is produced by Milina Sumathipala. The film trailer, website and collection of songs from Paththini were launched at the Sumathi Court auditorium in Bambalapitiya.
Jagath Sumathipala said his father late U W Sumathipala entered the cinema world by producing Unnath Dahai Malath Dahai featuring Vijeya Kumaratunga. His pursue continued with Ahasin Polowata, Ganga Addara, Duwata Mawaka Misa and Uppalavanna. Ahasin Polowata became the best film in the third world at the Cairo international film fest. Ganga Addara had the privilege to bag highest number of awards locally at the Sarasavi film festival which is a record yet to be broken.
People in our country can still recall songs Upul Nuwan Vidaha and Ganga Addara Maa in Ahasin Polowata and Ganga Addara sung by Milton Mallawarachchchi and Vijeya Kumaratunga.
Sumathi films associated with women centered plots throughout and Paththini is an extension of that trait.
Prof Sunil Ariyaratne speaking at the occasion said a heavy budget was allocated to make the film. He said Paththini revolves around an ancient Indian heroin named Kannagi.
“Sri Lankan and Indian contexts value a girl’s virginity very much. Lal Hegoda once took a picture of a set of delicately stacked clay pots in hazardous vicinity and called it Virginity.
Paththini worshipping tradition was brought to Lanka by King Gajaba. Prof Jananatha Obesekera wrote a comprehensive volume of 600 pages on Goddess Paththini. The Cult of Goddess Paththini was printed by the Chicago University. I wrote Paththini script by associating all these sources”, said the Prof.
Paththini the movie will be screened in the EAP circuit from January 31 in 2016 the day that coincides with the sixty ninth birthday of Sinhala cinema.
Local blockbuster films?
Prof Ariyaratne said Paththini was made in the blockbuster genre and it will provide filmgoers value for their money. He said the National Film Corporation does not believe in locally made blockbuster films thus NFC uses the same spoon to serve all films alike. “They treat Lantin Signor and Paththini alike”, said the Prof.
The Prof’s interpretation on the subject however is questionable. NFC has a responsibility towards safeguarding the industry by handling distribution according to a strategy. Thus NFC may be pampering films like Lantin Signor, Suhada Koka or Gindaree for that matter at this juncture because these types of low-budget films are able to earn profits by screening within this country.
Currently local cinema is in dire straits. Thus the best means of keeping the industry breathing air is to make films that have the ability to penetrate this market which is flooded with mega Hindi, Tamil and Hollywood films. To penetrate a market a product has to be competitive and heavy budgeted products face the challenge when it comes to pricing. The filmgoer will pay one standardized amount to purchase a ticket to see any film across the board.
On the other hand NFC until the distribution network is strengthened is not in a position to allocate comparatively a greater number of halls for a particular cinema. Thus NFC is compelled to striking a balance at this very moment.
Paththini and 70s decade films
With the dawn of 1970 decade local films were made to eat into the market segment of viewers who were addicted to Hindi and Tamil movies. This tactic really worked and Gamini Fonseka became local Rajesh Khanna, MGR or Shivaji Ganeshan while Jothipala and Milton Mallawarachchi became Muhammad Raffi and Kishore Kumar.
Prof Ariyaratne would have used the same tactic in making Paththini. A Hindi blockbuster film like Jodha Akbar in the present context is so popular among local audiences. Even Jodha Akbar tele-serial now being shown on a TV channel has attracted young and adult local audiences. Prof Ariyaratne would have adapted the technique of Jodha Akbar to make Paththini with the object of attracting the same set of viewers to Paththini. If he had done so it is a smart act.
Jagath Sumathipala announced Paththini will be shown in Australian cinema halls and discussions are underway to follow suit with few other Asian countries.
Puja Umashankar, Uddika Premaratne, Aruni Rajapakse and Vinu Siriwardena with a gamut of other artistes have teamed up to make Paththini a reality.
Music composing is by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe. Nanda Malini, Amarasiri Peiris, Nirosha Virajini, Kasun Kalhara, Uresha Ravihari, Saman Lenin and Damayanthi Jayasuriya do the singing. Lyricists are Prof Sunil Ariyaratne and Dr Praneeth Abhayasundera.
Channa Deshapriya has handled the camera while dance choreography is by Chandana Wickramasinghe.
Paththini is produced by Dr Milina Sumathipala and co-produced by Jagath Sumathipala and Thilanga Sumathipala. Production coordinator is A D Ranjit Kumara.
Story rebuilding, script, dialogues and direction of Paththini is by Prof Sunil Ariyaratne.
