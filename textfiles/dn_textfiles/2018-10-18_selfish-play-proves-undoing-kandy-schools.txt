Selfish play proves the undoing of Kandy Schools

Colombo schoolboy ruggerites will be looking to extend their winning performance when they host Kandy schools at the Racecourse Stadium in the second game.
Last Friday evening Kandy schoolboy ruggerites let down their supporters with a disappointing display against the Colombo schoolboys where they were beaten 14-12 after leading in the first half due to selfish play.
Kandy schools who are famous for sensible rugby had an off day in the first leg.
They should give a better performance on October 20 in the return game in Colombo. These two games are played to pick the junior national squad for the Asian U19 Rugby Championship that will be played in December. However there was only one selector at the grounds L.V. Ekanayake.
In the second leg game Kandy boys should not forget rugby is a team game not an individual game. Everyone expected the Kandy boys to do well at their home den, this defeat faces a big question mark as who is to be blamed the coaches or the players?
Kandy boys started scoring in the fourth minute through Devananda’s Lahiru Daulaga and his team mate made no mistake with the kick at goal to give them a 7-0 lead. Then came a try from Colombo’s Rukshan Madushak and it was goalled by Thuan Zamil to make it 7-all, Again Kandy scored through Humana Dhananjaya, a Maliyadeva product but this time the conversion failed and Kandy led 12-7 at half time.
In the second half Kandy schools were unable to prove that they had any sort of spirit in their game, and the players forgot that rugby is a 15 player team game. A thrilling game was expected but it never happened. Kandy had all the chances of pulling the game in their favor if they had played as a team. They also missed a penalty kick at goal two minutes before the final whistle, the Maliyadeva boy’s kicking at goal was good, but they brought in another player to kick this penalty and he failed.
Thanks to a superior team work of the Colombo schools backs and forwards who dictated proceedings after Kandy’s rugged opening quarter. Colombo made use of the Kandy boy’s one-man show mistakes.
Rugby fans were not impressed, there were 25 scrum downs in this game. Whatever said and done, the winning team’s ruggerites gave a super display in rucking and clean hard play. The winning side forwards had plenty of fire to keep up to their standards, and rattled the opponents. The set scrums were equally shared, with the fly half coming in, and setting the line in motion on several occasions. It was pleasing to see the ball handled by the entire back division. Some of the timely kicks into the opponent’s territory was excellent.
In the last quarter of the game Colombo boys played with confidence and paced out the game to earn a penalty try goal. Their forwards played furiously and their three-quarters ran the ball well. Kandy side in the second half on more than they went up to the opponent’s goal line but failed to score due to faulty finish and selfishness. It would have been more purposeful if they could have made these attempts productive in the need of the hour.
