AIA plants saplings as part of their ‘Go Green’ initiative

AIA employees joined hands with non-profit organisation ReForest Sri Lanka and the Athuraliya Divisional Secretariat, in an initiative to expand forest coverage in Sri Lanka. AIA donated 2000 kumbuk saplings, which volunteers from AIA head office and branch offices planted along the Nilwala riverbank, as part of AIA’s ‘Go-Green 2017’ project.
Notably, trees reduce the risk of flooding during heavy rains, by acting as a barrier to floodwater and reducing sediment going into rivers while increasing water absorption to the ground. This area in Matara was submerged during the recent floods and badly in need of a re-planting effort to help mitigate similar situations in future.
