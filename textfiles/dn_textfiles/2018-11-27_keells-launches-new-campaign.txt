Keells launches new campaign

This November, Keells ushered a new campaign that embodies two core values of the brand identity- Freshness and Quality. Keells launched their “Fresh Guaranteed: Double Your Money Back” campaign recently reflecting the Brand’s promise and commitment towards providing good quality fresh produce. With this in mind, the initiative allows customers to return Keells fresh produce bought within 24 hours which they are not satisfied with for double the price of the quantity brought back.
“Keells’ guarantee of freshness begins at the very source working directly with farmers and sourcing from collection centers in Sooriyawewa, Pannegamuwa, Keppitipola, Sigiriya, Jaffna and Thambuththegama”, said Head of Fresh Foods, Mifrah Ismail, Keells. Extension officers work in partnership with the Keells Fresh team to educate the farmers on both pre-harvest and post-harvest techniques as well as implementing Good Agricultural Products (GAP) certification among its farmer base.
Back in 2016, Keells pioneered ‘Fresh Chilled Chicken’ in Sri Lanka offering customers freshness, nutrition and taste. The project involved working with their suppliers to create a process that would optimize freshness and deliver chicken from farm to store under stringent hygienic standards and within 24 hours. To date, 78 outlets maintain Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards while over 60 outlets maintain Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLS) standards which emphasize Keells’ commitment towards providing customers with high quality produce.
In addition to fruit, vegetables, fish and meat, the brand’s standard of freshness now also includes their recently added range of hot food counters and juice bars as well as a customer favourite- the bakery. For Charitha Subasinghe, President, Retail, John Keells Group the Fresh Guarantee is a testament to the Keells identity as a newly relaunched Brand and a reflection of their core purpose- to improve the quality of life for the nation.
