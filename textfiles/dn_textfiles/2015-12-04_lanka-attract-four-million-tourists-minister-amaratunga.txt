Lanka to attract four million tourists - Minister Amaratunga

Sri Lanka hopes to attract four million tourists by 2020, said Minister of Christian Affairs and Tourism Development, John Amaratunga.
"Up to October 2015, arrivals stood at 1.4 million visitors (an all-time high) and tourism arrivals are expected to reach a record two million visitors this year."
He also disclosed that the formal and informal sector room strength currently stands at 33,426 and this will increase to 45,000 rooms by 2018. Speaking at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka at the Taj Samudra in Colombo, he said that the industry must gear itself and be ready for a tourism boom in the next few years.
"One of the biggest issues facing the hospitality industry today is the shortage of skilled staff and the industry must take note of this and act immediately." "Dozens of new properties are coming up across the island and based on work-in-progress, over 10,000 new rooms will be added to the inventory in the next couple of years. We need highly skilled personnel to deliver what we promise. Unfortunately there is a severe shortage of such personnel," the Minister said.
It was revealed that the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management has launched an aggressive island-wide campaign to recruit school leavers to the hospitality trade.
"We have started the recruitment drive in Anuradhapura recently and will be taking it to Hambantota on December 5 and 6 where 100 youth are expected to be enrolled to the satellite school there, Minister Amaratunga said. (SS)
