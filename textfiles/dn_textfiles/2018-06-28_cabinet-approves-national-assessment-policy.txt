Cabinet approves National Assessment Policy

The Cabinet of Ministers have approved a National Assessment Policy drafted to evaluate the productivity and long-term results as well as the impact of the Government’s development projects on public life.
The government annualy implements around 1,300 development projects yearly, countrywide.
Nearly 1/3 of these projects are massive projects where the cost is more than Rs. 500 million.
In addition, there are many District, Divisional and Local Government Development activities.
However, due to lack of a viable assessment mechanism, their productivity, impact on public life and long term benefits are not properly evaluated.
The National Assessment Policy has been drafted to fill this vacuum. It has been prepared with inputs from all relevant stakeholders and experts.
The proposal in this regards was presented by Sagala Rathnayaka, Minister of Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development to the Cabinet of ministers.
