TBWAL takes on 2018 with stronger  focus on brand, business building

Best known for their ‘Disruptive’ approaches to brand building, TBWAri Lanka has been a steadfast agency in Sri Lanka’s advertising industry over the past few decades.
With time, having established and nurtured strong and long-standing relationships with their clients, the Agency has grown and evolved together with the brands they manage, to produce some of the most iconic, disruptive and effective work the country has seen.
Armed with their wins from 2017 and powered by new leadership, the Agency has stepped into 2018 with an even more strengthened focus on brand and business building.
“Disruption is who we are. It’s what we are known for. It’s what’s in our blood. While our work will continue to be propelled by Disruption, we are taking 2018 head on with an augment focus on brand and business building,” said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director – TBWAri Lanka.
“2017 was a spectacular one for us as an Agency. Among others, it was the first time ever that the TBWARegional Leadership and Creative planning meeting was held together and more importantly was hosted by TBWAri Lanka. This was an immense win for us as it showed that the region recognized the importance of Sri Lanka and what we have to offer,” she said.
“Everything we have achieved is because our Agency has grown stronger as a team. Having a strong and diverse team, with a touch of quirk is a wonderful strength and something we have always embraced. We are strengthening our team to meet the rising demand of the market and will continue to fuel them with trainings and exposure at both a local and international level, I am extremely excited to see what 2018 has in store for us,” she added.
2017 was another year of steady progress for TBWAri Lanka. Having been named the ’2017 Agency of the Year’ by Campaign Brief Asia; being the only Sri Lankan Agency to be awarded metal at Adfest, Ad Stars, Midas, Epica and Sharks; winning 3 Gold, 8 Silver and 3 Bronze awards throughout the year; retaining Silver at the Agency of the Year Awards for the 3rd consecutive year and winning the People’s Choice Award for Maliban Cream Cracker are only some of the noteworthy achievements TBWAri Lanka accomplished during 2017.
Additionally, 2017 saw the Agency’s experience further expand into new categories, growing the already robust brand portfolio.
To spearhead the creative leadership of the team from 2018,the Agency also recruited industry expert S. Nathasoruban as their Chief Creative Officer. Soru, as he is better known in Sri Lanka’s advertising industry, has a strong reputation in the marketing fraternity as a whizz in brand building, which falls in perfect alignment with TBWAri Lanka’s focus for 2018.
“We are so pleased to have Soru join us to head our Creative Department from this year on. He is also an individual with a plethora of experience in some of Sri Lanka’s biggest and strongest brands. We look forward to having him lead and strengthen our team with the wealth of knowledge and expertise he has to offer,” said Renuka.
