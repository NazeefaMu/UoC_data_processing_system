A Life Of Dance & Drama

As the founder of nATANDA Dance Company and as a successful dancer, what does dancing mean to you?
Dance is my whole life. It allows me to be myself. As I was teaching Russian and German at the Kelaniya University, I felt I was missing something in my life and then I said good bye to that career and started dancing again. I think I made the right decision for me to do what I love to do. Dance has changed my whole life and it has helped me in so many ways to engage in the community to make my life more meaningful. I feel that I am doing something for others who have the same dream as me. Dance allows me to change my perspective in life and it teaches me how to have a balance life.
What would you say to a young person interested in learning to dance?
I would say discipline, commitment, respect, will make your great dancer. First do not think about how much you earn, first think about how much you can learn first. And commit yourself to do what you love to do. And also learn to work on time.
Could you tell us about how people of Colombo, Jaffna, Batticoloa, of different regions and races, and from different countries, came together to perform at nATFEST 2015?
nATANDA has done so many contemporary dance workshops around the Island and mostly out of Colombo for last couple of years. These workshops gave us so much experiences to work with so many different people of different social backgrounds, especially youngsters. And for us to learn from them was so enriching. We made unforgettable memories and our workshop created great bonds with people, because our primary language was dance and it is non-verbal. So the whole point of nATFEST was to bring different ethnic groups and religious groups together. And simply to reconnect and engage with everybody, to learn how to make a better world with arts and culture, where every person is accepted for who they are. Contemporary dance is a great way of enjoying this freedom of expression.
What do you think is the future of dance in Sri Lanka?
I think Sri Lanka is now waiting to see a new generation come up with new talent for dance. And I believe that we have so much talent in this country. As the founder of Sri Lanka's first professional contemporary dance company, I am so happy that we have come a long way with our work and we have got mostly international recognition. And now nATANDA is reaching out more towards the community and we see great potential from new rising dancers in nATANDA. I am also very proud to say that we have created a different dimension in the dance field in Sri Lanka. I am pretty sure that nATFEST will hoist our flag in other parts of the world with contemporary dance. I'm glad to say you'll see more surprises at nATFEST 2016 and I hope everyone will join us on that journey.
