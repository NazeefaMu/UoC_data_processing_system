How Jonny Wilkinson inspired Ayumu Goromaru

Japan fullback Ayumu Goromaru has perhaps the most eye-catching kicking style in world rugby: with both feet planted, he calmly stares at the ball and raises his arms. After a flick of the right wrist, he moulds his fingers into the shape of an imaginary gun before finally releasing his "trigger", a ferocious right foot in a sudden explosive action.
It's mesmeric to watch. From the initial calmness in approach to the tightening of his finger gloves -- which are worn to prevent the ball from slipping -- every movement is calculated and precise, a wonderful piece of engineering that has taken years to perfect. Twelve years, to be exact.
"The big reason behind my current style is down to my first year at university -- that was the year after England won the World Cup [in 2003]," Goromaru told ESPN via a translator at the team's Warwickshire hotel.
"Jonny Wilkinson came to Waseda University, who I was playing for at the time, to give kick coaching as part of an Adidas promotion. He taught me his kicking style and that helped initiate my own style.
"He came to Japan after becoming the number one kicker in the world. He was there mainly for the promotion, but afterwards he gave a kicking session for one hour. It was then I saw how much passion and great work ethic he had towards kicking. I was very impressed and touched. I still remember how stimulating that was.
"It wasn't so much the advice he gave -- it was his execution. He was kicking 5 metres in from the touchline with a very sharp angle. That is very difficult for a kicker -- and it was very windy that day. But he had a 100% success rate. I remember being shocked to see just how good he was."
Goromaru's kicking style has served him incredibly well. Following his time at Waseda, he began his professional career at Yamaha Jubilo, where he still plays in Japan's Top League today. -ESPN
