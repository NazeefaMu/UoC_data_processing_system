Prime Minister  challenges Rajapaksa to topple govt.

COLOMBO: Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday challenged Mahinda Rajapaksa to topple the current government, days after the former President expressed his intent to make a political comeback by bringing down the government this year.
“I will be going next week to Switzerland for one week giving Mahinda time to bring the government down,” Wickremesinghe told reporters here.
Rajapaksa last week has warned that the unity government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe could be toppled in 2017 through a roll of the head count in the national Parliament.
