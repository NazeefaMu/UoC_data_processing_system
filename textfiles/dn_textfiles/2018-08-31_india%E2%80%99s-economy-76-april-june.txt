India’s economy up 7.6% in April - June

India likely grew 7.6 percent in the April-June quarter, propelled in part by an improvement in manufacturing and exports, a Foreign Media poll showed. The median consensus in a poll of 50 economists put annual economic growth just a touch lower than the near two-year high of 7.7 percent in the January-March quarter. Forecasts for the $2.59 trillion economy ranged between 7.0 and 8.0 percent. (www.economictimes.com)
