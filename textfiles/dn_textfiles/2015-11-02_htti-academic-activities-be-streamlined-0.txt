HTTI academic activities to be streamlined


Academic activities of Higher Technological Training Institutions (HTTI) will be streamlined to provide a quality and capable workforce for industries set up under the government’s initiatives for industrial development, Higher Education and Highways Minister Laksman Kiriella said.
He said the subject fields and the content of the subjects taught at HTTI will be revised to suit the job market demand.
Kiriella said several mega scale industries will be set up countrywide. The minister said Korean investors will set up several industries in Kandy in due course.
"Japanese investors are also planning to set up industries here," the minister said. “It is a timely need to produce a capable and skilled workforce. Therefore, academic activities of HTTI will be streamlined aiming to produce a capable and skilled workforce.”
It has been planned to establish more HTTIs in Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ratnapura, Samanthurai, Tangalle and Vavuniya instead of the institutions established in Ampara, Badulla, Colombo, Dehiwala, Galle, Gampaha, Jaffna, Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Trincomalee.
