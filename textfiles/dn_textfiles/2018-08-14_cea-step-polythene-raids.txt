CEA to step up polythene raids

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) will step up its raids on banned polythene items with the support of the Police Environment Unit and Consumer Affairs Authority.
A blanket ban on shopping bags, lunch sheets and rigifoam lunch boxes was imposed in the country from January.
The CEA raided a large-scale lunch sheet manufacturing company in Meerigama in the Gampaha district last Saturday. Food wrappings valued at about Rs. 1 million were taken into custody and the manufacturing had been carried out using banned material without permits.
The CEA Director General said discussions were ongoing to obtain Police support in CEA raids on banned polythene items as these items affect the manufacturers and sellers of bio-degradable lunch sheet producers.
The manufacturers of biodegradable and compostable lunch sheets complain that they were unable to sell their products due to the abundance of banned lunch sheets in the market.
All Ceylon Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association Vice President Vijitha Warnakulasuriya warned that they would withdraw from importing and manufacturing bio-degradable lunch sheets as banned lunch sheets continue to invade the market.
The Gazettes Extraordinary prohibits “manufacture, sale, offer for sale, offer free of charge, exhibition or use” of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns and below, lunch sheets, grocery bags, food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene.
The use of all forms of polythene for “decorative purposes” at “political, social, religious, national, cultural or any other event or occasion” is also prohibited; including open burning of refuse and other combustible matters inclusive of plastics.
