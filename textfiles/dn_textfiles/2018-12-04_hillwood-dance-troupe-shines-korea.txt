Two dance troupes from Thailand were present as they celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations with Korea that month. Over 300 foreign dancers displayed their skills while the host country, Korea, had 16 dance troupes and 400 participants taking part in the event. Around 100 freelance dance troupes with 2000 dancers also showed their talents.
