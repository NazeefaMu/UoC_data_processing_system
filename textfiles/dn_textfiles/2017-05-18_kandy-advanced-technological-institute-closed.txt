Kandy Advanced Technological Institute closed

Students clash:
The Advanced Technological Institute in Kandy was closed indefinitely by the administrative authority following a clash between two student factions yesterday.
The authorities announced that except the Information Technology Unit, academic activities will not be held in other units until further notice.
The administration has decided to shift the Higher Technology Accounting Diploma Course to a venue in Dambawela, Ampitiya.
Investigations revealed that the pasting of a poster announcing this move had led to the clash, Kandy Police said.
