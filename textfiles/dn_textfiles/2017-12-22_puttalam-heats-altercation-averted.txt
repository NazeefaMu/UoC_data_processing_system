Puttalam heats up, altercation averted

Supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Podu Jana Peramuna averted a clash between former Minister Milroy Fernando and UPFA North Western Provincial Counsellor Trevin Fernando at Puttalam District Secretariat yesterday.
An altecation ensued when they arrived at the Puttalam District Secretariat to hand over the nomination lists for candidates contesting in the upcoming Local Government elections for SLFP and SLPP.
The scuffle began after Trevin Fernando and his supporters started shouting out slogans supporting their party (SLPP) at the same time when Milroy Fernando and his supporters were already shouting out slogans supporting their own party (SLFP).
It was reported that Milroy Fernando jostled Trevin Fernando with his elbow and pushed him. Then the people around had immediately intervened and taken them away.
Even though demonstrations are prohibited after the election date is announced, it was reported that both parties shortly after handing over their nominations staged demonstrations at the District Secretariat.
