In pursuit of happiness

Buddhism continues to acquire immense popularity in the West, despite the old misunderstanding of the ancient religion. In Sri Lanka too both creative and academic writing now focus on Buddhism. In addition, the people are exposed to a wide range of Buddhist sermonsover media – television, radio, press and the Internet that is – and have been seemingly attracted to the religion they are born with.
Still and all, the essential question remains unanswered: are we happy?
Prince Siddhartha left his luxurious life, as he noticed the grief hidden underneath. When he saw the first three ominous signs, the sick, the old and the death, he could grasp the grief embedded in one go – no one else would have had the capacity to see things that way in such simple events of life. All signs but the last must have been one whole sorry sight for him. The serenity of the robed figure’s face, the fourth and the last sign, gave him an indication where happiness could be traced.
This was a good lesson for Siddhartha to get disillusioned with the temporary happiness in the palatial riches. He left the palace in search of truth. Simply speaking he was out looking for happiness.
And the rest is history, what we have been learning by rote since our childhood. Siddhartha Gothama was enlightened under the Bo tree. What he said and did have been recorded in a colossal document called Thripitaka, thePali Canons.
We listen to and appreciate the monks trying to teach us something almost everyday, especially Poya and Sundays. Both monks and laity publish books in simple, easy-to-understand and creative language. Some books such as Saddharma Ratnavaliya teach us inspiring stories. But are we happy?
On the other hand, how can we be happy when the Buddhist philosophy is so pessimistic? Yes, this philosophy is pessimistic, as some old westerners misunderstood. Under the Bo tree the Buddha realized the world is based on impermanence.
Little do we know that is the path to happiness. When you realize the actual nature of grief, you have nothing to worry. This is precisely why arahants, except for monk Ananda, did not lament the Buddha’s great demise. Arahants are happy beings, and they see no point in lamenting something inevitable.
That’s a speck of what happiness is. One can well argue then happiness is confined to sublime humans such as arahants. Arahants are happy beings certainly, having given up all the worldly pleasures. But that does not mean happiness is something the laity cannot afford.
The laity too can afford happiness, but it’s going to be a little harder. Just to think ‘I’m happy’ because you may have got what you need temporarily does not work. It needs practice and patience far more than reading or listening to heaps of Buddhism.
First off we need to get back to basics – what we already know. The Buddha delivered how he discovered happiness especially in the very first discourses, Ananta Lakkhana and Dhamma Cakka Pavattana. It’s but one major teaching, the Four Noble Truths, he discovered on that decisive day: that the world is suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of that suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering.
See the irony. Realizing the world is suffering itself means you can discover happiness. If you know the real nature of death as it is, you would not have to mourn the death of your loved one.
If you know the majority is driven under delusion, you won’t get angry when your workmate does something really blunt.
As for Noble Truths, it’s a journey from the last to the first. A Buddhist should first concentrate on the path to the cessation of suffering, noble eight-fold path: right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration.
These eight factors are divided into three major categories: virtue (speech, action and livelihood), concentration (effort, mindfulness and concentration) and wisdom (view and intention). This is importantly linked with the three-fold fundamental teaching of any Buddha: stay away from evil deeds, busy yourself with meritorious deeds and maintain an excellent mindset.
Virtue is the first step of any procedure, whether it’s enlightenment or any other achievement. The Buddhist interpretation of lowest possible virtue means ten kinds of merits (generosity, morality, meditation, respecting those worthy of it, activities such as tidying the temples, sharing your merit, rejoicing in others’ merits, passing on the teachings, listening to the teachings and straightening your opinion about basic teachings) and five precepts (abstaining from slaughter, theft, sexual misconduct, false speech and alcohol). This kind of behaviour, in a sociological perspective, leads to a righteous and safe society. It will as well lead to your personal purification, which is more important than a righteous society.
Personal purification sets groundwork for concentration. A parable will serve to explain this.
A frustrated novice monk once wanted to disrobe. His teacher did not stand his ground, but had one wish the disciple could not evade. He cleaned the main hall of the temple just like his teacher wanted. The seats were arranged properly. Unwanted things were thrown away. And after a lapse of a few hours, the main hall looked quite neat. The novice monk was happy for himself as the teacher praised what he had done.
“You must be tired now that you have tidied the whole main hall. Why don’t you stay the night in the main hall and leave early tomorrow morning?” Disciple had no issue obeying the teacher’s request. He liked to spend one more night himself in the hall. The novice monk took a shower and stepped into the main hall. He was feeling so happy for what he had done. He realized his mind, like how the hall was a few hours ago, too was in quite a disarray. My mind can be streamlined too this way, he realized. As minutes turned into hours, his mind gradually got used to concentration. Apparently he didn’t leave the monastery the following day. The only way to concentration is meditation, which is of course not a piece of cake for an untrained mind. Cultivated virtue is a prerequisite for meditation. You can contemplate the cultivated virtue as well as shunned evil before meditation – that is the neatly arranged temple-hall which set a proper environment for the monk to meditate.
This is, in a way, an act of truth.
