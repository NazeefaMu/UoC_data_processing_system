Shangri-La Hotel holds  recruitment campaign

Eager job seekers attended the recent recruitment campaign of the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo, due to open later this year. The campaign was held at the BMICH from May 4 to 6.

We are delighted with the enthusiasm of our potential colleagues and look forward to working together to create a true Shangri-La experience here in Colombo."
The hotel staff held activities such as an in-house talent show, fun photo booth and a selfie corner to help bring out the personalities of the candidates.
The campaign focused on selecting the right profile which goes beyond the typical job description and clearly identifies how the employee will contribute to the hotel's primary objective in employee loyalty to achieve excellence.
