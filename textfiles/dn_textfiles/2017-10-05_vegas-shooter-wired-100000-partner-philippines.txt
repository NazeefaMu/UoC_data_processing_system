Vegas shooter wired $100,000 to partner in Philippines

Shooter's girlfriend returns to U.S.
THE PHILIPPINES: Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines who travelled there last month, authorities in Manila said Wednesday, citing the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said the FBI, its US counterpart, had sought help in finding Marilou Danley.
“Danley arrived in the Philippines last month, and then there was a wire transfer to her account for $100,000 from Stephen,” NBI spokesman Nick Suarez told AFP.
Danley is an Australian citizen who moved to the United States 20 years ago to work on the casino strip, the Australian government confirmed Tuesday.
“There are reports her ID was used for booking the hotel or some such detail,” Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock returned to the United States on Wednesday from the Philippines, as authorities in Manila said they were looking into reports he transferred $100,000 to her.
Marilou Danley flew out of Manila's international airport on Tuesday night for Los Angeles, immigration bureau spokeswoman Maria Antoinette Mangrobang told AFP.
She was met in the United States Tuesday evening local time -- Wednesday in the Philippines -- by FBI agents. The 62 year-old is classified as a “person of interest” to investigators but remains free to go wherever she wants, US media reported.
The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said the FBI, its US counterpart, had sought help in finding Danley.
“The FBI has coordinated with the Philippine office of the Interpol to look for her,” NBI spokesman Nick Suarez told AFP.
