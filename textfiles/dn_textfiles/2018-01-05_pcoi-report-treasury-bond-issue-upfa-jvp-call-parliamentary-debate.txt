PCoI report on Treasury Bond issue: UPFA, JVP call for Parliamentary debate

The United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have suggested that a special Parliamentary session be summoned to debate the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into the Treasury Bonds issue.
UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a large number of SLFP Parliamentarians, including Ministers and Deputy Ministers have expressed their concern to summon Parliament to have a debate in this regard,” he added.
Speaking on the Commission report of the monetary irregularities, the Minister said the Government does not need to cover or hide any misconduct even it has been taken place under the previous regime or under this Government.
“Not only the Commission report on the Treasury Bond issue, but also the Commission report of the monetary irregularities have also been debated in Parliament.
“All Parliamentarians can participate in the debate on these two Commission reports. Media personnel can also produce investigative reports on these two issues,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has requested for the immediate convening of Parliament to discuss the recommendations of the report on the President Commission of Inquiry on the issuance of Central Bank Treasury Bonds.
Parliament sources revealed in a letter addressed to the Speaker of Parliament yesterday that the JVP requests the convening of Parliament before January 23 which was fixed for earlier.
Sources also revealed that the JVP was of the view that there is a grave need for Parliament to be convened soon in light of the President’s special statement that the commission has recommended the amendment of several pieces of Legislation pertaining to the governing of the Central Bank and for the government to reclaim the lost money.
The JVP also requested the Speaker to hold a Party Leaders’ Meeting to convene Parliament at the earliest.
