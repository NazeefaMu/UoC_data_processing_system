Committee for NP resettlement

The Cabinet on Tuesday appointed a committee to look into the resettlement process in the Northern Province.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday, said the committee included Minister Rishad Bathuideen to look into the issues of Muslims, Minister Duminda Dissanayake to look into the issues of the Sinhalese, and Wanni District SLFP MP Kader Masthan to look into the issues of the displaced in the Vavuniya district.
He further stated that Minister Rauf Hakeem too had requested that he be included in the committee, but the President had pointed out that it was only for the North which was not under Hakeem’s purview.
