‘Raid Amazones’ Female Adventure Challenge in Passikudah bay and Thoppigala

The 18th edition of ‘Raid Amazones’ the world’s biggest female adventure challenge is to be held in Sri Lanka in two legs in 2018/19. The first leg will be held from 11 to 19 October 2018 and again in 2019 from in March. The event will be held in the East coast of Sri Lanka in and around Passikudha, Thoppigala and Kalkudah.
This international event is held once a year in a different country with around 500 to 600 participants competing in a week long multi-sport adventure challenge. In teams of two or three, the participants will compete in challenges such as, Orienteering Cycling; Canoeing; Running and Archery. All the activities designed to test the skill, determination and teamwork of the contestants.
This 100% female event provides an opportunity for women to test their mental and physical endurance all whilst enjoying the beautiful environment and enthralling culture of the host country.
The events will be spread around the east coast, providing much needed exposure to the relatively newer east coast tourism sector as well as showcasing the beauty, potential and viability of the formerly war-tornregion. Locations, such as Thoppigala, have been seldom visited by tourist and will provide the ideal backdrop for events. Raid Amazon is likely to play a key role in promoting and incentivizing more adventure-based tourism events to come to Sri Lanka and the east coast.
In addition, the Raid Amazones comes with immense international media coverage for the eventvia print, television, radio, internet and social media providing excellent exposure for Sri Lanka as a country and tourism destination.
“This coverage will create international publicity and awareness for the host destination estimated to be worth around $10 Million,” said Alexandre Dabanne, Organizer Raid Amazones at the event launch held at the Ceylon Hotel School, Monara Restaurant which was organized by Connaissance De Ceylan in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism.
The event will be organized by French based ZBO and their local partner Connaissance de Ceylan, which have 35 years of experience within the tourism sector.
