Precifac requests extension, Bond Commission gets six weeks

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has submitted a request to extend its term to prepare its report. PRECIFAC Secretary H.W. Gunadasa said they are yet to receive an official response with regard to the request.
Gunadasa said the request for an extension was sent two weeks back. The term of the Commission is to end on November 3, 2017.
Meanwhile, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue received an extension of six weeks to submit its report. Thus the new deadline for the report submission will be December 8, 2017.
The mandate period of the Commission was to end on October 27, 2017. The Commission concluded its hearing on October 8, 2017.
