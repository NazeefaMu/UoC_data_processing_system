SLC will fully back Kusal's case

 
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will take every possible measure to reduce the impending four-year-ban on Sri Lankan opener Kusal Janith Perera, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told the Daily News yesterday.
"There was no communication in this regard between the ICC and the SLC on Monday. However, we all know that Kusal is facing the risk of a four-year ban. Therefore, the SLC has decided to back the Sri Lankan player and support his appeal," the Minister said.
Jayasekera also added that the Sri Lankan cricketer had to undergo two more tests before the ICC's final decision on the matter. "The final decision, as far as I know, can be expected within the next few weeks," he said.
"We have already hired international lawyers to support Kusal's case and we will bear the expenses. There will be no pressure on the player.
We will not leave him stranded and we are positive about the outcome of inquiries," the Minister added.
