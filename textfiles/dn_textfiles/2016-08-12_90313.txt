Samarakoon gets  another chance  at a medal

 
RIO DE JANEIRO, THURSDAY: Sri Lanka’s ace shooter Mangala Samarakoon will be seen in action for the second time at the XXX1st Olympic Games when he takes part in the men’s 50m rifle prone event qualification round at Olympic Shooting Range, commencing from 9 am on Friday (5.30 pm SL time).
The former South Asian Games gold medallist who came across an unexpected problem due to his shooting attire and painted a poor picture in the men’s 10m air rifle event three days ago will not have the same worry in the prone event.
“The problem with my shooting bottom, that does not support the grip after modification, does not arise here in the prone event. I will forget the bitter experience I had in the 10m air rifle event and take this as a new meet, a challenge,” Samarakoon said on the eve of his second and last event.
“Despite all those setbacks, I have been training hard and concentrating on my 50m prone event. I want to bounce back and fire a good score. I will try my best to achieve that,” said Samarakoon who is competing in his second successive Olympic Games after London 2012. He completed his final work out today under the watchful eyes of his coach Pushpamali Ramanayake, the 1992 Barcelona Olympian and a gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games.
There will be a total of 47 shooters who will take part in the men’s 50m rifle prone event and the Lankan lad has a personal best entry score of 1,941.
