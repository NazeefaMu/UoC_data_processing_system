40 model villages for Kurunegala

Steps are being taken to set up 40 model villages in the Kurunegala District this year, said Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and Housing and Construction Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake, speaking to the media yesterday at the Nikaweratiya SLFP office.
“About 1,000 new houses are to be constructed under this programme which is to be implemented under the guidance of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa and myself,” Bandaranayake said.
These houses will be given to public servants and low-income families who have no houses of their own. The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) would carry out this massive project covering all 30 Divisional Secretary divisions within the district. Government land has already been identified for this purpose and those who wish to build houses under this project would be awarded with a soft loan of Rs.500,000 each, he said.
