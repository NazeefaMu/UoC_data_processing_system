Kingswood students barred from sitting term tests

Over a hundred students studying at Kingswood College, Kandy faced inconvenience as the school authorities barring them from sitting for the term test owing to their failure to pay the fees for school development committee in totality.The students who failed to make the complete payments were ordered to stay away from the examination hall, when the question papers were being distributed. The parents of these students have made a formal complaint with the Kandy Zonal Education Director W.M Wijayaratna. The Zonal Education Director on being informed about this situation sent a letter by fax ordering the principal to allow those students to sit for the term test.
The Zonal Director had pointed out that there is no connection with the non payment of school development committee fees and the term test and requested him to allow them to sit for the examination.
Meanwhile, the school principal said that parents of these students are deliberating not making the payments. The students of low income families do not need to make such payments. “But, they are required to furnish a letter from the respective Grama Niladhari citing that the student in question belongs to a low income family,”he said.
