SLC begins process to clear him
Kusal Perera took drug treatment for a leech bite

Sri Lanka’s exciting young batsman Kusal Perera tested positive for a banned substance by the ICC took medical treatment after being bitten by a leech on his foot during the home series against Pakistan last June, SLC sources have stated.
Perera was administered the drug to cure him from the bite by one of the Sri Lankan team physios, but where the physio and Perera erred was that they failed to inform the ICC about the use of the drug as should be the case.
Sri Lanka Cricket interim committee has seven days ie time till December 14 to send a formal notification to the ICC in writing that they wish to have the B sample also analysed.
The SLC IC it is learnt has agreed in principle to undertake the total cost for testing and requested the ICC to arrange a neutral venue for the testing to take place.
In the event of the B sample also proving to be positive, SLC IC has decided to pursue legal action to clear Perera.
Pursuant to Article 7.1.3.3 of the Code states:
“8. You have the right to defend this charge (at your own cost), and to have a hearing before the Tribunal in accordance with Article 8 of the Code. If you wish to have such a hearing (which may be carried out by video-conference, if convenient to all parties), you MUST file a written request for such a hearing with the ICC as soon as possible, but in any event within fourteen days of your receipt of this letter, i.e. by no later than 5 pm (UAE time) on 21 December 2015.
“Such written request should also include your initial response to the charge contained herein (namely whether you admit or deny the charge), together with an explanation (in summary form) of the basis of such response. You would then have an opportunity to provide a full response at a later date.”
