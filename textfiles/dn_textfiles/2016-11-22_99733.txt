Return of a franchise after 15 years

When a film becomes a hit, it’s quite common for the makers to develop it into a franchise. After all, they want to capitalise on the former’s success. However, it’s not often that a sequel is made a decade and a half after the success of the first movie. That’s what sets writer-filmmaker Anubhav Sinha’s ‘Tum Bin 2’, featuring Aditya Seal, Neha Sharma and Aashim Gulati, apart.
Five reasons that make it an interesting watch...
1. Love franchise after 15 years
The first outing, ‘Tum Bin’, was a surprise hit when it released in 2001. Backed by an excellent soundtrack, the romantic drama was loved by all and fared well at the box office despite being pitted against biggies. It remains to be seen how the audience reacts to ‘Tum Bin 2’, especially since it is releasing 15 years after its prequel.
2. The music has struck a chord with listeners
Young singer-composer Ankit Tiwari has created a soundtrack that not only boasts of melodious songs like ‘Ishq Mubarak’, ‘Dekh Lena’ and ‘Dil Nawaziyaan’ but also caters to the young audience. Moreover, the producers have recreated late Jagjit Singh’s song ‘Koi Fariyad’ from ‘Tum Bin’ as ‘Teri Fariyaad’ for the sequel with supporting vocals by Rekha Bhardwaj.
3. Director Anubhav Sinha lends his technical expertise
The writer-filmmaker has ensured that he has captured the picturesque locations of Scotland beautifully on celluloid. His attention to detail also inspired his actors to give their best shot, making the storytelling more impactful.
4. An interesting mix of supporting cast
Seasoned actors like Kanwaljit Singh and Meher Vij (of ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ fame) play pivotal roles in the movie. Moreover, West Indian cricketer Dwayne Bravo also has a special appearance. Television actress Mouni Roy will also be seen sizzling in ‘Nachna Aaonda Nahin’, a recreated version of the famous Punjabi folk number by the same name.
5. A complete family entertainer
The makers promise clean refreshing content with all the ingredients that are bound to wow the young and old alike. Times of India
