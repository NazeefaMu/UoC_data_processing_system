Narahenpita to receive early cancer detection centre

A new early cancer detection centre and hearing defects prevention centre will be set up at Narahenpita, soon. Dialog and the Rotary Club donated Rs. 185 million for the project, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa signed for the agreement on behalf of the Health Ministry, while Dialog Chief Executive Officer Supun Weerasinghe signed for the agreement on behalf of the company.
After signing the agreement, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the project was scheduled to be launched in 2004, but it was delayed for 13 years due to various reasons.
Colombo Rotary Club Head Ven. Bandagiriye Somawansha Thera, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Dialog staff, and many others were present during the ceremony, he added.
