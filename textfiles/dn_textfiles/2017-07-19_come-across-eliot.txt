To come across Eliot

As far back as the first decade of the sixties, our English lecturer requested to know what T S Eliot (1888 – 1965) declared about the status of literature, culture and criticism. All of us had to purchase a book full of his ideas titled as ‘Selected Prose’ as edited by a scholar named John Hayward.
The edition that is left with me at the moment is moth-eaten, but still the material comes closer to me as it happened in the past. As an undergraduate I came to know more about Thomas Stearns Eliot via the book full of short essays, both illuminating and resourceful. The most significant statement of Eliot went as follows:
“From time to time, every hundred years or so, it is desirable that some critic shall appear to review the past of our literature and set the poets and the poems in a new order…”
Distant perspective
Then the critic Eliot goes on to expand the ideas further stating that this task is not one of the revolutions but of a readjustment. What we observe partly is the same scene but in a different and more distant perspective. There are new and strange objects in the foreground to be drawn accurately in proportion to the more familiar ones which now approach the horizon, where all but the most eminent become invisible to the naked eye.
These statements appear in the essay of Eliot titled as ‘The Function of Criticism’, which, if I remember right, became one of the most profound and lasting visions. For us it was a matter of reading several times in order to grasp the inner meanings of Eliot. His brevity in the use of language happened to be the hallmark in his approach to literary views. In the essay titled ‘Criticism’, he laid down that ‘criticism must always profess an end in view, which roughly speaking, appears to be the elucidation of works of art and the correction of taste.’
What then is the function of the critic?
Eliot declares that the Critic’s task appears to be quite clearly cut out for him, and it ought to be comparatively easy to decide whether he performs it satisfactorily, and, in general what kinds of criticism are useful and what are unwanted and erroneous. Is literary criticism an aesthetic judgement? It happened to be one of the foremost questions raised by Eliot. He was positive about it in many of his writings.
Habitual actions
For instance, he declared that comparison and analysis are the chief tools of the critic – why did he say, happened to be the question raised by most of us. Eliot responds to the question as it is obvious indeed that they are tools to be handled with care, and not employed in an imagery into the number of times, giraffes mentioned in the English novel.
On reading the essay titled ‘Tradition’, for a moment I felt as if I am reading the Buddha’s Kalama Sutta. For Eliot states that tradition is not solely or even primarily the maintenance of certain dogmatic beliefs. These beliefs have come to take their living form in the course of a tradition. What Eliot means by tradition involves all those habitual actions, habits and customs from the most significant religious rite to our conventional way of greeting a stranger, which represent the blood kinship of the same people living in the same place.
T S Eliot is said to have studied most of the religious doctrines in the orient as well as in order to compose his poems like ‘The Wasteland’, where he makes the reader feel the emergence of a new world with the utterances of the man in the Rig Veda which goes as ‘Ohm Shanti Shanti Shanti’. One of the most sensitive questions raised by Eliot happened to be the need to transmit the validity of spiritualism to the modern world for the betterment of living conditions.
Eliot’s ideas on Religion, Culture and Society were initially laid down in the essay titled as ‘The Idea of Christian Society and Notes towards the definition of culture’.
Literary stream
Perhaps a reader of the essay may find that Eliot was more of a futurist or a prophet. The poetic plays of Eliot such as Murder in the Cathedral have placed him as the most spiritual and most influential poet of the century. He was born at St Louis, Missouri in the US and came to England to settle down and was engaged initially as a bank clerk. Staying for eight years in London, he entered the main literary stream as the editor of a literary journal Criterion.
This enabled him to joining the publishing firm Faber and Faber while working in the publishing firm, he had the grand opportunity of bringing out some of the best literary works such as Four Quartets, The Cocktail Party, The Confidential Clerk to name a few. In 1948, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Most of his poems, essays and plays have been translated and adopted to many languages.
The World Service of BBC, where I worked for a few years, once paid him a tribute by a series of discussions in the form of a live and creative dialogue with him, excerpting passages from his works. I feel that it is the function of the English teacher to reassess and or rediscover the great writer of the century.
Though Eliot became a British citizen in 1927 and has spent the greater part of his life in England. Some social critics believed that Eliot was an exponent of conservatism and tradition in literature, politics, and religion and his experience with the use of language and form in poetry. Some others believe that though the frame of his thought was conservative, the picture within the frame can be said to come closer to painters like Picasso and Dali.
