Neon technicolour basketball court

Paris just got even cooler, because now the city has a neon technicolour basketball court with some serious 80’s video game undertones – the new ultimate play-time spot for Instagramers and style-savvy folks.
The court was brought by the French fashion brand Pigalle and design agency Ill-Studio. Actually, this is not the first time Pigalle decorated the court – they painted it back in 2015, too – but with the recent upgrade, they’re taking it to the next level.
The court is squeezed in between two old apartment buildings in the 9th arrondissement. This grey/beige background makes the court’s pop of neon colors even more dramatic and recognizable.
The project was sponsored by Nike, a brand that already worked with Pigalle on a number of occasions. In fact, just this week, a new collection was announced in which the two companies collaborate, bringing sports and high fashion even closer together.
So, if you’re in Paris any time soon, don’t forget to visit the spot for a basketball game – or an original Insta feed update.
