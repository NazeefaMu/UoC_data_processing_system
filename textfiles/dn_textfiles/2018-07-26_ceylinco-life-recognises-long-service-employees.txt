Ceylinco Life recognises long service employees

Ceylinco Life recently felicitated 537 employees with Long Service Awards, recognising the loyalty of permanent employees that have served the Company for 10 years or more, at a gala celebration.
Plaques of appreciation and cash rewards were presented to employees in five categories, for service periods extending to 30 years or more, at this event themed ‘30 Years of Caring’ in appreciation of the fact that the life insurance leader celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year. Chairman of Ceylinco Insurance PLC Mr Godwin Perera was the Chief Guest at the event.
The largest number of employees felicitated (184) was in the 10 to 14 years group, followed by 128 in the 15 – 19 years group, 120 in the 20 – 24 years group and 101 in the 25 to 29 years group. Three Directors and an employee who had served the company for more than 30 years were also among the recipients of long service awards.
“We are proud to say that our credo for life insurance -- ‘A Relationship for Life’-- clearly also applies to our employees,” Ceylinco Life’s Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan said. “Consistency is an important virtue in financial services in particular, and having such large numbers of employees that have served the company for more than 20 years, not only means that the company has extremely experienced personnel, but that there is uniformity in the observance of core values and practices.”
He pointed out that employees honoured for long service this year represented 61 per cent of the permanent staff of Ceylinco Life, meaning that nearly two thirds of employees have more than 10 years of experience in the company.
Organised by the Employees’ Union of the company, Ceylinco Life’s Long Service Awards are held every five years. The 2018 edition was the fourth in the series.
Ceylinco Life commenced operations on 14th January 1998, and has been the market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry for 14 of the 30 years it has been in operation.
