We need to negotiate Cremer to win – Dimuth

Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne said that Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer who is the only wrist spinner in their line-up would pose a threat to Sri Lanka winning the one-off Test match at the R Premadasa Stadium.
“Cremer is a different bowler compared to the rest. He is bowling on good areas and turning well. Other than that, I don’t think there will be a much of a threat from the other bowlers,” said Karunaratne. “Other than that ball from Sean Williams (off which Karunaratne got bowled) I had no trouble. I was always getting the single I wanted. There will the odd ball turning but Cremer is a threat. He is bowling well.
“We can’t go for survival. We’ll have to play shots but we’ll have to be smart. If one batsman gets set against Cremer, runs will flow. Then they will be under pressure and they’ll have to spread out the field. We’ll have to put them under pressure.
“What Sean is doing is that he pegs the batsman down and forces him to commit a mistake against Cremer. Other than those two, I don’t think there will be such a big threat. But the reality is that those two cannot keep bowling right throughout the day. So we’ll see how the wicket behaves and set a plan.”
Karunaratne was confident that Sri Lanka has a good chance of knocking the runs off.
“I do believe that we can make it. We have already scored 170 for three wickets and we need only 218 more. On the other hand, we batted when the ball was hard but now that hardness is gone. All what they have now is the support from that rough. Angie (Angelo Mathews) and Kusal (Mendis) are set now. If those two guys keep on batting for an hour or more tomorrow morning they can get set again. If that happens, I don’t think it’s easy to get them out unless we do something silly,” said Karunaratne.
“Zimbabwe are bowling on the leg side with more fielders. So we need to have a plan to change that field may be play a reverse sweep. If we do that, we will be able to put some runs on the board quickly. If we go to survive, we’re losing the opportunity to win the match. We need to go on a positive mind to score 218 runs and win the game. Once we get closer, then we can take a call on it, whether to go for the target or go for a draw. But the most important thing is to have wickets in hand. So tomorrow’s first session is very crucial for us,” he said. – ST
