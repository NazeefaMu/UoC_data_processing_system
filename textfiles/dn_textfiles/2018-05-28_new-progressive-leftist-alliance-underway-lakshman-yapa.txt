New progressive leftist alliance underway: Lakshman Yapa

The first of the island-wide public forums titled Hurdha Sakshiye Nidahasa (Freedom of Conscience) organised by the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members of parliament who quit the national government and opted to sit in the Opposition on May 8, was held at Uyanwatta in Matara, last Saturday (26).
“We hope to form a new progressive leftist alliance and nominate someone acceptable by all as its candidate for the next Presidential election,” former Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
“The sixteen of us decided to leave the national government last September as we realised that the country was deteriorating as neither the members of the SLFP nor the United National Party (UNP) nor any other citizens were secure. We were compelled to postpone our decision because President Maithripala Sirisena requested us to stay with the government at least until December, 2017. We knew in advance that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would win the No-Confidence Motion against him. But staying true to our conscience, we voted in favor of it,” he added.
The 16 SLFP MPs who joined the ranks of the Opposition on May 8, were Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S.B.Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena, T. B. Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. Fourteen of the 16 MPs except Anura Yapa and T. B. Ekanayaka, were in Matara last Saturday. They paid homage to the sacred Matara Bhodiya and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha before walking across to the Uyanwatta stadium.
Former Minister Susil Premajayantha said that the policies as well as the expectations of the members of the SLFP and the UNP, were different even though they agreed to form a national government for a period of two years. He said that as it was the SLFP that insisted that a Presidential Commission be appointed to investigate the Central Bank bond issue, every SLFP MP should have voted in favor of the No-Confidence Motion brought against the PM. He also briefly spoke on a 20-point policy drawn up by the group, to guide the country to self-sufficiency and economic prosperity.
Former Minister S. B. Dissanayake said that their attempts taken to persuade President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa to contest the last general election as well as the local government election by forming a common alliance, had failed. He also blamed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for all the hardships the people were facing at present.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that it was because of the SLFP's representation in Cabinet that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was unable to do as he pleased and had to either withdraw or amend many Cabinet proposals such as the Port City Agreement and the Hambantota Port Deal, which were not in the best interest of the nation.
Badulla District MP Dilan Perera, who was the last speaker of the day, said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party could never be destroyed, evident by all previous failed attempts.
“This union between the SLFP and the UNP will never bear results. The 16 of us have only one mission in mind and that is to loosen the noose which is throttling the nation, rather than covering things up,” he said.
Ratnapura District MP John Seneviratne, Professors Gamini Samaranayaka and Professor Methsiri Jayathilake also spoke.
