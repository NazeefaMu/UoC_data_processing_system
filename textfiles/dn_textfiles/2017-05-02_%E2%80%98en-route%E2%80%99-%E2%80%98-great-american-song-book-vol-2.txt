‘En Route’ to ‘The Great  American  Song Book - vol 2'

Fans of American popular music of the early and mid 20th century have an event to look forward to and a date to keep.Colombo’s popular Jazz outfit “En Route” led by Saxophonist cum Vocalist Gananath Dasanayaka will perform live in concert “The Great American Song Book – Vol 2” on May 27 at the British School Auditorium from 8 pm. This will be the Band’s third concert following the much acclaimed Tribute to Sinatra in December 2015 and Volume 1 of “The Great American Song Book” in September 2016.
Though not quite certain and anxious of the audience response, Gananath and his talented band of musicians took the plunge in paying tribute to Frank Albert Sinatra on his 100th Birth anniversary on December 12, 2015. Their anxiety was unfounded. The concert delivered to a packed auditorium was a resounding success. Particularly to those such as the writer, starved of live music of the 1940s and 50s, the evening was an oasis from which to quench a long felt thirst. The repertoire included many popular Sinatra standards rendered by Gananath with panache and so ably supported by the versatile Band.
The legend “Ol Blue Eyes” himself would have been delighted to know that a group of musicians far away from his adopted home in the USA, paid tribute to his class and style before a highly appreciative audience in a packed Colombo auditorium in celebration of the centenary of his birth.
The success of the Tribute to Sinatra encouraged “En Route” to broaden their canvass. It resulted in the first presentation of “The Great American Song Book” in September 2016. “The Great American Song Book” also known as “American Standards” is described as the canon of the most influential American popular songs and Jazz standards from the early 20th Century. A selection of songs from this genre sung by Gananath and backed by flamboyant musicians including Maxwell Peirterz on double bass, Debbie Arnolda on Piano, Niroshan De Silva on Drums and Ramesh Nonis on guitar, left the audience bewitched for a full hour and fifteen minutes. Dilip Senewiratne on the organ as a “guest artiste” added to the lustre of the show. The songs ranged from Swing Ballads to spirituals, including “New York”, “Mack the Knife” and “Ol Man River”. The evening also brought back memories of the “Rat pack” days with a Dean Martin and Sammy Davis “look a like” joining “Sinatra” in song and laughter to a readily responsive audience.
Encouraged by its successful foray into big band Jazz “En Route” now present their 3rd concert building on the theme “The Great American Song Book”.
The repertoire for the evening will include among others, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” by Judy Garland, Sinatra’s standards such as “Summer wind”, “Lady is a Tramp”, I’ve got you under my skin” and Dean Martin hits “Amore” and “King of the Road”.Proceeds of the concert, as in the case of the earlier one, will be donated to the Music Project an approved charity, to help less affluent Sri Lankan children enhance music skills.
