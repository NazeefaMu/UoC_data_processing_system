Revision petitions filed by Aloysius fixed for March 9

 
A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena who are arrested and remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance was today fixed for March 9.
Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratn informed that the order regarding whether notices should be issued on respondents in respect of the revision petition would be announced on March 9.
Through this revision application, Aloysius and Palisena sought an order against the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court’s refusal to grant bail on February 16.
The petitioner is also seeking an order to release him on bail.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
