Public funds put to good use now - Justice Minister

The government has endeavoured to cut down state expenditure unlike the previous regime which wasted public money on personal aggrandisement, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
She also pointed out that both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are exemplary in creating a culture where politicians do not waste public money for their personal well-being.
She made these observations at a ceremony marking the commencement of concreting Kurudukolaniya road in Karawita.
“Today you see both the President and the PM making official foreign visits the same way other regular people do. But when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa went for foreign tours, he paraded over 250 people with him and wasted public money that could have been invested in road development projects,” Minister Athukorale said.
“When former President Rajapaksa’s wife went to Paris for the Vesak Day celebrations in 2014, she used a hotel room which charged Rs. 25 million for just one night stay. Their sons also wasted so much of public money for car races.” she furthered.
Minister Athukorale also pointed out that the present government has assured freedom of press and the independence of the judiciary system from which certain groups are trying to take wrongful advantages. “Many people questions as to why certain legal actions are not taken against certain issues. We cannot just prioritise certain cases or influence the judiciary system to do so.” she explained.
Minister Athukorale also pointed out that the present government does not do political favourations. “There was a time when Samurdhi was given to people selectively. This approach has changed now.” she said.
Rs. 13 million is allocated to the Kurudukolaniya road development project which is under the Pibidena Nivithigala program conducted by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs.
