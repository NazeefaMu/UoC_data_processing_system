Many MPs leaving ‘Pohottuwa’: Kiriella

Join Opposition (Jo) parliamentarians from the ‘Pohottuwa’ party were leaving it in great numbers after realising that they have no future in the party, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was addressing the media after handing over the election deposits of UNP candidates for the Kandy MC and the Gangawata Korale Pradesheeya Sanbha at the Kandy Elections Office on December 16.
“No other party can offer a strong challenge to the UNP today. The UNP defeated the SLFP and JO combine at the last general election,” he said.
He said people in the Kandy district had ensured a convincing victory to the UNP at the last presidential and general elections and they were certain to ensure a UNP victory at the local elections as well.
Kirella said the Kandy City would undergo a wide-scale transformation in development under a Japanese aid scheme shortly.
“This development project undertaken under the direction of the Prime Minister would usher further progress to the region,” he said. Minister Kiriella, who predicted that the present government would remain in power till 2025, added that ensuring a UNP victory at the local councils would enable the government to implement ‘Yahapalanaya’ policies at village level too.
He said the UNP nomination list for the Kandy Municipal Council included several former mayors as well. He said that under the new election laws, the member commanding the trust and confidence of the majority of the elected membership would be appointed as the mayor.
