NEED OF AN INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE

Response to Father Augustine Fernando:
Rev. Fr. Augustine Fernando, in the Opinion p.11 DN May 30, 2017, has said a mouthful and warned of dire consequences of religious tension that is seemingly building up, and stresses the need for an inter-religious dialogue, not only to avert an oncoming disaster, but also to build up a stable and peaceful society. If we are to learn a lesson from previous events, right action seems to come too late. A case in point is the language issue; the LSSP and the CP who championed the cause for one united country by granting parity of status for both Sinhala and Tamil languages were treated derogatorily and the lives of the leaders were threatened. Ironically, half a century later, both languages have now become official languages, and it is not difficult to surmise that had the right step been taken at that time, the 30 year ‘war’, with its heavy toll, may have been averted!
Rev. Fr. AF humbly states, “…I must also be willing to let my narrow understanding of truth be broken open to learn my own beliefs better by understanding the other, and in this way to let myself be furthered on the path to God…” A similar view was expressed by Rev. Dulip de Chickera, when we met at the cremation of Rev. Prof. Dhammavihari (former Professor of Buddhist Philosophy at Peradeniya); he went on to say “…my association with the monk enabled me to understand Christianity better”.
My English Language teacher at Royal College explained to the class the word ‘Catholic’- as being derived from the Greek word ‘katholikos’ meaning ‘universal’. In the Buddha’s teachings we come across ‘sabbe sattha bhavanthu sukhitattha’ meaning ‘may all beings be well and happy’. When these were mentioned during a commemoration of a religious event, a Muslim gentleman came up to me and asked me if I knew the meaning of the word ‘Islam’- he said Islam meant ‘peace’. According to the Bhagavadgitha ‘dvau bhutasargau loke’ smindaiva ….’ there are only two types of men in this world, the one possessing a divine nature and the other possessing a demoniac disposition. Thus the universal nature and peace promoting ideal of all major religions, for all people, is unequivocal.
Inter-religious dialogue
Rev. Fr. AF emphatically states, preventing a catastrophe is by way of an inter-religious dialogue. Such activity will expose one to others of different faiths, learn to respect each other, see the other’s point of view and stop being narrow-minded. The ultimate reality is in progress, not in dogma and bigotry. When one thinks he knows, he stops seeing, as knowledge tends to stand in the way of truth.
At present, there is some amount of dialogue at the top, amongst leaders of the different religions. Such once in a while dialogue involving only a few individuals will not produce the desired result, as it does not trickle down to the masses – the followers of the different religions. To have any significant effect, the people should start talking to each other, opening themselves to the followers of other world religions, understanding their faith and beginning to respect them. The dialogue should be open and honest, helping others to see the world the way it is. Lies should not be uttered for the sake of one’s own mental health; honesty with nothing to hide will make life easy.
The stage is well set for such dialogue, if only the opportunity is grabbed. In our country, we have 25 public holidays; barring only two – the independence commemoration and the May Day, they are all linked to the various nationalities and religions. Declaration of a public holiday is for the purpose of commemorating an event, but how many of us can honestly say we engage in some activity connected with such event?
A practical approach would be to restructure our public holidays. In addition to the Independence commemoration and May Day, Thai-Pongal, National New Year (two days), Vesak (two days), Poson, Ramazan and Christmas – this group of ten days only, could constitute our national holidays.
The remaining ten Poya days, Hadji, Prophet Mohammed’s Birthday, Mahasivarathri, Deepawali and Good Friday may be made full working days, with the exception that the first two hours i.e. 8 am to 10 am, be spent in an activity devoted to the significance of that particular day’s event.
On a Poya day, a bana preaching/meditation for one hour, followed by an hour’s dialogue. Similarly, on Hadji and Prophet Mohammed’s Birthday, an hour’s programme on some aspect of Islam, on Deepavali and Mahasivarathri day a Hindu Religious/Cultural programme of one hour, and on Good Friday, a prayer service and talk on aspects of Christianity, of one hour’s duration, and each of the sessions followed by an hour’s dialogue.
This will ensure that everyone will at least spend some time meaningfully, in observance of the particular event commemorated on that day.
Different religious and ethnic groups
It will also promote understanding of the different religions and cultures, and integration and harmony amongst the different religious and ethnic groups, as all separate groups will jointly be involved in arranging and participating in each other’s function, and after a good healthy dialogue, getting back to work after partaking in fellowship and refreshments.
Such activity well planned and executed in work places and schools will ensure that the inter-religious dialogue will trickle down to every strata of society; it will promote better understanding and respect for each other’s cultures, build bridges, facilitate cross faith interactions, build new friendships and regain inter community trust essential for ensuring harmony and oneness. As Rev. Fr. AF says, “In sincere dialogue, we discover that which is good, true, beautiful and holy in other religions and begin to appreciate it”.
As an added benefit, we will be curtailing the number of special holidays, increasing the number of working days, thereby helping the country’s smooth administration and economy.
It is imperative that preventive action is instituted swiftly, people made knowledgeable and prepared ethically and morally, as the rabble rousers come disguised and have to be beaten at any cost before they can strike the death blow on our beloved Nation. It is the people’s power only that can defeat such destructive activity; let’s empower them and save our Nation.
