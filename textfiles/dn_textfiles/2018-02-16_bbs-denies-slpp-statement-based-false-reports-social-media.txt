BBS denies SLPP statement based on false reports on social media

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday condemned the new release issued by SLPP leader Prof. G.L. Peiris, based on false reports that the Bodu Bala Sena organization would continue its anti-Muslim programmes after the SLPP victory.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, yesterday, Ven. Thera said the BBS had not issued any such statement to the media.
He said that the BBS had not inserted any advertisement or news release on the internet thanking the voters for the SLPP victory and also saying that BBS would continue the anti-Muslim campaign. The BBS has no involvement in such news published on a website.
“We all know that there are a number of fake news stories getting more popular on social media and there is no method to control them. Prof. Peiris should have carefully examined whether this news is fake or not before issuing the statement. We have asked the Police to investigate the incident to get to know the persons behind those false notices aimed at tarnishing the image of the BBS,” Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said.
The BBS has never engaged in party politics and campaigning at any election.
“The BBS has no intention to start a conflict with any party. The country is now in a state of anarchy. MPs are now being traded to form a new government, while most of politicians are reluctant to give up their posts. We must have a lot of patience to deal with this situation, while acting very carefully, because this kind of situation has not been experienced previously in Sri Lanka. We must also be vigilant on international influences at this juncture,” he added.
“However, we are happy that SLPP as a new political party obtained a majority with the support of various segments of society. This has clearly shown the popularity of the former President,” he said.
“We have explained our position on the Muslim issue to all ruling leaders in the power previously. But, nothing has happened so far and no proper solution given to the issue yet. We urge the government to establish Independent Commissions to resolve the problem and finding the actual part of the reconciliation. We were unfairly targeted for this issue previously, but intelligence agencies have cleared us of any wrong doing. Is Prof. Peiris trying to put us in jail again by raising unnecessary issues?” he queried.
