No Japanese Encephalitis epidemic

There is no scientific evidence that Japanese Encephalitis has become an epidemic and that there is a rapid spread of the disease, Acting Health Services Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr.Bandara, there is a slight increase in the number of Japanese Encephalitis patients reported in Sri Lanka from November to January every year. This situation is nothing new. Dr.Bandara pointed out that the four Japanese Encephalitis patients reported from Ratnapura were from four different MOH divisions and therefore it is just a normal situation. The patients were in the 24,30,42 and 80 age groups and have been already cured.
“During the past three weeks, around 10 patients with Japanese Encephalitis symptoms were detected at the Ratnapura General Hospital,”Dr.Badara added.
