‘Removal of Carlo Fonseka not a solution to SAITM issue’ - Patali

 
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Leader Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today said that the removal of Professor Carlo Fonseka from his position as the Chairman of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is not a solution to the SAITM issue.
He made this observation at a media conference held today at JHU office Battaramulla.
“Though he is 85 now, everybody knows that he can perform his service effectively. He played a key role in the struggle launched against Colombo North hospital during 86/87,” said the Minister.
He said that Professor Carlo’s retirement would badly affected the SAITM issue.
Professor Carlo’s official tenure was to end on December 31, 2016, as a SLMC Chairman’s tenure is generally valid for a period of 5 years and the President had extended his tenure by 6 more months.
