Kashmir Black Day: Peaceful Protest urges UN to implement resolutions on Kashmir

The United Nations Secretary General was urged to encourage, facilitate and support efforts leading to a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions, as well as exercise the mandate entrusted to him by Charter of the United Nations and under relevant international instruments to forthwith ensure the fundamental rights and freedoms of the oppressed Kashmiri people, in particular their right to self-determination.
The appeal was made at a peaceful assembly organized today by the Kashmir Study Forum and the Pakistani and Sri Lankan community opposite the United Nation Office at Bauddhaloka Mawatha in Sri Lanka, to mark Kashmir Black Day.
Similar peaceful assemblies appealing to the world community to prevent human rights violations in the India held Kashmir and holding of plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir under the auspices of UN, were also held in other parts of the Island, including Ampara, Batticaloa and Puttalam. The Kashmir dispute had emerged as one of the greatest human crises in history, which is marked by extra judicial killings, rape, detention and kidnapping of Kashmiris.
More than 94,000 Kashmiris were killed, out of which over 7,000 were custodial killings at the hands of Indian occupation forces.
More than 106,000 structures have been destroyed and more than 22,000 women have been widowed, over 107,000 children have been orphaned and more than 10,000 women have been raped and molested by the Indian military and paramilitary troops in Indian occupied Kashmir (IOK) since 1989.
Participants of the assembly expressed their grave concern about the ongoing killings of civilians by Indian security forces in towns and villages of Kashmir.
