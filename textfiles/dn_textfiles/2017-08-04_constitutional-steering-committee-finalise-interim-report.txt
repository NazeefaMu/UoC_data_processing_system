Constitutional Steering Committee  to finalise Interim Report

The Constitutional Steering Committee will finalise the Interim Report during their next round of meetings from August 8 to 10, a senior member of the Steering Committee told the Daily News yesterday.
He said they went through 90 percent of the draft at the last week’s meeting and decided to attach differing views on certain sections in the Interim Report as annextures so that they can be addressed at the next level of discussions.
“Hopefully, we can wrap up the process by the next round of deliberations,” the senior member said.
The members and parties that are holding different views other than what has been proposed in the interim report will be given an opportunity to so as not to drag the process. However, he said the SLFP holds on to the opinion that the Executive Presidency should be retained.
“They are ready to scale down some of the executive powers enjoyed by the office of the President, but insist that he should be directly elected by the people.”
The other leading parties in the Constitutional Assembly, including the UNF JVP and the ITAK are of the view that the Executive Presidency should be abolished. The President must be selected by Parliament. But they agree that the President should have certain powers over the Provincial Councils.
“This is unfortunate and could serve as a stumbling block to the future of the Constitution making process,” he said.
