Therefore, the decision makers of the business entities have to devote much time on analyzing their businesses from time to time in order to survive in their respective business than ever before.
Whether we like it or not, global businesses too have to face a number of challenges due to the influences of the rising economies in China and India. Even though Sri Lanka is a relatively small market in the global business map, Sri Lanka, too has to face the consequences of the changing business environments around the globe. Therefore, the managers or the decision-makers of the business organizations in Sri Lanka too should possess a thorough understanding on analyzing the change in the business environment if they are to survive and sustain in the long run in their relevant markets.
However, it is a fact that many decision-makers do fail to understand or to analyze the business environment properly and as a result, they tend to make erroneous decisions regarding their respective businesses. As a result of such failure in decision making, it could adversely affect the profits, business growth, competitiveness of the companies to a greater level and perhaps it may cause them to shut their businesses at last. Therefore, this brief article on the above topic intends to discuss some of strategic analysis tools that can be exercise by the managers in order to analyze their business environment fruitfully.
What is business environment analysis (BEA)?
As per Renee O’Farrel, Business Environment Analysis is a systematic process by which environmental factors in a business are identified, their impact is assessed and a strategy is developed to mitigate and/or to take advantage of them.
Thus, as clearly mentioned above, the decision-makers should be able to understand the changing environment perfectly and should be able to predict how such changing environmental factors could influence over their particular business before they make decisions pertaining to their business.
In order to easy understand, these environmental factors could be primarily identified as, “Internal factors” and “External factors”. For an instance strengths and weaknesses of an organization could be identified as internal to the organization, while opportunities and threats for an organization generally relate to external factors.
Purpose of the Business Environment Analysis
The purpose of the Business Environment Analysis is to identify the potential influence of particular aspects of the general (economic, political, cultural, technological, natural, demographic, international environments) and operating environments (company’s suppliers, customers, competitors, and public) on business operation.
Furthermore, an analysis of business environment facilitates managers to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that are to be addressed by them. Thus, such analysis is quite important for the existence and for the progress of the business entities.
Identification of strengths
As mentioned above, strength of organizations are classified as an internal aspect. For instance, if an organization possesses a solid HR policy, the job satisfaction and the performance of the employees could be improved. Thus, a happy workforce will be expected to deliver more fruitful results to the company. Therefore, satisfied employees can be seen as one of the strengths of that particular company when compared with its rivals who do not have such HR policy and satisfied employees. Once a company identifies its strengths, the company should take necessary steps to consolidate its strengths by further improvements in its existing plans and policies.
Identification of weaknesses
Like strengths, business organizations naturally have weakness as well. Therefore, identifying the weaknesses of the organization also has an equal importance for an organization in order to move forward by mitigating such weaknesses to an acceptable level.
Identification of opportunities
Even an organization is solid in its business; it should not hesitate to seek further expansion in their business. Therefore, analyzing the external environment will facilitate companies to identify the opportunities that exist in the market.
Identification of threats
When there is a severe competition in the market, companies have to face a number of threats from their competitors; also, there will be a threat of substitution for their products and services as well. Thus, proper environmental analysis could assist managers to identify the relevant threats from the external environment in advance and it will enable them to find out appropriate remedial action to encounter such threats from the outside in advance.
By doing a proper business environment analysis, organizations could achieve number of other benefits as well. Such business analysis will enable companies to be flexible in their respective business; will enable to make use of the limited resources of the company productively, predicting probable future issues of the organization, company’s adoptability and company’s sustainability.
Environmental frameworks
As discussed before, managers or the decision-makers of business organizations around the world tend to exercise a number of strategic analysis tools to analyze their businesses and business environment. Therefore, this concise article primarily focuses on the much preferred and most popular strategic analysis tools such as PEST Analysis or PESTEL Analysis, SWOT Analysis.

These political factors include government policies, political stability or instability, government’s foreign trade policy, tax policies, labour laws and environmental laws.

This has more impact when an organization involves in international trade as each country has its own rules and regulations. These legal factors include product regulation, employment regulations, health & safety regulations, equal opportunities, advertising standards, consumer rights and laws.

However, you may find some opportunities lying within the organization or in an individual which are not yet exploited or not yet revealed as well. In addition to those external factors it may include technological changes, socio-cultural changes. However, due to above two key factors, SWOT Analysis is sometimes called “Internal-External Analysis” as well.
Conclusion

Therefore, once managers identified those environmental factors which could influence the success of a business company in future, assumptions can be made with regard to the future development of those factors and subsequently a viable strategy could be formed accordingly. However, it is important to have a proper mechanism in place to assess (monitoring/feedback) the strategy on periodical basis and proper system to update the strategy accordingly. In conclusion, it can be assumed that the proper utilization of strategic analysis tools such as PEST Analysis or PESTEL Analysis, SWOT Analysis will surely enable the managers or the decision-makers of the Sri Lankan business organizations to identify the environmental factors properly and to assess their impacts and to develop an appropriate strategy to mitigate and/or to take advantage of them to make the business sustainable and profitable.
