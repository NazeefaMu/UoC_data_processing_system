Heshan Flexi Packaging, Union Bank Finance joint champs

The historic inaugural, Last Man Stands Sri Lanka T20 Cricket League 2016 final between unbeaten Heshan Flexi Packaging and Union Bank Finance was abandoned without a ball being bowled at De Mazenod College grounds, Kandana on Sunday.
The two finalists were declared as joint winners and shared the prize money of Rs. 150,000/- offered for the winner and the runner-up.
This unique cricket concept under the banner “A new way to play cricket” is the brain child of young Sri Lankan entrepreneur domiciled in Brisbane, Australia, Sheran P. Fernando, an old boy of De Mazenod College, Kandana.
Fernando has so far managed to spread the game (8 players per side) in six countries - Australia, India, England, South Africa. His ultimate goal is the LMS World Cup in 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa.
The Tournament Special Awards: Nipuna Gamage from UB Finance (214.2 points best 82 vs. Lanka Lions) was the Best Batsman and Thivanka Kakulawela from Heshan Flexi was the Best Bowler.
The awards were presented by Director, De Mazanod College, Kandana, Rev. Bro. Janaka Fonseka, Country Manager, LMS, Roshan Iddamalgoda and former Sri Lanka cricketer, Malinga Bandara. - YK
