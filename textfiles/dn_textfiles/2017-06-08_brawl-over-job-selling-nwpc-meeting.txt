Brawl over job selling at NWPC meeting

A heated argument erupted during the North Western Provincial Council (NWPC) meeting on Tuesday when Provincial Council Minister D.B. Herath said several Provincial Ministers and councillors have sold job appointments allotted by the Provincial Council. Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake ordered the provincial authorities to appoint a special committee under the chairmanship of the Provincial Chief Secretary to look into the allegations against the councillors.
However, ruling party councillors have not sold jobs, the Chief Minister said.
Provincial Ministers raised their objections over the allegation.
