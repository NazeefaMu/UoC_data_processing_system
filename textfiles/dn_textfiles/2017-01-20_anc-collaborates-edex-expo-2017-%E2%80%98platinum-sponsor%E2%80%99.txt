ANC collaborates with EDEX Expo 2017 as ‘Platinum Sponsor’

American National College (ANC) Education, has partnered with EDEX Expo, the country’s biggest education exhibition and job fair as a Platinum sponsor.
ANC, being a long-term supporter of EDEX Expo, has partnered with the EDEX initiative for thirteen consecutive years, proving our commitment to education.
American Education Centre Limited (AECL), which operates under the brand name ANC Education, was established in 2002 envisioning to be the most preferred choice for tertiary education in Sri Lanka. Moving forward with that vision, over the years, ANC has established affiliations and partnerships with reputed higher education institutions around the world.
ANC Education Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director Dr Punarjeeva Karunanayake said, “Since the beginning of our operation in Sri Lanka with the goal of providing quality international tertiary education options for local students, ANC Education has now grown to be the country’s largest provider of trans-national education for Sri Lankan students. With the best interest of students in mind, we are indeed delighted to continue our long-standing partnership with EDEX Expo and showcase all the opportunities available to students who are in pursuit of quality international higher education.”
At present, ANC Education offers world-class, quality education to local and foreign students through its various local subsidiaries and associates such as Wycherley International School, Regent International School, Net Assist International, Modern Montessori International (MMI) and PATHE Study Medicine. Through these subsidiaries, ANC provides students access to world recognized universities in America, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, Eastern Europe and Malaysia.
“We are pleased that ANC Education has pledged its support once again for EDEX Expo 2017. ANC has been a reliable education provider for Sri Lankan students for over a decade, and we are proud to be associated with them,” EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedera said.
