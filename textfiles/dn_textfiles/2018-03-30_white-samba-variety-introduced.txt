White samba variety introduced

The Labuduwa Rice Research Station had recently introduced a white samba variety called LD-253.
Upon cultivation of this variety, harvests could be yielded within 85 days. In the wet zone, a yield of 70 to 90 bushels of paddy could be reaped, while in the dry zone, a harvest of 90 to 130 bushels could be obtained.
Labuduwa Rice Research Assistant Director J. Ponnamperuma Arachchi said the new paddy variety is resistant to all diseases. LD-253 is in high-demand in the Southern region, the centre’s research officials added.
