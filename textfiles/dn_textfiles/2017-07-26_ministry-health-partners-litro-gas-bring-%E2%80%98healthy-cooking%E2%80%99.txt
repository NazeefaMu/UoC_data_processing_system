Ministry of Health partners Litro Gas to bring ‘healthy cooking’

In a bid to enable a culture of health conscious culinary habits to penetrate into the wider social spectrum within Sri Lanka, Medical Services of the Ministry of Health recently held a Healthy Cooking competition at the BMICH for Medical Administrators of Uva Province attached to the College Medical Administrators.
Facilitated by Litro Gas, the event featured ten enthusiastic teams representing numerous departments of the Medical Services of the Ministry of Health competing for the top three spots. Event patron’s, Chefs Guild of Lanka provided guidance to competitors and selected the three winning teams accordingly.
“Our ultimate goal is to advocate a behavioural change in the Sri Lankan social fabric. It is imperative that Sri Lankans adopt not only healthy diets but also healthier ways of preparing those food items,” said Dr. Lakshmi Somathunga – Deputy Director General - Medical Services of Ministry of Health.
The Healthy Cooking competition aspired to reach out to more than seventy high profile medical officials attached to Medical Services of the Ministry of Health representing more than 47 Hospitals Island wide as well as the Ministry of Health and The College of Medical Administrators.
“It was inspiring to see the vitality and passion that competing teams generated during the event. I believe the same enthusiasm will slowly but surely translate into lifestyle changes which the general public will also adopt given the rise in awareness on the subject of healthy eating and cooking habits”, commented Chaminda Ediriwickrama, Director- Sales and Marketing/Corporate Affairs - Litro Gas Lanka Limited
“Food is much more than just something that tastes good and fills up your stomach.
What you eat can heal, cause sickness, or even inflict pain. Cooking your own meals can teach you what foods are high or low in certain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
It will even boost your creativity as you learn to combine nutritious foods to satisfy your palate,” added Nilmini Ferdinando, Marketing Communication Manager, Litro Gas Lanka Ltd.
