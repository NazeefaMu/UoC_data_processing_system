Do not fear FCID when serving the country

Do not fear the FCID when serving to uplift the heath service, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne requested all health staff.
According to Health Ministry sources, Senaratne had stated that some public servants work slow fearing the FCID. “They should not because they will be saved if a problem arises,” he said.
He was addressing heads of the Hambantota district health institutions.
The minister said the existing tender procedure which takes around nine months to complete will be changed to a more effective system, and then it will take only two and half months.
The change took place in January 8, 2015 can be compared to the 1956 revolution. The Hambantota district produced a president, a finance minister, and an MP but still the state hospitals were not developed, the minister had stated.
Private health institutions will be regulated. Discussions had been held to impose high taxes on excessive sugar, salt, and fatty food items, he had stated.
