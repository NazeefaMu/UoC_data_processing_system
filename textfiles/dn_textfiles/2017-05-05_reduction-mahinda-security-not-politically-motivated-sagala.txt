'Reduction of Mahinda security not politically motivated': Sagala

Minister of Law, Order, and Southern Development Sagala Rathnayake said in Parliament today that the decision to reduce police officers from former President Rajapaksa’s security contingent was not politically motivated, the Government Information Department reported today.
“Even with the reduction, the former President has a security contingent of 187 personnel including 26 STF officers,” he told Parliament this afternoon.
“The number of security officers to be appointed a VIP is based on an estimate” the Minister further explained.
Based on the estimate, 42 police officers were removed from the former President’s security contingent, “but it is possible to provide security from the MSD to him during special occasions if a request is made,” the Law and Order Minister added.
