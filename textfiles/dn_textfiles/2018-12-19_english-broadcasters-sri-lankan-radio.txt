English broadcasters of Sri Lankan Radio

As a teenager in the 1950s, I discovered the existence of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. Since we were then studying in the English medium and studying in St Michael’s College, Maddakkalappu (Batticaloa) run by the American Jesuits then, we were all interested in Western Music, Literature, Cowboy Comics, Chewing Gum, western roll high jump, athletic running shoes etcetera. In fact, we liked everything western. However, we were rooted in our mother tongue (Thamil for me) as a second language. So, we liked the commercial service best. There was then a Home Service too, which was later known as National Service.
I used to listen to the Teenage Leisure presented by the friendly presenter Priya Samarajeeva (later she was known as Priya Kodipilly) on the Home Service. Listening to Mark Antony Fernando and Priya Samaraweera and Myrle Swan reading the news bulletins was a real treat. The announcers did not have a borrowed accent, but we learned the correct pronunciation of English words. BBCs Received Pronunciation was the order of the day then.
Turning our attention to the Commercial Service, we enjoyed the Sunday Choice presented ad lib by the internationally known Russo-Japanese announcer Greg Rozkowski, Tim Horshington, Livy Wijemanne, Mil Sansoni, Jimmy Bharucha, Bob Harvey, Karl Goonasena ,Norton Pereira, Eardley Pieris, Ronald Campbell, Percy Bathelomeuz, Dan Durairaj, Mike Wilson, Myrl Walpola,(later Myrl Williams), Rohana Candappa, Sita Parakrama, Shirly Perera Vernon Corea, Geoff Fruitgneath, Perin Rustomjee and a host of entertainers made us happy.
Parallel to the commercial service, there was the All Asia Beam where some of the announcers mentioned came over. There were the Sahani Brothers from Mumbai presented a variety of programmers. The Hindi announcers are the Ganjwal sisters.
The Hit Parade, Amateur Hour, Quiz Kids (where the late Athulathmudali was a star performer), Radio Journal, Take it or Leave It was some of the programmes I enjoyed.
By end of 1953, I move to Colombo with my parents.
Here not only the Commercial Service, the National and School Service too provided educational value programmes coupled with of course entertaining.
On the National Service, we had Tommy Perera, Mahes Perera, David Joseph, Joseph Mather, Dudley Weeraratne, Joe Sothinathan, Charmaine Fernando, Lalith Blok, Michele Berenger and others.
Foreign Affairs Review by Mervyn de Silva, Arts Magazine presented by Vernon Abeysekera, Deloraine Brohier’s programmes were some of the other programs I enjoyed listening to on the National Service,
Later on, new announcers came on the air. Errol Fernando, Vijaya Corea, Leon Belleth, Nihal Bharathi Rajendra, Kumar Samuel, Caryl Sella, Indranee Senanayake, Eric Fernando, Harold Fernando, Rajan Vairavanathan, Krishna Vairavanathan, Fathima Cader, Niranjan Abeysundare, Dudley Jansz, Bevil Pallihawdane, Sounthi Thavam, Chris Jayamaha and a host of others. I may have missed some names because of forgetfulness.
Although I have participated in many programmes and even presented some programs over Radio Ceylon, only after trying more than 10 times that I got an opportunity to become a Relief Announcer in Thamil on the commercial service in 1966. But in this article, I shall confine myself only to my association with the English services.
When Neville Jayaweera was the Director General of Broadcasting, I was selected as a trainee relief announcer for the National English Service. But that was short-lived. But when I joined the newsroom, I sometimes edited the Asia Beam news bulletin in English and read it over the air.
When the Asian Broadcasting Institute in Kuala Lumpur had an in-service training and workshop in Colombo, I was also selected as a participant. The trainers were Melville de Melo, the famous newsreader and broadcaster from All India Radio in New Delhi and Pran Chopra, the veteran Editor
of major Indian newspapers. It was a fruitful experience.
It was only later that I was selected as an English relief announcer for both the City FM and the commercial service. Apart from being an announcer, I also presented a weekly programme called” Rhythms Thamil”.
I continued to be an announcer until lately and stopped the Disc Jockey style-automation- system came operative. With the fast-spreading TV stations in the island radio broadcasts lost its listenership. I thank the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation in shaping me as a broadcaster. A wealth of learning and experience I gained.
