‘Yahapalana political culture encourages working together’

The new political culture under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena encourages us to work together sans political difference to achieve development goals, said Uva Provincial Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayaka.
The Chief Minister made these comments at a meeting after opening a newly built busstand at Siyambalanduwa in Moneragala, Siyambalanduwa DS area on Monday. The Asian Development Bank under the Pura Neguma Development project earmarked Rs. 12 million for the construction of the new busstand.
“Politicians should honour people’s decisions. They should get used to the new political culture to develop the country,” the Chief Minister said. He said the political history of the country proves that no politician can remain in power forever as the public have the power to change regimes.
“Uva Wellassa was the focal point of the vicious agenda of British rulers. They killed those who raised a voice against the British in 1818. In 2018, we are commemorating this event after 200 years,” he said.
Minister Chamara said, “We were able to re-build and there is more work to be done to develop this area.”
He said, Siyambalanduwa was claimed to be one of the poorest DS areas in the 1980s. Now people experience a rapid development.
“Floods, landslides and other natural disasters, except for the drought are not experienced by the people in this area. The government can provide infrastructure facilities to the people,” he said.
The Chief Minister said South Korea and Singapore are examples for rapid development and that Sri Lanka too should strive to develop in the same manner. “The Provincial Council takes all measures to develop the province to keep pace with national development,” he said.
Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena, Uva Provincial Council Health Minister Kumarasiri Rathnayaka and others also spoke. Moneragala Deport Manager R. M. Atula Thushara Chaminda and others participated.
