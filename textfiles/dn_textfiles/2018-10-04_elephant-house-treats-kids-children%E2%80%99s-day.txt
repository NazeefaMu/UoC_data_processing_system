Elephant House treats kids on Children’s Day

Elephant House recently commemorated Children’s Day 2018 by treating 50 kids to a fun-filled visit to its ice cream factory in Avissawella, which is the most modern ice cream manufacturing facility in South Asia.   
The culmination of “Ice Cream Factory Visit with Prof. Yahaguna”, Elephant House Ice Cream’s highly popular Children’s Day 2018 competition, wherein thousands of kids participated by giving missed calls to enter a lucky draw.
Fifty kids were chosen, along with their parents, to go on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that included being transported in the very special and highly colourful Elephant House Ice Cream bus.  
They were welcomed to the factory by Prof. Yahaguna, the Elephant House Ice Cream mascot whose claim to fame is being prominently featured in the brand’s nation-wide campaigns.
He told them all about Elephant House’s proud 150-year history and the brilliant and tasty products that formed part of the Ice Cream range, including well-loved Wonder Cones and Wonder Bars, quick-bite Cups available in an array of different flavours, sweet treats Major Max and Necto Ice Lolly, and latest additions Wonder Berry and Choc Shock. These ice cream flavours are very special as they are made using only the finest raw materials and highest quality ingredients, sourced from all over the world, ensuring they are Sri Lanka’s favourite ice creams.
