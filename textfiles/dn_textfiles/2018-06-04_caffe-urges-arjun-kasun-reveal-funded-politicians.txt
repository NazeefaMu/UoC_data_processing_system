CaFFE urges Arjun, Kasun to reveal funded politicians

CaFFE Deputy Director Keerthi Tennakoon had visited Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisea in the Welikada prison and had handed over a letter requesting them to reveal the parliamentarians they funded.
The letter had requested the duo to reveal the names of the parliamentarians they funded during the past election. “As you may know, any citizen in the country has the right to donate any amount to election campaigns, religious institutions and other approved organizations. No legal barrier for it either. It is also a right of every citizen and does not breach any election law,” the letter stated.
The letter further requests the duo to reveal the donations valued above Rs. 5 lakhs, gifts valued above 1 lakh and the donations valued above one lakh given to politicians and ministers from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017.
“There will be a severe issue about this scam when Parliament commences tomorrow. With the Presidential Secretary Austin Perera out of the country, Parliament would definitely not get the required documents.
The only way to clarify the issue would be to request the donators to reveal the people to whom they gave the money.
Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena have nothing to worry about since campaign financing is not at all illegal in the country.If they come forward with the names, the humiliation of the parliamentarians who did not take any money could also be averted,” Keerthi Tennakoon said.
