Two Brazilians made to purge ingested 163 cocaine capsules

The Negombo Hospital extracted 163 cocaine capsules weighing almost two kilograms last evening from the two Brazilians who were arrested for smuggling cocaine into the country by ingesting them, the Police Spokesman Office said.
Ninety one cocaine capsules were extracted from the first suspect and another 72 from the second suspect at the District General Hospital in Negombo. Police said the cocaine capsules valued at 50 million. The two individuals, aged 24 and 30 years, had arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on June 30 and July 1 from Doha on an Emirates Airline flight.
The 24-year-old has been identified as Dos Fantof Machadldo Wafchinapon. The suspects were produced in Court and detention orders were obtained to hold them for questioning for seven days.
The capsules weigh approximately 2 kg, the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) said. Investigations are continuing.
