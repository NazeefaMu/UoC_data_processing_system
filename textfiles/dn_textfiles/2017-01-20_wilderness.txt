Into the wilderness

At times life experiences are so complex that one finds it hard to gather words to express them. This is why globally renowned photographer Destin sparks says that photography is a story one fails to put into words. Viewers get this feeling when they encounter Mahinda Vithanchchi’s work.
The seasoned photographer will be holding his seventh photography exhibition ‘Montage on Life II’ at the J D A Perera Gallery, Horton Place. The opening ceremony of the exhibition is on January 20. Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka will be the Chief Guest at the event. The Guest of Honour will be University Grants Commission Chairman, Prof Mohan de Silva. ‘Montage on Life II’ will run till January 22.
Wild life and nature is mainly in focus at the exhibition. There will be more than a 100 photographs on display.
“I will be retiring next year from ANCL. I worked for 34 years in the media and out of that span, 17 years has been rendered for ANCL. It is a tiring occupation. I feel that now it is the time to put a full stop to my occupation in the media. However I am not one to laze around doing nothing. I wish to do something for myself now using the invaluable experiences I gained through my occupation,” Mahinda said.
Mahinda has not limited himself to taking photos alone during his stint in the media. He has ventured into other sectors as well and had made contacts socializing in the field.
“I have good friends in the media and they have stood by my side on various occasions. They are very cooperative towards me if I invite them for events,” he added.
Mahinda notes that it is mostly because of the lack of time that his capacity to capture more scenic locations is limited. He says he could have presented a more enthralling collection of pictures displaying the beauty of Sri Lanka if he had more free time at hand.
“I was limited because I had to perform my duty towards my occupation. I do not have any sophisticated equipment either. I captured these photos with the limited equipments that I could get my hands on. Most of these images were captured by borrowing camera equipments from colleagues,” he expressed.
Mahinda says that capturing these photographs was no walk in the park since he had to go through various hardships in the wilderness. he has ventured and taken pictures in many of the wildlife national parks and forest areas in the island including Kumana, Wilpattu, Yala, Galge, Bundala, Minneriya, Gal Oya etc.
“I even have a few video clips of myself trekking through various obstacles in the jungle. You can see me crawling on the ground, climbing steeps and scaling to the top of trees in those clips. I am hoping to edit them and present them as a documentary,” he said adding that the former Wildlife Department Kumana Park Coordinator Suranga Ratnayake has been very supportive toward his ventures.
He notes that all wild animals are ferocious in some manner.
“The law in the jungle is that each and every creature fears the other. We were able to get close to the animals due to the help of the wildlife guards who accompanied us during our trips. They knew how to handle matters on unexpected occasions. Since we did not have some of the latest equipment we had to get as close to our target as possible to capture the images. We have been through many dangerous experiences having being chased by elephants and nearly trampled down by a herd of oxen. Therefore all the images we have captured are images of the moment and difficult to capture,” he explained.
Talking about the feedback he received for his former exhibition ‘Montage on Life’ in 2014, he notes that many of those who viewed it expressed their appreciation for his effort.
“I believe that ‘Montage on Life II’ is presented in a manner which is more developed than the previous exhibition. Some people who witnessed ‘Montage on Life’ in 2014 said that they felt like they had been transported from the busy city to the wilderness when they entered the venue. Some even said that they felt the nostalgia of going back to their village days about three decades back,” he expressed.
J D C Printing Technologies Pvt Limited is the sponsor of ‘Montage on Life II’. The photographs were printed in India. Mahinda has included some of the photographs in the exhibition into a coffee table book as well. This will be available at the exhibition.
