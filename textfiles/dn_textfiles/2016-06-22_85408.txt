Exporting fishery products to EU begins

Sri Lanka on Wednesday began exporting fishery products to the European Union (EU) following the recent lifting of a EU ban on fishery products from the country.
 
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the first batch of fish exports following the lifting of the ban was sent to Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
 
He said Sri Lanka will now export fishery products to several other EU countries as well.
 
The European Commission recently said that after a lengthy dialogue process, Sri Lanka has successfully reformed its fishery governance system.
 
Sri Lanka was previously the second biggest exporter of fresh and chilled swordfish and tuna to the EU with exports worth 74 million euros (83.4 million U.S. dollars) in 2013. (Xinhua)
