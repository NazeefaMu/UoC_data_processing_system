Sebs’ past cricketers unite to aid present cricketers

Past cricketers Association of St Sebastian’s College hosted the “Sebs Past Cricketers and Group Family Get Together” to unite school’s past crecketers for the benefit of potential present school cricketers.
Father Rector Ranjith Andradi emphasised the importance of this gathering, particularly since it aided needy children at the school who were passionate players and argued that what the game required was a sense of uniformity and discipline which he hoped could be inculcated by the event. Rev. Brother Nimal Gurusinghe and Hemaka Fernando were among the other distinguished invitees.
Former secretary of the association Rupanath Wickremaratne also addressed the gathering.
The event was full of fun and nostalgia where draws and various other competitions were held.
