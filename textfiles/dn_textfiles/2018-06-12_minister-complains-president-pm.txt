Irregularities in school admissions
Minister complains to President, PM

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has complained to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over illegal school admissions to primary sections of schools in several provinces, ignoring the Supreme Court orders on school admissions.
According to him, illegal school admissions to primary sections of government schools had taken place in the recent past in the North Western, Western, Central and Uva Provinces.
It was revealed that some politicians had misused their authority to admit students whose parents are their relatives and political henchmen.
The Education Ministry has pointed out that if this goes on, remote schools will have to close down in the near future, Kurunegala District Education Director W. M. Balasooriya told the Daily News.
