Arjuna determined to clean-up CPC

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that most of the ministers call him the chairman of the cleaning service. He made this statement during the New Year celebration function held at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, on Wednesday.
The minister further stated that he was able to reduce corruption and also initiate development projects within the last six months.
“Earlier, Lanka OIC was a part of the oil distribution process. Some people are trying to be a third or fourth party to this. We don’t prefer privatization and the responsibility to protect this institution is vested on us. Even workers who have completed 99.9 percent out of the work, must complete the balance one percent to reach success. We have commenced the construction of oil tanks after 40 years. We expect to construct another six oil tanks after six months. No one wanted to construct a refinery system. But we expect to construct it soon. Some people are trying to stop this construction while suggesting to import oil for higher prices.
I will not stick on to positions if they are not allowing me to work. I always take decisions which are favourable for the country. When the President and Prime Minister handed over this ministry they requested me to solve all issues which exists in this ministry. Most of the ministers called me the chairman of the cleaning service. I have already worked hard and made institutions profitable,” Minister Ranatunga stated.
Meanwhile the Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Dr. Anoma Gamage said, “We have a vast amount of workers including 3,000 in the (CPC) and 2,700 in CPSTL. Minister Ranatunga and I have the highest regard in parliament. Everyone is following both of us to get approval for petrol sheds or to seek a job. Even I’m glad about the progress, but there are still shortcomings.
I think we can do more than this. We have to work as a private institution though this is a government institution. I personally prefer to privatize all governmental institutions. I have worked in both private and government institutions. The most valuable thing is efficiency.
Minister Ranatunga, the Board of the Directors and I are expecting to maintain an efficient service to avoid another fuel crisis in the future. The SMS was circulated by people within the CPC and that is why it hurts. We are blessed to be government servants. Therefore, work properly,” she urged.
Chairman of the CPC Dammika Ranatunga also praised the Minister and Deputy Minister for their co-operation to work without political influence.
