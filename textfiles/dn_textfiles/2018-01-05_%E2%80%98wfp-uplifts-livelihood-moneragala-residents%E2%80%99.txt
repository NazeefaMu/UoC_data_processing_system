‘WFP uplifts livelihood of Moneragala residents’

The World Food Programme (WFP) plays a key role in uplifting the livelihood of the downtrodden people in the Monaragala district by providing infrastructure facilities, Moneragala District Secretary D. S. Padma Kulasuriya said.
The secretary made these comments at a meeting after opening a vocational training centre which was built at a cost of Rs. 1.45 million at Ethimale in the Siyabalanduwa Divisional Secretariat area under the World Food Programme, recently.
She said the people in Wathegama, Kotiyagala, Perakumpura, Sirivijayapura, Ethmale Janapada, and Thissapura in the Siyabalanduwa DS area are benefitted under this project.
A sustainable programme is currently being launched under this project to face the drought that prevails in these areas. Building ponds and rehabilitating canals and tanks are some of the key areas the project focuses, she said.
The project also provides vocational training opportunities to the unemployed youths in the area, she said.
Certificates were awarded to 58 trainees who successfully completed the vocational training, and they were also given Rs.10,000 each to invest in self-employment ventures under this project.
The WFP earmarked Rs. 19.096 million for launching this project. Moneragala Assistant District Secretary M. M. M. Sharfas, Siyabalanduwa Divisional Secretary A. M. Nandasiri, WFP Director Laksiri Nanayakkara, and Uva Vocational Training Authority Provincial Director also participated.
