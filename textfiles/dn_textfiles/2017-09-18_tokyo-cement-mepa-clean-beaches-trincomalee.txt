Tokyo Cement, MEPA to clean beaches in Trincomalee

Together with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), Tokyo Cement will take the lead to clean 15 beaches in Trincomalee, as part of the National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week 2017.
Joining hands with the MEPA Trincomalee District office, Tokyo Cement will deploy resources and personnel to clean up the coastal environs of some of the world-famous beaches along our North Eastern Coastline, including Pigeon Islands, Nilaveli, Alles Garden and the beaches along the Dutch Bay.
MEPA carried out a nationwide series of programs covering 14 coastal districts of Sri Lanka to coincide with the International Coastal Cleanup day on September 15.
The National event was held at Crow Island Beach Park, Mattakkuliya with the participation of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
Similar events are planned in each of the 14 districts during the Marine Environment Week that falls during September 15-22 and will be conducted in collaboration with the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management, Central Environmental Authority, Department of Coast Guard, the Sri Lanka Navy, School Children, NGOs and the coastal communities.
Tokyo Cement comes forward as the main Partner of the Trincomalee District event held by MEPA, on September 21, at Trinco beach, with the participation of school children, the tri-forces, public servants and government officials, and the general public from the area. The company invites the public, living in and around Trincomalee to join hands with the cement giant to support this great cause to restore our famed beaches back to their pristine state.
