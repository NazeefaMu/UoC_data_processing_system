Big Match fever gives boost to voting

Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest takes a new turn with the commencement of the 2017 traditional ‘big match’ season from this month.
With the first XI cricketers warming up for their most crucial engagements of the season, their supporters, young and old as well as the cricket fans, have joined in their numbers to vote for their star schoolboy cricketers, thus supporting the emerging players of their alma mater.
Hence, voting for the most popular contests of the 39th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year has caught a greater interest among cricket fans as it would be a psychological boost for their school cricket heroes before the big ’uns.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year series has produced many legendary cricketers, who had made their mark in the international arena, right from its inception way back in 1979. Former Sri Lanka, NCC and Royal captain turned ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, who had become the first recipient of the prestigious title, heads that select band of cricketers who had emerged through the contest.
In a recent interview, the first-ever winner of the prestigious award in 1979 had said that the Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complimented for keeping the show going for almost four decades. In a recent press interview, Madugalle had also paid a tribute to the sponsors of the Mega Show, stating that such sponsorships are essential to keep the show going. He was particularly happy to see the emergence of rural stars through the event in recent times. “In the past, most of the winners of the top awards were from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game,” he was quoted as saying.
Sri Lanka’s World Cup winning captain turned Minister Arjuna Ranatunga is a familiar face at the past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards presentations, ever since he first won the coveted title in 1980 - as a cricketer, spectator as well as a VIP guest. In fact, Sri Lanka’s world cup-winning captain is the second recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year after Madugalle in 1980 and the first schoolboy to win the major title twice.
Ranatunga is of the view that the dream of every schoolboy cricketer from his era is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. In a recent interview, the former Ananda, SSC and Sri Lanka captain had commended the Sunday Observer for hosting the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest from 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers.
“I am happy at the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or one of the many awards presented at the contest,” says Ranatunga.
The cherished dream of every schoolboy cricketer from the day he holds a bat or ball at junior level is to play for the Sri Lanka national team one fine day. When their school careers come to an end, they will look forward to one encouraging signal – to secure a top award at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year ceremony.
They are acutely aware that such an award would be an unofficial guarantee to enter the big league. Hence, there is a common belief among schoolboy cricketers that if they could end their school career with the top award at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show, they are only a step away from wearing the Sri Lanka cap.
The past track record of the Mega Show provides ample examples to prove that belief. Most of the top award winners at the Mega Show in the past had straightaway walked into the national team, just months after they had won the top award. The best examples are Madugalle and Ranatunga.
Merely three years after he was adjudged the first-ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, Madugalle was able to secure a place in the Sri Lanka team for the country’s inaugural Test in 1982.
In contrast, Ranatunga found a place in the Sri Lanka team for the same Test just months after winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title for the second time in 1982. Both Ranatunga and Madugalle made that a memorable occasion by scoring debut half centuries for Sri Lanka in Test cricket.
As the proud host of the three-decade old prestigious school cricket awards show, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, the Sunday Observer is delighted to see the distinguish achievements of Madugalle and Ranatunga as well as other recipients of the top award such as Asanka Gurusinha, Roshan Mahanama, Muttiah Muralitharan, Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu and Kumar Dharmasena to name a few.
The Mega Awards Show which recognises talents of schoolboy cricketers is organized by Sri Lanka’s flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, in association with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires & Sorcerers’ Association
Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel is the proud sponsor of the event for the 10th consecutive year. Its Chief Operative Officer (COO) Nalin Perera has played a key role in taking the event to a new level. It was due to the lavish sponsorship of SLT Mobitel that the hosts Lake House was able to elevate the standard of the event with superior trophies and attractive cash awards.
