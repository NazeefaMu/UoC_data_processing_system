The Sixteen SLFP MPs, who broke ranks with the Government, yesterday crossed the well of Parliament and sat on the Opposition benches.

They were joined by S.B.Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, T. B. Ekanayake, John Seneviratne, Sumedha Jayasena, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
JO members led by Dinesh Gunewardena thumped their desks to welcome the group while Government backbenchers booed and jeered. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Chamal Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa were absent in the House.
