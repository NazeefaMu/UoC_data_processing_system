‘Mahinda can sue New York Times if report is wrong’
Govt has no intention to curtail social media – Minister

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday flatly rejected claims that the Government was planning to ban certain social media websites, saying “censorship never works”.
“Today anyone with a smartphone can become a sort of journalist and so fake news remains a big challenge. But censorship is never a suitable solution at all. We should have the courage to face any adverse reports or accusations. If we can’t stomach those, it is better to disregard to ignore them,” Minister Samaraweera told a gathering at the Finance Ministry.
He took a swipe at those calling for curbing press freedom, noting “we cannot control the media’s freedom. We cannot ban news. We have to face the media.We cannot and we do not want to censor websites or any other media outlet”.
However, he pointed out the need to create a more socially and ethically responsible media for the future.
The Minister recalled how editors and journalists were killed, assaulted and intimidated during the previous regime. On the other hand, this Government had granted complete freedom to the media to harshly criticize Government figures including the President and the Prime Minister and also Government projects.
The Minister reiterated his condemnation of verbal threats against the two local journalists involved in the New York Times (NYT) expose of a transaction of US$ 7.6 million during the previous regime.
“The NYT has raised very serious allegations in this regard. The Thera mentioned in the story has acknowledged that a Chinese person had given him US$ 38,000. Judging by the same token, the other allegations cannot be false. However if they are, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa should have already sued the NYT without making various allegations against the local journalists. That is what I would have done if this happened to me. So far, there is no indication of that happening.”
The Minister said the NYT has already urged Rajapaksa and others to speak to their top editors in New York, who had maintained that they saw the documents relevant to the transaction, instead of taking up cudgels with the local journalists.
Asked whether this could lead to a diplomatic row with China, the Minister replied “if our leaders and politicians take bribes from other countries, it might lead to diplomatic incidents”.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickremaratne said the Presidential Awards would be especially beneficial to young journalists. It would encourage more young people to enter journalism. “These awards are symbolic of our desire to protect democracy and media freedom.Today, we have ensured media freedom like never before. Ven.Dambara Amila Thera said recently that he harshly criticised the President on many occasions but to date no one had even called him to say anything about it. This shows the level of media freedom and general democracy in the country,” he added.
Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the Presidential Media Awards would lead to a qualitative improvement in the media. It will encourage not only award winners, but other journalists as well to perform better and win next time. “The Government has always recognised the role of media. For example, all media institutions rallied to educate the public on dengue during the recent epidemic situation. This award ceremony will be just one measure among many aimed at developing the media.”
Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga outlined the structure of the award ceremony and eligibility criteria.
