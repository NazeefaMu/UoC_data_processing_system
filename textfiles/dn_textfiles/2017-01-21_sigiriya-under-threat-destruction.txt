Sigiriya under threat of destruction

Ponds, parapet walls, and stone steps in the historic Sigiriya rock fortress are under threat of destruction.
The World's eighth wonder, Sigiriya, had become vulnerable to destruction due to its improper maintenance and conservation.
The Central Cultural Fund deploys over 300 employees to control and maintain the Sigiriya Fortress, but they have failed in their duties.
Service of 65 resident labourers had been terminated recently and new ones were recruited. However, they have not been provided with proper lodging facilities, sources said.
The Central Fund charges an entrance fee of about Rs.4,900 from a foreign tourist and Rs. 50 from a local tourist. But maintenance and conservation of Siririya is not up to the expected level, the sources said.
