When victims are many and beneficiaries none

Shock waves generated by mob attacks on Muslims in Ampara, Digana and few other places in the Kandy district still reverberates in our ears and fills our hearts with remorse. Though normalcy has been restored at a heavy price, an uneasy peace reigns in the hill capital.
If one peruses the media he or she could discern a variety of interpretations as to what happened as well as how and why it happened. Though violence originated in response to two isolated incidents, violence was the work of an organised gang. In the first instance in Ampara not only the consequences but even the original incident seems to be pre-planned. It was based on a myth – the supposed contamination of food with what was described as an infertility pill. In the second incident at Digana, the mob violence was not spontaneous or instant. It was a belated response, few days after the incident.
Opinions differ whether there was a political hand behind the violence or not. Meanwhile accusations are hurled against the ruling parties as well as against the Joint Opposition. In so doing nobody including the highest in the land is spared.
Whoever is to blame, what is mob violence? It is not an economic or a cultural phenomenon. It is a deliberate political act. If it is not an isolated individual act and is organised, orchestrated and widespread it should be result of an action by politically motivated groups whether they comprise members of a political party, religious or an ethnic group or any other grouping.
Economic repercussions
It is clear that the masses have been provoked by some elements hostile to the Muslims or who resent the peaceful co-existence of different ethno-religious communities. May be they have vested economic or political interests or are committed to an ideology of hegemony and domination.
This violence and destruction is most inhuman. It is not worthy of human nature. It drags the whole society from civilization to savagery. Our country’s name has been sullied. If repeated, such violence would once again make Sri Lanka a pariah state among the nations of the world.
It is time to soberly ponder over the economic repercussions of such violence and restore sanity in society. Sri Lanka has chosen an export-oriented development strategy. As a small country with a limited market we have to get integrated with the world economy. There are no independent self-sufficient nations in this age of globalization.
Look at our principal sources of income. They are remittances by expatriates working abroad, especially the domestic workers in the Middle East, earnings from apparel exports, tourism and the tea trade.
In 2017 our Number One foreign exchange income of $ 7.1 billion was from expatriate remittances. The bulk of it came from the Arab countries in West Asia. Attacks on Muslims here would harm this avenue for foreign employment for our citizens, thus depriving the country of a valuable source of income. Further, we would also have to forgo the aid we receive from our friendly countries in the region and face isolation at international fora.
We derive our second source of foreign exchange from the export of garments which brought the country US $ 4.7 billion in 2016. Europe and the United States are our principal buyers. Communal riots would earn us their wrath as they are particular about the preservation of human rights. Besides they are our principal trade partners too.
Next, in order of importance, is tourism. Now more than 2 million tourists visit our country in a year. In 2016 revenue from tourism was US $ 3.5 million.
Civil unrest due to communal violence would deny us most of these benefits and our economy would be precariously undermined. That would be a catastrophic consequence of communal violence.
Added to it will be loss of property and human lives, possible resurgence of civil war and destruction of the future of our present and future generations.
The entire population would suffer except a handful of those who benefit by war and our country would be a testing ground for armaments of big powers.
Communal violence
On the other hand, what can anyone gain by such ethno-religious communal violence? They would gain absolutely nothing. Neither Buddhism, nor Islam or Christianity or Hinduism would gain anything. Nor would their adherents gain any material or spiritual benefits. Even the attackers would not gain anything, except perhaps enjoying a sadistic pleasure at one’s “performance”.
In this tragic hour of despair there was also hope. Substantial sections of the Sinhala Buddhist clergy, including members of the Maha Sangha came forward to protect the Muslims, to express their condemnation of violence. This is an unprecedented phenomenon acknowledged by the victims themselves.
However, there are some disturbing voices emanating from intellectual sources that tend to justify or minimize the gravity of the crime committed by the mob. For example, an erudite scholar was arguing that in developing countries minorities enjoying privileged status dominating the market under liberal democracies inevitably face backlash against them from the majority community.
Islamic fundamentalism
The fact of the matter is that until recently Muslims were one of the most backward communities in the island. It is only affirmative action by some past governments that has enable to make some progress. Under these circumstances he was trying to identify the growing self-consciousness of the Muslim community and the entrepreneurial acumen of some of its members as factors that could explain the phenomenon of mob violence that was witnessed during the last few days. Such are the ideological mentors of the racist mob.
Hilarious as it sounds he was also referring to Muslims voting en bloc at elections under the One man – One vote system. Not only Muslims other communities also do so at times. There are even people who vote en bloc for their caste. Ask any party nomination board how they select candidates to contest the elections and the answer will be found.
Islamic fundamentalism is a post - World War II phenomenon which has proliferated widely especially following the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, Sri Lanka is free from it. This is due to the absence of Muslim communalist forces of any significance in our country. Therefore, to speak of Muslim communalism in its absence is an indirect justification of majoritarian communalism.
There is also a talk that the recent communal violence was a result of an international conspiracy. While the influence of geo-politics and interferences of intelligence services of foreign powers cannot be ruled out the basic cause of the violence is internal. Hence, ignoring the internal factor is protecting the culprits.
