Luxury Amari Galle enhances  Sri Lanka’s Southern coast

Cementing Galle as one of the top international destinations, Sinolanka Hotel Private Limited, in collaboration with ONYX Hospitality Group, celebrated the grand inauguration of a brand-new property Amari, in Sri Lanka's historic southwest coastal city of Galle, last Friday.
Offering 172 rooms including a presidential suite and 11 other suites, the hotel is hoping to run on minimum 60% occupancy with a good mixed clientele.
"Originally from Thailand and expanding across Asia, Amari has a rich and long-standing heritage and is well known amongst travellers worldwide," said Douglas Martell, President and CEO, ONYX Hospitality Group. "Amari celebrates the colours and rhythms of modern Asia with each hotel highlighting the textures and flavours of its unique setting through architecture, design, cuisine and service.
With the opening of our first Amari in Sri Lanka, we are building a service culture which combines Asian hospitality values and the deep-rooted local customs."
"We have already marketed the hotel internationally and the forward bookings are very positive," he said. He said that they also have a very positive local clientele as well.
Amari Galle is equipped to handle meetings, seminars, product launches and workshops with a ballroom that can accommodate approximately 350 people for seated dinners, supported by three IDEA rooms designed for creative meetings.
"We also see a huge response for our wedding options form Sri Lankans," he added.
ONYX Hospitality Group Director Russell Cool said that they are extending their footprint aggressively in Asia and Sri Lanka is one key destination. "We see great potential in Sri Lanka and we will look at more property management in the island with the right partner in the future as well."
"Currently we have 44 hotels and our aim is to reach 99 by the end of 2020."

Leading the Sino Lanka Group, Bob Kundanmal noted, "It is indeed a celebration of yet another milestone for Sino Lanka Hotels Private Limited as we unveil our third hotel in Sri Lanka.
We are so thankful everyone who has been with us every step of the way. It is no doubt that this big success is simply the result of tireless efforts, support and enthusiasm through the many stages of instituting this property."
The grand inauguration ceremony was held in the presence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Chief Guest and Minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga as Guest of Honour.
The ribbon cutting ceremony was fronted by the Prime Minister, together with the Chairman of Sino Lanka Hotels Private Limited, Bob Kundanmal, President of ONYX Hospitality Group, Douglas Martell, Joint Partner of Sino Lanka Hotels Private Limited, Manu Bhojwani, Sino Lanka Hotels Director Rajan Bharvani and ITALTHAI Group President and CEO Yuthachai Charanachitta.
