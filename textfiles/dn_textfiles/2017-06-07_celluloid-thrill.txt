Celluloid thrill

Chandran Rutnam entered the field of Cinema in 1957 as a 'light boy' (Technician in the film crew) in the Hollywood movie Bridge on the River Kwai. The film was shot in some of the spectacular locations in Sri Lanka including Kithulgala. The film was directed by famous Hollywood director David Lean. Rutnam was involved in this as a 16-year old.
When the film shooting was over, Rutnam had a great opportunity to fly with the film crew to the United States of America. This golden opportunity allowed him to work in some of the top class studios in Hollywood including universal and paramount. He enhanced his knowledge of editing of films, directing and all other work related to cinematography while working in these studios. He spent nearly 40 years in the US. Afterwards, he decided to move to Sri Lanka and produce his own films.
He started his production house, Asian Film Location Services Ltd, which provided equipment and other services to foreign films shot in Sri Lanka such as Shadow of the Cobra, Fifty Fifty, Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Doom, Iron Triangle, The Adventures of Tennessee Buck, Mother Theresa, Road from the Elephant Pass and the Common Man.
Rutnam’s latest endeavour is co-producing a foreign movie at an immense budget, shot in Sri Lanka. Titled as Solar Eclipse, the Depth of Darkness the movie will be released in January 2018.
 
Q: Rutnam, what is so massive about the Solar Eclipse?
A: Actually I am happy to say that I am engaged in this movie as one of the co-producers and also as the one and only service provider. This film was entirely shot in Sri Lanka. Also, this is a high budgeted movie. There are about five producers from different countries including the United State of America.
Creating the movie sets and finding ideal locations for this film was done by Asian Film Location Services Ltd under my supervision. The movie script was written based on a true story which contained some conspiracies which had taken place prior to assassinations of former US President Abraham Lincoln and another leader of the Indian freedom struggle Mahatma Gandhi.
I rather call this film as an Asian and American production. Although the entire film was shot in Sri Lanka, we could create all the American and Indian movie sets 100 percent perfectly. The staff members of the Asian Film Location Services offered a marvellous service while preparing these movie sets.
Q: Building up American sets in Sri Lanka is a daunting task. How did you overcome that hurdle?
A: You must never forget how we created an entire city of Kolkata for Mother Theresa. We built all the necessary movie sets and other requirements for Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Doom as well. And then the movies such as Lord Mountbatten - The Last Viceroy, In the Name of God Poor and Water come in line. We have a professional team that works on producing these movie sets. They complete it to utmost satisfaction. I am thankful to Athula Sulthangoda and Bimal Dushmantha because they offer guidance to the team.
Q: How do you deal with the cast and other co-producers?
A: I co-produced this with Panhage Shegall, Moobi Alright, Raja Ayyar and Nojen Boora, The cast includes Vinee Jones, Kris Henri Harris from the USA, Ome poori from India and etc. We have actors from England and Sri Lanka. The movie is directed by Dutch film director Karim Tradia and Pankaj Shegall.
I am assigned with checking whether the entire production goes smoothly to the satisfaction of other co-producers as well. This could just be a beginning of the golden era of Sri Lankan film Industry. We must not forget that the whole world will see the spectacular locations in Sri Lanka in this film and I must also be thankful for the tremendous support that I received from the new government as well as the National Film Corporation Chairman to make this project a success. I hope that this will be a trend for other foreign film producers to come to Sri Lanka to make their movies much more comfortably.
Q: The world cinema is now a part and parcel of digitisation. Where do you position Sri Lanka?
A: The world cinema entered digitalisation 15 years ago. In 2007, I Joined venture with UFO Movies in India. We could import 24 Brand new digitalised film projectors. I invited the of theatre owners and showed them how to operate these new machines. We donated one projector to the National Film Cooperation as well. But unfortunately, the film advisors who were in the previous government made all plans a complete failure. They sabotaged it deliberately. Actually, they were running at their own personal agenda at that time.
They did not have any intention to enhance the film industry in Sri Lanka. I had to keep the projectors for more than two years without any use. Finally, we had to sell all those 24 film projectors at a very low rate to the government of Nepal to recover the costly expenses.
I must emphasise that the film advisors to the then president had taken brutal steps to destroy the project reports presented by us related to digitalisation.
Q: A new government is now in power. What could be your potential here?
A: Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee for supervision of distributing films in Sri Lanka. The Media Minister and the National Film Corporation Chairman have been involved in accelerating the projects that we have already initiated earlier.
Besides, there is another project of building mini cinema halls across the island. We have already opened seven mini cinema theatres.
