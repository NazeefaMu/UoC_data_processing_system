Finger piercing instead  of wearing a wedding ring

 How people choose to show their commitment to someone else is evolving. You can say it with diamonds. Or you can say it with a massive “gnarly” finger piercing.
Whilst your bony digits may seem like the last body part you’d get pierced, having the lower part of your finger pierced is now a trend which is catching on.
A graphic clip, shared by Cultura Colectiva + , shows people getting their fingers pierced.
Given that it’s not for the faint-hearted, videos of people having this done have, unsurprisingly, split opinion.
Plenty of viewers were left feeling a little queasy by the process.
“Ouch! Hell no! I’ve been engaged for 1 month,” one response read.
“I have hit my hand off of things at least once a day...hat would hurt like a mother...”
Another weighed in with: “That is just DISGUSTING. Why would anyone want to pierce their hand or finger?
“Oh well that’s just waiting for infection, being ripped off, getting stuck on something, hey their problem, they’re ones who will be crying,” pointed out someone else.
But, the internet is a graphic, disgusting place at the best of times, with the bar getting constantly raised higher.
So while there were certainly people who didn’t like the idea of a finger piercing, there were others who were OK with it.
“I liked it,” one woman added, “everyone to their own I say and I’m in my 50s, sometimes I think us old farts are more open minded lol.”
It remains to be seen whether this catches on or not.
Wonder if Harry and Meghan could be tempted into sealing their marriage this way?
