Air Force-Army will be a close contest
The game between Air Force Sports Club and Army Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter club league rugby tournament will be a closely fought out affair at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana today. The match commences at 4:00pm.
The Army has failed to live up to expectations losing to Navy (24-25) and to Havelocks (26-37) last week.
The Airmen who have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players yet recovering from injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for today’s game. However adding to their woes would be the absence of their play maker and scrum half Ashok Wijeykumar due to him touring with the Sri Lanka national under 19 team to take part in the junior rugby Asiad in Malaysia.
On the other hand Air Force who has won their outings against Police and CH and FC after beating the mighty Kandy SC 24-21 in the season’s second match are the favourites to pull this one through.
Army SC boasts of having in their ranks quality talented players in the form of Imanka Ariyapala and Gayan Salinda who are playing a key role for the soldiers. Then comes the granite forward Ashoka Jayalal who is bound to run into a solid defence comprising players in the caliber of Medagedara brothers, skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda and ever reliable full back Nuwan Perera.
The Army skipper and number eight Manoj Silva faces another acid test while Air Force captain Iddamalgoda has fared admirably with the resurgent team.
Teams: Air Force (Probable XV): Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranil Medagedara, Dimithri Patabandi, Dinesh Weeraratne, Saraka Waralla, Isuru Jayaratne and Gayantha Iddamalgoda (Captain), Kaushal Manupriya, Sooriya Crishan, Charith Seneviratne or Dinusha Ariyapala, Ishara Madushan, Nuwan Perera, Head Coach: Leonard de Zilwa.
Army SC (Probable XV): Ashoka Jayalal , Sameera Wickramanayaka, Dillepa Niroshan, Nalaka Maduranga, Nishantha Kobbekaduwa, Sampath Rosa or Upul Abeynayaka, Chameera Silva, Manoj Silva (Captain), Rizvi Mohamad and Ashan Bandara, Mihiran Perera, Kamesh Fernando, Dinusha Ariyapala, Sudaraka Dikkumbura, Gayan Salinda or Shanaka Perera, Head Coach: Fereti Verabula (Fiji)
