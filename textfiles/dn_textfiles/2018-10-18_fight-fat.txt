Fight the fat!

You have probably obsessed about having it and have been searching for a way to get rid of it. The good news is that you can do something about it. As common as cellulite is, there’s also an awful lot of misinformation out there about what it is and how to get rid of it. So before placing blame, scheduling a cosmetic procedure, or spending a fortune on over-the-counter products read on to say goodbye to cottage-cheese thighs for good with these proven tricks.
 Defining cellulite
Cellulite is a term for the formation of lumps and dimples in the skin. Common names for cellulite are orange-peel skin, cottage-cheese skin, hail damage, and the mattress phenomenon.
Cellulite can affect both men and women, but it is more common in females, due to the different distributions of fat, muscle, and connective tissue. Between 80 and 90 percent of women may experience cellulite at some point in their lives
Reasons  that women  get cellulite
The exact cause of cellulite is unknown, but it appears to result from an interaction between the connective tissue in the dermatological layer that lies below the surface of the skin, and the layer of fat that is just below it.The fat cells and connective tissue in this layer are arranged vertically in women.
If the fat cells protrude into the layer of skin, this gives the appearance of cellulite. In men, the tissue has a crisscross structure, which may explain why they are less likely to have cellulite than women.
Cellulite in men and women
Estrogen plays a role, plus women typically have more body fat than men. But the main reason is that the bands connecting skin and muscle are different on men than they are on women. Men have thicker bands, there are more of them, and they form a crisscross pattern (as opposed to the vertical pattern on women’s bodies). That keeps the fat in place so that it doesn’t pucker.
Skinny women and cellulite
Cellulite is often genetic. It also happens to women of all shapes and sizes.
Some women are more prone to getting cellulite than others because cellulite has its roots in skin structure and genetics. That is not to say that there is no way around cottage cheese thighs. Even if some of us may not be able to completely eliminate all traces of cellulite from our bodies, there are ways to reduce its appearance drastically.
Cellulite and aging
Hormones also seem to play a role in the appearance of cellulite. As women age, their bodies produce less estrogen-a hormone that helps keep blood vessels flowing smoothly. Less estrogen can mean poorer circulation, which can also mean a decrease in new collagen production and the breakdown of older connective tissue. Age also causes the skin to become less elastic, thinner, and more likely to sag. This increases the chance of cellulite developing.
Cellulite and genetics
Certain genes are required for cellulite development. Genetic factors can be linked to a person’s speed of metabolism, distribution of fat under the skin, ethnicity, and circulatory levels. These can affect the chance of cellulite developing.
Treatments for cellulite
Acoustic wave therapy uses a hand-held device to transmit sound waves. It may work, but it can take several sessions.
Laser treatment may improve the appearance of cellulite for a year or more. It involves inserting a very small laser probe under the skin. The laser is then fired, breaking up the tissue. This can also thicken the skin by increasing collagen production. The thickened skin may reduce the appearance of the cellulite below.
Subcision involves a dermatologist putting a needle under the skin to break up the connective tissue bands. Results can last two years or more.
Vacuum-assisted precise tissue release cuts the bands using a device containing small blades. As it cuts the connective bands, the tissue underneath moves up to fill the space under the skin, removing the appearance of cellulite. This may last for three years, but data on its success is limited.
Carboxytherapy involves inserting carbon dioxide gas under the skin. Side effects include bruising and discomfort after the procedure, but some cellulite might disappear.
Endermologie involves a deep massage with a vacuum-like device that lifts the skin. The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved it as safe, but there is little evidence that it works, say the AAD. Ionithermie cellulite reduction treatment involves covering the affected area with a special mud or clay, then wrapping it in plastic before applying an electric current. It is not proven to be effective.
Radiotherapy aims to reduce cellulite by heating it, but any results are short-term. Laser-assisted liposuction removes small amounts of fat, but this may make dimpling worse. Research has not yet shown that it works to reduce cellulite.
Ultrasonic liposculpting targets and destroys fat, but again, research is lacking to show that it works.

Tips to reduce cellulite 
Load up on anti-oxidants 
Include plenty of antioxidant-rich foods in your diet, such as acai and other berries, red and orange fruits and veggies, and citrus fruits.
Antioxidants are your number one defence against free radicals, which cause damage to skin cells and can contribute to cellulite formation.
 
Go green 
Drinking green tea can help reduce the signs of cellulite. Green tea has been found to be effective for increasing energy expenditure and assisting with weight loss. It is also a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent free radical damage. Drink about three cups of green tea a day.
 
Healthy fats 
Replace saturated fats with healthy omega-3 fats such as oily fish, flaxseed and fish oils, and nuts. These help with blood circulation. Poor circulation reduces the body’s ability to deliver nutrients to skin cells, causing them to clump together, which can compound cellulite problems.
 
Exercise 
Regular exercise is vital. It burns calories to reduce fat, boosts circulation and can help disguise cellulite by increasing muscle tone under the skin. Exercise also improves lymphatic drainage, which carries toxins away from cells. If drainage is sluggish it will contribute to cellulite.
 
Cut out toxins 
A build-up of toxins in the body can affect the dermis and contribute to cellulite formation. Remove or limit toxins such as tobacco, alcohol, coffee and heavily processed foods containing high levels of sugar and chemical additives. Make sure you drink plenty of water.
 
Use herbs 
Try herbs. Dandelion leaf tea helps reduce fluid retention, as well as helping to flush toxins from the body. You can also use dandelion leaves in salads or fresh juices. herbal preparation from the dried leaves of the ginkgo tree, helps boost circulation.
 
Skin care 
External treatments such as coffee scrubs can improve circulation and reduce signs of cellulite. Use a coffee scrub twice a week. Moisten your skin under the shower, turn the water off, rub coffee granules into the affected areas for a few minutes, then rinse off.
