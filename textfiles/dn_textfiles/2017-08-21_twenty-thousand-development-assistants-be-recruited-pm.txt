Twenty thousand Development Assistants to be recruited: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said 20,000 new Development Assistants would be recruited to the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
The Prime Minister said the new recruits would be given training and knowledge on empowering small and medium scale entrepreneurs and women entrepreneurs.
He said applications have already been called for new recruitments.
“The Government could successfully manage the country’s debt burden over the past two years. Therefore, we can now solve the problem of unemployed graduates,” the Prime Minister added.
The Premier said the Unity Government’s forward march is slow but steady.
He further said 1,700 new graduate teachers would be recruited to solve the teacher shortage in the Eastern Province.
The Premier made these comments participating in an event to open the new Urban Council building complex in Eravur.
