Request community support for ‘National Road Development Programme’

Road Development receives a notable position in the National Development Programme. It is important to note that development processors occur efficiently, thereby keeping the impact on the economy to a minimum. The ‘National Road Development Programme’ has commenced conducting the key procedures in an orderly manner.
Collective date that could impact road development from different divisions is a vital aspect in the National Programme. The community’s support is essential to collect these data.
The Rural Development Authority is conducting a special survey regarding the vehicles plying on the country’s road system. The survey will be conducted countrywide from April 2017.
The RDA expects the fullest cooperation of the public for this survey.
