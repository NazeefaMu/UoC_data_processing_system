THAT NIGHT BELONGED TO KAVISHKA PARANAVITHANA

It is one hundred and twenty five years since the inauguration of ABRSM and as always the Sri Lanka Chapter held its Annual High Scorers’ Concert and Awards presentation since 1989 and have gone from strength to strength harnessing Sri L anka’s cream of youth talent in classical music. ABRSM is the leading authority of the world in music assessment producing over 600,000 candidates in 93 countries each years. It is linked to four leading UK Conservatoires;
Royal Academy of music, London
Royal College of Music, London
Royal Northern Collage of Music, Manchester
Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow
With such a rich history behind it, Sri Lanka with its pioneering Representative, Mano Chanmugan has strengthen the cause of our budding musicians and future looks bright for our musical scene. In his welcome address in the presence of the British High Commissioner who was the chief Guest, said ‘If there is one thing that binds people and nations together, it is music. Nations get together with each other in harmony and joy and relieves the world of its tension.
‘Today, the results as we see among our youth is of very high standard, leading them to professionalism and even careers in music teaching. Some end up with orchestras etc.’
The evening kept fine with a packed crowd inspite of the International Book Exhibition being astone throw away from the auditorium of the British School where the event took place.
Kavishka Paranavithana vying and achieving the LRSM prestigious High Achiever’s Award by the ABRSM (Sri Lanka Chapter) naturally had to be a student of our own string wizard, Ananda Dabera. He had no violinistic problem and on the contrary. Swept through like the wind in the willow in the hands of serenading Kavishka to whom it felt a toy bowing his way into each and every heart, flawlessly. Kreisler, one of the foremost violinists in history, wrote Preludium and Allegro to place these scores in hands of such as Ananda Dabera so that he will pass it down to produce such promising stars like Kavishka. Standing tall and elegant, he too did proud by his teacher. Kreisler who an early Romantic was highly influenced by Baroque music and find those traces in PRELUDIUM and Allegro as played tonight.
