Indian economy not in good shape: Manmohan Singh

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday painted a bleak picture of the Indian economy insisting “it is not in good shape”.
Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said the government is “hiding behind” GDP numbers that are being challenged. Releasing the “Real State of Economy 2017”, a document prepared by the Congress research cell at the party headquarters here, Singh said it speaks about the state of India’s economy, its many issues and where it is heading.
“That the Indian economy is not in a good state is obvious. Even IMF has downgraded our GDP growth and it will not be 7.6 per cent but less than 6.6 per cent,” he said. Chidambaram said the state of the economy “is not something that we can be happy about” and expressed concern over the low credit growth which he claimed is at 5 per cent, the “lowest in several decades”.
“BJP is hiding behind a GDP number which is being challenged. People are not dazzled by it, but are asking where the jobs are? “NDA government tends to believe exaggerated version of economy, this research document is closer to truth than what government will say tomorrow,” he said.
Chidambaram said every government must be optimistic, but optimism must stem from a realistic assessment of situation. “Yet, if government presents tomorrow a rosy picture of the economy, people of India are entitled to question that. There are no jobs, capital formation is declining, credit growth is the lowest in several decades,” he said.
Chidambaram wanted government to focus on fiscal consolidation and said, “there are serious question marks on this government’s ability to follow fiscal prudence”.
He dismissed suggestions that the 2008 farm loan waiver was a populist measure, saying, “It was based on the response to a demand from the farming community and was a very wise decision.”
