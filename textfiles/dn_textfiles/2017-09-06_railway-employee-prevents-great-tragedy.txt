Railway employee prevents great tragedy

An employee of the Railway Department reportedly had prevented a massive train accident by acting wisely and efficiently on August 4.
An officer in the Hatton railway station said the employee was assigned to check the railway line from the Kotagala to Hatton. When he was travelling on foot, he had noticed a disconnected rail track near the Singimale railway tunnel.
A train from Hatton was to run through the tunnel within a few minutes. Realizing the destruction it would cause if the train reached the tunnel, he had run over a half km on the rail tracks towards the approaching train signalling the driver to stop the train.
He managed to get the attention of the engine driver at last and stop the train on time. Thereafter, he informed the situation to the Hatton railway station and taken necessary steps to repair the track.
The brave employee, P.M.Bandara, is attached to the Hatton railway station. The incident delayed the up-country train service about two hours.
