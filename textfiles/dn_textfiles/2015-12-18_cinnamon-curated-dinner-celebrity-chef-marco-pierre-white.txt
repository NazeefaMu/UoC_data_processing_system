A Cinnamon curated dinner with celebrity chef Marco Pierre White

Godfather of modern cooking Marco Pierre White, who is a three Michelin star celebrity chef and Judge of MasterChef Australia and Hell’s Kitchen fame, will be in Sri Lanka courtesy of Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, flown down by the national carrier SriLankan airlines from January 18 to the 31, 2016. As part of his visit to the island, the legendary chef will be presenting a curated Gala British Dinner on January 22 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
The dinner will be once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Colombo to engage with the Godfather of Modern Cooking over a meal designed to delight the senses at every turn.
The themed 6 course dinner is curated by Marco Pierre White and his executive chef, in collaboration with the executive chefs at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo. While Marco will recreate some of his signature dishes, the ingredients for this dinner will be brought down from Great Britain such as Scottish Angus Beef, Welsh Lamb, Rainbow Trout, Salmon from Scotland and English cheese. The dinner will be served with exclusive wine and Scottish single malts prepared by Marco’s executive chef. Over the course of this mouth-watering meal, guests will also be able to interact personally and have a photo opportunity with Marco Pierre White.
