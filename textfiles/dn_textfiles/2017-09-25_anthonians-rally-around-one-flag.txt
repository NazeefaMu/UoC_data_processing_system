Anthonians rally around one flag

St Anthony’s College, Wattala will celebrate its Diamond jubilee this year. To coincide with its Diamond Jubilee, the college has embarked on a mega development programme to bestow a facelift to it with the help of its old boys, to be on par with major national schools in Colombo.
Fund raisers
The Alumni of St Anthony’s College, Wattala has organised a fund raising project to develop the school in a 10 year project.
Sub projects in the pipeline include; renovation of the main gate with the 75th anniversary emblem, parents’ waiting area which will be unveiled soon, visitors’ rest room and the science room.
“The quadrangle has been already completed. Primary school building which is now under construction is a project worth 45 million rupees. The government has funded this project”, said J. D. L. Dinuka who is the President of the Old Boys’ Association of the college.
“Our strength is our Alumni. We have resourceful old boys holding top positions in the corporate sector, in the media fraternity as well as in the business sphere within the country. Old boys who live in other countries too are doing extremely well. We want to communicate with them and get them to rally around us to bring back the past glory to our Alma-Mater”, he said.
Mega carnival
Alumni member Sanjeewa Weerasinghe said a friendly walk followed by a mega carnival and a musical extravaganza with the Marians is scheduled to be held on September 23.
“The Walk will commence at 2pm from the college grounds. College T shirts, caps and souvenirs are already distributed among old boys and can be obtained by participants. The college expects a gamut of old boys and parents to participate in the Walk with teachers to induce strength to the fund raising project”, he said.
A raffle draw will be held to give away loads of prizes in the latter part of the day after the Walk at the carnival before the musical show begins.
Rector of the College, Rev Father Mal Warnashantha Fernando said the Government, Sri Lanka Cricket, private sector and old boys of the college are helping to make this endeavor a success. “This is a 10 year project and by 2028 we will see our college in the clan of major government schools in Colombo”, he said.
Memories
Ranjan de Silva said completing 75 years is significant to the college thus a souvenir will be printed on the history of the college.
“The souvenir will carry each and every student’s photograph with teachers’ photographs. Old boys now living abroad can extend their warm wishes to their Alma Mater via the advertisements on the souvenir”, he said.
An old boy, Hirantha Perera said the Jubilee Dance will be held on November 11 at Grandeeza Hotel, Negombo.
Reuniting
“Invitations are already extended to old boys who live overseas and we look forward to their participation at this occasion. We intend to re-unite with our long-lost friends of St Anthony’s College, Wattala.
We hope old boys living outside Colombo too will rally around the college to elevate it to the next level.
We will reach out to them as they are doing extremely well in the society and network with them in our regular get-togethers and functions,” he said.
Chief organizer of ‘Anthonian’s Sixes’ Denver Fernando said a Cricket Carnival will be held with the participation of 27 cricket teams from leading schools to raise funds to construct the college pavilion.
