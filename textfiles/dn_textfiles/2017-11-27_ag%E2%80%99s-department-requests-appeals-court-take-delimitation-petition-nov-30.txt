AG’s Department requests Appeals Court to take up delimitation petition on Nov. 30

 
The Attorney General’s Department has filed a motion at the Appeal Court to take up the petition filed against the Delimitation Gazette Notification on November 30.
The Court of Appeal last Wednesday issued an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017 on the Delimitation Committee Report, until December 4.
The Court made this order consequent to a writ petition filed by six electors who challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification issued by Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government on the Delimitation Committee Report with regard to the boundaries in respect of Local Authorities.
