Upsurge in sword attacks–Jaffna Police looks for links

Four individuals were hospitalised in Jaffna following a resurgence in two separate sword attack incidents which Police say were motivated on personal grounds.
Speaking to Daily News DIG K.P.Fernando of the Jaffna Range said that while most of the attackers used swords as their choice of weapon, the Police were still investigating any probable links.
“So far, we’ve found that the motive in most of the cases were personal issues among the assailants and the victims,” he said.
“We are still investigating for patterns or links between these individuals.”
Earlier this week, another individual in Koppay was pursued from Jaffna town by two assailants on two motorbikes before being attacked close to the Koppay Police station.
Later that day, another individual was injured in Navaly when his house was broken into. Reports also suggest another attack in Gurunagar on Sunday which left two individuals hospitalised.
