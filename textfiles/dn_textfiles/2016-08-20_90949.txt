Jayawardene's ton takes Somerset to semi-finals

Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene played another silky innings to relish at Taunton to guide Somerset to an away tie against Warwickshire in the semi-final of the RL Cup on Thursday.
Jayawardene made a delightful unbeaten 117 in 111 balls to help Somerset to 214-1 chasing Worcestershire’s total of 210.
With Jim Allenby who made 81, Jayawardene posted an opening stand of 188 off 33.1 overs to set the county on course for victory.
Jayawardene has had a largely unproductive spell at Somerset this season - his previous best since joining the county for the NatWest T20 Blast being 55 - but a selection of easeful glides and a couple of gentle straight sixes against the spinners were a reminder of his class. Presented with a chance to depart with smiles all round, he took it. It would have been rude not to.
Somerset now faces the prospect of having to play their semi-final without Jayawardene. “I think the semi is going to be tight,” he said. “I have already moved a few things around to play today, but prior commitments at home mean I have to go back now. Even this match was a bit of an extension but I have had a great time here and if they get to the final I might be able to make the trip.”
It was Somerset's seventh win in the competition this season after waltzing through their group.
Scores: Worcestershire 210 in 42.5 overs (Moeen Ali 81, D Mitchell 64, P Trego 3/33)
Somerset 214-1 in 36.5 overs (M Jayawardene 117 n.o., J Allenby 81)
