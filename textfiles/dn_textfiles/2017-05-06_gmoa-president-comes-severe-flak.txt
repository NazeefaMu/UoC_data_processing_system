Government Medical Officers’ Association President Anuruddha Padeniya came under severe flak for engaging in private practices while thousands of patients in Government hospitals were facing inconveniences due to the trade union action launched by the GMOA.
Dr.Padeniya came under severe criticism on social media after Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake revealed to the media that he and 11 other individuals had channelled Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya at a private hospital yesterday to seek medications.
