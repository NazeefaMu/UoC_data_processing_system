SilkAir first to fly new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to Australia

SilkAir, the regional wing of Singapore Airlines, became the first airline to fly the Boeing 737 MAX 8 to Australia. SilkAir Flight MI-801 touched down in Darwin, Australia on Sunday 7th January at 2:50pm and was welcomed with a water-cannon salute.
There was also excitement today as the airline celebrated the arrival of the MAX 8 into Cairns. The newest aircraft to join the SilkAir fleet, the MAX 8 offers customers an enhanced on-board experience and new cabin products, ensuring a comfortable and pleasant flight.
Commenting on the launch of the MAX 8 to both Darwin and Cairns, Foo Chai Woo, Chief Executive of SilkAir said, “The new MAX 8 enables us to offer customers access to new and exciting destinations and paves the way for a new phase of growth. With the aircraft entering into service, we look forward to inviting customers on-board to enjoy the quality experience that the MAX 8 offers.”
The MAX 8 aircraft was first introduced to the fleet on 30 October 2017, with Hiroshima, Japan as its launch route. Currently, the MAX 8 aircraft is also deployed to other longer haul destinations in the network including Kathmandu, Hyderabad and Bangalore.
The Max 8 aircraft features thoughtful refinements to both the Business and Economy Classes. The enhanced Business Class now features a 25% increase in seat pitch (39”to 49”) as well as additional seat recline (8” to 12”) for added comfort.
Economy Class seats have also been refined and showcase a sleeker and more ergonomic design. Each seat is fitted with a seat-back tablet and phone holders, accompanied by personal in-seat USB charging ports.
