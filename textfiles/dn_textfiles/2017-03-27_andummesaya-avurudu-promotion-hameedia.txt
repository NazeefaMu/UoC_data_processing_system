AndumMesaya  Avurudu promotion from Hameedia

To celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Hameedia, a leading menswear specialist recently launched the very first ‘AndumMesaya’ Avurudu promotion across its showrooms islandwide.
Drawing inspiration from the traditional Avurudukemamesaya (food table) which comprises a collection of popular sweet meals, this innovative offer will enable customers to purchase an array of clothing items in the season’s colours whilst enjoying a range of benefits such as gift vouchers.
No fashion or retail outlet has ever launched an ‘AndumMesaya’ promotion and as part of this special offer, customers will be eligible for gift vouchers and the more you purchase the more Gift vouchers you will be entitled to.
The promotion will run until April 12.
Commenting on the promotion, Chinthaka Wanigasekara Group General Manager, Hameedia said, “At Hameedia, we have always taken great pride in setting the benchmark in the menswear fashion category and we are proud to launch an innovative promotion of this nature.”
At Hameedia, we believe in promoting harmony and fostering peace and integration, we are truly a multi-ethnic organization and will be celebrating Avurudu with our team and family members alike.”
Hameedia, established in 1949, has grown to become a household brand in Sri Lanka.
