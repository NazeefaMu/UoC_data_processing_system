Collection centers to buy recyclable waste

Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said collection centers will be built across the country to purchase recyclable waste gathered at homes.
“Our aim to create recyclable items into value-added products for the benefit of the country,” he said.
He said a mechanism will be introduced to educate the people on how to recycle household waste in their houses.
The Deputy Minister said that organic waste can be made into compost and used for cultivating and other recyclable thrash collected at homes can be sold to these centers.
