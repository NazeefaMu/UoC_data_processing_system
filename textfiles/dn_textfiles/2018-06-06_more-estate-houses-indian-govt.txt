More estate houses from Indian govt.

Under the Indian Housing Project, the foundation stone was ceremonially laid for the construction of 250 new houses at Madakumbura Estate in Punduloya, Nuwara Eliya District, on June 4.
Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minaister Palani Digambaram, State Education Minister V.S. Radhakrishnan and Acting Indian High Commissioner Arindam Bagchi jointly laid the foundation stones.
MPs Thilakraj, members of the Central Provincial Council, senior government officials as well as officials from the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT), and plantation and estate management participated in the ceremony. A large number of people from the Madakumbura Estate attended the function.
In a similar ceremony held at Vellaioya Estate in Hatton on the same day, Assistant Indian High Commissioner in Kandy, Dhirendra Singh and government ministers laid the foundation stone for the construction of 50 new houses. The Indian government has committed a total of 14,000 houses in the plantation areas, including the 10,000 houses announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Around 1,000 houses are nearly complete. The foundation stones laid at Madakumbura and Vellaioya Estates mark the start of another 3,000 houses in as many as 40 estates and around 70 locations.
UN Habitat is the implementing agency for the construction of houses at Madakumbura Estate and IFRC/SLRC is the implementing agency for the Vellaioya Estate houses, on behalf of the Indian High Commission.
