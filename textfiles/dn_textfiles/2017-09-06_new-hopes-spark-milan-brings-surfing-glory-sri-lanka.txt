New hopes spark as Milan brings surfing glory to Sri Lanka

Arugam Bay’s peak season is on the wind down in Sri Lanka’s famous coastal surfers’ paradise where from May through to October travelers gather to ride the swell, lay in the sun and party ‘til dawn.
To 28-year-old Milan Andrahennadige, this is home. Milan and fellow Arugam Bay resident Praneeth Sandaruwan have just returned from India, where they competed in the annual Covelong Surf Point Competition in Kovalam, Chennai. Milan returns triumphant, winning second place in the competitions open event having gone head to head with skilled international surfers. This is a huge achievement for one of our sons and with their return comes a determination and a more focused view for the future of surfing in Sri Lanka. This is the second time both Sri Lankan surfers competed at Covelong with the support of the Surfing Federation of India. The Federation invites surfers from around the world to compete in national tournaments providing them with accommodation, food and transport. Most laudable is the Federation’s efforts to make the surfers feel welcomed and involved in the advancement of surfing in India.
Milan is sponsored by Bay Vista Arugam Bay where he currently works as a surf instructor. Born and raised in Arugam Bay his enduring love for the ocean brought him to surfing, making the ocean his lifeblood. When Milan began surfing at the age of 15 his ‘board’ was a slat of wood shaped to a form that made surfing possible. With this precious implement, the boys in the area took coveted turns to ride the wave crests. A benevolent tourist gifted the young boy with his very first surfboard as he acknowledged the potential. This is the story that most gifted surfers in the area would repeat. Virtually all local surfers of Arugam Bay would have had their first initiation of capturing the ocean’s waves through surfboards gifted or left behind by foreign surfing enthusiasts. They also benefited through the lessons learned from various international coaches who holidayed in the area. A strong sense of solidarity and camaraderie exists among all who live and surf in the bay and collectively they were the first on the island to be ISA certified surf instructors. Not in his wildest dreams did Milan imagine that he would be able to support himself with his passion, but the wonderful reality is that this determined young man is now a much sought-after surf instructor in the bay. Happiest when he is in the ocean with the wind on his face, riding the waves, surfing with his friends. Milan appreciates and values the international competitions of this magnitude as those became eye openers for him to improve surfing education and conservation of Sri Lankan beaches, specially surf destinations.
Passionate about protecting the environment, Milan laments on the results caused by negligence and human activities in our neighboring seas. “While surfing in India I had to duck dive several times to avoid plastic bags in my face and hit twice by two big plastic bottles. We are lucky that our waters are still relatively clean, but for how long?” People who live by the coast have an enduring love for the ocean and to them the ocean is their source of contentment and economic prosperity. This sentiment is palpable amongst coastal residents who are more than willing to dedicate their all towards conservation. However they agree in one unified voice that there should be more undertaking to protect the environment by the local authorities.
As tourism in Sri Lanka seems poised to be propelled on a new and exciting trajectory, a large proportion of the island remains unequipped to cope with the volumes of visitors who are eager to discover this island. The future of surfing is bright – with surfing now recognized as a competitive sport in the 2020 Olympics and it is only a matter of time before Sri Lanka is capable of having its own surfing team compete at the Olympics. This is the dream of the inherently talented young men along our coasts.
Their journeys have been epic. Devoid of resources, instructors, equipment while battling economic hardship, adverse weather and lack of infrastructure, their victories must taste all that more sweet. If the necessary support by the authorities is provided to these determined young surfers, there is no doubt that Sri Lanka’s flag will one day fly high at the Olympics with a surfing team the world will need to contend with.
