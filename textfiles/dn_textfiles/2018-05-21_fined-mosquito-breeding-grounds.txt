Fined for  mosquito-breeding  grounds

An officer-in-charge of a semi-government institution handling construction work, who was found guilty of maintaining dengue-mosquito breeding grounds at their office premises at the Thambuttegama Base Hospital complex, was fined Rs. 5,000 when he was produced before Thambuttegama Magistrate Ramila Nadeeshani, recently.
Thambuttegama Public Health Inspectors N. Ilangasinghe and S. K. Edirisinghe who prosecuted, said that they had filed legal action against the suspect because he had neglected repeated warnings to clear the said mosquito-breeding grounds.
