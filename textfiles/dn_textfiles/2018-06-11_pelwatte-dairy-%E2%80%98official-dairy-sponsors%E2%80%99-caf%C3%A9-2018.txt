It also brings together the entire community of culinary professionals. This is the first time that Pelwatte Dairy has partnered with the event.
“We all know that dairy products are an integral part of many recipes be it butter, milk, yoghurt or ghee. Pelwatte Dairy is committed to producing and distributing 100% locally manufactured dairy products not only to households across the island but also to the commercial producers,” said Pelwatte Dairy’s Managing Director Akmal Wickramanayake.

“With the immense success of the expo, we are looking forward to working with the hospitality industry to ensure that 100% locally manufactured dairy products are introduced to their kitchens. Our ultimate goal is to make Sri Lanka self-sufficient in milk which includes the food sector as well,” Wickramanayake added.
