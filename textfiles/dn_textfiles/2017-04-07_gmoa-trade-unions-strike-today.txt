GMOA trade unions to strike today

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Consultant doctors and over 100 health and other trade unions will launch an islandwide strike today, halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government that the right to life should receive priority than right to education, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said. Addressing a press conference at the Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday he said that accident services, maternity hospitals, children’s hospitals, the cancer hospital, Kidney Hospital and dialysis units and places where dengue affected child patients are being treated in the Trincomalee district will not be affected by the strike and all the services will continue in them. The services will continue in those institutions without any interruption.
According to Dr. Zoysa, politicians have been trying to legalize a fraudulent company using children as a shield. SAITM is just another `Sakvithi type business’ which needs to be dealt with under the law. Usually while implementing the law, the culprits receive punishment first and then the justice is done to the victims.
“A lot of things can be done in Sri Lanka using money and the SAITM owner shows the power of his money. We have one question for the Health Minister. We ask him whether he is against the President. When the President was the Health Minister he clearly opposed and stated his stand on SAITM. 147 years old standards of medical education protected by Sri Lanka Medical Council has been challenged in the courts because of the Health Minister and he should tender his resignation,” he said.
