Vienna Canal security fence completed

The construction of the security fence to the road running along the Vienna Canal in Mahiyanganaya has been completed.
A number of accidents took place on this road during the past period due to the lack of a security fence claiming the lives of 68. President Maithripala Sirisena taking this situation into the consideration instructed the officials to immediately construct a security fence and ensure the safety of travellers.
This 9.6 kilometer long fence has been erected spending Rs.54 million and Rs.38.5 million allocated by the Road Development Authority and the Mahaweli Authority respectively.
The Irrigation Engineer of the Mapakadawewa Office said construction work was completed within three months due to the involvement of the President.
