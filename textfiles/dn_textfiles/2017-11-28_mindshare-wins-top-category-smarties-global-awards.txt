MindShare wins 'Top of the Category' at SMARTIES Global Awards

Proving their mettle once more, MindShare, a unit of GroupM Media Private Limited clinched the Silver award in the (MESSAGING CATEGORY) for the Softlogic Life flood relief SMS based platform campaign at the SMARTIES Global Awards 2017 organized by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) and held in New York City, USA. SMARTIES Global Awards honours innovation, creativity and effectiveness of mobile marketing campaigns. This year the award carries special significance as there were no Gold award winners in this category. The MMA is the world’s leading global non-profit trade association comprising of over 800 member companies, from nearly fifty countries around the world. The members hail from every faction of the mobile marketing ecosystem including brand marketers, agencies, mobile technology platforms, media companies and operators.
“This achievement is a reflection of the prowess that MindShare has acquired within a short period of time in delivering communication strategies that are worthy of capturing the attention of the global players in the industry. Whilst ‘SMARTIES Global’ is a significant achievement in its own right, the fact that it is Sri Lanka’s first and only win so far in this most sought-after digital awards scheme and possibly the biggest recognition for a Sri Lankan brand in the field of mobile marketing makes the award a much more outstanding achievement,” said Erosha Tennakoon, General Manager, MindShare.
During both the development and execution stages of the flood relief campaign Softlogic Life provided the necessary strategic input and shared valuable insights from the 'insurance' category dynamics to enable MindShare to include the right components to the campaign in order to enhance campaign impact. The award winning Softlogic Life flood relief campaign was created around the client’s corporate vision of ‘Choose your life’ and it was instrumental in saving approximately 2500 lives during the disastrous floods that devastated Sri Lanka in May 2017.
Iftikar Ahmed, Managing Director, Softlogic Life Insurance said, “A local brand creating such an impact on a global platform in the area of marketing and digital is a great milestone for all marketers in Sri Lanka. This shows that we as a country are well in-line with global trends and has the capability and the vision to be on par with any global brand. Without a doubt, this is the highest achievement a Sri Lankan brand has garnered in the field of marketing on a global platform.”
The campaign involved setting up a simple yet highly effective SMS based platform in partnership with Etisalat, a leading mobile operator in Sri Lanka to connect flood victims, rescuers and the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka to deploy necessary rescue teams and aid to affected areas.
At a time when most communication lines were damaged and accessing the affected areas became impossible due to landslides and dangerous levels of inundation, the campaign was a success as Sri Lanka enjoys a high mobile penetration of over 110%.
Moreover, the fact that the country predominantly is a 65% feature phone market allowed a greater number of phones to be active throughout in spite of wide spread power cuts that prevailed. The SMS platform was the most opportune solution at the time since high network traffic arisen due to the disaster affected the voice call penetration.
The SMS hotline was activated with direct links to the Disaster Management Centre while an efficient dashboard gave critical information at a glance enabling the authorities to provide necessary relief. The agile SMS platform was in operation 24 hours a day. The geo targeted messages focused on affected locations were relayed as the first touch point whilst awareness building posts were posted and boosted on FB to increase reach. “This campaign was much more than a strategic communication campaign that reached out to victims of a disaster in their time of need and connected whole of Sri Lanka to take action. In this context, this accolade is of particular significance to all of us at MindShare,” said Chamith Buthgumwa, Head of Digital Media for Mindshare.
In a noteworthy tribute to the effectiveness and the timely relevance of the campaign, Mobile Marketing Association shortlisted the Silver award winning Softlogic Life flood relief campaign for a Smarties APAC Award as well.
