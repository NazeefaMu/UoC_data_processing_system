Significant drop in CKD patients - President

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the number of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients have recorded a significant decrease annually as a result of the comprehensive programmes implemented by the government to prevent kidney disease spreading in the country.
President Sirisena said the government executed extensive programmes during the last three and half years to control and prevent kidney disease and to look into the welfare of kidney patients and their families. The President was speaking at a ceremony to offer pure drinking water to the Sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi yesterday.
The water was collected from 500 water purification systems established at a cost of Rs.800 million. The 500 water purification systems were also vested with the public by the President. President Sirisena further said the number of new kidney disease patients reported in 2016 was 3,372 which declined 2478 in 2017 and 1,500 cases in 2018.
The President said that the Kidney Fund, which he established utilising the money he received and which would have been spent on banners & cutouts during the Presidential Election when he was contesting as the Common Candidate has now become a strong and reputed National Fund. The President also said that through this fund, many programmes have been implemented for the welfare of kidney patients, extended his gratitude to the state and private sectors,the business community and the international community for joining hands with this initiative.
At present, 500 water purification systems have been established with the financial assistance of the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease and with the labour support offered by the Sri Lanka Navy to provide pure drinking water to the people in areas vulnerable to disease.
The 500th water purification system under this project was established at the Mihindu Aranya Senasanaya in Mihintale, Kurundankulama, Anuradhapura. The President, using remote satellite technology, vested that water purification system with the public. The President who participated in religious observances at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura also called on the Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera, and obtained his blessings.
Later, the President engaged in religious observances at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. After this the President offered pure drinking water collected from the 500 water purification systems, to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi.
Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera presented a sapling of the Sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, which is to be sent to Buddhist Temples in Berlin, Germany to the President and later the President handed over the sacred sapling to Ven.Dr.Ittapana Dhammalankara Nayake Thera.
