MAS Holdings inks chemical leasing deal with JAT holdings

MAS Holdings has inked a chemical leasing deal with JAT holdings paint supplier with the aim of reducing chemical usage in their plants and ensuring products are zero toxic by 2020.
As a part of a long term commitment on Environmental Sustainability Aelian Gunawardene, Managing Director of JAT Holdings (Pvt) Ltd and Chelan Goonetilleke, Chief Executive Officer of MAS Active Trading (Pvt) Ltd and their respective teams came together to sign this agreement.
The objective of the agreement is to environmentally and economically optimize a chemical’s life cycle. A specification of the agreement is that the chemical supplier is paid for the usage area of chemicals and not the number of units of chemicals provided. The end user, in order to reduce cost will reduce the amount of chemicals used and opt to recycling at all possible instances.
Benefits of this agreement revolve around the chemical supplier, end user and the environment. As a result of the reduction in chemical consumption and waste, a considerable reduction in air and water pollution will occur. This induces a reduction in emission of the production process leading to a low carbon footprint.
The low amount of chemicals used and the high amount of chemicals recovered, lead to a low cost of production. This value addition shared by both the supplier and the end user provides a dual economic advantage when applying the ChL business model.
