Rare human experiences

Perhaps it is an inner urge that makes a poet or a poetess express his or her feelings, experience and observations in words. This inner urge has resulted in varying types of poetry which makes us understand what poetry is. When I read the 50 poems by Kamani Jayasekara ‘Voicing the Dumb’ (2016 Godage) I felt that I am experiencing varying types of creations woven from the commonest of the most rare human experiences. What we often miss from the naked eye is sensitively captured by the poetess.
Feeling sensitively the bliss of a moment paves the way for Kamani Jayasekara’s creative process. The basic example comes from the poem 2 titled as Satisfaction. The poetic persona states in a cathartic form.
Thunder clashes
Lightening flashes
Fan pelts the roof
A comfortable chill invades the room
You hear gentle snoring
From the other side of the bed
Turned away from me
Facing the wall
As you go on the reader feels a sense of what’s next?
Jayasekara’s poetic creations have gone a long way from the ordinary. She is freer in her expression, and the poetic structures are more creative as boiling situations via dialogues and monologues. One good example is the poem titled as ‘Situational Comedy. This poetic work underlined the gruesome situation in the university academic competitions arise in real non academic climates in the race for higher positions suck as deanships and other ranks.
Perhaps with a smile, the poetic persona in this direction says:
The faculty divided into functions
Propaganda at its worst
Even drawing in the personal
Questioning what had not been questioned
Focusing on criteria
Never regarded as worthy
Making one fear for the
Vision and mission of
The halls of learning
Jayasekara never passes judgments though she indirectly points out the possible judgment. Jayasekara as a creator draws inspiration from the day to day academic experiences. She excels in this venture in the poem titled as Ethical Lessons. The poetic creation centres round a dialogue that ensues between the individuals: a sender and the other the replacement.
Perhaps Jayasekara sees the ironic situations in her own field of work at the university, at times it so happens that the administrative structures obstruct the academic situations of both the student and the teacher. The tendency seems to reach a climax in the case of examinations. Jayasekara selects such a student where an external student finds it different to sit for a particular paper or face an interview as he or she is suffering from sickness like chicken pox. But the ethico-administrative structure finds it difficult to find a situation by way of either pardon or excuse.
They have to abide by the regulations or bureaucratic frame of reference, strictly laid down.
The religious, spiritual and creative spirit is seen in her creations. This experience could be stated as a trance (dhyana) in the mind of the poetess who experienced the bliss of living and at the same time the severe distress and why it happens.
In the poem titled Lessons, the reader may see the lessons in intimacy and aloofness of human contacts distancing one from the mere barriers of didactic verses. The poetic experience lays two layers, the upper layers of expression and the hidden layer of a vision.
A faint fragrance of cologne
Instead of the musky smell of living
Clean, sundried, unruffled sheets
On the spacious bed securing privacy
Setting a perfect atmosphere
Then comes the moment of illumination:
Making you wish that
You may not fall into slumber
Not before you fully
Savour the beauty of luxury
The poetic persona is unmasked and moved by what happens around. Instead a sense of discovery is perceived. Can an ordinary layman become a sensitive poet or a poetess? Where lies the latent talent to possess the skills of poetic abilities? Is it the mere observation, the mere verifying ability or the tradition-bound knowhow conventions? As a reader of Jayasekara’s poems I was for a moment enmeshed in these questions.
The response via the pages of Voicing of the Dumb for me happened to be enticing and enlightening. I was moved by some of the creations, albeit entrapped by the depiction of human conditions that go into the creative expressions. Some of them transcend the mere norms trails that one often observes in poetry.
Being a scholar in western classics, Kamani Jayasekara is driven often to allude her creations to her learned sources. One good example is Adultery.
The brevity of creation and economy of the use of poetic diction is a poetic gift observed herein. To her credit, this is the eighth collection. Jayasekara has been the recipient of several literary awards. I note the commendable effort with raised interest in the field of contemporary literary scene.
