Premier took on challenge to bring in investors - Gayantha

Opening a huge company such as ATG Hand Care (Pvt) Ltd which will provide a large number of jobs to the youth in the South was a most welcome move, said Gayantha Karunathilake, Minister of Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms in Koggala recently.
Sri Lanka from ancient times had built a huge reputation as a trading hub. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe when assumed office had to face a daunting task because the former regime had mismanaged the economy opening several white elephant projects securing huge loans for exorbitant interest rates. Due to this the country was facing a huge financial crisis, Minister Karunathilake said.
But the Premier had taken the challenge to form a government at this difficult juncture and from 2017 onwards bring in investments, open factories around the country and generate employment opportunities and open income avenues to the masses of the country. Fulfilling the promises after the dawn of 2017 within a few days, in a time span of one to one and a half weeks the Premier has brought in investments that will generate over 20,000 jobs in the country, the minister said.
Last week in Giriulla a factory that would provide 3,000 job opportunities was launched. In Kuliyapitiya the work of a massive car assembly plant was inaugurated by the Prime Minister and in Horana, the premier broke ground for a huge tyre manufacturing plant and today by opening this factory in the South had made it a reality to the people in the area. The Prime Minister has also taken the responsibility to revive a huge number white elephant projects in Hambantota, Karunathilake said.
The minister recalled as to how President J. R. Jayewardene took the challenge to build the Mahaweli Project which had been talked about since the 60’s by various governments. Jayewardene took grants and very concessionary loans and completed the accelerated project in six years. The burden of those projects was not passed onto the public, he said.

Fazal Abdeen, Joint Managing Director ATG Group said he and members of the Katunayake Free Trades Zone Manufacturers' Association very much appreciated the government’s endeavour to bring in investments to the country and create one million jobs .
It was also a great pleasure that they were able to contribute to the government’s endeavour of creating one million jobs by providing employment opportunities from their Koggala and Wathupitiwala factories, he said addressing the open ceremony of the US$ 50 million ATG Hand Care Pvt Ltd factory in Koggala. ATG opened in 1992 with about 25 employees. Today they were able to provide employment to more than 4,500 people, he said.
