Cinnamaon Colombo music festival on August 18

Prepare for the biggest musical event in the history of Colombo’s entertainment as Cinnamon brings yet another world-class event to Colombo. Four international artistes will set the city ablaze with their beats with 10 hours of non-stop entertainment on the 18th of August 2018.
The event will feature a selection of entertainers and pop-up events, to seamlessly bring together a multi-faceted one-day festival – one that the city has yet to experience. The Cinnamon brand has long been associated with inspiring the art of living and its latest venture into the entertainment space, will help to solidify the brand’s position as a leading lifestyle brand and hospitality trendsetter.
The festival will last through the day of August 18, for an audience of up to 10,000 people. A state-of-the-art stage will showcase each of the acts and will be hosted in a location which is soon to be unveiled. VIP ticket holders will have backstage passes and access to an exclusive grandstand, among other VIP privileges. The festival will be complete with Detox Lounges to sit back and relax, after a night filled with an eclectic array of performances to wind down throughout the night.
To add vibrancy and another dimension to the festival, paint balling, zorb balls and soap football will brighten up the event along with countless food and activity stalls.
Commenting on the upcoming event, Dileep Mudadeniya, Vice President John Keells Group and Head of Brand Marketing said, “The Cinnamon Brand has a strong track record of curating one-of-a-kind mega-events that have helped to strengthen Colombo’s position as a rising metropolis and top entertainment hub in the region. Our latest event will be an annual music festival that will kick off under specific theme and have a truly global feel and ambiance.
Featuring some of the biggest acts from this genre, this year’s festival will appeal to the entertainment-seekers who don’t want to miss out on life. Sri Lanka is known for its colourful island culture, and audiences here will be able to resonate strongly with this year’s theme.
The festival is designed to have multiple experiential touch-points and will bring the entertainment culture and sounds to life with a contemporary Sri Lankan twist. This festival will be unlike any event the city has experienced before. We encourage you to stay tuned for more details as they unfold in the coming weeks.”
The Cinnamon Music Festival will be the next annual mega-event in the Cinnamon portfolio. The brand recently hosted the region’s first international Broadway production of The Sound of Music.
Celebrity chefs such as George Calombaris and Marco Pierre White have also been hosted and Nigella Lawson is set to visit the island for a series of events in the near future. -NJ
