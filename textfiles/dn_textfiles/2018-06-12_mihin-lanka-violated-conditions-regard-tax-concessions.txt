Presidential Commission reveals
Mihin Lanka violated conditions with regard to tax concessions

It was disclosed at the Presidential Commission that Mihin Lanka company had violated conditions with regard to tax concessions and the company has failed to respond to Board of Investment queries.
The Presidential Commission investigating into the alleged frauds and malpractices at SriLankan catering, SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka met yesterday.
It was also divulged at the commission that no document related to the Cabinet decision for the establishment of Mihin Lanka was found from the BoI dossier.
BoI Director (Investment) Gamini Jayathilaka when inquired by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe told the Commission that SriLankan catering, SriLankan airlines and Mihin Lanka had been exempt from Customs levy through the 2012 budget too.
Wijesinghe said that former Parliamentarian Sajin De Vass Gunawardena had submitted the application for the registration of Mihin Lanka airline with the Board of Investment on October 12, 2006 and he had mentioned his address as Presidential Secretariat, Colombo 01.
The BoI official added that his institution granted the approval on the following day itself and the relevant letter of approval was addressed to Sajin Vass Gunawardena.
He said that Mihin Lanka Chief Executive Kapila Chandrasena had sent a letter requesting the BoI to reduce the investment to US$ 50 million from US$ 100 million.
He had also requested to mention the investment as Rs.3,610 million instead of Rs. 610 billion. The BoI official giving evidence before the Commission said that the BoI informed Mihin Lanka to show reasons as to why the company is making this request to the BOI. He added that Mihin Lanka failed to respond to the BOI letter.
