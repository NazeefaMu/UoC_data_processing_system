Lankan construction  industry could benefit  from India's EXCON

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in association with Ceylon Chamber of Commerce organised a preview on EXCON 2017 – South Asia’s largest event for the construction equipment industry and invited Sri Lankan companies, the SME sector and even engineering students to attend it.
In its ninth edition, it is South Asia’s largest construction equipment fair. This mega business event will take place from December 12-16 at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, Bangalore, India.
With a gross display area of 25,00,000 square feet, the five-day international exhibition organised by the CII would attract over 1,000 exhibitors including 300 companies from abroad. The event is expected to attract over 40,000 business visitors.
In his address at the roadshow, V.G. Sakthi Kumar, member, EXCON 2017 Steering Committee and Manageing Director, Schwing Stetter Sales and Services said that Excon is set to put India’s construction equipment industry, which is expected to grow from US$ 3 billion in 2016 to US$ 5 billion by 2020 in value terms, on the global map.
Sri Lankan companies in the infrastructure and construction sectors have a very distinct advantage in not only sourcing equipment from India at competitive cost, but also offer best-in-class aftermarket service which forms a large part of the operating cost, he further added.
He also spoke of the geographical proximity which reduces downtime for spares and quicker delivery of world-class products for the construction fraternity in Sri Lanka. He was of the strong view that the India sourcing of construction equipment and spares by Sri Lankan contractors and infrastructure companies will definitely lower the cost of the projects.
“We are entering into the ninth edition of EXCON, which has a 17-year strong legacy, having been organized since 2000. With each passing edition, EXCON has witnessed immense growth both in quality and participation. EXCON has grown from India’s biggest to South Asia’s largest construction equipment exhibition at present. With over 1,000 Indian and overseas exhibitors coming under one roof, EXCON 2017 has witnessed a 26% growth in terms of number of exhibitors compared with the 2015 edition.”
“So, while this will be the largest event on all counts including the number of domestic and overseas visitors, exhibition area and new project launches, the biggest difference will be the enhanced presence of foreign players – 300+ participants. There will be country pavilions including from leading economies like Germany, Italy, China, South Korea and United Kingdom,” he said. (SS)
