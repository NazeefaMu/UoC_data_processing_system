UNP reshuffles senior posts

The United National Party (UNP) has once again reshuffled some senior posts to introduce young blood into the party.
Several old posts in the party have been abolished while introducing new ones. The changes were proposed by UNP leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Working Committee Meeting yesterday. The post of National Organiser has been abolished.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage who held the post has been appointed party Senior Vice Chairman.
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando lost his post as deputy national organiser. Party sources said Fernando may be appointed as Estate Workers' Union chairman.
"My duty is to guide young people to organise the party. We all are now in the government and have more responsibilities. The responsibility of the party should go to the young. Our leader is organising the party accordingly," Gamage said commenting on his appointment.
His wife, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage will head 'Lak Vanitha'- the party's women's wing.
Sources said the party leader had also proposed that Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam be appointed as Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya chairman in addition to his role as party Deputy General Secretary, Kavinda Jayawardena as National Youth Front chairman and Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene as Assistant Secretary of the Party and while being in charge of Buddhist affairs.
UNP MP Joseph Michael Perera told the Daily News yesterday that the party leader has proposed these changes to the Working Committee but the abolishing of the national organiser post will only come into effect after it is approved at the National Convention.
The National Convention will be held in September when the UNP is to also discuss a new Constitution for the party. The last time the UNP adopted a new Constitution was in 2010 where Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa was appointed Deputy Leader. In 2014, the Prime Minister introduced the posts of Senior Vice Chairman (Ranjith Madduma Bandara), Assistant Leader (Ravi Karunanayake), Deputy General Secretary (Akila Viraj Kariyawasam), Treasurer (Eran Wickremaratne) and Deputy General Secretary- Elections (Thalatha Athukorala).
UNP MP Kavinga Jayawardena also confirmed that International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe and Lankaputhra Development Bank chairman K.H Lasantha Gunawardena have been newly appointed as members to the UNP Working Committee.
As the newly appointed National Youth Front chairman, Jayawardena said the ideas of the youth were important for the future continuity of the party.
He said they planned to organise a grassroots youth movement to build the next generation of UNPers.
