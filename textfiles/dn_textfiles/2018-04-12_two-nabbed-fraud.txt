Two nabbed for fraud

Two suspects who were arrested by police in connection with a financial racket of Rs. 2.4 million, were remanded until April 25 by Anuradhapura Additional Magistrate Judge Harshana Danushka Rathnayake, yesterday. A youth in Mihintale and an ex-LTTE cadre in Vavuniya, were thus arrested by police for cheating a millionaire businessman by promising to exchange the sum of money for US dollars at a lower rate of Rs. 100.
They were to be produced for an identification parade on April 25.
