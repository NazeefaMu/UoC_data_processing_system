Peterites ‘lend a hand and a heart’

To “lend a hand and lend heart” for a worthy cause the students their parent’s teachers and well wishes of St Peters collage joined a walkathon on July 1. The walk was organised by the school Development Committee.
The main aim of the walk was to raise funds to construct an IT Laboratory, a state of the art auditorium with seating for 300 viewers, refurbish the college Science Laboratory which needs to be equipped with modern facilities to suit the present era and construct a fully equipped sports pavilion complex in the college grounds. Principle Rev. Father Trevor Martin the tutorial staff and parents along with present and past students made a great commitment for this project. Turning the pages back to the history of this premier catholic school which began in 1922, we see that in all eras the school has been blessed with leaders, who had great visions for the development of the school.
St.Peters promotes integral education creating an environment for students to build character fit for leaders who would in the future sphere head the social economic and political arena of Sri Lanka. Many projects have been initiated under the guidance of Rev.Fr Trevor Martin. The most popular is the mini- prize giving where children are motivated to reach for excellence given recognition for making the effort and awarded accordingly.
