'Closure of Deduru Oya bridge will not affect bus commuters'

The proposed closure of the Deduru Oya bridge for urgent repairs will not bring any injustice to bus commuters on the Nikaweratiya Kurunegala route, said the operations superintendent of the Nikawaratiya SLTP depot.
He said steps have
been taken to stop buses of either side of the
bridge and to provide connecting buses to the destination after getting commuters to walk across the bridge.
He added, if this operation is to be a success, the RDA should erect a pedestrian crossing along the bridge.
However, the Wayamba Provincial RDA Directress said the bridge had still not been closed for repairs utpo September 27 morning.
The delay in effecting repairs to the bridge would cause added problems with the onset of heavy rains.
However, authorities had a duty and responsibility to complete the renovation work in time for the December GCE Ordinary Level examination.
