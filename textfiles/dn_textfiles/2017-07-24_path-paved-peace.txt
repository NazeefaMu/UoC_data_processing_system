A path paved for peace

A group of civil society members, religious dignitaries—members of inter-religious organisations, Women and Development Organisation representatives, war victims, former LTTE cadres, media and representatives of the business community, recently came together for at the American Corner in Aththiyad Lane, Navalar Rd in Jaffna, for a survey on what people of the North thought need be addressed for ‘lasting peace and reconciliation’ in the country.
Yearning for lasting peace and reconciliation

Almost all those who had been interviewed pointed out grievances of the same nature; they yearned for lasting peace and reconciliation in the country and did not want another war. All the participants at the interviews were also unanimous in the view that the Government had to find effective mechanisms to promote ethnic and inter-religious harmony, lasting peace and reconciliation. They stressed that there was a delay in the implementation of activities promised by the current government and in finding effective solutions for their genuine grievances.
The Northern community, they said, was the worst-affected by the war and many still remember the suffering they underwent due to decades of conflict.
They said, the previous government never took action to resolve the post-war issues affecting the day-to day lives of the war victims and they had started to doubt whether this regime too, could solve their grievances.
Disappearances
Jeyakanthi Narmila’s husband from Thilaiyampathi in Kondavil, Jaffna, disappeared on August 17, 2007. She alleged that he was taken away by the Army in a white van.
“Some Army soldiers reached my home in a white van—it was around 3.30 am. He has not returned since. I haven’t heard anything about him. I made complaints about the abduction of my husband to both, the Uralu Army Camp and the Kopai Police,” she said.
Six months after the disappearance, she had seen her husband on a motorcycle pillion, ridden by an Army soldier. Three years later, she saw her husband once again, in an army truck.

“On that day, a piece of cloth was tied around his mouth. Thereafter, I never saw my husband again. I have two children and I find it extremely difficult to feed them. I live with my mother and suffer to earn a living, doing odd jobs as a labourer. What had happened to my husband? I need justice,” she added.
J. Vathsala, a resident of Gurunagar, Jaffna, said that her husband was killed by a shell attack during the final phase of the war. He was employed as a security officer for the LTTE.
“I was pregnant then. My husband Benjamin Jayasingham was 33 years old when this incident took place. That was in 2009 at Puthukkudyiruppu, Mullaitivu. He was paralyzed and rushed to Vavuniya Hospital by the ICRC. His wound were infected and he died when the shrapnel was removed,” she said.
“My father was a fisherman. He was killed by the Navy in the deep sea, along with some other fishermen. When my mother went to Palaly camp, she was informed that all the fishermen had been killed,” she added.
“I have two sons and two daughters aged 19, 17, 15 and 10 years, respectively,” she said.
Her elder son passed the G.C.E. (A.L.) and the other son has just sat for his G.C.E. (O.L.) exam. The elder one is temporarily employed as a labourer and earns Rs. 800 per day. Her two daughters are still studying and she makes string hoppers daily, to support her family.
“During the final phase of the war, my sister and her family tried to escape to India by boat, but the Navy shot at the boat. An Indian fishermen rescued her and her infant child, but her husband was killed. My sister and her children returned to Sri Lanka and are now in Mullaitivu,” she said.
Her hope was, ‘all communities in Sri Lanka to be allowed to live in peace and harmony without discrimination.’
N. Ravindradasan and his wife.
She suggested that peace and reconciliation units consisting members of all communities be established in all areas to avoid another bloody war.
N. Ravindradasan, 62, from Keerimalai, Jaffna, is an ex-LTTE supporter and used to work as a library assistant at the University of Jaffna,
“I’m a former supporter of the LTTE movement. I prepared porridge and soup for LTTE cadres. My second daughter joined the movement voluntarily when she was only 17; that was in 1998. She died in 2001 due to a claymore mine and her body was handed over to us by the LTTE,” Ravindradasan said.
During the Ceasefire Agreement signed between the LTTE and the Government, Ravindradasan got his old job back as the library assistant at the university.
“My own house at Kankasanthurai was acquired by the Army as they said, it was located in the ‘High Security Zone.’ So we left for Kilinochchi. At that time, I heard once again that the war could start, so we left to Puthukkudyiruppu without informing the university authorities,” he added.
“We all lived on the beach there, inside a tent provided by the UNHCR. My elder daughter, her husband, two of my grandsons and my son, were sleeping one day while my wife and I were away on the beach. I heard the sound of a bomb exploding near the tent. When we got to the tent, it was on fire, I could only rescue my son who was suffering severely from the injuries,” he said.
LTTE cadres in the location, rushed his son in a truck to an area called Mathalan. Five people from his family were buried in a mass grave on that beach.
“His wounds needed 84 stitches and throughout his university career, he was always emotionally disturbed that his hands did not work as they used to. Both, he and his girlfriend, were only 22 years old when they committed suicide by jumping into a pond in Kopai,” he added.
Ravindradasan and his wife are the only survivors of their family and they live temporarily in a house given to them free of rent by his friend in Keerimalai, Jaffna.
“There is no difference between the Northern politicians and their counterparts in the other provinces of the country. Lasting peace and reconciliation are of no use for us as all our family members have already been killed. Two years into the new government, nothing worthwhile has been done to solve the burning problems of the war victims. We are living in another person’s house while my own house is occupied by the army. There is no war now; our house has to be released.” Ravindradasan said.
He also asked that the Government take action against certain Southern politicians who were in the habit of rousing communal sentiments in order to come into power.
Naga Vihara, Jaffna
The Naga Vihara Chief Incumbent Ven. Meegahajambure Ghanarathana Thera said that the temple was completely destroyed 5 April, 1985, by the LTTE. In 1995, the Sri Lankan Army re-captured Jaffna under the ‘Rivirasa-02’ operation.
The reconstruction of the temple began in 1995 and unemployed Tamil youth too, were employed in reconstruction work, Ghanarathana Thera said.
The temple was reopened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the Ceasefire Agreement.
“Irrespective of ethnic or religious differences, all communities in Jaffna are in the habit of taking part in all the religious ceremonies held at the Naga Vihara. Religious dignitaries representing all religions actively take part in inter-religious discussions conducted in the Naga Vihara Temple when resolving issues relevant to peace and reconciliation,” he said.
Ven. Ghanarathana Thera requested, “Systematic programmes be implemented to rebuild the shattered minds of the war-affected communities in the North”.
“Mechanisms the government promised to promote lasting peace and reconciliation in the Jaffna Peninsula are proving to be very slow and this causes frustration once again in the minds of the Northern communities,” he added.
Language Barriers
The Chief Incumbent also asked that the government send qualified teachers to teach Sinhala in Northern schools, similar to the manner in which Tamil is taught in Southern schools, to solve the language barrier between the two communities. He stressed that there was a serious shortage of qualified teachers in the schools in the North.
He explained that when the former Chief Incumbent, Ven. Meegahajambure Sirivimala Thera (presently in Switzerland), was at the Naga Vihara, he formed an inter-religious committee and launched numerous programmes to solve the unrest created among the students of the University of Jaffna.
Lack of livelihood opportunities
The Chief Incumbent also asked that more factories be opened in the North to solve the employment problems and that resources be equally distributed to all people without ethnic discrimination.
“The housing schemes started for the war victims at the beginning are not suitable for human habitation when compared to the recently provided houses. New housing schemes have to be started to relocate civilians, if there is a delay in releasing the houses and lands in the ‘High Security Zones’,” he said. “Child abuse, incidents of rape, use of intoxicating varieties of drugs are not rare in Jaffna or other parts of the Northern province. This could be due to the abuse of the new-won freedom after a long bondage by the LTTE,” he added.
Women and Development

Jaffna-based Women and Development Organisation Chairman Saroja Sivachanthiran said, lasting peace and reconciliation should not be confined only to words.
The fishing industry in the Northern Province had been gravely affected, causing economic problems for the fishing community. Fishermen from the South, as well as Indian fishermen, were in the practice of stealing the fishing resources of the Northern Sea, she added.
“There are close to 80,000-90,000 war widows. Whether they were wives of the members of the Army, Navy, Air Force or the LTTE does not matter. Widows have the same grievances; all should be treated the same. The facilities provided to widows of the Government Forces are not provided to the widows of the LTTE cadres and this can be identified as yet another type of discrimination,” she said.
The issues of missing persons were also highlighted and she called for certificates of disappearances at least to be handed out to those who cannot be found.
She also asked that government forces not engage in commercial activities which impacted local businesses.
The crime rates have gone up and a large number of liquor shops are found in Jaffna, sometimes in close proximity to schools, she said. She added that the number of school dropouts in the province had also increased significantly.
Sivachanthiran proposed certain solutions such as: creating avenues for job opportunities, ensuring equal rights irrespective of ethnic and religious differences, a proper system in the protection of human rights, increasing the number of Northern women entering local government bodies and Parliament and to have exchange programmes from women from the North to the South and vice-versa.
Jaffna National Youth Services Council former Director Wimalesvari Srikantha Ruban said, war-affected civilians had no funds to cultivate their lands.
Several Organisations had also submitted their proposals on the proposed constitutional reforms, but the Government had not taken action to silence the racist politicians in the so-called Joint Opposition, she added.
The Media
LTTE former Media Spokesman V. Thayanithy, alias Day Master, who is presently employed as the News Editor of Dan TV, said that the Northerners were peaceful and the civilians never made remarks to antagonise the Sinhala community in the South.
The present government was inactive and conveniently ignoring finding solution for the problems of the citizens of the country, including the communities in the North. Thus, paving the way for the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to come to power, Thayanithy said, quoting a recent news report appeared in Veerakesari on a speech made by a certain veteran peace activist.
“The Northerners live in constant fear whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would come back to power again. Those who need lasting peace and reconciliation never advocate what he preached whenever he visited Buddhist Temples,” Thayanithy added.
He said, the Government should resort to the internationally-recognized mechanisms such as, ‘Truth Commissions’ and ‘Transitional Justice Mechanisms’ to provide opportunities for war victims to reveal their genuine grievances. These mechanisms could help the Government to find solutions for the unaddressed issues of the war-affected, he added.
