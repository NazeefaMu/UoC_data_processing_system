FIFA World Cup: What happens in knock-outs in case there is a tie?

The knock-out stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup started on Saturday as France overcame Argentina and Uruguay downed Portugal.
It's a do-or-die battle in the knock-outs as there is no possibility of a draw.
So what happens if a knock-out fixture ends as a tie after 90 minutes?
Let's look at the rules regarding tie-breakers.
THE EXTRA-TIME POST THE 90 MINUTES
EXTRA-TIME
In the group game, if two teams draw a fixture, then both sides are awarded equal points (1).
But in the knock-outs post the 90-minute period, the match enters extra-time.
There are two halves in the extra-time period of 15 minutes each.
We see a total of 30 minutes of football and the team which gets the winning goal progresses.
WHAT IF THE SCORE-LINE REMAINS SAME AFTER EXTRA-TIME?
SCENARIO
Even after extra-time, if the two teams remain level in terms of goals scored, then the match enters the penalty shootout phase.
Five players are allowed to take the penalties.
After 5 penalties, if the score-line reads the same for both the teams, then the spot-kick battle continues until a team gets one more than the opponent.
GERMANY THE KING OF PENALTIES
GERMANS
Germans have been the masters of shoot-outs.
They have won four World Cup matches which were determined by the shoot-outs.
They have also scored 15 penalties in a row during the shoot-out in these four campaigns.
Argentina come second aftera claiming four wins from five attempts.
England have a poor record after failing to win even one of their three shoot-outs.
