AIA holds 24th Poson  safety programme

AIA’s Poson Safety Programme saved the lives of six persons. Now in its 24th consecutive year, the programme aims at protecting the lives of pilgrims travelling to Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla.
Every year, AIA Insurance joins hands with the Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Lifesaving, the Civil Security Division and the Sri Lanka Navy in deploying lifeguards to watch over the reservoirs in the area, which are popular bathing and swimming spots.
Over 200 lives have been saved due to this programme since its inception.
This year a total of 560 lifeguards were deployed around 22 lakes and reservoirs, for three days straight, to protect the pilgrims. Six lives were saved including that of an 11 year old school-boy.
“We have just completed the 24th consecutive year of our Poson Safety Programme and we are glad to have played a part in saving over 200 lives since its inception” said AIA’s Chief Marketing Officer, Nikhil Advani.
We are grateful to our partners, Sri Lanka Lifesaving, Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Navy and the Civil Security Division who so enthusiastically support AIA’s Poson Safety Programme with their lifeguards each year to protect the lives of the pilgrims who visit lakes and reservoirs around the holy sites.
