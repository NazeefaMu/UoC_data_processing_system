More investment opportunities at Mattala soon

The Mattala International Airport will be geared to support both international and domestic travel as well as air and sea cargo transshipment in alliance with the Hambantota seaport under the plans mooted by the government, according to sources at the Mattala airport.
The sources said a marketing plan is being prepared, which will provide opportunities for local and foreign investors.
The sources added that the Urban Development Authority has identified and allocated lands for the development of tourism, which will open investment opportunities for hotels.
Meanwhile, the Warapitiya wewa at Tissamaharama remains overgrown with weed and aquatic plants. Its water is being used by farmers at Saliyapura and Tissapura villages for various cultivations.
The farming community in these areas said the wewa should be dredged to enable the farming community to obtain sufficient water for cultivations. The farming community said the plight of the wewa has been brought to the notice of the political authority in the Hambantota district.
However, political authorities observe silence over it.
