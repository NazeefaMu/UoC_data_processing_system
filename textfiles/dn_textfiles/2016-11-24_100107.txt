64th National Billiards Championship   : Record-breaking Sirisoma bags title for 25th time

 
Defending champion Port Authority’s K.H. Sirisoma bagged the national title for a record 25th time when he defeated S.H.M. Aslam of Moors SC by an easy six frames to three (91/100, 100/98, 100/51, 63/100, 101/91, 85/100,
100/44, 101/39, 100/78) in the nine-frame final of the 64th National Billiards Championship worked off at the Otter AC billiard tables yesterday.
The same two cueists battled out last year’s final as well with Aslam who has never won the national title finishing second best for the eighth time.
Seasoned campaigner Sirisoma experienced a shocking setback when young Aslam defeated him in the first frame, but regained his composure to win two consecutive frames.
A ding-dong battle ensured with Aslam winning the fourth frame and Sirisoma retaliating by taking the fifth only to lose the sixth frame.
The 62-year-old veteran cueist then displayed his class and brought out all his experience to win the next three frames and with it the title.
In the semi-finals Sirisoma overcame SL Army’s Susantha Wickrema by an easy five frames to one while Aslam received an unexpected walkover from K. Devapura of Galle who met with an accident on his way to the semis on Tuesday.
Sirisoma and Aslam have qualified to play for the World Billiards Championship which will be held from December 5 to 10 in India.
