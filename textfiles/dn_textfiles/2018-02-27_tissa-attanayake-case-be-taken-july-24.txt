Tissa Attanayake case to be taken up on July 24

The Colombo High Court yesterday re-issued summons on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear before Colombo High Court on July 24 to testify in the case filed against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday sought a further date to testify in the case filed against former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake.
When the case came up before High Court judge Vikum Kaluarachchi, the court was informed that the President and Prime Minister, the key witnesses in the case, had notified the fact that they are unable to appear in courts since they have to perform their official duties.
Thereby, the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake, for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media, during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena was fixed for a long date by the Colombo High Court.
Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election aimed at inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently out on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court, by the Attorney General, over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility, or, violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character, or, conduct of any candidate.
The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim as witnesses in the case. Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for Tissa Attanayake. Counsel Niroshan Perera appeared for UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim.
