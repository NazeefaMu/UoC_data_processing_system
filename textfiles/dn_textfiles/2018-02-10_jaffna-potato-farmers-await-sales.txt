Jaffna potato farmers await sales

Potato farmers in the North undergo severe hardships to sell their produce at least at Rs.50 per kilo at the Dambulla Economic Centre.
Imported potatoes are available at the centre at Rs.36 to Rs.40 per kilo while Jaffna farmers are languishing at the locations without a deal whole day, sources said.
The centre is receiving large stocks of potatoes daily from the Jaffna peninsula as its farmers have received a bumper potato harvest this season.
Their potatoes have been stored all over the economic centre and Jaffna farmers are sitting on their potato sacks without any sale.
