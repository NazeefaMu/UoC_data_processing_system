A welcome move

Almost all other problems pale into insignificance beside the garbage problem that has affected the entire country. One can gauge the magnitude of the problem when considering that more than 700 tons of solid waste has to be removed from Colombo alone per day.
The recent collapse of the garbage ‘mountain’ at Meethotamulla that resulted in 40 deaths was a wake-up call to everyone, from the authorities to the householders, that the issue has to be taken seriously at least now. The dengue epidemic, though not a direct result of garbage accumulation, has compounded the problem and forced all stakeholders to search for an urgent solution.
Now Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has been tasked with resolving the garbage and solid waste issue, having launched several successful measures to contain the garbage problem in a previous turn as Environment Minister. He has accepted the challenge, knowing the gravity of the issue.
As Minister Ranawaka stressed, the dumping of garbage in landfills is passé. Instead, we have to look for alternatives that actually make use of garbage. Thinking along those lines, the Government plans to initiate three projects in the Western Province next month to generate electricity using municipal solid waste. This initiative forms the basis of measures to find a permanent solution to the festering garbage crisis in urban areas. Making compost fertiliser is another method and Minister Ranawaka has already announced compost programmes that use 300 tons of garbage per day. Around 100 tons are being recycled. Many other countries already have similar programmes and there is no doubt that they can be replicated here.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had taken a keen interest in addressing the garbage issue long before Meethotamulla. President Sirisena appointed a three member task force comprising Ministers Champika Ranawaka, Faiszer Musthapha and Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya to pilot the garbage disposal project in the Western Province and specifically Colombo. As Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Ranawaka stressed both international support and latest technology should be used to address the garbage crisis. The Government has focused on finding permanent solutions to the garbage crisis that remained unresolved by successive governments for decades, they said. There will be a scientifically managed sanitary landfill in Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam district.
The ban on polythene and polystyrene coming into effect from September will also go a long way towards addressing the garbage issue. The best way of addressing this issue is reducing the quantity of garbage in the first place. With close to one million lunch sheets being discarded in Colombo alone every day, one can imagine the extent of the problem. Although many varieties of polythene are now biodegradable, this process still takes many years during which time the polythene fills the landfills. Polythene is clearly not a sustainable solution for our environmental problems. The onus is on our scientists and researchers to develop suitable alternatives to polythene which are just as convenient and cheap. Paper is one alternative that can easily be recycled – the older generations will remember the paper bags and “gotu” which were in vogue before the advent of polythene. Nelum and Banana leaves are already being used as lunch sheets by many establishments, but there are just not enough of them around for one million lunch packs per day. Hence the importance of looking for alternative materials. Our universities must play a leading role in this effort.
The Government alone cannot resolve this problem 100 percent. Public response and participation are essential. The first thing to bear in mind is the value of the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Reducing household and commercial waste is essential. If we cook just the amount of food we can eat, there will be nothing left to throw away. If we reuse a bag for shopping (yes, even a polythene one), it will drastically cut down on the “siri siri” bags that end up in landfills. Awareness on recycling is almost non-existent – the authorities must launch a campaign on recycling through the print and electronic media that will educate the public on what kind of materials and goods can be recycled. It is also vital to reduce electronic and electrical goods wastage – many of these items are Built for Disassembly and can easily be recycled.
One should try to avoid goods that may harm the environment. PET bottles are a good example. Unlike the glass bottles which have to be returned to buy new ones, PET bottles are single-use items which then have to be discarded. The Government should contemplate bringing in laws that restrict their use, but we can do our bit by minimizing PET purchases.
Education is a vital part of the chain. Children should be encouraged from very young days to separate garbage according to type and not to waste food indiscriminately so that the next generation will be much more knowledgeable and responsible on garbage. Technology will also have marched on by then, finding solutions to today’s vexed problems. Until then, everyone must chip in to waste less.
