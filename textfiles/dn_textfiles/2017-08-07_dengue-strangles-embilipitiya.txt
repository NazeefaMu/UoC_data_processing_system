Dengue strangles Embilipitiya

Seven out of every 1000 people in the Embilipitiya town have been diagnosed with dengue, authorities said.
The authorities have implemented several programmes to combat the dengue menace.
A 5-day programme to clean up the city and surrounding areas was launched yesterday by the Public Health Inspectors’ Office and the Municipal Council, supported by the Police and Security Forces.
PHI office sources said around 315 dengue patients were detected in the city alone and 750 dengue patients were reported in the PHI division. Over 200 mosquito breeding sites were detected during the yesterday’s programme and those responsible for them will be dealt with legally, the PHI Office sources said.
