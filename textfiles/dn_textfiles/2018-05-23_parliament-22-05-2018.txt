Sri Lanka – Singapore Free-Trade Agreement
‘Unlinked individuals restricted from independent movements’
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama yesterday said that there was no liberalisation of independent movements of any persons not linked to investments under the Sri Lanka and Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
He said the Agreement was endorsed by the Cabinet and Attorney-General prior to inking it. He also agreed to table a copy of it in Parliament, adding that it is freely available in the website for anybody to peruse. The minister’s speech was aimed at debunking the misinformation related to the freshly-signed Free-trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore.
“With regard to trading services, certain professional associations have expressed their concerns regarding the influx of professionals and other workers into the country. The movement of natural persons from Singapore has not been opened up under the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, except for intra-corporate transferees in very senior management and business visitors linked to investments,” he said.
He added that corporate transferees were individuals from a branch of a Singaporean company with an investment in Sri Lanka and are also limited to managers, executives and specialists.
“Business visitors will be permitted for a period of not more than 30 days for purposes such as market-scoping, business agreements and so on. Corporate transferees’ period of stay is also initially, limited up to two years. No movement of persons either Singapore citizens or permanent residents, have been opened in professional services,” Minister Samarawickrama said.
“Even permanent resident holders arriving in Sri Lanka are limited and their entry would be tied to a corresponding investment in Sri Lanka,” he said while responding to claims that the agreement would lead to millions of non-Singaporean citizens arriving in Sri Lanka.
“These claims are untrue. The FTA does not permit any permanent resident to work in Sri Lanka. Even corporate transferees who arrive in Sri Lanka can only work for that particular Singaporean company which they are employed at,” the minister said.
“The concern that engineering and architectural services have been opened, is also incorrect. The only commitment is towards cross-border services, and that is only through the use of internet and is unrelated to the movement of people. This is taking place now and it is already possible through the existing regulations and administrative framework. That has also been limited to pre-designed advisory and consultative service, and does not include practice of architectural or engineering profession,” he said.
“Thus, establishing a company to provide these advisory services in the country or for the movement of natural persons to provide such services, have not been permitted under the agreement. It should be emphasized that Sri Lanka has not undertaken any liberalisation exceeding the prevailing investment regime,” the minister added.
He said that if a person had “dominant and effective nationality in a third country,” such persons had also been excluded under the Agreement. “Therefore, Singaporean companies cannot hire and send citizens of another country to work in Sri Lanka,” he added.
The minister, pledging to keep trade chambers, trade associations and professional bodies informed on the negotiations of the FTAs, said that entering into FTAs with selected countries is a part of the government’s new trade policy.
“The aim of the policy is to achieve diversification of exports as well as export markets. All these are for the progress of our country. We have to change; we cannot go on the way we have been going on before. We need new markets, new products. We are not sacrificing our people; only helping them. Our country requires a knowledge-based economy. In addition to funds, we can get know-how through Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs),” he said.
The minister welcomed constructive dialogue with trade chambers and professional bodies, and invited them to point out if they found anything adverse in the Agreements.
“We have a period of one year after which a review can take place, and if there is anything wrong in the agreement, we can make amendments,” Minister Samarawickrama said.
The minister further said the Agreement had no effect on the government’s revenue as import tariffs on petroleum and gold had not been removed under the FTA.
“The trade liberalisation programme has been in consultation with the Finance Ministry. At present, imports from Singapore are valued at USD 1.293 billion, out of which USD 750 million was for petroleum products and USD 228 million was for gold. These tariffs had not been removed,” he said, adding that the Agreement does not allow transshipment of goods.
Speaker names Chair Panel for Parliament’s second session
The Chair Panel for the second session of the eighth Parliament, which comprises of the members to preside in the absence of the Speaker, was named by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament, yesterday.
The 11-member Chair Panel includes Parliamentarians Piyankara Jayaratne, Lucky Jayawardena, Bimal Rathnayake, Edward Gunasekara, J. M. Ananda Kumarasiri, K. Thureiratnasingham, Shehan Semasinghe, Kanaka Herath, Velu Kumar, Mujibur Rahuman, and Dr. Thusitha Wijemanne.
Group of 16’s concern for public, a pretence- Dr. Jayatissa
No member of the Joint Opposition and the ‘SLFP Group of 16,’ who insisted on having an urgent debate on the disaster situation and the fuel price hike, was present in Parliament when the debate was facilitated, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
Seconding the adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Nihal Galappatti on the inconveniences faced by the public due to the sudden fuel price hike, Dr. Jayatissa questioned the absence of the JO and SLFP members in the Opposition for the debate.
“Earlier, the JO together with the SLFP faction of 16, made a din in the House requesting to postpone the two Gazettes scheduled for debate in order to discuss the flood situation and the fuel price hike. The Speaker agreed to cut short the day’s business and facilitate a three-hour adjournment debate for the purpose at 4pm,” he said.
“However, MP Dinesh Gunawardena opposed it, stating that the JO wished to call for a division on the two Gazettes, and that their MPs would only arrive at 6.30 p.m. for the vote. The debate ended at 6.30 p.m. and no division was called. None in their group was present in the House even to speak a single word regarding either matter,” Dr. Jayatissa added.
“This gives us the impression that they were shedding crocodile tears on the inconveniences faced by the public when Parliament proceedings were shown live on TV. People must understand that their acting in front of TV cameras does not reflect the nature of their politics,” he said.
JO MPs, together with the SLFP Group of 16, agitated in the House at the commencement of the meeting, demanding to take up an urgent debate on the disaster situation and the fuel price hike. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya turned down the demand, saying that an adjournment debate on the fuel price would be moved by the JVP and that concerns on the flood situation could be raised during the debate on regulations under the Environment Act to be taken up today. Later, the JVP proposed that the concerns on the floods could also be aired during the same debate, and it was agreed by both the government and the Speaker.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, joining the argument, said all members must abide by the Speaker’s ruling and that if anybody wanted to challenge it, a separate substative motion should be presented. “If you cannot accept the Speaker’s ruling, we can appoint a committee to look into that,” he said.
The Speaker, in a heated exchange of words with MP Gunawardena, said that not only them (the JO), but that he too understood the problems faced by the people.
Politicians’ agendas change with positions: Handunnetti
Sri Lankan politicians had obtained the largest amount of commissions from strategic development projects, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti said, yesterday.
Politicians, as they change their positions from the Opposition to government and back, conveniently change their attitude towards strategic development projects, MP Handunnetti pointed out.
“It is how they bend the law,” he said, adding that that was how the innocent fall prey to traps.
He was addressing a debate on the amendments to the Strategic Development Project Act.
Handunnetti questioned whether the debates on the said development projects by both parties were merely done for the sake of arguing.
“When the previous government brought in this Strategic Development Project Act, we, together with the United National Party (UNP), argued against it. At present, the UNP is forwarding the same act again. When the Act was initially taken up, we said the pro-act politicians were obtaining commissions and that it would destroy the country,” MP Handunnetti added.
Handunnetti alleged that there had been no proper discussions between professionals and the government on the Singapore trade agreement. He urged Minister Malik Samarawickreme to hold discussions with professionals who had raised concerns over the agreement.
Mimister Samarawickreme in reply, said that the government had already held several rounds of discussions over the matter and agreed to schedule another series of meetings over the course of the following week.
Suwaseriya Foundation, Land Amendment Bills presented at Parliament
The government yesterday in Parliament, presented the 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation Bill and Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Amendment Bill.
The bills were presented for the first reading by Government Whip Gayantha Karunatileka.
The establishment of the Suwaseriya Foundation is to provide pre-hospital care ambulance services and emergency response services free-of-charge to any person. It also provides immediate and effective pre-hospital care free-of-charge in a safe and clinical working environment until a person reaches the nearest healthcare provider.
The bill to amend the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act is to relax the hitherto prevailed restriction on the sale of a condominium parcel situated on or above the fourth floor to foreigners, provided that the entire value shall be paid upfront through an inward foreign remittance, prior to the execution of the relevant deed of transfer.
MP Ramanathan proposed for Deputy Speaker post
 
The name of United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) National List Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan had been proposed for the Deputy Speaker post at the Party Leaders’ meeting in Parliament, yesterday.
The proposal was made by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) group in Parliament. They had told party leaders that they sought the permission of their party leader President Maithripala regarding the matter.
However, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran had reportedly opposed the nomination. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had chaired the party leaders’ meeting.
The government backbenchers recently argued that the post of Deputy Speaker had fallen vacant with the crossover of MP Thilanga Sumathipala to the Opposition along with 15 other members. They added that the 16 dissident MPs crossed over to the Opposition after submitting a letter which stated that they would resign from their posts.
As per the agreement between the two main parties of the national government, the post of deputy speaker should be given to an MP from the SLFP.
