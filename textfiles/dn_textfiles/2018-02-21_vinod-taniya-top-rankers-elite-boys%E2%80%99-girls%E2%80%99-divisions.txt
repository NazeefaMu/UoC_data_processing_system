NDB Wealth National Junior Golf Rankings 2017
Vinod, Taniya top rankers in elite boys’, girls’ divisions

Vinod Weerasinghe, Taniya Balasuriya, S. Dhuwarshan, Shanal Binuksha and Reshan Algama topped the respective divisions as the Sri Lanka Golf Union announced the National Junior Golf Rankings 2017 on Monday. The junior golf ranking programme is sponsored by the NDB Wealth Management for the second successive year.
The junior ranking programme paved a good platform to showcase budding golfing talent and to encourage juniors to improve and develop their skills. Three main annual events namely, Rukmini Kodagoda Match Play Championship, the Sri Lanka Junior Open in Colombo and the Prima Regional Junior Opens in Kandy and Nuwara Eliya were considered for junior rankings of 2017.
Junior Golfers have been ranked accordingly in four age categories ranging from below 9 years (Copper Division) and 10-11 years (Bronze Division), to 12-14 years old (Silver Division), 15-18 years old (Gold Division) and girls combined (Silver/Gold Divisions).
“This has attributed in the junior golfers’ aspiration to improve their skills and maintain consistency throughout the year to get prestigious national rankings. The SLGU is thankful to the sponsorship from NDB Wealth for the second year,” said Niloo Jayatilake, Chairperson - Junior Subcommittee, Sri Lanka Golf Union. She added that national rankings will permit the juniors access to any golf course in Sri Lanka and privilege facilities. The developed ranking system will also be used in selecting players for overseas representation as it tests the player’s current form making national selection easier and more transparent. The governing body for golf in Sri Lanka has developed a long term strategy and is now focused on promoting junior golf in the country to harness talent in the island with the junior development programs island-wide.
SLGU expects more numbers to participate in the coming year and much keener competition for the juniors as the playing population increases.
