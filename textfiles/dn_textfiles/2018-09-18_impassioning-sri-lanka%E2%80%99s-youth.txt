National Youth Model United Nations 2018
Impassioning Sri Lanka’s Youth

“I believe we need to bring about change in society and that can only be done by having strong passion from the youth,” says 20-year-old Zainab Rafeek, a Model United Nations (MUN) delegate with more than seven years’ experience. “I believe it’s possible to bring about change when you have that vision in you.”
Rafeek is a new member of the Secretariat of Sri Lanka’s National Youth Model United Nations (NYMUN), the largest youth MUN platform in the country. At this year’s conference, NYMUN 2018 organisers expect about 350 participants. NYMUN was founded, says the organisation, “to serve two notions: to provide the young people of our country an opportunity to engage and learn the art of diplomacy and conflict-resolution.”
For novices, the Model United Nations is a mock United Nations, where participants engage with the same challenging issues addressed in the real UN. Participants are typically students, and throughout the conference, they develop their critical-thinking skills by grappling with the same kinds of challenges and logistics required in real diplomatic settings. They even learn the rules of UN decorum and procedure.
Each participant is assigned a specific country, committee, and topic, and before the conference they research how that country would respond to the issue that they have been assigned. Another member of NYMUN’s Secretariat, Shaila Sabri says that participants learn based on “how each country could bring about a resolution.” She hopes that from their MUN experience, they extrapolate beyond the conference, to “how they could apply those solutions to our country.”
The six committees of NYMUN 2018 function through a simulation of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. Amongst the topics covered this year are disarmament, decolonisation, science and technology for development, human rights, and the status of women.
To a greater extent than previous conferences, NYMUN 2018 has sought to reach out to Sri Lanka’s nine provinces with a campaign of awareness and accessibility.
“We travelled from province to province where we held workshops,” explains Sabri. “We distributed study guides and manuals,” she elaborates, “We trained young people by explaining the whole process of the MUN, the protocols and procedures that come with the conference.”
During the workshops, the Secretariat holds impromptu MUN simulations, giving participants small topics to try out. Already, they’ve travelled to the Central Province, the Western Province, the North Western Province, and last weekend, they travelled to the Eastern Province as well.
“We had some people in Beruwela who were really interested. It was encouraging for us,” says Sabri, who exchanges glances and smiles with Rafeek. They display their own passion for the messages they are spreading and the excitement they have managed to create nationwide for the process of peace-making.
Rafeek says that reaching out to all nine provinces is part of the first phase of their broader goals. “The second thing,” she says, “is that NYMUN needs to be trilingual.”
Another reason that NYMUN 2018 is different from previous conferences is that it offers two of its six committees in all three languages, English, Sinhala, and Tamil. By creating trilingual sessions, NYMUN 2018 fulfills another of its purposes: to engage with global problems through diverse perspectives.
Going forward in 2019, NYMUN envisions making the conference increasingly accessible to speakers of all three languages. With that in mind, the Secretariat is eager to implement another phase of their plan: to organise provincial conferences, where delegates from three or so provinces come together for regional debates.
“Out of the provincial conference participants, the best would be chosen for Vision 2020, where the whole island would be represented, because everyone deserves a chance,” says Sabri.
The year 2020 is an important one for Sri Lanka, with an upcoming Presidential Election as well as Parliamentary elections as the benchmark for sustainable development goals (SDGs), explains Sabri, and NYMUN wants to capitalise on that significance. That’s why the NYMUN Secretariat has already entered into the planning stages of Vision 2020, “a national youth assembly to make sure the voice of the youth is considered by relevant authorities to ensure greater fairness of political, legal and economic systems and safeguard fundamental rights,” as its mission statement says.
“Vision 2020 is basically a youth assembly that we are creating,” says Sabri, “to be a part of the current issues in the country. Not to be someone who is looking into it, but to be someone who is actively contributing.”
The NYMUN Secretariat sees Vision 2020 as an opportunity to inform and engage Sri Lanka’s critical youth electorate. NYMUN 2018, and, in the future, 2019 are part of the larger process of attracting the country’s brightest and most thoughtful youth in preparation for their 2020 goals. By then, the entire conference, they say, will be conducted in English, Sinhala and Tamil, “because we believe language should not be a barrier in the path towards greatness,” states the Vision 2020 mission statement.
Now, registration for NYMUN 2018 is available online to young people (both students and professionals) between the ages of 14 and 30, with a fee of about Rs. 2,500. Travel grants have been made available to some of the participating delegations, and by the end of this month, hundreds of young people from across the country will make their way to Colombo for the conference, which will take place on September 29 and 30 at Colombo University.
NYMUN 2018, says Rafeek, “is a place where you have got youth coming from different places – irrespective of race, religion, country, or caste – bringing their innovative ideas, because each person out there may have a solution.”
