Kingswood out to grab William Weerasinghe trophy

Kingswood College who played in the lower Segment II B ended unbeaten in the first round by beating Vidyartha, Ananda, Maliyadewa and St. Sylvester’s.
In five games they scored 213 points for 51 against. Now they are in the Plate competition of the second round and will meet their arch rivals Dharmaraja on April 29 at Pallekelle.
This match is played for the William Weerasinghe trophy, which was introduced in 2001, in appreciation of the service rendered by William Weerasinghe to the Rajans rugby. On May 7 Kingswood will play St. Anthony’s at Nittawela while they will meet Lumbini on May 13 at Mt. Lavania, followed by the match against D.S.Senanayake at Welisara on May 22.
Kingswood who got themselves relegated from the ‘A’ Division after a below par last season has been the top performer in the lower division this season in the first round.
This time they are coached by one of their old boys, D.D.S Gamage who has done a good job. Few months ago he guided the under 18 to win the all Island championship. This school was the first in Sri Lanka to introduce rugby when they were known as Boys High School.
