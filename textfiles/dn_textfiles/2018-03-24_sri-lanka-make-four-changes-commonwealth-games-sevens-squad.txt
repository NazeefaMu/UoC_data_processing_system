Sri Lanka make four changes to Commonwealth Games sevens squad

Sri Lanka had made four changes to their national sevens rugby squad by including the services of players in the calibre of Dhanushka Ranjan, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Richad Darmapala and young Sri Lanka national under 20 sevens captain Naveen Heenakankanamge for the upcoming Commonwealth games next month.
Present CH and FC third row forward cum Auckland Blues sevens forward Sudarshana Muthuthanthri will once again lead the team. Mean while it was really shocking to see the selectors leaving out players like Kevin Dixon, and Reeza Rafaideen who had a stand out performance in the Borneo Rugby sevens tournament that concluded in Sandakan, Malaysia last week.
The good news for the Tuskers is the welcome return of speedy three quarter and former Sri Lanka national under 20 sevens captain, Thomian Naveen Heenakankanamge in to the side. Also the selectors has retained youngster Adeesha Weerathunga for this tournament after a superb performance at the Borneo sevens.
The probable squad is as follows, Sudarshana Muthuthanthri (Captain/Forward), Srinath Sooriyabandara (Utility three Quarter), Adeesha Weerathunga (Forward), Danushka Ranjan (Three Quarter), Tarinda Ratwatte (Utility Player), Kavindu Perera (Utility Player), Naveen Heenakankanamge (Three quarter), Sudam Sooriyaarachchi (Three Quarter), Rehan Silva (Three quarter), Danush Dayan (Utility Player), Richad Darmapala (Three Quarter), Sithum Peiris (Forward) or Hirantha Perera, Inthisham Marikar (High performanse Director) Head coach -
