NHREP overarching policy framework for employment

Cabinet this week approved the National Human Resources and Employment Policy which is to be the overarching policy framework for the government from 2017-2021 when providing and managing employment within the country.
The Policy is an update of the detailed action plan prepared in 2014 and incorporates the development priorities of the present government. The plan has also laid greater emphasis according to the Cabinet paper on private sector involvement in creating employment and growth opportunities.
In addition, it has also included the Medium Term Development Strategies declared by the Prime Minister in Parliament on 5 November 2015 along with inputs from the President.
The plan proposes the coordination of 28 line ministries which would have direct involvement with the implementation of the policy. Implementation is to be coordinated by the National Steering Committee and a Progress Monitoring Unit has been established in the Department of Manpower and Employment under the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations.
