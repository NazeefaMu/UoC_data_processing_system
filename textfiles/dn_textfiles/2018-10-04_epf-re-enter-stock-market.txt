EPF to re-enter stock market

The Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) will re-enter the Stock Market under strict guidelines and a cautious investment strategy, Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
The Governor, speaking at a press conference at the CB auditorium on Tuesday, said the EPF would be permitted to trade only in Monetary Board approved “list of shares”. He said that the list is now being finalised with the help of the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
He said ‘investment and trading guidelines’ for the EPF have now been agreed to make sure that necessary safeguards and checks and balances are in place with regard to the Rs 2 trillion-Fund.
“There is a lot of preparation for the EPF’s re-entry into the Stock Market. An investment committee chaired by a Deputy Governor, which meets every day, will decide on the EPF investments. The decisions will be taken collectively. CCTV and voice recording devices will be installed and special training will be given to the officers,” the Governor explained.
“Since there had been some resistance from Trade Unions, we hope to call a meeting with the Trade Unions Advisory Committee in a couple of weeks.We will make a presentation to them on the new measures to be taken when trading EPF money in the stock market,” the Governor added. He said once all these steps are completed, the Monetary Board would decide the date as to when the EPF would come back to the Stock Market. He said the percentage of the Fund traded in the Stock Market would not exceed 5 percent.
He pointed out that if the Government maintains the fiscal discipline, the domestic borrowing requirement of the Government would lessen gradually and therefore the EPF would have to find new avenues for investment other than the Government Securities.
“The peak of the domestic debt repayment comes this year and that amount is Rs 980 billion. Next year it drops down to Rs 600 billion and it further drops the year after.The EPF will have to look for other avenues, but certainly those have to be conservative investment,” he added.
Asked by journalists as to why not the EPF pulls out of its arbitrary investments, which have given no return as revealed in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Sri Lankan and Mihin Airlines, the Governor said now is not the best time to do so as the stock market is operating at low rate. “We need to wait till the Stock Market regains. This is a buying opportunity, not a selling opportunity,” he added.
