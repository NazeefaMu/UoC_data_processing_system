‘Standards of medical education should be safeguarded’

The future generation will blame us if we do not safeguard the standard of the medical education and the safety of patients’ lives. Therefore, we will not let down our duty, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne showed his mental status on May Day <U+200B>to the entire country <U+200B>by threatening a trade union on workers’ day, he said. He said the minister showed his mentality to the entire country, <U+200B>b<U+200B>ut the GMOA will not bow down to his <U+200B>verbal or any other <U+200B>threat.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said they would not stop the surgery halfway and let the patient die. “We will continue our struggle until the Government take over the SAITM and offer a scholarly solution.<U+200B> The set of proposals presented to the Government by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the <U+200B>Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTAs)<U+200B> simply solve the SAITM issue while doing the justice for its students, he said. <U+200B>
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said there is no Malaria, and Filaria today not because of the `talking’ of the Health Minister.
Today Sri Lanka’s health indicators are among the developed countries’ because of the dedication and hard work of health professionals.
Today many patients stay on ground in state hospitals without adequate beds while the Health Minister is busy putting advertisements on behalf of a private company, he said.
