DFCC Bank receives ISO 27001:2013 certification

DFCC Bank was recently awarded the ISO 27001:2013 certification in recognition of implementing the best practices in legal, physical and technical control for information security management.
The certificate was awarded to Palitha Gamage, Chief Risk Officer DFCC Bank by Shan Nanayakkara, General Manager Bureau Veritas Sri Lanka, at the awarding ceremony held at the DFCC Bank Auditorium recently.
This certification entails that the bank has met all levels of confidence in information security management, becoming one of the four financial institutions in the country to be certified.
Apart from enhancing DFCC Bank’s image and giving it a competitive edge in the industry, the certification also reinforces the bank’s willingness and commitment in enhancing security posture of the organisation to increase customer confidence in line with international standards and best practice.
“This is yet another step in our journey of growth as a Bank that is committed to providing sustainable solutions to all stakeholders. We take pride in being awarded this certification, which demonstrates our compliance with mandatory certification as laid down by the Central Bank. “
“The DFCC management was committed to implement the ISO 27001:2013 security standard and engaged with PWC for the ISO implementation and with Bureau Veritas for the certification audit. We are grateful to them for their support.” said Arjun Fernando CEO, DFCC Bank.
Commenting on this achievement, Yudhishtran Kanagasabai Director, PwC Sri Lanka, said, “DFCC has taken a bold step well ahead from Baseline Security Standard mandated by the Regulator in moving towards ISO 27001:2013 thus firstly raising security awareness, establishing processes and then keeping an unblinking focus on violations and new threats as they emerge with a view to strengthening its security posture.”
 In an era where the technology landscape continues to change and the diversity of the threat landscape continues to increase this certification would move DFCC to the next level in being a cyber-resilient organisation thus providing comfort to all its stakeholders about privacy of data and information.
PwC is proud be associated with this journey that resulted in DFCC being certified in ISO 27001:2013.” 
General Manager, Bureau Veritas, Shan Nanayakkarasaid, “I would like to congratulate the management of the DFCC Bank and all those involved in this collective effort. Your achievement will make a positive difference in developing the objectives of the bank.”
