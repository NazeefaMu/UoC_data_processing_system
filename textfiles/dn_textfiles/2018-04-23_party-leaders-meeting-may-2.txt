A Party Leaders’ meeting will be held on May 2 to discuss arrangements for the inaugural ceremony of Parliament scheduled to be held on May 8 and the Parliamentary business thereafter, Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake said.
Dasanayake added that it will be an informal meeting of the Party Leaders convened by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as the Parliamentary Business Committee stands dissolved following prorogation of Parliament.
He said that Parliament has been unofficially told that the inaugural sitting of second session of Parliament would commence at 2.15pm on May 8, adding that the relevant Gazette is expected to be issued by the Presidential Secretariat tonight.
