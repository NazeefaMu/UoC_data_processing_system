No Sri Lankans stranded at US Airports: Foreign Ministry

 
The Foreign Ministry refuted reports that Sri Lankans are among those stranded at US airports due to Trump’s executive order on Friday (27).
‘Sri Lanka Missions in the US have informed us that there are no confirmed cases of Sri Lankans stranded at US airports’ the Foreign Affairs Ministry said, adding ‘All Sri Lanka Missions in the US are on alert and in touch with relevant US authorities on this matter.’
The Foreign Affairs Ministry requested any Sri Lankans stranded at a US airport and requiring assistance to call Sri Lanka's Mission in New York on 001 917 597 7009, adding that it was worth noting that Sri Lanka was not on the list of countries singled out by Trump.
President Donald Trump on Friday banned nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for at least the next 90 days.
These countries are - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. 
The executive order also bans entry of those fleeing from war-torn Syria indefinitely.
