University hostel facilities to be completed by next year: Kiriella

 
The hostel facilities of state universities will be completed next year, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The Minister said that after providing hostel facilities the Government will pay attention to improve other facilities in universities including common rooms, libraries, canteens and toilets.
The Minister said the Higher Education Ministry will work in collaboration with the Health Ministry to come up with a plan to avoid a shortage of House Officers in hospitals as a result of disruption to academic activities in medical faculties.
Responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament today, the Minister said that a total of 583 students have been suspended from classes within two years from May 30, 2013 to May 30, 2015 as disciplinary measures. 
Court actions were taken against 37 students and two students who were expelled from universities within the said period.
