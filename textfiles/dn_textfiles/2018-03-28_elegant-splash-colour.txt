An elegant splash of Colour

If you are tired of all-white traditional wedding dresses - dip it in some dye or airbrush it. We are not joking!
This dip dye wedding dress trend not only gives your formal dress a colorful touch, it also solves one major problem that many brides face. Anyone who has attended a wedding probably saw how dirty the gowns sometimes get from touching the ground. So there’s a very practical reason to colour the edges.
You can find plenty of DIY tutorials on how to colour your dress, however if that sounds too complicated, you can always order one to get dyed.
