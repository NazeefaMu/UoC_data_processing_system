Two brilliant tries scored by Wesley College winger Kavinda Perera enabled them to pull off a close 23 points (3 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) to 15 (1 penalty try, 1 try, 1 penalty) win over Dharmaraja College in their Singer ‘A’ division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at CR & FC grounds, Longden Place yesterday. At lemons Wesley led 18-10.
It was really pleasing to see Wesley not forgetting their former old boys who have done yeoman service to college rugby inviting one of their legends to be the guest of honour at yesterday’s match - Ransiri Sahabandu, a former Wesley, Sri Lanka Schools, CR & FC flanker cum Wesley’s and CR ‘Bees’ rugby head coach.
For the winning Wesley side the three tries were scored by winger cum hero Kavindana Perera (two) and prop forward Sheshan Jayawardena (one) with Murshid Doray slotting in one conversion and the two penalties.
