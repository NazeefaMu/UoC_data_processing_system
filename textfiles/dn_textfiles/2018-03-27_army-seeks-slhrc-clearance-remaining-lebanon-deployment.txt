Army seeks SLHRC clearance on remaining Lebanon deployment

The Sri Lanka Army in compliance with the new procedures of UN Peace Keeping Operations has already sought clearance from the Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) in order to dispatch the remaining contingent for deployment in Lebanon, a released issued by the Sri Lanka Army said.
“The UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) has insisted that Sri Lanka should seek feasible clearance for such UN deployments directly from the Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission by vetting respective overseas bound UN candidates before their departure. As a result of this change of procedures, the Army was compelled to refer the remaining batch of 101 Army personnel for necessary screening as advised by the UN DPKO,” the statement said.
The full statement: “Sri Lanka as one of the Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) to the United Nations has been in the practice of sending her troops for UN Peace Keeping assignments since 2004 in large groups after the country became qualified to do so.
"At present, Sri Lankan troops,the majority being from the Sri Lanka Army have been deployed in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as military observers, staff officers, staff officer assistants or general contingent troops.
"As planned, one more contingent of 150 soldiers of the Army, earmarked for deployment were set to leave for Lebanon in batches as replacements, beginning February this year. Accordingly, the first batch of 49 troops left Sri Lanka for Lebanon on 18th and 19th February.
"However, the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) has insisted that Sri Lanka should seek feasible clearance for such UN deployments directly from the Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) by vetting respective overseas bound UN candidates before their departure.
As a result of this change of procedures, the Army was compelled to refer the remaining batch of 101 Army personnel for necessary screening as advised by the UN DPKO.
"In view of those new UN procedures, the Army has already sought clearance from the Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission in order to dispatch the remaining contingent for deployment in Lebanon.”
