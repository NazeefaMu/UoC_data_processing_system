The ‘Siwdewigama’ is the 49th model village constructed under the ‘Reawakening Villages,” Housing Scheme the Minister said.
"The new project is equipped with 39 houses, pure drinking water, electricity, and roadways. It cost the Ministry 373 lakhs. A community hall was also constructed and 337 additional families are listed to get the benefits," the Minister said.

“When the war ended, I brought up proposals to construct halls for the Sunday schools and provide two acres of paddy fields to every shrine. But they turned it all down and now speak of patriotism,” he said.
“The people appointed us to develop the country and we have a great burden on our shoulders to complete that task. We have to work honestly. “Even though many obstacles come in my way, I am doing my best to protect the trust that the public have in my ministry,” the Minister said.
