Dialog launches iPhone X

Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider with network to support 4G VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) for Apple iPhones, Dialog Axiata PLC, announced the launch of the all new
iPhone X on December 8, at the Dialog Iconic where a lucky fan won a free iPhone X and others received an array of freebies.
Authorised reseller and partner network for Apple, Dialog, grants unparalleled after sales services with warranties to users, island wide.
Housed in a sleek and stunning all glass design, the toughest glass ever used on a smartphone to date, the all-new 5.8-inch super retina display ensures the iPhone X delivers the world’s first biometric identification mechanism, where users can unlock the device, authenticate and make payments via a radical Face ID recognition, enabled by the all new TrueDepth camera.
The Face ID projects more than 30,000 invisible IR (Infra-Red) dots. The IR image and dot pattern is pushed through neural networks to create a mathematical model of the users face and sends the data to a secure enclaveto confirm the match, while adapting to physical changes in appearance over time.
The iPhone X is powered by the new A11 Bionic chip, designed for the ultimate experience in augmented reality and is the most powerful chip ever used in a smartphone, featuring a six-core CPU (Central Processor Unit) that is 25 percent faster than its predecessor.  The iPhone X offers 70 percent greater performance for multi-threaded workloads, giving users greater performance with longer lasting battery life.
The all-new dual 12 mega megapixel rear camera in the iPhone X is equipped with dual optical image stabilization and is customized for theultimate AR experience as each camera is individuallycalibrated.
