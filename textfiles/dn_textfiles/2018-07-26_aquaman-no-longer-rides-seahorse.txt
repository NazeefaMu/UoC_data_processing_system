Aquaman no longer rides a seahorse

The upcoming ‘Aquaman’ movie is still doing PR for the king of Atlantis, which means now seahorses are forbidden. They must become sea dragons.
Entertainment Weekly has a first look at concept art of Arthur’s mount of choice in the movie, a big upgrade his previously trusted steed Storm the Seahorse. Because seahorses aren’t for big, beefy men like Arthur Curry, who swims around shirtless and stabs things with tridents in the manliest of fashions. No; such men, they get giant, hulking, sea dragons!
According to Aquaman producer Peter Safran, “The idea was to turn on its head the idea of Aquaman riding a seahorse, take something for which he was mocked and turn it into something terrifying and impressive,. He’s a Xebellian creature but I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw Arthur (Jason Momoa) on one at some point…”
‘Aquaman’ will be releasing on December 21.
