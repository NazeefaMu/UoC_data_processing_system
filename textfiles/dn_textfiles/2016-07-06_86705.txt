Heated argument at COPE meeting over AG’s report

The differences of opinions on the Auditor General’s report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance led to a heated argument at the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting yesterday at the Parliamentary Complex.
The COPE met at 2.30 pm  at a Committee Room to discuss the AG’s report that was handed over last Wednesday. A stormy meeting ensued as UNP MPs representing the COPE argued in favour of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran while other members debated against him.
UNP MP M.Velukumar reportedly resigned from the COPE. However, COPE sources said that the resignation was a move to appoint UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe to the membership. MP Velu Kumar was not present yesterday but had informed of his willingness to resign.
The UNP members in the COPE had argued that Mahendran was not responsible for the alleged loss of the Treasury Bonds sale. They were of opinion that Mahendran was only implementing a policy decision of the government.
The JVP MPs countering this argument demanded to know from which office that policy decision had been made. They also pointed out that such a policy decision should be approved by the Monetary Board and there was no such approval.
Thereafter the UNP members in the COPE stated that they could not accept the AG’s report, adding that it should be referred to independent experts for their opinion. They said that independent economic experts should be summoned to the COPE and they be given ample time to express their opinion on the AG’s report.
The JVP MPs had protested and responded that if the UNP MPs needed expert opinion they could wait till July 7 as the COPE is to meet the CB Governor and the Monetary Board Officials on Thursday. The JVP MPs had pointed out to the UNP members that COPE could seek the expert opinion from them. The JVP MPs accused the UNP COPE members of deliberately attempting to delay the COPE investigations.
The COPE meeting presided by its Chairman Sunil Handunnetti was attended by members Dayasiri Jayasekera, Ravindra Samaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Harsha de Silva, Ajith P Perera, Ranjan Ramanayake, Ashoka Abeysinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Lakshman Seneviratne, Bimal Ratnayake, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Chandrasiri Gajadheera, Hector Appuhamy, Dr.Nalinda Jayatissa and Harshana Rajakaruna.
The UNP MPs had also attended a meeting held by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the previous day on the same issue.
