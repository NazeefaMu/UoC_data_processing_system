Four Rajarata University Faculties to remain closed

Four Faculties of Rajarata University, which were previously closed due to the spread of chickenpox, are to remain closed due to lack of drinking water, University sources said.
The faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities, Management Studies, Applied Sciences and Technology, which are located in the Mihintale premises, have been closed until further notice.
However, the examinations in those Faculties, which are due to commence from Monday will be held as scheduled.
The University authorities had held a discussion with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board on providing drinking water to students sitting for the exams.
The four Faculties, which were closed on August 8, were to reopene from this week, but the lack of water has forced the university authorities to extend the closure.
The Faculties of Agriculture, Medicine and Allied Sciences,situated in Puliyankulama and Saliyapura, have not been closed.
