Skating on thin ice

Franchaises have a nostalgic quality about them. The ‘Ice age’ series is evergreen. Manny, Sid and Diego have been on our favourite list ever since animations made their way to the screen and became the fad.
The movie starts on a promising note with Manny, the woolly mammoth showing the classic symptoms of being in a long-term relationship by forgetting his wedding anniversary. Trouble arises when we discover that his wife, Ellie, has not forgotten it. However these issues are just butter on the toast since a lot of gags – many which miss the shot – are aimed at the viewers. Manny also has trouble reconciling with the idea that his daughter Peaches could potentially leave the family for boyfriend Julian.
Director Mike Thurmeier seem to have run out of ideas because he has failed to capture the uniqueness that all the previous ‘Ice Age’ movies boasted of. This is a tried-and-tested formula which seem to be brought out again and again with each animation which hits the big screen.
Co-directors Thurmeier and Chu rely too heavily on slapstick shenanigans to keep the proceedings clipping along. Despite their combined efforts, the film never achieves the sense of fun or genuine excitement that marked some of the earlier editions.
Impending doom
Scratwith his acorn
Like always there’s an impending doom on planet Earth thanks to the misadventures of Scrat, the saber toothed squirrel. The hurtling asteroid, of course, is his handiwork as he continues his epic struggle with his beloved acorn, redefin ‘all-consuming obsession’. Somehow, in the process, he manages to kickstart a series of disastrous spatial events that threaten earth’s existence.
Scrat’s the first person on the moon, Scrat is the reason Mars is devoid of life, Scrat gave Saturn its rings… Scrat is everywhere but where he should really be. The character has generally excelled as an enjoyable distraction in previous ‘Ice Age’ films and continues to be so in ‘Collision Course’.
While these new characters add freshness to the plot, even their designs aren’t anything new. Shangri Llama looks like a slavish copy of the Yoga guru Llama from Zootopia, that release earlier this year. The Dromaesours family consisting of an evil Dad and his reluctantly grey shaded son and daughter is straight out of Hollywood family movie stereotypes book. The standard love interest role that was portrayed by Jennifer Lopez’s Shira in the last movie has now been conceded to Brooke the Sloth.
Funny scenes
‘Collision Course’ has its share of funny scenes. For example Sid, in the clutches of love, says, “I’m getting butterflies”, and Manny reacts with a “I’m getting nauseous.” All of Scrat’s antics are enjoyable. Buck is a riot too, especially as Neil Debuck Weasel, the astronomer inside Buck’s head who helps save the world.
The filmmakers seem to depend far too heavily on the affability of the A-list voice cast, which includes John Leguizamo as the lovelorn sloth, Queen Latifah as the mammoth’s missus, and Jennifer Lopez in the role of the middle-aged white tigress.
The ‘Ice Age’ movie franchise is 14 years old. ‘Collision Course’ is the fifth installment. Sadly the formula is getting old and the imagination of the makers looks a bit jaded too. The ideas behind the movies has gotten old and monotonous. Sadly the makers behind this franchise is content with reworking the same old. So before we get a sixth installment it is best to bid the endangered species adieu.
‘Ice Age: Collision Course’ is screening at Majestic Cineplex, Liberty Lite cinema and Savoy cinema, Wellawaththa.
