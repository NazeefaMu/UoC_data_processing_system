Douglas asks why NPC allocations underutilised

UPFA MP Douglas Devananda yesterday asked as to why the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) had failed to fully utilise the financial allocations made to it by the Central Government. The MP was raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Prime Minister would reply to the question at a future date.
MP Devananda observed that a greater share of the annual allocations made to the NPC in 2014 and 2015 had not been used and the money was directed back to the Treasury.
"Until the NPC was established in 2013, development activities were carried out in an expeditiously as the central government provisioned funds for them. Since the NPC was established as per the franchise of the people, it had failed to deliver to its people. Those in the NPC demanded to remove the Northern Province Governor and the Chief Secretary stating they cannot coordinate with them.
This request was fulfilled by the new Government and almost 10 months had lapsed since then. Now it is clear that this happens because of the inefficiency of the NPC. Other than corruption and fraud, recruitment outside the stipulated procedure and passing useless motions, the NPC does not do any work that benefits the people" he said.
