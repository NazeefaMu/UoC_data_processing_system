President Sirisena’s constitutional remedy
The Constitution of Sri Lanka is titled Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Most political leaders acted meek with regard to the constitutional democracy in favour of their own gains. Democracy was confined to its mere verbal status until President Maithripala Sirisena took up the cudgels to offer a brave interpretation to the sanctified script in the country’s legislature.
What we face today is not a political crisis. It is the real activation of democracy by the Head of State we voted to office three years ago. He stands aloof irrespective of party politics in favour of the wishes of the people. It is also the wish of the international community to see the country has a Democratic government. The international community must read between the constitutional lines before pointing the accusing finger at the newly formed government. Let us hope and pray sanity will prevail over personal gains, for the prosperity and peace of this Island.
