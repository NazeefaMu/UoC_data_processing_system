We are just brothers! - Brady

It was a strange offseason for the cannon-armed, football-playing cyborg known as Tom Brady.
In addition to dealing with the Deflategate scandal, Brady found his personal life all over the tabloids for a number of bizarre reasons.
Several media outlets are still clinging to the story that Brady and Gisele Bundchen are headed for divorce, despite the fact that she's been publicly supporting her superhuman husband's quest for another ring, just as she always does.
Of course, the weird, non-football-related Brady stories don't end there. After Brady's four-game suspension was overturned in court prior to the start of the season, he found himself with an unexpected supporter. Presidential candidate/human throbbing forehead vein Donald Trump congratulated Brady and sent the QB one of his signature "Make America Great Again" hats that look not unlike something that Ashton Kutcher would've worn during his Punk'd days.
Brady proudly displayed the hat in his locker, and when asked if he supported Trump, he muttered some non-committal nonsense about the Donald putting a putting green on the White House lawn.
Tom probably figured it was a clever way of dodging the question, but the press ran with it and claimed that Brady is full-on Trump supporter. Brady took the opportunity to dial those comments back during a radio interview on Monday:
"Even an off-handed comment like that, like you said, that people may run with; and I understand why people do run with it because you get the clicks and that type of stuff," Brady said. "It's just people doing their job. I try to have fun with certain things.
I mean, look, I've known him for a long time. He's been a fun guy that I've had a lot of time around. One way or another, it's so far away from when the election will be.
"Whatever I vote is going to be my own personal choice based on how I feel. I don't even know what the issues are. I haven't paid attention to politics in a long time. It's actually not something that I really even enjoy. It's way off my radar." Normally, we'd make fun of a grown adult with a lot at stake who claims he doesn't "enjoy" politics and "doesn't even know what the issues are," but Tom's got an awful lot on his plate these days.
