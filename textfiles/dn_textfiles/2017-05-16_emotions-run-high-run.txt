Emotions run high on the run

While the Global Champion of the Wings for Life World Run 2017 Aron Anderson from Sweden made history at the Wings for Life World Run on May 7, Sri Lanka’s K. P. Nuwan Suganda Karunatilleka with a distance of 26.5km won Sri Lanka’s Wings for Life World Run APP RUN - Colombo.
Every one of the 399 registered participants from Sri Lanka joined the 155,288 participants from 111 locations and were part of the global-record setting effort to raise funds for spinal cord research. In total, the Wings for Life World Run 2017 covered a total of 1,431,183km.
Whether it was daytime (Europe) or night (Asia and Australia), sunny (United Arab Emirates) or rainy (Sri Lanka), spirits were high right from the start at 11am UTC (4.30pm local time), as runners of all levels were on the road in the movement to find a cure for spinal cord injury. All of Sri Lanka’s 399 runners endorsed by Lahiru Thirimanna, Sudharshan Muthutanthri, Niroshan Dickwella, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Hasitha Perera and Randhir Witana led the pack from the start line at Independence Square at 4.30pm. The atmosphere at the Independence Square Memorial Ground was electric with a festival like atmosphere from food stalls, entertainment from some of Sri Lanka’s most renowned singers and a screening of the Wings for Life World Run. Sri Lanka was proud to raise a total of Rs. 640,000 from the day for spinal cord injury research.
