Minister Senanayake denies allegations

Tourism and Wildlife Minister Wasantha Senanayake yesterday in a statement denied the allegation that he has traded his MP post.
In the statement, Senanayake has observed that the allegations circulating in social media against him are completely baseless. Minister Senanayake said in his statement that he will not allow any injustice to the people of Polonnaruwa who voted for him. He also observes that he is still the leader of UNP supporters in his electorate.
Minister Senanayake states that he decided to support President Maithripala Sirisena considering the change that took place in the country and the changes necessary for the country. He said that he never traded his MP post for money.
Minister Senanayake said the UNP leaders failed to serve the people and the country. Senanayake expressed his confidence that he would be able to serve the country and its people with the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and the leadership of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
