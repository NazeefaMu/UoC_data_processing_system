Help brain tumour patient

Mrs. W. M. C. Wickramasinghe of Kotikawatte, Angoda, a 54-year-old mother of two, is suffering from a brain tumour.
Dr. Deepal Attanayake, Consultant Neurosurgeon of the National Hospital has recommended surgery. Since there is a waiting list at the National Hospital, it has been decided to perform the surgery at the Lanka Hospitals, at a cost of Rs. two million.
Public assistance is sought to raise the funds. Donations can be credited to A/C No. 194200253815460 of People's Bank, Kolonnawa. For further inquiries call 0711958101.
