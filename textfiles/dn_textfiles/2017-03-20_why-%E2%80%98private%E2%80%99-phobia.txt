WHY THIS ‘PRIVATE’ PHOBIA?

This is a continuation of my previous correspondence on the SAITM issue, which I published in the Daily News of July 15, 2016. In this article, I hope to convince the public of the glaring need for private Medical Colleges in this country to be worked out on a public-private partnership in this country.
This is the only country in the world that is against private medical colleges. I was the Professor at the first North Colombo Medical College, which was established 1981 by the College of General Practitioners, and continued till 1995, when it was taken over by the government and made into the Kelaniya Medical Faculty. Although the CGP built a beautiful three-storied building to house the professorial units, and built many buildings to house the pre-clinical and para-clinical departments and a large library, no compensation was given to the CGP by the government.
This is one of the 16 countries in the world that has free education from Grade one up to University. It is the taxpayers of this country who have to pay for free Education. Unfortunately, what is given free is never appreciated, and that is why we see so many strikes by the IUSF and protest marches in the country, as they don’t have to pay for their Education.
Throughout the world, universities admit purely on merit. In our time, we had to go for an interview before we were selected for the university. In our country, admission to the university is no more done on merit, but by a peculiar system known as Z Score, by which even the best students with 3 As don’t get admission to the Medical Faculties, and the parents have to send their children abroad to various medical colleges and universities approved by the SLMC. It is a well-known fact that many of the Doctors serving in the private and public sector, and universities have been sending their children abroad over many years, for higher qualifications in Medicine and various other fields. Many of them never return to Sri Lanka. Thus, according to Minister Kiriella, over Rs. 15 billion has been lost to the country every year due to the fact that we have no facilities in this country for private medical education.
Fortunately, IUSF doesn’t seem to make a fuss about the vast number of international schools in the country, and the private universities and establishments that are continuing to give degrees in various other fields such as Accountancy, Engineering, Law, IT etc. None of these professionals go on strikes or protest marches in this country like medicos.
There are about 26,000 doctors registered with the SLMC; about 20,000 in government service, and 15,000 – 16,000 of Government Doctors are members of the GMOA. The eight state medical faculties in Sri Lanka have an out put 1,200 doctors per year. And about another 300 Doctors who are Sri Lankan citizens qualified overseas enter the work force every year. So in all only around 1,500 doctors enter the work force every year.
Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million, and this goes up every year by over 300,000. The proportion of doctors to the population is around 1:1,000. In Britain, it is 1:20. So will we never be able to reach those figures even after couple of centuries at the rate we are going. The government is hoping to open up two faculties in Wayamba & Sabaragamuwa. Every year we will require 300 more doctors for the increase of population annually.
The specialist medical officers in curative (hospital) services 2016 is as follows:
Total cadre required: 3,078
Total in position: 1,634
Total vacancies: 1,447
How long will these vacancies take to be filled? The cadre will increase every year with the increase in population.
The WHO requests the government to reduce the doctor to patient ratio to 500. This means that we will require 40,000 doctors for a population of 20 million. Can the medical faculties in the country ever produce this number even for another 100 years? Thus, it is quite obvious to any sane person to realize that we require private medical institutions under the PPP Programme urgently in this country. We require at least 20 more faculties to produce this number. I cannot understand how intelligent Doctors in the GMOA cannot realize this. They too, are carrying on protest marches and strikes in various parts of the country, putting the poor patients in to so much inconvenience and trouble. In my opinion, all this is done with selfish motives. However, they do their private practice in the evening, attending to the rich.
In our times, 40 – 50 years ago, medical professions were highly respected. However, I feel ashamed when I hear of what it has come to. It is no longer a profession or vocation, but downright business. In the NCMC, we taught our students not only medicine, but to treat the patients with TLC(Tender, loving care). Unfortunately, I don’t think that this is ever taught in our state medical faculties. That is why the graduates who passed out from the NCMC are top consultants in this country and even abroad, because their approach to patients is quite different.
The GMOA and the medical students are protesting against the ruling given by the Court of Appeal. In my opinion, they should be charged for contempt of court. The SLMC has appealed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. We will have to wait and see what the outcome is.
