Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) will participate with the Sri Lankan pavilion in Apparel Sourcing, Paris.
Paris as one of the major fashion capitals of the world is the best place to promote and sell brands and collections in Europe, to the Western, and increasingly to the Eastern and Middle Eastern markets. The fair will help to understand the European market and how best to increase buyers to Sri Lanka.
EDB is providing subsidized stalls to increase the exports of menswear, womenswear, children and infant wear, intimate apparel, resort and swimwear, outerwear, casual wear, sportswear, workwear and uniform, active wear, fashion accessories, designer wear, brands and labels.
