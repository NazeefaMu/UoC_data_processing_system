‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign launched

Milo, the nourishing energy beverage brand, has been synonymous with school sports in Sri Lanka for over three decades.
In a mission to encourage children to embrace physical activity, Milo now takes another big leap by offering children the chance to win as many as 1000 mountain bikes through the ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign.
Milo Brand Ambassador and National Cricket Captain Angelo Mathews was a recipient of the ‘Milo Colours Award’ for two consecutive years.
These initiatives have played a significant role in instilling positive values such as discipline, leadership skills, nurturing a winning attitude and team spirit, helping children develop well-rounded personalities and moulding them into becoming leaders and exemplary citizens of tomorrow.
The launch of the ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign not only helps bring mothers together with their children, but inspires children to stay physically active and healthy throughout the day,” said Norman Kannangara, Asst. Vice President – Beverages of Nestlé Lanka PLC.
The ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign provides a unique opportunity to mothers who play a key role in providing the nutrition requirements and driving the physical development of their children to get involved by taking ‘selfies’ of themselves and their young ones with a Milo ready-to-drink pack.
Children between the ages of 8 – 16 years who meet the given criteria are eligible to participate in the contest up until November 25 and win their very own mountain bicycle via raffle draws conducted every week.
The first two weekly draws witnessed an impressive consumer response from which 500 lucky winners were selected.
