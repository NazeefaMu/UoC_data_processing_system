Undying love

Wedding venues can be a headache to find; the location, the size, cost, guest capacity just adds difficult dimensions to the labyrinth that is wedding planning.
Thinking outside the box might help tackle a few of your problems though.
Rebecca Walker and Graeme Boothroyd did exactly that, tying the knot in the chapel of Huddersfield Crematorium in West Yorkshire. Yes, that’s right, you can get married in the place where a dead person’s body is burned to ashes. And why not?
It’s the first wedding of its kind and isn’t just some cost-effective choice for Rebecca and Graeme, but has sentimental value; it’s where they first met.
Rebecca, an independent civil celebrant, and Graeme, who works as a technician for Kirklees Council’s Bereavement Services, felt it was an obvious choice after a chance first meeting at the crematorium.
The pair had met as part of their jobs in bereavement services, connecting over a broken coffee machine.
“I had to ask Graeme to come and sort it out and one thing led to another,’ explained Rebecca. He asked if I was with anyone and when I said “no” and he gave me his phone number – and I rang him before I even got home! I can’t believe it’s only 10 months that we have been together. We are like two peas in a pod. It’s a building that’s filled with love and you can feel that when people are going into it. It has everything you could want, beautiful grounds and excellent facilities. They had never heard of anyone doing that before. We didn’t want it to be a morbid occasion.” The pair invited 90 guests and made arrangements to be respectful to others using the space for more somber reasons and once the ceremony was over everything was returned to normal.
If that’s sparked a desire for you to book out your local crematorium, you could speak to your local council.
Paul Kemp, service director at Kirklees Council said, “Whilst the crematorium is usually a place where we mark the passing of life, we feel there is no reason, why, in the right circumstances, it shouldn’t be used for other ceremonies and we would consider future requests on a case-by-case basis.”
It’ll definitely be a wedding to remember. Metro
