The centenary year of the MUSTANGS

The MUSTANGS are a group of senior old boys from both colleges, Royal College and S. Thomas’ College, who meet once a year, in a private tent to watch and enjoy the game and share the camaraderie which prevails in the tent. Most of us have known each other from our respective school days and therefore naturally it has become a meeting place for old friends.
The MUSTANGS tent which celebrates its centenary this year was for a long time, the only private tent at the match. This changed in 1975, with the COLTS TENT being given the permission to have their private tent at the match.
We are very fortunate, that Mr. Fred Wirasekera, one of the six founder members of the MUSTANGS has written an article in the match souvenir in 1979. This article details of how four old Royalists and two old Thomians formed the tent.
Even at that time, the Royal-Thomian was a great social event and it extended to the families of the school boys as well as the old boys of the two colleges, and close friends of the old boys. Most of us have very close friends in the other schools when we befriended many through sports by playing against each other at school level and they too shared in the revelry of the big match
The Mustangs colours were chosen by Mr. Wirasekera and Wilmot Perera and remain the same - PINK, GREY and BLACK.
They even had a Mustang Tie specially made for them by the well-known company SULKA of Bond Street, where one of the founder members Mr. Wilmot Perera went to England for his honeymoon.
Successive Co-coordinators and subsequently Secretaries have done their best to continue the traditions of 100 years.
In the last 5 years the demand from old boys who reached the age of 50 to join the tent has grown tremendously. Therefore, we are now compelled to limit our membership.
The original name MUSTANGS were thought of by the founder members who were young, enthusiastic and eager to enjoy themselves at the match and the same spirit continues and will surely last another 100 years.
