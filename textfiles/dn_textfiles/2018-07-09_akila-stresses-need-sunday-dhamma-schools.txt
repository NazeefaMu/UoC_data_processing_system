Akila stresses need for Sunday Dhamma schools

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has sent a circular to all school heads countrywide that they have to take positive and meaningful steps to encourage students towards Dhamma education.
The Minister emphasised the need for every school student to have religious education to live a life of integrity.
Accordingly, all school students have to be directed to Sunday Dhamma schools according to their respective faiths and school teachers too have to inculcate human values in the minds of students, while teaching, to shape students’ attitudes to avoid negative feelings such as anger, revenge and unwarranted competitiveness to achieve educational goals, the circular says.
