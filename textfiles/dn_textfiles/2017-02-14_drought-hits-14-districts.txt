Drought hits 14 districts

Around 490,00 persons from 14 districts are facing a scarcity of drinking water due to the prolonged drought, the Disaster Management Ministry said yesterday.
“Relief teams have been dispatched to worst hit districts such as Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Gampaha, Hambantota, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Moneragala, Mullaitivu, Puttalam, Ratnapura, Trincomalee, Kandy and Vavuniya,” a spokesman for the ministry said.
According to the ministry, 4798 water storage tanks and 349 water bowsers and tractors have been sent to the affected areas.
They are acquiring more water bowsers and storage tanks to be deployed in the affected areas. The ministry said if rains do not arrive soon, the country will face a severe drought situation in the coming months.
The ministry said the drought situation was worsening and adverse effects of the extended dry spell were continuing to aggravate. Reports of drinking water shortage, crop damages and wild fires from several areas of the country are being reported.
The ministry said preparations were being made to face the severe drought situation with the participation of all related institutions. Attention has been drawn to dwindling water levels in the reservoirs, the ministry said.
