Disciplinary action against DIG Nalaka after completion of probe - Rajitha

Disciplinary action against DIG Nalaka de Silva will be taken following the completion of the preliminary investigation process, Cabinet Spokesperson and Health and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, the Minister said Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara had handed over the investigations to the CID and that DIG Silva was temporarily transferred.
Last week in Kandy, Namal Kumara of the Dushana Virodi Balakaya revealed details of a plot stating that the DIG of the Terrorist Investigation Division Nalaka Silva had notified him of a conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa through underworld criminal Makadure Madush who is currently evading arrest.
Investigations regarding this revelation was initially handed over to Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) but was later handed over to the CID by IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
Responding to questions raised by journalists on why no action has been taken against DIG Silva, Minister Senaratne said nothing can be done before the investigation is concluded.
“The allegations levelled against him are very serious. The government does not interfere in any process. It is the duty of the CID to find the truth,” the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said that before the truth is revealed, DIG Nalaka cannot be interdicted or arrested.
