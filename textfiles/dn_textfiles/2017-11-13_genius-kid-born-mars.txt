Genius kid 'born on Mars'

A 'genius' Russian boy believes he had a previous life on Mars and his parents believe him.
The curious case of Boriska Kipriyanovich, now aged 20, continues to startle experts. He first came to the mainstream attention of conspiracy theorists and New Age believers in 2008 when he was the subject of the documentary 'Boriska: Indigo Boy from Mars'.
From an early age, he began telling experts about his previous life on Mars. Boris believes he lived among an alien civilisation that was ravaged by war and then a nuclear catastrophe.
The martians were seven feet tall and breathed carbon dioxide, he said.
He claims he was a martian pilot and travelled to earth where he was 'reborn' in 1996.
The human race has much more knowledge to unlock, and the Great Sphinx in Egypt holds the key, he says.
"The human life will change when the Sphinx is opened, it has an opening mechanism somewhere behind the ear; I do not remember exactly," claims Boriska. The outlandish claims have sparked endless discussion on conspiracy theory websites.
Boriska is said to have displayed much higher than average intelligence from young age and was reading, writing and speaking by just 18 months.
He first became famous in Russia after holding adults spellbound with his tales of his former life on Mars during a camping trip aged seven.
