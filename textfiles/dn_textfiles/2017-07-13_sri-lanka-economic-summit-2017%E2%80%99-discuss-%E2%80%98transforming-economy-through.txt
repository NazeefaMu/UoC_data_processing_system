Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017’ to discuss ‘Transforming the Economy through Technology’

The Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will conduct a dedicated thematic session to discuss how Sri Lanka can transform its economy through the adoption of technology.
The session titled ‘Transforming the Economy through Technology,’ will line up the likes of Prof. Rohan Samarjiva, founding Chair of LIRNEasia, Kamal Quadir, Chief Executive Officer of Bkash Limited, Prof. Ajith De Alwis, Project Director of Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation, Gehan Dias, General Manager, of MillenniumIT, Samantha Ranatunga, Managing Director of CIC Holdings PLC and Linda Speldewinde, Founder of the Academy Of Design.
Dumindra Ratnayake, Chairman of Martin & George (Pvt) Limited will moderate the session.
The speakers will focus on the areas of technological advances Sri Lankan manufacturers should adopt to transform the sector and ignite fresh competitiveness, how digital technologies can help transform the local agriculture sector, how to improve the national innovation ecosystem to support the transformation and the lessons Sri Lanka can draw from international experiences.
The all-important session was drafted into this year’s summit taking into consideration the fact that many of Sri Lanka’s key sectors are lagging behind its global competitors due to a lack of technological advancement and risk getting left behind in a dynamic and competitive global economy.
The two-day annual summit will take place on July 25 and 26 at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo, under the title of ‘Execute – Transform - Realize’.
