Sri Lanka’s No.1 T20I ranking on the line

 
Preparations for next year’s ICC World Twenty20 India 2016 continue as reigning champion Sri Lanka goes head to head with former winner West Indies in a two-match series in Pallekele today.
The India event will take place from 11 March to 3 April and Sri Lanka will defend the title it won after defeating India by six wickets in the final in Mirpur last year. The West Indies had lifted the silverware in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in October 2012 when it beat the home side by six wickets.
As many as 12 T20I matches will be played this month and the action will begin on Monday with Sri Lanka’s number-one position on the ICC T20I Team Rankings on the line when it takes on third-ranked West Indies.
Sri Lanka leads the West Indies by eight points but if the West Indies wins both the matches, then both sides will swap places. In this scenario, the West Indies will rise to 123 points, two points ahead of second-ranked Pakistan, while Sri Lanka will slip to 118 points, three points behind Pakistan and one ahead of fourth-ranked Australia.
If the series is tied at one-all, Sri Lanka will retain its top spot but the West Indies will join Australia on 118 points and because it will be ahead of Australia when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point, the West Indies will be ranked third.
In contrast, Sri Lanka will extend its advantage over Pakistan to 10 points and the West Indies will drop to fifth on 113 points if the home side wins both the matches.
The second T20I between Sri Lanka and West Indies will be played at the R Premadasa Stadium on November 12. ICC
