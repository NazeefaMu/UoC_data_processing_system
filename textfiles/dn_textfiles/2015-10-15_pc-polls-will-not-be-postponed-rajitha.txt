PC polls will not be postponed - Rajitha

The Provincial Council elections will not be postponed. It will most probably be held in March 2016, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senarathna yesterday.
The minister said there are still some issues to be solved in connection with delimitation as the demarcation of divisions had been decided by the previous government for their benefit.
Dr. Senarathna was speaking at the Cabinet briefing at the Information Department. He said as soon as these issues are solved, the election will most probably be held in May.
Dr. Senarathna said the Provincial Council elections is decided to be held under the first past the post system. He said this is a mixed system with the proportionate system.
He added that according to the mixed system, 70 percent will be held under the first past the post system and the rest under the proportionate system.
