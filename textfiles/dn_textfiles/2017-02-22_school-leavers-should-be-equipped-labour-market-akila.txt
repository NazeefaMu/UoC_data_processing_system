School leavers should be equipped for labour market: Akila

The greatest social responsibility Sri Lanka has in education is to ensure that school leavers are equipped to join the labour market and to decide on appropriate further studies, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The Minister was delivering the keynote speech at the World CSR Day held from 17-18 February in Mumbai.
Over 1000 professionals from 130 countries congregated with the objective of providing a platform to the corporate, government, civil society and academia to share their expectations, aspirations and responsibilities.
In his address, the Minister emphasised the importance of education in supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs). "Sri Lanka has initiated educational reforms that would have a far reaching impact on achieving SDGs in the country. The Government emphasised on skills development and vocational education. These policies would ensure that students in secondary schools receive education in the streams of their choice. A new stream in vocational studies is also being introduced. With the skills and work attitudes the youth receive, they will join the market place with confidence, and the school dropout rate will drop to a near zero. This is one of the great social responsibilities in education in Sri Lanka, Minister Akila said.
Representatives of a number of Sri Lankan institutes and companies including Women in Management, Dialog Axiata PLC, and Hemas Pharmaceutical (Pvt) Limited received awards.
