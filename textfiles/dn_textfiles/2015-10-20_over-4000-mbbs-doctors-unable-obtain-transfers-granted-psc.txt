Over 4,000 MBBS doctors unable to obtain transfers granted by PSC

Over 4,000 MBBS doctors are stuck in their work places without being able to obtain the transfers granted to them by the Public Service Commission (PSC). The Hospital Directors are ignoring the order given by the Commission, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr.Nalinda Herath said.
Addressing media in Colombo yesterday,Dr. Herath said that a doctor who is acting as the Public Relations Coordinator to the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister is purposely preventing the GMOA from meeting Minister Senaratne. "Therefore, the GMOA will inform the Public Service Commission about the Health Ministry officials who ignore the orders given by the commission," he said.
According to Dr. Hearth, state hospitals located at rural and difficult areas do not get qualified doctors due to this situation. The Health Ministry officials are trying to use the issue in order to transfer doctors according to their wishes without implementing the proper and accepted transfer system.
Meanwhile, during a recent ceremony held at Maradana, Suduwella Minister Senaratne had stated that the reason for closing down some rural hospitals is stopping the recruitment of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) and Assistant Medical Practitioners (AMP). Around 12 rural hospitals in the Kandy District had been closed down due to lack of doctors. Minister Senaratne had also stated that there is a shortage of doctors in Sri Lanka and it will exist at least for another eight years. The medical students who are now in Medical faculties will not be able to meet the country's demand for doctors. It is wrong if recruiting RMPs and AMPs stopped giving into the demands of trade unions because the demand for doctors' service exist in the country cannot be met without RMPs and AMPs.
