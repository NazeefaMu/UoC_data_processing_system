Tribute: Elaine Fernando : A sister par excellence

“A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread to the meaning of life.” This quote wonderfully describes what my eldest sister Elaine meant to me, when my darling Mummy entered Eternal Glory to be with her Maker.
My sister Elaine was the eldest of the family with three younger sisters and two younger brothers. She was always a loving and caring sister to whom we always looked up to.
I was her youngest brother and being 14 years younger to her, most naturally, I enjoyed a special love where much of her loving attention was showered on me. It developed in to an affectionate and strong bond between the two of us.
When my Mother was stricken with cancer and bedridden for nearly three years, she nursed her along with my other three sisters.
My part was to massage her legs and arms when I returned home after school.
My mother’s death made a vast impact on my father's curriculum of work as Magister Magistorum and a legend of Royal College Colombo. My sister Elaine stepped in and quite rightly provided my father with the comfort and solace needed both at school and at home.
Elaine was educated at Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa. She studied up to the Senior Cambridge and participated in the school's activities. She married Christopher Fernando, who was teaching in a school at Tangalle. He too hailed from Moratuwa and finally came to live with us when he got an appointment to teach at S.Thomas’ College Mt. Lavinia.
Elakka lives with her son and daughter-in-law, while her daughter lives in Canada. She is blessed with five grand children and eight great-grand children.
Elakka, my eldest sister has touched the lives of many relatives and friends whenever her services were needed because of her altruistic attitude in life. She gave her compassion and kindness to each and everyone who moved with her and her inspiration and courage at every moment of their lives.
It is said that there is no better friend than a sister and she is a friend to me whose memories I will always cherish in my heart.
Elakka continues to focus on Jesus Christ at all times.
Lylie.
