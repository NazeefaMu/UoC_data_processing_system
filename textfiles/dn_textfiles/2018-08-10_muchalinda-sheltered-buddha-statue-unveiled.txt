Muchalinda-sheltered Buddha statue unveiled

A Muchalinda-sheltered Buddha statue was inaugurated at the Dammavijaya Temple in Kavantissapura, Kataragama, on August 6.
The 56-foot-tall Buddha statue constructed under a concept of Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera, was opened at 3.55 am. The Budha statue is flanked by two statues of the Kataragama and Saman deities. A group of Singaporean Buddhists had allocated funds for the construction of the statues.
A plaque was unveiled by Aluthkuru Hapitigam Korale Pradana Sanganayake and Varana Raja Maha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Sri Punnananda Thera.
A pirith ceremony was held the night before the opening and 1,000 robes were offered to the Buddha statue on the day of the opening, which was followed by an alms-giving for 500 bhikkhus.
