Blue Mountain wins big at Asia Pacific Property Awards 2017

The Blue Mountain Group's most iconic real estate development to date, Achilleion, was recently recognized as one of the top three apartments in the Asia Pacific region, at the Asia Pacific Property Awards 2017, which took place in Bangkok, Thailand, recently.
Achilleion received a record number of eight awards including two five-star awards and emerged as the only Sri Lankan real estate development to be honoured at the event.
This recognition will now enable Blue Mountain's Achilleion to compete against global real estate titans for the title of ‘Best Apartment in the World’ at the ‘World Property Awards 2017’ in November later this year.
Dr. Hiran Hettiarachchi, Blue Mountain Group Chairman, received the awards on behalf of the entire Blue Mountain team, at an exclusive awards ceremony and gala event that were attended by the region's top real estate professionals and developers.
Sri Lanka's Achilleion shared the limelight with other top developments, the Bulgari Hotel and Residences in Shanghai, and HBS Towers in Mumbai.
Achilleion also won two five-star awards in the ‘Best Apartment’ and ‘Development Marketing’ categories.
The property also emerged as an award winner in the ‘Residential High-Rise Development’, ‘Interior Design Apartment’, ‘Developer Website’, ‘Development Marketing’ and ‘Best Apartment’ categories.
Dr. Hettiarachchi said: “I am truly honoured that Achilleion was ranked among the top three apartments in the entire region and I was pleased that our company was able to bring glory to Sri Lanka and showcase the strength and quality of our growing real estate industry.
Having secured so many wins at the regional award show, I am looking forward to our team vying for the ‘Best Apartment in the World’ award later this year being considered for this prestigious global accolade, is a significant accomplishment in itself for our entire team.”
Heralded as one of the largest projects of its kind in the residential real-estate space in Sri Lanka, Achilleion is a landmark venture for the Blue Mountain Group, which will bring seven-star luxury to the city of Colombo. To deliver a world-class project that has a strong local flair and character, Blue Mountain has partnered with the renowned Singapore-based Palmer and Turner Group, Sri Lankan architect Surath Wickramasinghe and interior design firm from Singapore, Index.
