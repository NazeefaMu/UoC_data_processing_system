A ‘grown up’ Wonder Woman in ‘Justice League’

Actor Gal Gadot said her Wonder Woman has “grown up” and the change in her character will be visible in the upcoming film ‘Justice League’. The 32-year-old star, who played the titular role in the superhero movie ‘Wonder Woman’, said her part is now more prepared to take on the enemy.
“She’s grown up. It’s been a century, after all! She’ll bring her specific qualities to a dynamic group and she understands the enemy better than anyone else,” said Gadot.
Apart from Wonder Woman, the DC film will see characters such as Batman (Ben Affleck), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller), as well as the rumoured revival of Superman (Henry Cavill). ‘Justice League’ hits the US theatres on November 17.
