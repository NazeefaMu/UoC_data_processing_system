According to Dr.Aluthge, in the letter the GMOA pointed out that although the Presidential Committee promised to provide all solutions and end the issue by December 31, the committee met for the last time on November 20 and there is not date fixed for the next meeting. The committee should meet immediately.
“In the letter the GMOA informed the President that it will not take part in the committee (at least as observers) if the committee does not respond to the observations and proposals of the GMOA,” he added.
