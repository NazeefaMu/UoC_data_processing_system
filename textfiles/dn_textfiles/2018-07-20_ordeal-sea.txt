Ordeal at sea

After a two-week ordeal, the seven Sri Lankan fishermen stranded for days at sea, off the Maldivian coast, returned to the country last Tuesday (July 17).
The 41-foot fishing boat Sindhur-2 left the Galle Fisheries Harbour with the seven, on June 14. Susil, Samantha, Rohana, Asela, Dhaminda, Kalindu and Janith took with them food supplies for a month, hoping to return to the country safe and sound, not in the least expecting the trouble that would befall them.
The only hope that fishermen have when they leave the shore is that if they are stranded at sea, the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) would track their location and assist the authorities to rescue them. VMS is a satellite-based monitoring system which at regular intervals provides data to the fisheries authorities on the location, course and speed of vessels.
Until June 29, the fishermen continued to have contact with their fellow fishermen who were also at sea, and others in the country. However, on June 30, they realised that the VMS had stopped working and that they were stranded.
Technical failure
Susil Praneetha, one of the fishermen, said that when they realised that the VMS had faltered, they panicked thinking they were not going to get out alive.
In the meantime, Kalindu Chandana (26) said the battery had failed, and as a result, the VMS stopped working. “We know the basics of repairing the VMS, but this fault was beyond our knowledge. We tried everything possible to make it work, but we could not,” he said.
Susil Praneetha said that when they found that the VMS had stopped functioning, they were already far away from Sri Lankan shores. He further said that the relevant company had shut down the VMS services, and by the time they realised it, they were in the high seas, off the Maldives.
“When the technology failed, we resorted to traditional methods to signal that we were stranded,” said S.H. Samantha. They lit a fire and waved flags in the hope that they would be rescued. Speaking about the bitter experience they had, he said that it was one of the most painful he had ever faced.
“We left the Galle Fisheries Harbour on June 14 and up to June 29 there were no issues. We, as usual, carried on fishing. On June 30, we could not start the boat and when we checked, the battery was not working,” he said.
Samantha said that they always carry two extra batteries, but for some reason even that failed to work. Even though they tried hard to restart the boat, they could not.
Susil Praneetha said that their world was torn apart when they realised that the VMS had also faltered. According to Susil, the company had deactivated the service despite their paying Rs.2,800 per month just for the service.
The boat was sailing in the high seas for 11 days before they became stranded. Once they realised they were stranded, the fishermen continued to signal for help, hoping someone would save them. After three days, a Maldivian fishing boat detected them and requested the fishermen to get onboard.
Susil said the Sri Lankan fishermen refused to get onboad the Maldivian boat because it is illegal to do so. The Maldivian fishermen thereafter informed the Maldivian coast guard about the Sri Lankan fishermen.
“The Maldivian fishermen stayed with us until the coast guard arrived. We were also very scared. We did not want them to leave us there,” he said.
Janith Prasanga Kumara said that the Maldivian fishermen constantly assured them that they were in safe hands and that they need have no fear for their safety. In three hours, the Maldivian coast guard arrived. The Sri Lankan fishermen refused to leave their boat at mid-sea and return to shore with the coast guard. Therefore, they had to wait until evening when another boat arrived to take their boat ashore.
“Even though we have returned to Sri Lanka, our boat is still in the Maldives. If the VMS was working, we would not have faced these issues,” Janith said.
Sunil said that when he called his family from the Maldives, they burst into tears and were in so much pain to know of the fishermen’s ordeal. He said that the villagers lit firecrackers when they learnt that the fishermen were safe. The Sri Lankan fishermen said their boat owner Saman Priyantha’s brother-in-law Upul, who is in the Maldives, helped them a great deal. They requested the Fisheries Minister to take steps to ensure the VMS system for fishing boats works continuously to avoid similar situations in the future. A fisherman of Sindhur -2, Samantha Sellaheththadhi said that they were expecting that they would be rescued soon.
“We remembered our families and friends when we were stranded at sea. We were waiting for someone to come and rescue us. If we had a proper method to communicate with the Navy, we need not have undergone all these troubles. But unfortunately, we were stranded in the sea for nearly three days,” he said. The fishermen said even though they could not understand the Maldivian language, they managed to communicate with those fishermen in sign language.
After they were rescued, Upul took them to his room and provided them with all necessary facilities.
Janith said that they never gave up hope of being rescued.
“We have not done anything wrong and we continued to pray to God to save us,” he said.
Minister assures security
Soon after the fishermen arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) on Tuesday, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa and State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi invited them for a meeting at the Ministry.
The fishermen requested that the VMS facility be properly maintained and that their security is ensured when they leave Sri Lankan shores.
Asela Chamantha thanked the Minister, State Minister and other officials for taking all possible measures to rescue them. He said that they had enough food and water and there were no issues in this regard. Sunil told the Minister that their boat was still in the Maldives and requested help to bring it back.
“The boat owner has to spend nearly Rs.23 lakhs to bring the boat back and that is a huge amount of money,” he said, adding that the owner will be leaving to the Maldives soon to sort out the documentation.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry said that they could not track the fishermen as the battery of the VMS failed and communication was barred as a result. The Ministry said that the fishermen were found close to the Maldives.
The fishermen said that if the VMS was working properly, they could have been tracked and rescued easily.
Fisheries Department Director General Prasanna Ginige said that the radio system of the boat was also not working and there was no communication with the radio unit of the Fisheries Department. However, the Fisheries Ministry, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the Maldivian Embassy took every initiative to bring the fishermen back to Sri Lanka.
He said that India and the Maldives assisted the authorities to locate the missing fishermen.
The Fisheries Minister assured the fishermen that the Ministry would take all possible measures to avoid a similar situation in the future. “There could have been issues with the VMS. There were mistakes on our side as well as theirs. We have now decided to introduce new reliable technology to track their location,” he said.
He said a new unit with smart technology will be established to ensure the safety of fishermen and added that a communication officer and a controller will be appointed for the unit.
Minister Zoysa said that measures have also been taken to provide VMS to even small boats with the support of the Australian government.
The fishermen were provided lunch at the Fisheries Ministry and bidden goodbye with the assurance that the Ministry would take all necessary measures to uplift their lives as well as protect the lives of fishermen.
