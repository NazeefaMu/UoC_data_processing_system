Football unites in wishing Ferguson well after emergency brain surgery

MANCHESTER, Saturday - Messages of support poured in for Alex Ferguson after the legendary former Manchester United manager was left fighting for his life following emergency surgery for a brain haemorrhage on Saturday.
News of his operation was made public by his old club, with a United statement cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the 76-year-old, the most successful manager in British football history.
“Sir Alex Ferguson has undergone emergency surgery today for a brain haemorrhage,” the statement said.
“The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery. His family request privacy in this matter.” According to the Daily Mail, an ambulance was called to the Scot's home in Cheadle, near Manchester, in northwest England at 9:00 am local time (0800 GMT) on Saturday Concerns for Ferguson's health started to mount when it was announced his son, Darren, the manager of English third tier club Doncaster, would miss his side's League One match against Wigan on Saturday because of “family reasons”.
“It is tragic. I am going to find out how he is as soon as I possibly can,” said Everton manager Sam Allardyce, a longstanding friend of Ferguson's, after his side's 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton. “Obviously I knew it was extremely serious when I knew his son Darren didn't attend his own game at Doncaster today,” the former England boss added. - AFP
