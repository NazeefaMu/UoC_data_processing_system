Davis Cup Asia/Oceania
Sri Lanka relegates to Group III in 2019

Sri Lanka will play in the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group III in 2019 as they lost their relegation tie against Indonesia 3-1 at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association Clay Courts yesterday. As visitors won two singles and the doubles rubber to claim the tie win, the remaining singles rubber did not play yesterday.
Harshana Godamanna kept Sri Lakan hopes alive winning the second singles against David Susanto 6-3, 6-1 on Saturday after Sharmal Dissanayake lost the first singles rubber over Indonesian number one Christopher Rungkat 6-4, 4-6, 3-0Ret.
Godamanna and Sharmal were defeated by the strong Indonesian pair Christopher Rungkat and Justin Barki in easy straight sets to bag the doubles rubber win and Godamanna lost his second singles against Christopher Rungkat in an exciting three-setter 4-6, 6-4, 6-7.
Godamanna, 33, who played his 51st Davis Cup tie was recognized for his long and invaluable service to the country by the International Tennis Federation before action got underway when he received an ITF Commitment Award. The left-hander then went on the clay courts and proved how much Sri Lanka will miss him in the future, especially in singles, as he dominated Susanto.
“I’m really proud to get this award,” Godamanna said. “It wasn’t something I planned for or aimed at but it is pretty cool to be in the company of a couple of other Sri Lankans who have given their commitment to the Davis Cup which is a special event.”
“He is a worthy recipient of this award for he has given a lot to the country,” said Suresh Subramaniam, president of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka and a former Davis Cup member too.
The other local recipients of this award are the late Bernard Pinto and Arjun Fernando. Godamanna first represented Sri Lanka at the Davis Cup in 2002 and has now played a record 51 ties including 94 matches – 69 singles and 25 doubles – with a 43-15 win-loss record in singles and a 26-10 doubles record.
“If I continue after this year, it will be mainly playing doubles. This will be my swansong in singles but I leave with the team in good shape as we have three guys, Sharmal (Dissanayake), Yasitha (de Silva) and Alex (Fairbanks) who are all good prospects for the future. In the past we have depended on one or at most two players but now we have a solid core,” Godamanna pointed out.
