A total of 1,541 displaced are currently provided shelter at the Terrence N De Silva Maha Vidyalaya in Kolonnawa. Speaking to the Daily News, several of the displaced said they are provided with all necessary sanitary and other facilities. The victims include 343 families. As of Sunday (16), 145 houses had been damaged while 625 persons belonging to 180 families had been displaced. Brigadier Seneviratne said it is difficult to assess the complete damage caused, even after comparing the satellite photographs taken then and now.
Meanwhile, in a press release by the President’s Media Division stated that President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed responsible officials to provide relief measures to the victims of the Meetotamulla incident without any financial restraints.
The instructions were directed at a special meeting held at the Ministry of Disaster Management, chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena.
