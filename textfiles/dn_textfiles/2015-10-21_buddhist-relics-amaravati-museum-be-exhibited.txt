Buddhist relics of Amaravati museum to be exhibited

Buddhist relics preserved at the Archaeological Museum in Amaravati, India and kept away from public eye will be exhibited, during the capital foundation ceremony.
A collection of exclusive artifacts from the museum, including bone relics of the Buddha will be on display at 'Amaravati Pavilion', proposed to be created by the Tourism Department at the venue. According to sources, the relics were originally found in the stupa at Bhattiprolu in Guntur district. They were donated by the Mahabodhi Society of India and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
"Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and dignitaries from across the country and abroad will be here, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu wants the relics to be showcased on this special occasion," said R. Amarendra Kumar, Executive Director (Projects) AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC).
The Amaravati museum is home to many relics dating back to thousands of years, found during excavations. This museum has a wealth of the ancient Amaravati town that belonged to 3rd century BC, through several sculptures that once were a part of Mahachaitya (the giant stupa).
The exhibition will showcase the past, present and the future of the ancient town and will be kept open for public for a month from October 22.
Replicas of sculptures and a miniature model of the future Amaravati capital city will adorn the pavilion besides an exclusive collection of ancient coins.
This region was ruled by dynasties such as the Satavahanas, Andhra Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Ananda Gotrikas, Vishnukundina, Kota Vamsa, Chalukyas, Cholas, Kakatiyas, Reddis and Vijayanagara kings during ancient and medieval times.
The Mumbai-based Hinduja Foundation will display coins of a few dynasties such as Pallavas, Vishnukundina and Vijayanagara kingdoms dating from 150 BC to 250 AD.
"We have an exclusive collection of about 70 coins of different dynasties, of which the Satavahana collection is the largest and the most comprehensive," says Brig (retd.) H. Chukerbuti, chief functionary of Hinduja Foundation.
"We also have a collection of punch marked coins believed to be the oldest coins in Indian history," said Mr. Chukerbuti.
Punch-marked coins are a type of early coinage of India, dating to between about the 6th and 2nd centuries BC. The foundation members are also calling an expert on Satavahana dynasty from New Delhi to answer the queries of visitors.
"Each coin has a unique motif. There are too many intricacies involved. Only an expert on the subject can explain them," says the former Brigadier, the Hindu reports. - The Hindu
