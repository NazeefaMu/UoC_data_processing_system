Festive cheer for COMBANK credit, debit card holders

The festive season is upon us and more than 200 exciting brands have signed on to offer incredible discounts to Commercial Bank’s credit and debit cardholders, over the next six weeks.
Valid till end December 2017, these offers cover holidays at prominent hotels and resorts islandwide, overseas vacation packages and shopping at some of Sri Lanka’s most popular clothing, shoes, jewellery, accessories, cosmetics, sportswear, and homeware outlets.
Discounts on payment by Commercial Bank Credit cards range from 20% to 55% and from 10% to 50% on Debit cards, for shopping on specific days during the promotion, with some retail outlets offering discounts on two to four days and others for periods of up to 16 days.
Besides offering the ideal shopping spree opportunity to buy gifts for the festive season, and a chance to embark on exciting holidays, these promotions significantly enhance the benefits already offered by ‘Comdeals,’ a programme which provides value addition to Commercial Bank Cardholders through discounts at a number of major retail outlets in the country and 0% easy payment schemes for Credit Cardholders, the Bank said. Commercial Bank Cardholders are also eligible to participate in global promotions carried out by Visa and MasterCard.
Commercial Bank is also the first bank to offer loyalty rewards for both credit and debit card holders under its Max Loyalty Rewards scheme, and was a pioneer in extending promotional discount offers, which were traditionally only offered for credit cards to its debit cards.
Commercial Bank’s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank has a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a majority stake and Italy, where the Bank operates its own money transfer service.
