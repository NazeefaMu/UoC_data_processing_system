‘Cancer drug harmless’

No complaint was lodged so far about the new cancer drug imported from Russia, Apeksha Hospital Director Dr. Wifred Kumarasiri said .
Dr. Kumarasiri said all Consultant Oncologists at the Apeksha Hospital use the drug. It arrived in 1,199 vials at the hospital on June 1 last year and 1,175 of them had been used by the end of February this year.
The drug had been used for cancer patients during the last nine months without any complaint.
There was no issue of the quality or any other problem of the drug. Initially, some doctors did not use it since it is a new drug, he said.
