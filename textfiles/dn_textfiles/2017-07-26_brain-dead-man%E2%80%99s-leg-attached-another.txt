Brain dead man’s leg attached to another

For the first time in Sri Lankan medical history, a leg from a brain dead individual, has been attached to another at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. The operation took place on Monday (24). At present less than 10 such operations have been done around the world.
A year ago, a 32-year-old man had to have his leg amputated just above his knee as a result of an accident.
In the meantime, a 52 year old man who lay brain dead due to a brain haemorrhage and presented himself as a likely candidate for the young man’s leg”, Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital’s Vascular and Transplant Surgeon, Dr. Joel Arudchelvam said.
The young man had given consent to the surgery and the family members of the brain dead individual had given their consent for the amputation.
The operation was headed by Dr Arudchelvam together with surgeon Dr Amila Ratnayaka, Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Nuwan Wijesinha, Anaesthetic Dr Levan Kariyawasam, a nursing team and support staff. All members of the team work at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital.
“When attaching an external organ to a patient, the donor’s external as well as internal specifications have to be similar.
Their blood groups, as well as their skin colour and other physical features have to match”, explained Dr Arudchelvam.
The nerve endings of the attached leg is now functioning well and the young man is in good health and currently recovering at the ICU at the hospital, he added. The 52-year-old man’s kidneys too has been donated and the two kidneys were sent to the Kandy General Hospital on Wednesday.
They are to provide new life to two patients suffering from kidney failure.
