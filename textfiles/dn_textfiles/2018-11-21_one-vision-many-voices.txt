One vision,  many voices

Reading and/or listening to a great profile of a person could lead not only to a momentary bliss but also to a resourceful turning point in one’s existence. We are accustomed to reading the noble profiles of saints, heroes and religious dignitaries from various cultures and countries over the years. The compilation of 12 modern Buddhist Masters by Jack Kornfield comes as a rare presentation in this direction.
According to the compiler, the materials in this work have been collected and translated from foreign languages such as Thai over the past years. Furthermore, they represent an intimate record of spoken Dhamma, the teachings of many of the greatest modern Buddhist Master. They are intended to be shared and utilized by all in the development of the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha.
Spiritual teachings
The 12 masters of Buddhist teachings are drawn mainly from the Orient. The countries include Burma and Thailand. But Kornfield does not undermine the other countries like India and Sri Lanka as he has often made journeys in search of the same kind of spiritual teachings. As such, Kornfield states that ‘in making these teachings available, I have tried to secure blessings and assistance from the masters represented. However, due to difficulties of time and half a world of distance, some of these materials have not had the formal acknowledgements and blessings as are traditional in publishing such a volume.”
Perhaps the compiler, in keeping the reader as not acquainted with a deeper knowledge in the teachings of the Buddha, has provided a long prologue titling it as ‘Essential Buddhism. That comes as Chapter One. This introduction paves the way to gather the most salient socio-cultural and socio-spiritual essence as taught by the Buddha to his disciples, who in turn transferred the same down the centuries. Thus, the commencement goes as follows: “The Buddha after his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree was undecided about the teaching. Who, he wondered, would be able to understand the Dhamma to the depth he had penetrated? Who, in fact, would listen? With great compassion, the Buddha chose to teach, especially for those beings ‘with but a little dust covering their eyes’. Thus Kornfield says that hundreds of thousands of saffron-robed monks and tens of thousands of temples still exist throughout Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.
In a lighter vein, Kornfield at times lays down tales from his various experiences to edify certain salient points in his presentations. One such tale goes as follows:
“A Western monk once asked the permission of his forest teacher to journey to Burma to try the intensive meditation systems of several other well-known teachers. Permission was readily granted. After several years, he returned to his first teacher.
“What did you learn?” The teacher inquired.
“Nothing,” answered the monk.
“Nothing?”
“Nothing that is not already around, that was not right here before I left.”
“And what have you experienced?”
“Many teachers and many meditation systems.” The monk answered. “Yet, the more deeply I penetrated the Dhamma the more I realized there was no need to go anywhere else to practice.”
“Ah yes,” replied the teacher, “I could have told you that before you left. But you could not have understood.”
Meditation of different types
This compilation in Kornfield’s words is an odyssey. It takes the reader on a journey through the countries one knows but never experienced as a traveller. The reader encounters well the teachers of meditation of different types. They include one great layman, one Bhikkhuni and ten Theravada monk of fame who have developed their teaching methods of meditation and spiritual levels as compared with the mere laymen.
These noble teachers uncover the various aspects of wisdom, power and knowledge, traversing into the inner reading of one’s life. The origins of these teachings too became a subject area, linking the east and the west. Each profile that emerges carries an extra value by supplementing it with either a learned article, a talk delivered at a particular place or an interview. For instance, the profile of Mahasi Sayadaw (1904 – 1987) goes to state how he had a far-reaching effect on the practice of insight meditation in Theravada Buddhist countries. His scholastic studies at a village monastery began at the age of six and culminated several years after his full Bhikkhuni ordination (upasampada) with the highest honour in government-sponsored Pali and scholastic examinations. After teaching the scriptures for many years he set out with the robe and bowl in search of a clear and effective meditation practice. In this manner, the details pertaining to the life and learning process of the noble monk are rewarded. This is followed by a brief note on his teaching linked to the insight meditation, its basic and progressive stages. Similarly, Ajahn Buddhadasa (1906 – 1993) is visualized as the best known Dhamma Master in Thailand during his lifetime.
Comparative religious studies
In addition to being a great scholar of Buddhist tradition and scriptures, he is learned in many other fields. He is presented as the author of several books in Thai as well as in English on the subject of meditation and comparative religious studies and the application of Dhamma to daily life. One of his learned discourses titled as ‘Insight by the nature method is inserted as additional material. One notable profile is on Ajahn Naib (1897 – 1983). She was born into the family of Thai governor in a province bordering Burma. At the age of 30, she began the study of Buddhist psychology and insight meditation under Ajahn Pathunta U Vilasa. Twelve years later she began teaching, establishing centres for the study and meditation at many temples, and finally under royal patronage established a Buddhist Research Centre in Bangkok. One of her learned essays titled ‘The Development of Insight’ is inserted. Jack Kornfield’s training includes six years in Thailand, India and Burma. Apart from this compilation, he has also compiled several other works inclusive of Buddha’s Little Instruction Book’ (translated into Sinhala by Nayana Rajapaksa).
