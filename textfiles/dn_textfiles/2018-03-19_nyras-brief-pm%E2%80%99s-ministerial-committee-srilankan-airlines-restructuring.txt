Nyras to brief PM’s ministerial committee on SriLankan Airlines restructuring

A presentation on the restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines will be delivered to the ministerial committee looking into restructuring Sri Lankan Airlines on Wednesday (21), a reliable source said.
The ministerial committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will receive a progress evaluation on the first phase of the restructuring plan for the national carrier at this presentation. It will be conducted by Nyras, the international aviation consultant tasked to come up with recommendations to turn the tide for the flag carrier.
The restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines is presently going through the first phase of the plan which mainly focuses on the internal restructuring such as route rationalization, purchase renegotiation and cost deduction, the source explained. “The main task in reviving Sri Lankan Airlines is to find a strategic partner. However, we cannot attract a good investor if we do not resolve the internal issues in the airline. The first phase of the restructuring focuses on these internal adjustments.” the source said.
Speaking further on a strategic partner for the national carrier, the source said the reason as to why an international partner seems more desirable would be because such a partnership will allow Sri Lankan Airlines more space to regain its former performances.
“Recognised international partners get low fuel prices, they offer low fares, they have more aircraft which could be shared, and their ratings are higher. These plus points make international partners practically more sought-after.” it was pointed out.
Meanwhile, the head of the Official Committee appointed to look into the restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines, Finance Ministry Secretary, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said the restructuring of the carrier is still at its preliminary stage.
He pointed out these initial adjustments to the airline follows the recommendations forwarded by Nyras, as a multi-action plan focusing on six main segments that should be restructured.
SriLankan Airlines which was a profit making establishment began to accumulate losses when the previous regime changed its management from Emirates.
The management agreement between Emirates and SriLankan Airlines ended in 2008 in a backdrop where the then Rajapaksa regime cancelled the visa of then emirates Chief Executive Peter Hill over a disagreement. Emirates exited the airline selling their 40 percent shares to the government.
The accumulated profits during Emirates-managed SriLankan Airlines was around 4.4 billion. The loss incurred in the seven years, from 2008 to the end of 2014, under the local management appointed by the previous regime was around Rs. 107 billion.
By 2015 national carrier’s accumulated losses stood at Rs.128 billion with a debt of Rs.76 billion and balance sheet discrepancies of Rs.74 billion.
The staff members of 5,113 in 2008, was also increased to 6,987 by 2015 which increased the operations cost of the airline.
The losses escalated as the previous regime decided to buy A330 and A350 aircraft.
The previous government signed an agreement worth of Rs.143 billion, leasing fifteen aircraft for the SriLankan Airlines, without a cost benefit analysis.The agreement was on seven A330 narrow bodied aircraft and eight A350 wide bodied aircrafts.
