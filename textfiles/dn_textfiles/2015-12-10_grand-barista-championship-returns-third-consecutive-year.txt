Grand Barista Championship returns for third consecutive year

Colombo’s favourite coffee house chain Barista Lavazza staged its signature annual Grand Barista Championship 2015 on December 1. The much-awaited event took place at Barista’s Gandhara outlet in Colombo 6 and was held for the third consecutive time.
The championship first commenced in 2013 as an internal competition to motivate staff members. However the success of the first event led to a much larger event last year. The aim of the event is to crown the ultimate “brew master” from among the Barista Lavazza staff from their outlets spread across the island. The winner receives an all-expense paid educational tour to India. Commencing at 9am this year’s championship saw six highly skilled competitors battle it out for the grand prize.
After a grueling and well-contested championship Nirodha Sankalpa emerged the champion “Brew Master” while the 1st runner-up was Thuwan Surajdeen and 2nd runner-up position was clinched by Roshan Subesinghe.
This year’s competition was adjudicated by a renowned panel of judges comprising Illy Coffee Business Development Manager Alexandra Rocci, Colombo School of Hospitality Management CEO Steven Bradie, Inflight Service Delivery Sri Lankan Airlines Training Manager Divakar Gnanakan, JAT Holdings Business Development Manager Jerome de Silva and London House of Coffee Operations Manager Kiyaz Borham. The eminent panel followed stringent international barista championship guidelines thereby ensuring a truly world-class competition.
“A Barista Championship was held in a small scale two years ago and as a result of continuous training we later branded the championship as GBC (Grand Barista Championship) last year giving the championship a unique identity. Last year GBC was held in a grand scale and this year we made it an even bigger deal as a means to appreciate the talent within our ranks.
We are extremely happy with the competitive spirit with which each of the participants took part and even more so of the high level of coffee based drinks they came up with.
Competitions such as this only showcase how much young talent our country possesses and that we can take on the world if this talent is groomed in the right manner”, Barista Coffee Lanka (Pvt) Limited Training and Development Manager Tharanga Perera noted.
Darshana Sampath was the winner of GBC 2014 and was sent to India to visit a Lavazza coffee factory to experience firsthand how the coffee used at Barista outlets is made. He also participated at special coffee trainings conducted by global experts which in turn have enabled him to enhance his brewing techniques.
“After becoming the Barista Champion and visiting the Lavazza coffee factory in India I returned with more passion for coffee than before and continue to make great coffees”, Sampath said speaking on his achievement. “It was really exciting for me to have my friends at Barista cheer me on while I was competing. I’m now looking forward to adding more knowledge to my skills through further training”, this year’s winner Nirodha Sankalpa added.
Coffee is the core of Barista Lavazza’s business and all aspects of serving the perfect cup of coffee to every customer are taken very seriously. Therefore a lot of time, energy and funds are invested continuously to not only ensure the best raw material but also to develop the team their skills. Championships of this nature ensure that the best of the best are trained within the company itself.
A brew master at Barista Lavazza is a respected profession in the world for their specialized skills in brewing perfect espressos, cappuccinos and lattes. Most of the coffee house chain’s brew masters have joined fresh after school from various parts of the country and from different walks of life. Many of them have experienced a subtle but effective transformation as they become part of an organized learning experience.
“The culture at Barista Lavazza is driven by our passion for our main product which is coffee and our company prides itself on the modern style of management that we follow. We believe our staff is the greatest asset and we do everything within our capacity to develop this asset and treat them with the respect and care which we expect them to extend to our guests. We have a passionate, energetic and enthusiastic bunch of people who work with a lot of ownership never failing to take initiative to make the customer’s experience worthwhile. GBC is actually a platform that is created for our team to display their skills passionately in front of a distinguished audience”, Perera added.
