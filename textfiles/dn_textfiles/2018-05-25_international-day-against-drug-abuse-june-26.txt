International Day Against Drug Abuse on June 26

The National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) has decided to commemorate International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking for a week from June 26.
International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking falls on 26 June, said NDDCB, Chairman, Prof. Saman Abeysinghe addressing a media briefing at their offices yesterday, “But we felt that rather than just have one day, it was better to commemorate it over a week.”
The NDDCB will be working together with the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Drugs for an illicit drugs–free country.
The two agencies have been working together over the last year to raise awareness among schoolchildren, university students, vocational training institutions, early childhood development centre staff, government officers, law enforcement officers and communities. At the end of 2017, the NDDCB had conducted awareness programmes for 126,456 school students through 614 programmes,
“The youth are the most vulnerable group when it comes to drug use and more often than not, it starts due to a lack of information,” said the Chairman.
Senior advisor to the Presidential Task Force, H.M. Tilakaratne, said in addition, programmes from the grama nildhari level to the district level were being operated through district drug prevention committees to village drug prevention committees. They were being supported by community policing units around the country.
“We have also trained 400 military personnel through the universities including civil defence force personnel to work with communities on drug prevention programmes and they assist officials to conduct awareness programmes. In addition, 600 youth from the Mahaweli areas have been trained to work to prevent drug use in their villages,” said Tilakaratne.
He noted that their programmes were being constantly updated to use what works. Further officials have been instructed by the President to act without political interference to curb the drug problem.
“All government officials have been given the power to act, but whether they do so remains doubtful. So the President has undertaken to monitor the progress once a month or once in three months.”
