Sports Minister sacks Labrooy and appoints De Mel as chief cricket selector

The Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha sacked the five-member selection committee headed by Graeme Labrooy and reinstalled former Sri Lanka fast bowler Ashantha de Mel as the chief selector of a newly appointed four-member selection panel.
De Mel a former chairman of selector will have former cricketers Brendon Kuruppu, Hemantha Wickremaratne and Chaminda Mendis as his co-selectors.
The first task of the new selection committee will be to select the squad for the upcoming tour to New Zealand.
The Labrooy led selection committee came for criticism following Sri Lanka’s dismal showing in the Asia Cup where they lost to Bangladesh and Afghanistan and were knocked out in the first round and for the ODI and Test defeats suffered at home in the ongoing series against England.
Labrooy has also been criticized for his role of being away from the national team on duties as an ICC Match Referee for women’s international cricket tournaments.
Recently he was in the Caribbean as match referee for the ICC Women’s World T20.
A Sri Lanka Cricket media states that the Sports Minister met with Labrooy and the rest of the members of the previous national selection panel yesterday afternoon at his office and thanked them for the services rendered towards Sri Lanka Cricket, as national selectors.
