Trinity-Isipathana should provide the thrills

Pallekelle rugby ground is expected to be bursting at the seams packed with rugby fanatics today for the annual rugby clash between Trinity and Isipathana. A thrilling game of rugby is in store when the eagerly awaited confrontation between arches rivals in school rugby scrum down, which is also the third game of the second round for the two schools. Today’s kick-off is fixed for 4.30 pm with Rohan Fernando handling the whistle. Both schools are great crowd pullers and in the past whenever they met have produced unrelenting brand of rib bruising rugby.
A repeat is expected today. The match itself should prove interesting as both teams will be out at full strength and will no doubt be seeking to grab it in their favor. As long as the Trinity forwards are left mobile it will be difficult for Isipathana.
This is the realization that has struck the Pathanians and the match strategy will be to run the ball at every opportunity.
It will not be easy for the Trinitians much will depend on their forwards who are experienced and tactically good players. In the first round it was a joy watching Trinity’s attacking style.
They have quality players in almost every department. The Pathana pack too has been sound, if Trinitians can find the extra speed necessary, the Pathanians task will be harder.
The Trinity forwards are playing well and using their weight and height to good effect to gain possession. Today their power and superiority will be gauged against the equally strong Pathana forwards who should play tighter like they did last Saturday against the Thomians. Pathana three-quarters look formidable and are in good form.
They were impressive against the Thomians, disrupting quick ball and preventing them achieving any momentum until late in the game. They caused the Thomian forwards a lot of problems, and they’ll do the same for Trinity.
Dharmaraja host Science at Nittawela
Today at Nittawela the high riding Dharmaraja ruggerites will play Science a game that should turn out in the Rajans favor. In the second round Rajans showed the exit door to both home town schools Kingswood and Vidyartha. If the Rajans want to win this match, they will have to play flawless rugby, mindful of the Science ruggerites ability to play the high ball to maximum benefit.
At present the Rajans forwards are a formidable lot playing together and are good in their rucking and driving. Science should use their line as they have some good runners.
Vidyartha, Kingswood in Colombo
Vidyartha who have lost both their second round matches to St. Anthony’s and Dharmaraja will be in Colombo today to play D.S. Senanayake at Welisara. The D.S. boys should have things to their own liking - their forwards play hard and send the ball quickly out to the threes. Vidyartha fielding a very young outfit will be at full strength. Kingswood who lost the first second round game shocked the Antonians in their last encounter and should have their hands full today when they play Lumbini. Kingswood who possesses a glittering array of players will go all out for a win as they cannot afford to lose this game. Lumbini too are good and sure to give a good run to the Kingswoodians in their own den.

The Antonians must be desperate to come out with a better performance. They had major issues in the team where ball handling; unforced errors led them to a tough defeat. In this game the Antonians must rely more on their speedy outsiders, for their bad luck their regular fly half Samuel Maduwantha who passed the century mark last season is out due to an injury, this is affecting them badly.

Tickets are sky high at school’s rugby?
School rugby crowds could soon keep off from matches if ticket prices continue to rise. School rugby supporters say the present school match tickets are highly priced and Kandy schools rugby risks losing an entire generation of young fans. Rugby was more affordable at one time, now they have broken that habit.
The reason behind it is only Trinity has their own grounds for rugby. They give some schools free for matches when it is not used by them, schools like Vidyartha, Sylvester’s, Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Sumangala, Anthony’s and Rahula who have no grounds of their own for matches. Today schools have to spend nearly Rs. 100,000 as ground fee so naturally the gate fee goes up. From that too they have to pay a 25% entertainment tax. When schools play their matches at Bogambara due to hardness of the grounds there is lot of injuries.
