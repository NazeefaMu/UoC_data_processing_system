England and Australia not giving an inch over scrum

England and Australia are fighting over the scrum before they even go on the pitch for their decisive World Cup clash on Saturday.
The pressure will be on French referee Romain Poite during the game as much as the heavyweights on either side whose battle for supremacy could decide the game.
With the stakes so high -- England were upset 28-25 by Wales and will go out in shame in the qualifying round if they lose again -- there is a war of words over how the Pool A confrontation will be refereed at Twickenham.
England forwards coach Graham Rowntree hit back Friday after former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer accused the Red Rose brigade of deploying an illegal set-piece.
England have won their last two Tests against Australia through their dominant forwards.
But Dwyer, who guided Australia to victory over England in the 1991 World Cup final at Twickenham, has accused England loosehead prop Joe Marler of gaining an unfair advantage by angling in rather than scrummaging square." AFP
