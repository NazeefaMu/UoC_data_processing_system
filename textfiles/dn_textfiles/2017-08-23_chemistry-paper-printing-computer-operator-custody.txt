Chemistry paper printing computer operator in custody

A computer operator who had computerised a Chemistry paper, similar to the Advanced Level Chemistry second paper, has been taken into custody by Gampaha police officers on Monday (21).
The suspect has computerised the Chemistry paper on a request of a tuition master.
Thereafter, the paper has been distributed near an examination centre in Gampaha soon after the Chemistry second paper was over on Saturday (19).
The suspect working at a computer centre in Gampaha, is a resident of Kelaniya.
However, the Police have failed to arrest the tuition master, who is the main suspect. His father and a brother have been taken into custody on charges of helping him to prepare the paper. These three suspects will be handed over to the Criminal Investigations Department by Gampaha police for further investigations.
Meanwhile, the Examinations Department is inquiring into a case of a missing Chemistry second paper. It was reported that a question paper of the second part of Advanced Level Chemistry paper was missing from the bundle of question paper packets distributed to the examination centre number 1,407 at the Padavi Parakramapura Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura. It was revealed that several question papers were missing when the question paper packet was opened by invigilators attached to the examination centre just before the exam commenced.
