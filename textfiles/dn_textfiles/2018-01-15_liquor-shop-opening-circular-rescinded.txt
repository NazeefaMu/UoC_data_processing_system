Liquor shop opening circular rescinded

President Maithripala Sirisena said he has instructed the Finance Ministry to revoke the circular which permits liquor shops to be kept open from 8am to 10pm allowing women to purchase and sell liquor.
The circular will be cancelled by the Finance Ministry today. President Sirisena made these remarks addressing a public gathering in Agalawatte yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, the President emphasised that he stands for an ethical and disciplined society inculcated with democracy, freedom and equality. He added that the Government has taken many fruitful measures to achieve this goal during its three year period.
The President further said that it has been an era of democratic governance with freedom. “But it can be observed that certain segments are trying to ruin the freedom and democratic environment for silly gains,” he said.
The President noted that he stands for creating a just society as he talks on it. He said, not only by talking but also by practicing he stands for creating a just and peaceful society. Unlike most of the rulers, he said that he did not speak a single word with the police when his own brother was taken into custody by police over a road accident.
“In the history of the country it may be the first ever incident of a brother of not only a President but also a Prime Minister or a Minister, was taken into custody on a charges of a motor accident” he noted.
President Sirisena added that he ensures equality for everyone in creating just society.
“I use a common policy, which causes no discrimination for anyone to create a society with equality.
“I never consider the political status or party affiliations in taking action against fraud and corruption,” he said.
