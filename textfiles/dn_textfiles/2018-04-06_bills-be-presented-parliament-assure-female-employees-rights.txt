Bills to be presented in Parliament to assure female employees rights

 
The Labour Commissioner General informed that bills will be presented in Parliament to remove all discrimination in connection to maternity leave enjoyed by female employees in the private sector, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry spokesman said.
This was said during a visit paid by the European Union delegation to Sri Lanka.
The delegation paid special attention towards measures taken by the Sri Lankan Government to protect labor rights, the Ministry spokesman said.  
The delegation observed the progress made by Sri Lanka in connection with 27 International Conventions.
Of the 27 Conventions, eight are connected to labor laws and implemented by the Labour and Trade Union Ministry.
Small female workforce, night duty for women etc are some of the other subjects to be concerned.
The delegation inquired labor authorities about certain complaints and requests made to them by Sri Lankan trade unions. In response the Labour department informed the delegation that certain garment factories do not let officials from the labor department, to carry out inspections, he added.
