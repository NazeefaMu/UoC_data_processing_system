Willing to be organ donor or not? Info. in new driving license

Drivers’ licences in future are to contain information on whether the holder is willing to be an organ donor or not, according to Cabinet proposal approved this week.
A proposal made by Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne “to amend forms of obtaining and renewing driving licences by including a declaration to declare the will of drivers to donate their organs and to indicate that will on the driving licence card,”was approved this week, Minister Senaratne said addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
“With drivers facing accidents on a regular basis, they can be an important group of donors. Cabinet two months ago approved the issue of new drivers’ licences which would contain more information on the chip. This is one such information which would be included in it”, explained the Minister.
With Chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure becoming a common problem in Sri Lanka, the country is facing a major issue with a scarcity of donors.
Sri Lanka is the leading nation in the world for cornea donation and provides corneas to around 54 countries.
