Aiming to offer a five-star service at each and every passenger touch point, the latest accolade is an important affirmation of Turkish Airlines’ dedication to further improving its brand experience.
Turkish Airlines, flying to more countries than any other airline, has been named a 'Five-Star Global Airline' by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) Official Airline Ratings.
The prestigious award, based on passenger feedback, was presented to Turkish Airlines at the APEX Award Ceremony at Expo 2017 in Long Beach, California.
This five-star ranking reaffirms Turkish Airlines’ position as a global leader in passenger experience and comfort.
Commenting on the airline’s latest accolade, Chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee of Turkish Airlines, M. Ilker Ayci said: “We strive to provide the best travel experience to our guests and having been named a ‘Five Star Global Airline’ by passenger votes is the most valuable recognition that we can have in return. What differentiates us is that while connecting our guests with their loved ones, we turn great ideas into reality that result in a travel experience full of unique services and delightful differences. Touching our passengers’ hearts is the key factor that earned us a series of awards. This is our most important advantage over our competitors.”
