Black cats shunned for purr-fect selfies

In a strange development, rescue centres reveal that most of the abandoned cats they find are black. The black cats are harder to re-home because of their association with witchcraft.
However, according to a story in The Sun, Christine Bayka, 67, founder of The Moggery in Bristol said that it has become harder to re-home them these days because according to people they do not look good in social media posts.
Christine said: “It’s worse now because black cats don’t show up in selfies. It’s an increasing problem. It’s definitely got harder because of selfies.”
Amy Buckle, of the Last Chance Animal Rescue Centre in New Romney, Kent went on to add people do seem caught up in taking photos and putting them on Facebook and Instagram and want a model animal they can put on social media.
Buckle went on to add that it seems black cats get ignored because people find them boring.
The RSPCA confirmed, “More black and black and white cats come into care than any other ­colour.” The Sun
