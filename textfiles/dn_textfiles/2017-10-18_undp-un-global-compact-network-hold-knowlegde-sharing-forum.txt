UNDP, UN Global Compact Network hold knowlegde-sharing forum

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Global Compact Network, Sri Lanka, convened a knowledge-sharing forum recently under the theme ‘UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’ at the Aitken Spence Auditorium in Colombo.
The panel comprised of UNDP Business and Human Rights Specialist Sean Lees, Virtusa Corp Vice President Denver De Zylva and Aitken Spence PLC Corporate Sustainability Assistant General Manager Yasangi Randeni, sharing their knowledge and experience on Business and Human Rights in the private sector.
This came following the recent partnership agreement signed between the UNP and the Global Compact Network Sri Lanka to further align private sector sustainability initiatives with the 2030 development agenda and host high-level knowledge dialogues and facilitate greater public-private partnerships on national development priorities.
