Panaeliya train accident: Injured could apply  for compensation

Sri Lanka Railways Deputy General Manager Vijaya Samarasinghe said the government would pay compensation, if the injured in the Panaeliya train collision accident apply for it.
A comprehensive probe into the accident is being conducted, while the Engine Driver, the Assistant Driver, the Head Guard and the Under Guard of the Rambukkana bound train have been temporarily suspended until investigations are completed.
"Disciplinary action would be taken if proven guilty after investigations," he added.
Meanwhile, a four member committee had also been appointed by the Sri Lanka Railways General Manager to investigate the incident, while the final report in this regard is due to be submitted next week.
