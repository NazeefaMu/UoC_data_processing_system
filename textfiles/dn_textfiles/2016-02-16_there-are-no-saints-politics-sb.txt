There are no saints in politics: SB

 
There are no saints when it comes to crossing over, breaking political parties and establishing new political parties, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
"I did it myself, the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa snatched the SLFP in the past, along with late Anura Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake. I also received a position of an'organiser' at that time," he said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, where he also said the former President who had now resorted to calling others 'frogs', had forgotten how he snatched at the SLFP in the past and how the elderly leaders of the SLFP died with the mental agony inflicted on them by defeat.
There is no one who remained in his or her political party for ever. Majority of them have crossed over, broken their parties or established new political parties, the minister said. He added however, "But at the end all of them returned to their original political party. No new political party survived."
Minister Dissanayake said that what is wanted is to unite the SLFP and stop it from breaking into two. "We do not need to spoil the relationship with anyone. We vehemently reject the efforts made to push the country back to racism. All the issues, especially the war occurred because the past governments prevented the minorities from joining the administration and ruling of the country," the minister said.
He pointed out that he had recently been accuse of cutting Rs. 100 from the payment granted for the elderly by the government. But that Rs. 100 goes to a large fund which upgrades elders homes, which are like hell with no facilities and dirty and unhealthy environments., he said. He also said a system would be established soon to make payment for elders at their homes via easy cash.
Then they can save Rs. 200 or 300 they spent for three wheelers to travel to the post office or other institution to obtain the payment, he said.
