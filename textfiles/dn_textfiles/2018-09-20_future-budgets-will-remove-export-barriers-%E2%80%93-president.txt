Future budgets will remove export barriers – President

Future budget proposals will consider eradicating the barriers faced by exporters, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The government is constantly seeking ways and means of empowering the export sector and solving their issues as the export sector is vital for strengthening the national economy, said President Sirisena. The President was speaking at the Presidential Exports Awards ceremony at the BMICH on Tuesday.
This awards ceremony, which recognises outstanding exporters, is organised by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board annually and was held for the 22nd time this year.
The awards include ‘Exporting Conglomerate of the Year’, ‘Sri Lanka Exporter of the Year’, ‘Employment Provider in the Export Industry’, ‘Sri Lankan Export Brand’, ‘Nett Foreign Exchange Earner’, ‘Best Emerging Exporter’, ‘Market Diversified Exporter’, ‘Woman Exporter of the Year’, ‘Contributor from the Regions to the Export Supply Chain’ and ‘Contributor to Sustainable Development in Exports’.
The President said that although there have been many achievements in the exports sector since 2015, there are many achievements yet to be made.
President Sirisena underlined the need to eliminate the barriers in the export sector and to strengthen the production process to suit foreign markets.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama, State Ministers Sujeewa Senasinghe, Eran Wickremaratne and Harsha De Silva, and other Ministers, Export Development Board Chairperson Indira Malwatte and other EDB officials were present the event.
