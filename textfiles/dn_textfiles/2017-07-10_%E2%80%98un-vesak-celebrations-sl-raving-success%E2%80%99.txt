‘UN Vesak celebrations in SL a raving success’

Sri Lanka achieved unprecedented international recognition by holding UN Vesak celebrations in the country in a highly successful manner, All-Nepal Bhikku Association President Ven. Maitri Mahathera (Shakya) Thera, who was in Sri Lanka, recently, said.
Shakya Thera, who is also the Chairman and Chief Abbot of the Ananda Kuti Vihar International Buddhist Society in Lumbini, Nepal and Spiritual Advisor of the Lumbini Development Trust, noted that Sri Lanka, where the Buddha visited on three occasions, was the best place to hold the United Nations International Vesak Festival. He also said that Sri Lanka was the most noteworthy contributor to International Vesak Day. “Prof. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera initiated and inspired a meeting of global Buddhists in 1950 in Sri Lanka, resulting in the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) on May 25, 1950, at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy. This meeting was attended by 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries in Asia, Europe and America,” Shakya Thera added.
“At this meeting, the Buddhist Flag was formally accepted and Ven. Piyarathana Thera recommended that Vesak Day should be accepted globally as a Buddhist celebration; a proposal which was accepted and followed by the Global Buddhist fraternity. Buddhism during its existence over two millennia had developed into three schools; Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayna; all disciples and believers of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Prof. G.P. Malalasekera was able to unite all three schools of Buddhism within the World Fellowship of Buddhism and became the first president of WFB from 1950 to 1958,” he said.
“Lakshman Kadirgamar too, was a pioneer in making Vesak Day as an ‘optional holiday’ at the United Nations for the first time under its resolution 69/250/ at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1999, requesting for the adaptation of 'Vesak Day' on September 23, 1999 and at the 79th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1999,” he added. In 1968, Ven. Maitri Thera was ordained in Sri Lanka under the theme of ordaination of 10 Shakyas.
