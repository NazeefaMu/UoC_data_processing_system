Flood damaged houses to get upto Rs 2.5 mn


The government has decided to grant a compensation upto a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million per each house destroyed in the adverse weather conditions, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
The deaths will receive a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per each individual, Senaratne said.
Meanwhile, the number of deaths has been increased to 193 and disappearances have gone upto 94, Disaster Management acting Minister Dunesh Gankanda said. The displaced families amounts to a 149,678, he said. A total of 383 relief camps have been established. 1,326 houses are fully damaged and 6,979 houses are partially damaged, Gankanda said.
Minister Senaratne speaking at a media briefing held at the Disaster Management Ministry said the government insurance scheme that covers all the houses in the country, has enabled such compensation to be allocated.
All unauthorised constructions will be removed and the illegal dwellers will be moved to alternative residences.
Changes have also been made to the financial allocations made for dry rations given for the affected families, he also said. Accordingly, the government has allocated Rs. 1800 for a family of four per a day. The allocation for each meal prepared for a displaced, have been increased to a Rs.300 as well.
Compensation programs are currently being prepared to aid small and medium scale tea estates that got caught in landslides, Minister Senaratne also pointed out. The government will take necessary steps to increase the compensation package in due time, as there is a considerable inflow of foreign aid as well.
