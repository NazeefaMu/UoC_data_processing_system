‘MR cannot be SLFP Co-chairman’

Some people argue that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be made SLFP Co-chairman, but it cannot be done in terms of the party constitution, SPFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said.
He disclosed this when he visited the Katukelle Jumma Mosque in Kandy on June 30. According to the SLFP Constitution, a party member who gets elected as the country's President, automatically becomes party chairman, while former President becomes its honourary patrons, he said.
Prof. Piyadasa said former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga had become party patrons as decided by the Party Constitution.
Prof. Piyadasa said the most suitable candidate acceptable to the SLFP and the UPFA would be fielded at the next Presidential Election. "That candidate selected under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena would never be a common candidate. Although fielding the best possible candidate at the next Presidential Election was difficult, complex and problematic, it would be a creative challenge," he said.
Prof. Piyadasa said the SLFP had always stood for minority rights and the opinion some tried to create that it was opposed to minority rights could be construed as a myth. He said the Pohottuwa group was not a political party because many of its membership had not given up SLFP membership.
"Neither have they intimated their desire to resign from SLFP membership to the SLFP Central Committee in writing. These people are still attending party's committee and Central Committee meetings," he said.
Referring to the recent New York Times Report, he said Sri Lankan media persons could conduct an investigative report on the incident as the government would never try to influence them. Such an investigation by local media persons could establish whether it was correct. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Provincial Minister Ediriweera Weerawardene were present.
