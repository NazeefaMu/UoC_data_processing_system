Defender providing security to MR collides with three wheeler

A defender jeep carrying a team of STF officers attached to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's security division collided with a three wheeler at Kiribathkumbura on the Kandy road around 6.30 am yesterday injuring the three wheeler driver. He was admitted to the Peradeniya hospital.
Police said the three wheeler had earlier crashed against a bus from Kandy proceeding to Panadura and the jeep following it had struck the three wheeler from the rear.
The STF officers had been proceeding to Mahiyangana to cover a religious ceremony attended by the former President when the accident occurred. Peradeniya police said the three wheel driver was driving without a valid driving licence under the influence of liquor.
