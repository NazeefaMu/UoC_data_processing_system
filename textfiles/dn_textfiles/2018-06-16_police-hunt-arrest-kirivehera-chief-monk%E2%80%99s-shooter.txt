Police on hunt to arrest Kirivehera chief monk’s shooter

Police teams investigating into the shooting of Kataragama Kirivehera Chief Incumbent Ven Kobawaka Dhamminda Thera had searched around 20 locations where the main suspect is believed to have been hiding.
The Police spokesman said the suspect had been identified and he is expected to be arrested shortly.
Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera had complained to police about threats to his life earlier and as a result, the police had provided him security of two PCs and two CSD personnel.
However, one of the PCs had been on leave, while questions have arisen regarding the other PC on duty, as to why he had not fired at the gunmen, despite having been given a weapon.
“The monk’s security personnel had failed to shoot at the suspects and currently an investigation as to why they had not fired back, is being conducted.
In such an instance, according to provisions of the Penal Code, security personnel had full authority to fire at suspects, but we have to investigate why they had not fired back at the assailants,” the Police Spokesman said.
Comprehensive security measures are in place in the Kataragama sacred area including the Kirivehera following the shooting incident at the Kirivehera temple, which left Chief Incumbent of Kataragama Kiriwehera Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera and another Thera injured. Vehicles entering the Kataragama Devalaya and Kirivehera premises have been restricted and police personnel have been deployed.
Police have taken decision to restrict vehicles entering the Kataragama sacred site to ensure the security of devotees and the VIPs, visiting the sacred area.
