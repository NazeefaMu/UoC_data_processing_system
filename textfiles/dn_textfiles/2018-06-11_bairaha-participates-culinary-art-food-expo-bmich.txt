Bairaha participates in Culinary Art Food Expo at BMICH

Bairaha Farms PLC, one of leading chicken processors and suppliers, participated at the Culinary Art Food Expo 2018, held at the BMICH.
The company, already having achieved a major stake in the domestic consumer market as well as supplying to hotels and restaurant in Sri Lanka, is attempting to further promote Bairaha products among hoteliers in Sri Lanka.
“Currently we cater to different food service outlets, with a majority in the domestic market and also a presence in the five-star hotel sector, but we want to further increase and penetrate our presence and supplies to the hotel industry,” said Bairaha Farms PLC Brand Manager Ravin Madusanka.
Bairaha housed an outstanding stall among others at the exhibition, with three 3D signs above the stall to achieve a greater recognition among visitors. The Bairaha stall had a separate counter for selling.
Also present at the stall was a competition area, equipped with two separate stoves for competitors, with the motive of encouraging and helping the younger generation in enhancing their skills and interest in their culinary journey.
Bairaha also introduced a new product at the exhibition, ‘Golden Yellow Broiler Chicken Meat’, a corn-fed fully Sri Lankan broiler chicken product.
