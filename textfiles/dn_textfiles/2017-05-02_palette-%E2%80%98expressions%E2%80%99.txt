Palette of  ‘Expressions’

He walked with ladies in the fields, the wind rustling the grass and the sky was dark. He looked into the eyes of a beautiful African maiden and watched her smile, the scarf framing her face. He stood awestruck before the compassionate and majestic Bodhisattva. The gypsy with a thoughtful look on her face puzzled him. The woman seemed to be in pain, she seemed to him, distraught, hiding her face. The mother carrying a child seemed to be troubled as if the horizon was full of darkness. The beautiful smiling sweet girl perhaps reminded him of his own daughter. Jayantha Silva’s mind travels through alternate realities. He is an artist.

“I’m like a fine wine. I get better with age. The themes in my art are often messages about life, society or human nature. That’s why I have called all my Exhibitions “Expressions”. This is my 14th Annual Solo Exhibition,” said Jayantha.
Jayantha has gone from strength to strength. His first exhibition was Expressions 1 which was held 13 years ago at the same venue, Lionel Wendt.
“The inspiration comes from moving with my friends and relations. Their ways and expressions have inspired me very much. Also being observant about situations I see while traveling in my day to day life contribute. This is thanks to my photographic memory,” pointed out Jayantha.
Jayantha says that 90 percent of his paintings are images from his mind. “I see them, I store them and I paint them. Let it be consciously or unconsciously,” stated Jayantha.
The great Leonardo Da Vinci is his inspiration, but this Jayantha is also a connoisseur of art. “I am married. Marriage has not affected me but inspired me to greater heights. I have one sweet Daughter. She does not paint but admires my work,” he says
“I use several mediums. Acrylic, Soft Pastel, Color Pencil and Charcoal are the main mediums. I have done a few water color artworks. Unfortunately I have still not gone into Oil,” he added.
Jayantha’s 14th Annual Solo Exhibition “Expressions 14” will be held at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery starting with a preview at 6.30pm on May 5. Expressions 14 will be open from 10 am on May 6 and 7.
