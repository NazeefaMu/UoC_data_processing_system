SAITM students to be  absorbed into KDU fast

A strategy to complete the process of absorbing SAITM students to the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) will be in place soon concurrent to the KDU Act passed in Parliament recently.
Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) media spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the GMOA Executive Committee met President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the latest developments of the SAITM issue and this decision was taken during the meeting. Higher Education Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, President’s Secretary and KDU high officials were present at the discussion.
Dr. Ananda said the Supreme Court judgement given recently in connection with SAITM clearly states that it can be solved according to the KDU Act passed in Parliament.”Therefore there is no conflict whatsoever between the KDU Act and the Supreme Court judgement given,” he said.
The Parents Union of the State Medical Students Wasantha Alwis said media reports published on SAITM students demanding Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) registration was inaccurate because only a very few SAITM students out of the 83 had gone to the SLMC to check whether they can obtain registration according to the judgement which is now not relevant at all because of the implementation of the KDU Act.
