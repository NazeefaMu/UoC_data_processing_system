Kusal took the game away from us – Smith

PALLEKELE: Australian captain while being critical of his team’s batting performance said that young Kusal Mendis’ innings of176 took the game away from them when they lost the first Test by 106 runs to Sri Lanka at the Pallekele Stadium on Saturday.
“We bowled pretty well in the first innings to get them out for 117 that was a pretty good effort. In our batting we lacked a little bit of discipline in the first innings, we were in a position to get a much bigger lead that 86,” said Smith at post-match press conference.
“The third innings of the match we didn’t do a great deal wrong but Kusal Mendis played an exceptional innings of 176 that sort of took the game away from us.
From our point of view it was disappointing to lose Steve O’Keefe in the 49th over he was looking very ominous out there.
“At every stage we thought he was going to take a lot of wickets from that aspect it was tough losing him. We tried other ways to get the team out but we weren’t able to do that and 267 obviously on a day four or five wicket against quality spinners was going to be a tough task and we weren’t upto it,” he said.
Smith said that he was proud the way Phil Nevill and O’Keefe stuck it out for one and a half hours in tough conditions.
“It wasn’t easy some balls were skidding and some were spinning, it was difficult but they found a way to get through. If Steven was able to run we could have scored a few runs as well,” said Smith. “From the batters point of view it’s about finding a way to get used to these conditions. We let the spinners into the game a lot more than we probably should have. Rangana (Herath) got the majority of his wickets on the inside of our bats for the right-handers and outside of the left-handers’ bat so we have to find a way to play that a lot better in Galle.
“Galle is traditionally the biggest spinning place in Sri Lanka I’ve been told. Spin is going to play a big part again. I am pretty shattered losing a bowler like O’Keefe he is the sort of perfect bowler for these conditions. He was doing an exceptional job and he actually bowls quite similar to Rangana Herath hits the stumps, bowls with a sort of cross seam - balls skids and balls spin so he was doing a tricky job,” he said.
Victoria’s left-arm spinner Jon Holland has been named as replacement for O’Keefe and Smith who has gone to the same academy as him said, “Holland is a class bowler he has done pretty well in first-class cricket.
Having a left-arm orthodox bowler in these conditions is a must. If he hits good areas hopefully we can see some from what we saw from Steve and Rangana some balls spinning and some balls skidding, which incredibly hard to play against. We know each other reasonably well and I am sure he will fit well around this group.”
Smith’s team came with the intention of improving their record in the subcontinent and the defeat at Pallekele was not the result they would have wanted.
“I said before the game we haven’t played pretty well in subcontinent conditions for a while now something that under my captaincy I want to change. There were glimpses throughout this game that we improved in some aspects but we just let ourselves down,” Smith said.
