World powers hit back at Trump’s Iran decision

IRAN: Iran and the international powers that signed the nuclear deal have hit back strongly at President Donald Trump’s repudiation of the landmark pact.
Germany, France, the UK and Russia rallied together with the EU late on Friday in support of an agreement they said boosted international security by stopping Iran from building atomic weapons.
“We can’t afford as an international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that’s working and delivering — especially now,” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in Brussels.
“It’s not a bilateral agreement. It doesn’t belong to any single country — and it’s not up to one single country to terminate it.”
Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said he stood by the deal, but would walk away if it failed to serve the country’s interests.
“No president can revoke an international deal,” the Iranian president said in a live television address following Trump’s announcement. “Iran will continue to honour its commitments under the deal.
“However, if one day our interests are not served, we will not hesitate even one moment and will respond.”
The head of the UN, António Guterres, said he strongly hoped the Iran nuclear deal would remain in place.
The leaders of France, Germany and the UK said in a joint statement that they were all “committed” to the deal and were “concerned by the possible implications” of Mr Trump’s refusal to recertify it.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and British Prime Minister Theresa May urged the Trump administration and the US Congress to “consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies” before taking steps that might further undermine the deal.
Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, said that Trump’s position was “extremely troubling”, RIA news agency reported. Moscow now saw its main task as preventing the nuclear deal from collapsing, Ryabkov was quoted as saying.
The European leaders rejected Trump’s scepticism over whether Iran was honouring the nuclear agreement, noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency had judged Tehran compliant. Mogherini also gave short shrift to Trump’s declaration that he could choose to terminate the deal. “The president of the United States has many powers — [but] not this one,” she said.
The European countries indicated one area of potential compromise with the US when they said that they shared Washington’s concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programme and role in conflicts elsewhere in the Middle East.
