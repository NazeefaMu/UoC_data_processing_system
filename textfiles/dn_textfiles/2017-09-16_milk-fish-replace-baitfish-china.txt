Milk Fish to replace baitfish from China

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to promote Milk Fish, known in Sinhala as Wekkaya as an alternative for baitfish import from China.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed relevant officials to provide relief for those who are willing to breed the local fish variety called Wekkaya as an alternative for the Chinese baitfish variety.
The minister said the price of cuttlefish variety imported from China to use as bait has increased rapidly during the past few months.
“Although fishermen have requested to reduce the price, the ministry cannot do so as tax has not been imposed on the Chinese baitfish variety,” said the minister. Accordingly, the ministry has decided to provide financial assistance of Rs. 500,000 and a land for them. Measures have also been taken to provide loans at concessionary rates through a State bank.
The minister said a land from Balapitiya close to Madu Ganga and another land from Chilaw have already been identified as suitable lands for breeding the baitfish.
The ministry has also decided to give priority to the fisher community when they select beneficiaries with the intention of enhancing living standards,” said the minister.
