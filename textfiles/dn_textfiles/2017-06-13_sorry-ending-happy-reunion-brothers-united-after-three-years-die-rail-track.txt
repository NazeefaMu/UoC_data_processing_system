A sorry ending to a happy reunion: Brothers united after three years die on rail track

 
Two brothers, Shashi Madhushan (24) and Thikshana Shakshan (12) met with a tragic ending last evening when they were hit by a train while taking ‘selfies’ on the rail track between Bambalapitiya and Kollupitiya.
The brothers, residents of Anuradhapura, had met after a long separation when the older brother Shashi Madhushan arrived in Sri Lanka after completing his studies in Singapore the past three years.
The family had picked the older boy Shashi Madhushan from the airport and then driven to Galle Face in Colombo to celebrate the joyous occasion.
On the way to Kollupitiya, the brothers had stopped to take ‘selfies’ on the coastal rail track and met with their untimely death.
Grandmother of the deceased W. Prema Gunawardene said the two brothers had been so engrossed with taking selfies they had failed to hear the train bearing down on them.
The younger brother Thikshana Shakshan was decapitated instantly, while the older brother had succumbed to his injuries en route to the Colombo National Hospital.
The head belonging to the younger brother was recovered from the Kollupitiya Police Station today.
