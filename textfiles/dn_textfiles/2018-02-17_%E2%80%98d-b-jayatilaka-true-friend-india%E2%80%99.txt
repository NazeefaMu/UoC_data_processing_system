‘D. B. Jayatilaka, true friend of India’

The history of Sri Lanka is not complete without the special mention of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka. The history of India-Sri Lanka bilateral relations is also not complete without acknowledging the priceless contribution of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka, said Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu.
He was addressing the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Sir Don Baron Jayatilake, recently.
Ceylon turned to India when the food shortage hit the country during the heights of World War II. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was sent as an emissary, and India honoured his request and sent food shipments to the island. He was later appointed as Representative of Government of Ceylon to India. Unfortunately, he fell ill when he was in Delhi. The Viceroy had arranged a special plane for him to return to Ceylon. Unfortunately, he passed away when the plane was over Bangalore. He was later cremated in Borella.”
“He remained a true son of Ceylon. He would remain forever, a true friend of India. Had destiny allowed him a longer life, who knows, what turn his career would have perhaps taken,” he said further.
“It might be a strange coincidence but it is true that in 1923, when Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was elected President of Ceylon National Congress, another great educationist, who would later become independent India’s first Education Minister, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, was elected President of Indian National Congress”.
Prime Minister Modi in his Vesak Day speech noted that the friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the ‘Great Master’. Sir D.B. Jayatilaka was a worthy son of the Great Master, and his contributions to strengthening the bonds between our great nations will be remembered forever. As the Buddha has said, ‘even death is not to be feared by those who have lived wisely.’ Sir D.B. Jayatilaka lived wisely. Let us be his worthy disciples and live wisely, today and every day,” the High Commissioner said.
