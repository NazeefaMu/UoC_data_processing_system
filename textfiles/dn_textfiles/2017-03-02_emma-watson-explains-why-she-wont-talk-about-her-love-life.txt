Emma Watson explains why she won't talk about her love life

 
Being a celebrity must be hard. Fame and fortune aside, the constant intrusion into your life can’t be much fun.
We live in a world where break-up stories are splashed across the front pages and the public are always hungry for juicy details of a star’s personal life.
But there are some celebrities who are noticeably coy when it comes to aspects of their lives outside of work, specifically their love lives.
One such person is actor and feminist campaigner Emma Watson.
Do you know who she’s currently dating? We thought not.
And Watson has just explained why she never talks about her romantic life, and it makes a lot of sense.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, Watson revealed that by keeping her private and work spheres separate, she’s able to lead a more normal life away from the cameras.
She has a boyfriend, but no one knows who he is - according to rumours on the internet, he’s a guy called Mack who works in Silicon Valley.
“I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways,” she explains. 
However this silence is not just for her own benefit, but for that of whoever she’s in a relationship with.
“I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”
Being in the spotlight clearly does not come naturally to Watson. She has revealed that when she enrolled at Brown University in 2009, she was seriously considering giving up acting altogether.
“I was finding this fame thing was getting to a point of no return,” she remembers. “I sensed if this was something I was ever going to step away from it was now or never.” 
Don’t ever bother asking Watson for a selfie either, because she’ll say no: “If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they’ve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters. 
“They can see what I’m wearing and who I’m with. I just can’t give that tracking data.”
She’s not rude or mean to her fans though, and will happily take the time to chat to people or sign an autograph: “I'll say, 'I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just can’t do a picture’.”
It’s a refreshing and rare approach
