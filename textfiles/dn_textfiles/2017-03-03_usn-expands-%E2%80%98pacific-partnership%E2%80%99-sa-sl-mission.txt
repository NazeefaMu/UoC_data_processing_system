USN expands ‘Pacific Partnership’ into SA with SL mission

The US Navy's (USN's) expeditionary fast transport ship (EPF) USNS Fall River (T-EPF-4) departed Singapore for the Southern Sri Lankan town of Hambantota on March 2, marking the first time that the series of humanitarian and disaster relief (HADR)-preparation exercises will be conducted in South Asia.
Involving more than 200 military and civilian personnel from Australia, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the drills will be in their 12th iteration since 2006. Fall River will perform as the sole supporting ship - the first time that an EPF is being thrust into this role.
"As the navy buys more [EPF] platforms this is really a great opportunity to see how well we can execute this mission on this vessel", said Captain Stanfield Chien, Deputy Commodore of Coastal Riverine Group One and 'Pacific Partnership' mission commander, in response to questions from Jane's .
"In today's economy we all know budgets are very tough. So if we can properly execute and complete a mission like this, which is considerably less expensive than a hospital ship, but we still create the same effect and still build those relationships, then this is a very viable platform for the future," he added.
Besides multilateral HADR drills, 'Pacific Partnership' 2017 will also feature medical subject matter expert exchanges, civil engineering projects such as the rebuilding of schools and maternity hospitals, and medical symposiums.
"So this is a demonstration of that commitment that we have in this region, and we want to build those relationships and we want to be partners," Capt Chien emphasised in reference to the USN's presence in Asia Pacific. (IHS Jane’s)
