SAFETY AT PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS AND SLEEPY DRIVERS
Accidents and loss of lives at pedestrian crossings have become the “order of the day” as reported on both electronic and printed media. It is high time that the concerned authorities took preventive measures without further delay.
I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities in the respective ministries and the Traffic Police to the following suggestion which can be implemented at the minimum cost.
A ‘rough surface’ on the road should be created 50 metres before the Pedestrian Crossing, by burning/ melting and scraping the top layer of the ‘carpet’ for a width of 6 feet on the on-coming side. This will alert the driver through the slight vibration of the steering wheel that there is a Pedestrian Crossing Ahead.
“Creating rough surface” can also be done by covering the surface of the small ‘hand operated’ road roller temporarily with a metal layer with ridges and then pushing it to and fro on the burnt/melted portion of the carpet whilst sprinkling water. The ridged metal covering can be removed after finishing the work.
A massive saving can be made on the entire cost of material needed for marking the road with white zebra strip as it may have to be done a million times to cover all the roads in the country.
This can also be done, every 10 kilometres, to prevent the driver from falling asleep. These precautionary measures have been taken in some Middle East countries.
A vehicle can be ‘replaced’ a billion times but not human life. This is a very simple inexpensive device but consider the number and value of human lives that can be saved daily. So, why hesitate?
Over to you dear Ministers of Megapolis Transport and Highways, all accident prevention authorities including Traffic Police.
