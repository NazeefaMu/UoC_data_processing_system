Canada close in on Rugby World Cup after Germany win

MARSEILLE, Saturday - Canada are one point away from a place at next year’s Rugby World Cup after beating Germany 29-10 in a round-robin repechage tournament on Saturday.
A losing bonus point against Hong Kong in the final match of the tournament next weekend would be enough for the Canucks to claim a spot at the showpiece event in Japan.
Despite a meagre three-point lead at half-time, a trio of second-half tries helped Kingsley Jones’ outfit close in on qualification.
Earlier in the day, Hong Kong comprehensively beat Kenya 42-17 but need to beat Canada on Friday by more than seven points and prevent them from scoring four or more tries to ensure their first-ever appearance at the tournament.
Hong Kong, who lost their opening match of the campaign to Germany, came back from 14-0 down after 23 minutes to run in six tries, two of them from backrow forward Thomas Lamboley.
Four teams are involved in the competition in Marseille with the winner going through to face New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia in the group stage of the World Cup.
The defeats for Kenya and Germany mean that they now cannot qualify for the tournament in Japan. – AFP
