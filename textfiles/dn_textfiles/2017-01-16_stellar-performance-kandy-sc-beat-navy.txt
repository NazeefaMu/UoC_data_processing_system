Stellar performance by Kandy SC to beat Navy

Defending league champions Kandy SC came up with a stellar performance to defeat Navy SC by a thumping 50 points (4 goals, 2 tries, 4 penalties) to 22 (2 goals, 1 try and 1 penalty) in their return Dialog league rugby match played at Nittawela yesterday. At half time Kandy led 28-10.
Kandy totally deserved this victory having had a difficult time in getting the team together since the tournament commenced. Yesterday they look a complete package with the forwards and backs clicking as a team, and team support and turn-over play. The Nittawela boys totally outplayed the sailors with heart and conviction.
The defending champions lived up to their hard earned reputation in the current league. They drew rounds of applause from their fans that saw them rock the sailors to a standstill with a spirited display which was full of rugby know how. Their performance with the ball was stunning which helped them to a half a century score.
The Kandy forwards out forced the sailors and a good part of the second half was entirely dominated by them. This third consecutive victory in the second round could easily be classed as the finest of them all, it was quite a remarkable performance. The character and flexibility shown was superb and it fashioned out a delightful win.
The sailors have been magical this season losing only one game narrowly to Havelock SC. They will be hugely disappointed because they had such wonderful victories in the second round, but yesterday failed to cope with Kandy’s team work and hunger for a win. What let down the sailors down was the way they played.
They were forced to manage to adapt and having to throw out their initial game plan and revert to a more compact and defensive game.
In the first quarter the sailors thought they could beat Kandy with ball in hand, but then things changed. The sailors need to be careful with their ball handling in the rest of their matches. In this game they made few mistakes whereas Kandy at times was brilliant. Some of their running with the ball and passing was at times breathtaking, skipper and scrum half Roshan Weeraratne was as usual brilliant but had to leave the field with a shoulder injury in the second half.
The return of Fazil Marija was excellent as he fed the three quarters to run every time they got the ball. He had his hands full with the magnificent play. Kandy’s backs can string together some lovely play and they are a pleasure to watch.
In the forwards play Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Shehan Pathirane, Damith Dissanayake and Sayru Anthony controlled the strings and were outstanding. Fullback Thilina Wijesinghe has been monumental this season sealing his spot with the No: 15 jersey.
The try scorers for Kandy SC were Dhanushka Ranjan (two) and one each was scored by Richard Dharmapala, Shehan Pathirane, Buwaneka Udangamuawa and Gayan Weeraratne. The conversion and the four penalties were neatly put over by Thilina Wijesinghe.
For Navy SC the tries were scored by Saliya Hapangoda, Lee Keegal, Dulanjana Wijesinghe one each. Thilina Wijesinghe put over the conversions.
The match was refereed by Sam George Jones from Australia.
