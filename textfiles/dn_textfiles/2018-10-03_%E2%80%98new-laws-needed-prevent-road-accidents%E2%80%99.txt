‘New laws needed to  prevent road accidents’

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday that new laws should be drafted to replace old and outdated laws to prevent road accidents contributing to the fatalities that keep rising daily.
He was speaking at a ceremony held yesterday to pay compensation to hit-and-run victims where the identity of vehicle drivers is not known.
Accordingly, family members of six victims of hit-and-run accidents were provided financial support worth Rs. 1.2 million while six injured people from such accidents were granted Rs. 6 million financial support by Minister de Silva.
The minister said CCTV cameras should be installed at accident prone areas to identify hit-and-run drivers and implement the law against them.
“When I brought new laws to increase fines against errant drivers, some parties opposed it. Therefore, it is necessary to change people’s attitudes to prevent road accidents,” the minister said.
