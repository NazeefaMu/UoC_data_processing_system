SLFP, JVP asked to state positions clear

The SLFP and the JVP have been asked to state their positions clear on the draft interim report on the new Constitution during the Steering Committee meetings scheduled on January 5 and 6.
A Steering Committee member speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the draft interim report circulated among the Steering Committee members last month spells out the basic contours of the new Constitution.
“However, the presentation of this report to the Constitutional Assembly had to be postponed as the SLFP members in the government ranks and the JVP requested time to further study its content. They are expected to articulate their official stances on the Constitutional making during the next Steering Committee meeting,” he said.
The member also said the 14 points forwarded by the Joint Opposition on the new Constitution would also be discussed during the next committee deliberation. The 14 point proposals of the JO group state among other things that foremost place to Buddhism, the unitary state and sovereignty of the country should be re-affirmed.
He said the UNP, the TNA and other minority parties representing Parliament are in agreement with the draft interim report.
Asked about the stance of the steering committee on SLFP proposal to take up the electoral reforms separately as the 20th Amendment, he said the majority of parties prefer comprehensive reforms and is against pushing through the electoral reforms only.
“If we are to accommodate larger reforms even including devolution of power and nature of the state and government within the 20A then we can reconsider this position,” the member said.
The Constitutional Assembly is to have its first debate on the new Constitution next week. A three day debate has been scheduled from January 9 on the reports of the six sub committees which deliberated on “Fundamental Rights, Judiciary, Finance, Public Service, Law and Order, and Centre-Periphery Relations”.
