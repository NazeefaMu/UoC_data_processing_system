SC Justice displeased over IGP’s lack of response

Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri yesterday expressed his dissatisfaction on the absence of a response from the Inspector General of Police on the request to release a team of police officers for the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue. Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said the written request sent by him at the beginning of the Commission to the IGP, has not received a response.
“The IGP has not even acknowledged on receiving the Commission’s request,” Justice Chitrasiri said.
The issue rose as the commission expressed their concern about the lack of intervention by officials to reform the process followed by the Public Debt Department when issuing direct placements.
The commission was questioning the lack of efficiency of the public officers when executing their responsibilities.
