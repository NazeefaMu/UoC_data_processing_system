Depression in the Bay of Bengal?

The depression that developed to the east of the Bay of Bengal might reach Sri Lanka by next Monday (25) or Tuesday (26), the Director General of the Department of Meteorology K.H.S.Premalal said yesterday.
“It may cause changes in the atmosphere as well,” he added. However,he said that there would not be a possibility of Sri Lanka affected by a cyclone.
Premalal was speaking at a media brief held at the Disaster Management Center last evening.
“Due to a disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, showers or thundershowers will occur in most provinces of the island,” he also said. Accordingly, heavy falls (above 100mm) can be expected at some places in the southern half of the island.
Meteorology Department sources issuing a weather report further state that showers will occur at times in the Northern, North-central, Eastern, Southern and Uva provinces and Matale district today. It also states that fairly heavy rainfalls (above 75mm) can be expected in the Southern Province and in the Ratnapura and Kalutara districts and that fairly strong gusty winds (50 kmph) can be expected in Northern, North-central and Central province and Hambanthota, Moneragala and Matara districts today as well.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity, it also said.
“Due to an active cloudiness in the sea areas to the south-east of Sri Lanka, the possibility for heavy showers/thundershowers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80kmph) in the deep sea areas to the south and south-east of Sri Lanka is high.” the report also said.
Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard.
