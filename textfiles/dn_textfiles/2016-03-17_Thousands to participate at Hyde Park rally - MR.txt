Thousands to participate at Hyde Park rally - MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that thousands of people will participate in the rally organised by the Joint Opposition at Hyde Park today despite various obstacles.
He said that those who oppose the United National Party government will participate in today's rally. Rajapaksa said that the Tamil National Alliance and the JVP are not the real opposition and they were just dancing to the tunes of the government.
He said the TNA and JVP are still harping on allegations against him without uttering a word on how this government is depriving the rights and welfare measures of the people.
"These two political parties being in the opposition, are supporting what the government is doing," he said.
Rajapaksa said that these political party members just raising questions in parliament provided by the ruling party.
