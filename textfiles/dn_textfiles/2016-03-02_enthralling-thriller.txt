Enthralling thriller

Although it runs in several layers, the genre of Bhava Tharana is clear. It is a political thriller. A conceptual political thriller, to be more precise. Devinda Kongahage's debute cinematic attempt points us toward the powerful imaginative capacity of the Lankan filmmaker. It is a proper remedy to the recent surge of Buddhist-themed films. The directors of these so called Buddhist-themed films (not to mention in general, though) seem to belittle the audience.
Their job was simply confined to take up a Buddhist tale along with its related events and make it into a film. And such films were forced upon the schooling citizens in the name of Buddhism and culture of this land.
On the contrary, here comes someone who bucks that trend. Devinda Kongahage is yet to establish his name as a seasoned filmmaker. With Bhava Tharana, however, Kongahage treads far ahead the traditional filmmaker of this country.
He employs Buddhism and politics, which are becoming popular subjects in the local art scene. All the same, he is not hesitant to question the Bhikkhu and the politician. He finds an interesting territory in politics and Buddhist culture. And thereby hangs his position: Devinda Kongahage offers a lesson on how ancient sources could be reconstructed and deconstructed.

More than the visual beauty of the film, Kongahage portrays his excellence as a scriptwriter with powerful imagination. He bases his script on 'Kandyan Kingdom: The Secret of its Survival' by Dr Lorna Dewaraja. With that as a source, Kongahage fuses the Buddhist concepts of rebirth and karmic effect with the political turbulences of the pre-colonial era. Unlike most films based on hackneyed Buddhist tales, Bhava Tharana presents us an almost-never-heard-of story that came to pass during the Kandyan era: a conspiracy by Kandyan aristocrats, led by a Buddhist Bhikkhu, against King Kirti Sri Rajasinha who has roots in South India.
At the outset, Bhava Tharanaya delves into the two main traditions of Buddhist monk order: monastic and the urban tradition. In Ven Thibbotuwawe Buddharakkhita Thera's character, we find both traditions infused: a worldlier monk in the previous birth and a meditative monk in the present birth.

In his previous birth, the Thera stands as the protector of Buddhism in its cultural segment. But in his present birth, he observes the futility and impermanence of the worldly affairs.
Devinda's interesting script introduces us to the Kandyan political landscape where politicians acted in much favour of the Buddhist monks - though the kings themselves had South Indian roots. Kongahage pursues his concept through the dialogues between Ven Buddharakkhitha Thera and his closest aristocrat patron. It is universally clear why politicians respect the Buddhist monks. The monk order has strong links with the community. The community would never be hesitant to comply with whatever the members of the Buddhist monk order needs done. Defying a Buddhist monk, a politician would definitely have to fear the public wrath.
That is why King Kirti Sri Rajasinha would not punish the Buddhist monks for being a part of the conspiracy. They were removed from the Sangharaja positions, only to be reinstalled later. This seems a riddle for Dr Dewaraja. Interestingly Devinda has already solved this riddle infusing his concept into the dialogues.
Even during the colonial times, the Buddhist monks could show their power, vigour and mettle. Probably why the politicians' fear and respect for the Buddhist monks continue to exist even at this age.
Kongahage reaches his cinematic pinnacle when he gets rid of lighting, a lavishly used cinematic technique in historic films. Thanks to this strategy, the audience can differentiate the present (which is shot in a moderately colourful ambience) from the past. You would find it a bit hard to see the darkly lit palace of King Kirti Sri Rajasinha. But that alone would creates a mutual bond between you and the Kandyan times.
The narrator we meet in the present layer was a part of his rebirth - he was one of the conspirators. In his sleeps, he naturally evokes memories of one of his previous births. Through a seemingly natural course of events, he is led to the Bhikkhu, who now resides in a forest in meditation. The culmination is that the Bhikkhu understands the futility of his social struggle. And king Kirti Sri Rajasinha comes to meet him in his present birth as a giant tusker.
The deal is over and done with. There are no more grudges or revengeful feelings left among them. What happened has already happened.
And the audience leaves the cinema hall, fully content.
