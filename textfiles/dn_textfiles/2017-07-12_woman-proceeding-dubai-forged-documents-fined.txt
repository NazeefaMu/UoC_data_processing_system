Woman proceeding to Dubai with forged documents fined

A Sri Lankan woman of Palagala found guilty of attempting to proceed for employment in Dubai by tendering forged documents including a forged security stamp purported to have been issued by the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau was fined by the Negombo Magistrate when she was produced in court by SLBFE officials on June 1.
The woman, Abdul Majeed Fathima Sipaniya, had arrived at the Katunayake Airport on December 5 last year to proceed to Dubai as a housemaid.
The SLBFE manager at the Airport who checked her documents had found that the SLBFE security stamp in the documents had been issued in the name of a different individual and reported the matter to investigation officers.
