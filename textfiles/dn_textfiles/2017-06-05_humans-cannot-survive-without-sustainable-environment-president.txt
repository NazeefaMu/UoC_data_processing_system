Humans cannot survive without a sustainable environment: President

It took several centuries for human beings to be modest enough to accept the fact that they are only one of nature’s creations, President Maithripala Sirisena in a World Environment Day message said.
The message added: “Even though human civilizations, from its origin, made efforts to change the natural environment to suit their needs, at present, due to the frequent occurrences of natural disasters, we have to admit that humans cannot survive without a sustainable environment. Nature reminds us of its message through landslides, devastating floods.
“Nevertheless, it is not too late to understand the message of nature comprehensively, as well as to live in harmony with nature.
“Connecting people to nature”, the theme for World Environment day 2017, invites all of us to unite to build that kind of nature friendly relationship. “This year’s World Environment Day expects to bring knowledge and awareness to the people about the need to sustain the environment in their activities and daily lifestyle. Avoiding lifestyle habits detrimental to nature and engaging in appropriate nature friendly lifestyle habits is directly interconnected with human survival.
“I wish every success for all the World Environment Day programmes carried out to achieve these goals, and join hands with all those who contribute for the sustainability of the environment”.
