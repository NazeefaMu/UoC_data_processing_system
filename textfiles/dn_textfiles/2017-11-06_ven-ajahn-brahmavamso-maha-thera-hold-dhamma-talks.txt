Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso was born in London as Peter Betts on August 7, 1951. He came from a working-class background, and went to Latymer Upper School in London. From there, he won a scholarship to study theoretical physics at Cambridge University in the late 1960's. At Cambridge, he joined the university’s Buddhist Society.
After graduating from Cambridge, he taught at a high school for one year before travelling to Thailand to become a monk.
Ordained as a monk (bhikkhu) by Somdet Buddhajahn at Wat Saket in Bangkok in 1974, Ajahn Brahm travelled to north-east Thailand in January, 1975 and became a student of meditation master Ajahn Chah at Wat Pa Pong. During that same year, he became a founding sangha member of Wat Pa Nanachat, a monastery established close by to Wat Pa Pong by Ajahn Chah to cater to the increasing number of Westerners that were coming to ordain and train with him. Ajahn Brahm became the vinaya (code of monastic discipline) master at Wat Pah Nanachat from 1975 until his departure in 1983. His vinaya notes are still authoritative for most Western Buddhist monks in the Theravada tradition.
He practiced meditation in Thailand under the forest tradition for many years before moving to Australia in 1983. In 1995, Ajahn Brahm become the abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery. In 2006, he led the fundraising and development of the Jhana Grove Meditation Retreat Centre, a world-class meditation retreat.
