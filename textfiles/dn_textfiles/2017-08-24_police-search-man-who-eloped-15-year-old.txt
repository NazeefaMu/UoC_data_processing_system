Police search for man who eloped with 15-year-old

Kuruwita Police are conducting investigations to arrest a 30-year-old man who had eloped with a 15-year-old schoolgirl resident in a village close to Kuruwita and sent her back home a week later by giving her a Rs. 500 note to her hand as bus hire.
Investigations revealed that the man had earlier carried on a love affair with the girl despite warnings by her parents who had admonished the girl and told her to give it up. But after continuing a secret intimacy, the girl had eloped with the man leaving a letter behind to her parents.
A week later, the parents had been startled to see the girl returning home. When questioned, the girl had said she went with the man to one of his friend’s house at Kurunegala and lived together for a week.
Thereafter, the man had given her a Rs. 500 note and got her to board a bus to return home after explaining the route she should take, telling her he had to go away to attend to some urgent work. The parents had thereafter taken her to the police station and lodged a complaint against the man giving his desecration and other details.
The Police have launched investigations to arrest him.
