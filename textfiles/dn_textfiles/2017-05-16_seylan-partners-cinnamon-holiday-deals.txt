Seylan partners Cinnamon for holiday deals

Seylan Bank offers its credit card members holiday experiences at Cinnamon’s resort properties this season.
Through its exclusive partnership with Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, Seylan Bank offers its credit card members amazing deals which break down all barriers to revelling in their dream holiday.
Tilan Wijeyesekera, Deputy General Manager Retail Banking at Seylan Bank said, “Our discerning credit card members have come to expect unprecedented offers from Seylan Bank and we are delighted to fulfil their expectations year after year, by extending exclusive holiday offers that unfailingly exceed their expectations.”
This year too, Seylan Bank has risen to the occasion by extending impressive 40% savings for Seylan credit card members and 25% savings on Seylan Debit Cards at Cinnamon’s resort properties. Card members can also avail of a further 10% discount on dining at Cinnamon’s resorts and a 25% discount off full body massages at the Balinese Azmaara Spa. All these offers are valid until 31st May 2017.
The discounts on the dining and spa can even be used independently of a stay at the resorts, perhaps on long drives to any nearby Cinnamon’s resort property to spice up a weekend! In the past, Seylan Bank had provided discounts up to 50% and 70%, as flash deals with Sri Lanka’s leading hotel chains.
The fact that customers can convert their payment into Seylan’s Easy Pay Plan offers further unmatched convenience for holiday-goers. It is the only payment plan in Sri Lanka to give the flexibility of choosing from multiple monthly instalment plans.
Romesh Walpola, head of sales and marketing leisure resorts (Sri Lanka and Maldives) at Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, said, “We are delighted to partner with Seylan Bank on this promotion and we are confident that this will encourage more of the bank’s clientele to join our constantly growing database of local guests.”
Seylan Credit Cardholders can discover their favourite destination to enjoy an exciting and memorable vacation with their loved ones with attractive savings. Seylan Credit Cards are accepted at over 30 million merchant outlets worldwide.
