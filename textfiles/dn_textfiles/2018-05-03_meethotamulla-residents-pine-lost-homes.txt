Meethotamulla residents pine for lost homes

D.S. Rasika’s house was among those which were enveloped by the massive mountain of garbage when the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed exactly a year ago. Even though she was given a flat by the government soon after the collapse, she still wishes that the tragedy had not happened and that she could live with her family in their own house in Meethotamulla.
“Living in a flat is not similar to the life we lived before,” she said. “There is a huge difference. We led a more peaceful life there.”
It is one year since the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy. The survivors and the residents of the area claimed that not even a handful of garbage from the dump has been removed. All of them – those who have been given flats and others who are yet to receive compensation according to their land value - live with the blind hope that the government would clear the garbage dump and settle them in their own lands.
On the eve of New Year celebrations last year (April 14), the garbage dump in Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa, collapsed claiming more than 30 lives. According to the Disaster Management Ministry, more than 100 houses were completely destroyed and nearly 150 families were evicted from the area which was declared as a ‘danger zone’ by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO).
The People’s Movement Against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump revealed that even thoughthe government provided flats, around 63 families who refused to move into flats were living in rented houses in other areas.
Voice of the people
When interviewed by the Daily News, a resident of the area K. Sandun said the amount paid by the government as compensation to those who were affected was insufficient.
He claimed that the assessments were not done fairly and added that for some, receiving flats was more profitable compared to the house they had before, but for others it was unfair.
He said that the government should have done a proper assessment and given compensation according to the land value.
In the meantime, M. Piyasena said that he refused to move to the flats, but he was satisfied with the government’s approach to the problem and he was happy with the compensation payment provided by the government.
He further said that these housing units provided to the shanty dwellers were already dirty and the government should ensure that they take care of these premises and keep them clean.
However, M.G. Siriyawathi said that the compensation paid for their properties was not enough to either build a new house or purchase one.
She said she did not feel as if she belonged to this place any more.
Siriyawathi pointing her finger at her house said it had not collapsed, but had been declared as a danger zone, and for the past one year she and her family have been living in a rented house.
“We were asked to leave our house soon after the collapse,” she said. “The government gave us rent for four months, but they are yet to give the rent for the last six months.”
She said the full amount was given by the district secretariat to the people who had deeds and she added that they too had title deeds for their property.
“Therefore, we were asked to bring a letter to the district office,” she said. “They informed us that they have got the order to give the money and needed a letter to pass it.”
Thereafter, Siriyawathi was given Rs. 1.35 million as compensation, but she has found that this was insufficient for them to buy a new house.
“If the government asks us to go to our houses, we are ready to go,” she said. “We would like that to happen.”
K. Ramanayake was asked to vacate within days of the disaster as the authorities feared a further collapse of the dump.
“We requested the government to at least give us the land value or we would not have a future,” he said.
Ramanayake lives in a rented house in Nagahamulla now and lamented about the difficulties in finding a proper school for his children.
Even though Rasika is living with her husband and two children in the flats, she feels that they are trapped inside a building.
“We could not save any of our belongings, we earned all back with great difficulties,” she said. “We got this apartment and Rs. 2.5 million and the officials told us that this apartment was worth Rs. 4.5 million.”
Rasika explained that not all have managed to thrive in their new living spaces in the apartments and that some have left their apartments, while others have given it out on rent.
“We would like to go back to our village,” she said. “We are waiting for something to happen. If the government removes the garbage dump and cleans the surrounding area and gives it to us, we are ready to go back to our lands.”
Immediate measures taken
Immediately after the collapse of the garbage dump, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a one-member committee - former Judge Chandradasa Nanayakkara - to inquire into the causes that led to the Meethotamulla tragedy. A comprehensive report on the damage caused to life and property due to the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump was handed over to the President in February 2018.
The Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.K. Anura was removed from his position by Governor K.C. Logeswaran on March 2, based on the recommendations of the committee. The decision was made by the Governor after receiving instructions from the President to take appropriate action according to the report.
Short-term and long-term recommendations regarding the disposal of waste at Meethotamulla were included in the committee report, with the report pointing out the importance of establishing a central institution to manage the process of waste disposal in the Western Province.
The report also highlighted the importance of establishing garbage incinerators and the President said that he will give instructions in the future to the relevant ministries and institutions to implement the recommendations and proposals of the committee report.
The report further revealed that the cause for the tragedy included the fact that the CMC from its initial stages failed to follow a proper method for the purpose of waste disposal and failed to properly implement the proposals suggested in this regard.
Compensation for victims
The people affected complained that no measures were taken to value the lands of both properties over which the garbage collapsed and properties in the danger zone.
In the meantime, Piyasena said that the main issue was the continued delay in getting compensation for their lands.
He said that it was government’s carelessness and irresponsibility that led to the disaster.
“It is more correct to say that it was the government that let this disaster happen,” he said. “We were already struggling to lead a peaceful life and the disaster added to our plight.”
National Disaster Relief Service Centre Director Chaminda Pathiraja said that compensation given to the people differs according to the damage caused.
He said that 170 families moved to the flats and 60 families live on rent.
“The families living on rent are given rent allowances since May last year,” he said.
Pathiraja said that the Valuation Department is currently doing the valuation for the lands and said that they will hand it over in the coming weeks.
“There was a meeting with Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya on April 19 and the Valuation Department said that they would present the report in three weeks,” he said. “But I think there is a slight delay due to the New Year and Vesak holidays. They will present it soon.”
Ramanayake claimed that the rent allowance given to the people was stopped last August and the representatives of the Movement Against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump intervened and the Cabinet proposal to pay the allowance to the families was approved for a further six months.
Pathiraja, in response, said that the rent allowance from September 2017 to February 2018 has been paid. He assured that once the land valuation report is completed, the problem would be solved.
After the compensation for land value is paid, the lands will legally belong to the Urban Development Authority, which the government is expecting to do within the next few months.
In the meantime, Kolonnawa Urban Council member Saliya Wickremasinghe claimed that the government has not taken any initiatives to remove the garbage from that area.
“They somehow managed to remove the people from that area and they are taking initiatives to pay them compensation,” he said. “I am not very well aware of the progress, but I am also concerned about the environment.”
He further insisted that land valuation should be done.
“Around 22 acres is covered by garbage,” he said. “The government has been talking about projects, but I do not see anything happening.”
Urban Development Authority (UDA) Director General Sumedha Ratnayake, speaking to the Daily News, said that the government had decided to take over the land and convert it to an urban park.
He said that even though the first phase of the landfill site in Aruwakkalu was completed, it was only going to provide a long-term solution to Colombo’s waste disposal and not deal with the existing garbage dump at Meethotamulla.
“If we are to transport the garbage in Meethotamulla, it is going to cost a lot,” he said. “Therefore, we have decided not to go for that option.”
Ratnayake explained that a conceptual design on establishing an urban park was done by the Moratuwa University and it would be implemented with the support of the National Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLR and DC), National Building Research Organization, and the Sri Lanka Army.
Kolonnawa Urban Council is left without a place to dump garbage
The Meethotamulla garbage dump at the start was a small scale garbage dump for just the Mulleriyawa and Kolonnawa Urban Councils. Following the shifting of the Bloemendhal garbage dump, garbage collected from the CMC was also dumped at the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
According to Kolonnawa Urban Council Chairman Gupthila Silva, they do not have a place to dump garbage from Kolonnawa now.
“The Colombo garbage issue was only raised after the collapse of the Meethotamulla dump,” he said. “Until then, even though there were internal issues and people protested, nothing happened,” he said.
Silva claimed that in 1996 the land which belonged to the Kolonnawa Urban Council was taken over by the UDA. The land was initially used by the council to dump the garbage from Kolonnawa and its suburbs, but with the support of the UDA, the CMC had forcefully begun dumping garbage in that land in 2009.
“Today after the collapse, every other urban council has a place to dump their garbage except for the Kolonnawa urban Council,” he said. “We are not allowed to dump in Dompe or Karadiyana.”
Silva further explained that the people living in the areas belonging to Kolonnawa UC were low-income families and the garbage often was not segregated.
According to Silva, only segregated garbage could be sent to Muthurajawala, but the garbage collected from their council was mostly mixed, and thus they needed a separate place to segregate them.
Even the CMC has been given a place to dump mixed garbage, but not us. We are meeting the subject minister this week to discuss the prevailing issues regarding garbage, said Silva as he struggled to balance interests, both the local and national.
