Fairfirst leadership programme concludes

The first batch of the Fairfirst Leadership Program (FLP) recently completed their 12 week leadership programme.
It officially commenced in June 2017 with 21 promising leaders who will one day become the future change makers of Fairfirst. Conducted by a qualified academic and professional faculty and curated by the Colombo School of Management, the programme covered various theoretical concepts coupled with its practical facets.
The FLP is an effort to synergize business skills and fundamental values that are universal in nature. Subanie Ekanayake – Head of Human Resources said “We at Fairfirst value the contributions of our employees. This program along with our overall people agenda is focused on enriching our employees and augmenting their knowledge and skills. This is a stepping stone for some amazing things to come at Fairfirst”
In addition to the knowledge and practical exposure the participants received, this programme has cultivated a stronger bond among its fellow members. Fairfirst believes in co-creating a progressive work culture that fosters personal growth and development whilst having fun.
“Our organization challenge is to influence these talented individuals and convert them into business leaders who are commercially astute with robust personal values” stated Dr. Sanjeev Jha – CEO and Managing Director of Fairfirst.
Keeping in line with the guiding principles of the parent company, the Fairfax Group, it is Fairfirst’s intent to promote a management style that is non-confrontational and detached from corporate hierarchy. Leadership that is grounded on the core values of fair and friendly and goes beyond mere production roll-call.
