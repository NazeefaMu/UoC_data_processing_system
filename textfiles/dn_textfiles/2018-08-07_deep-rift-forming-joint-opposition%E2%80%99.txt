Deep rift forming in Joint Opposition’

The clash between parliamentarians Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Kumara Welgama is evident that a deep rift is forming within the Joint Opposition on fielding Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as their Presidential Candidate
Kalutara District parliamentarian Kumara Welgama, an ardent supporter of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, lashed at his colleague Mahindananda Aluthgamage saying that the latter was a coward and man without a backbone.
Welgama hit out at Mahindananda Aluthgamage at a event held in Kalutara and parliamentarians Namal Rajapaksa and Rohitha Abeygunawardena were on stage.
“Mahindananda has told a newspaper that I am a joker. But he did not have the backbone to say it to my face when we met at the central committee party last week, Welgama said.
He said Mahindananda Aluthgamage did not have the guts to take part in the Nugegoda rally after Mahinda Rajapaksa fell out of power. “Aluthgamage was in hiding those days,” he said
He said they do not want a presidential candidate not involved in politics, showing his opposition to the presidential bid by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya.
