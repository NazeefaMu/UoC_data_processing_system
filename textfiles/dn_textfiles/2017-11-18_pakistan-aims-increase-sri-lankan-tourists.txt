Pakistan aims to increase Sri Lankan tourists

Pakistani travel companies interested in increasing the number of Sri Lankan tourists visiting Pakistan, visited Sri Lanka this week to hold discussions with the Pakistani High Commission in Sri Lanka and the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines to ease travel between the two countries.
The CEO of the Pakistani destination management company, Saiyah Yousaf Akhthar who was on a visit to Sri Lanka with a Pakistani tour group from November 8-15, said they held discussions with the two to increase Sri Lankan traffic to Pakistan.
“The Pakistani High Commission assured that they would help ease the visa process for Sri Lankans who visit Pakistan. We are also working with SriLankan Airlines and tour operators here to prepare tour packages to Pakistan,” said Akhthar.
They are to concentrate in the areas of leisure trips, adventure tourism and sports tourism. Akthar explained that tour packages involving these activities would also be tailored around the ideal season to visit the country.
“We were told that Sri Lankans would be interested in seeing snow. So we are at present promoting visits to the K2 Mountain,” explained Akthar whose wife, Uzbugy Khan, had scaled the Minglig Sar Mountain at an altitude of 6050m in October last year.
In addition, they would also have a special focus on increasing religious tourism into the country where people will be taken on the Buddhist circuit to visit ancient Buddhist sites. It would also touch on the Indus Civilizations of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
Aisha Khan, the Deputy Director of Crafts and Culture at the Walled City of Lahore Authority in the Government of Punjab who accompanied Akhthar on the tour, noted that at present, most visits to Pakistan from Sri Lanka were on business or official purposes and that few travelled there on leisure due to various misconceptions about the country.
“We have not had any incidents with foreigners. And it is safe to travel. Local authorities will also provide police escorts to all tourists,” she assured.
The Pakistanis, during their visit, also met 20 Sri Lankan tour operators and they are expected to visit Pakistan soon to check on conditions there and ways in which travel could be promoted between the two countries. The Sri Lankan Cricket team visited Lahore, so you should know that it is safe and we have a lot to offer, said Khan as Pakistan opens its doors and strives to promote itself a ‘must visit’ place in South Asia.
