SLFP May Day rally at Getambe

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party would hold its May Day Rally at Gatambe in Kandy by demonstrating its strength despite attempts to divide it by several groups Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry auditorium.
He also said that the Joint Opposition that attempted to divide the party is becoming weaker.
“The failure of the JO was reflected at the Habaraduwa rally that was held recently”, Minister Weerakkody said.
“There was only 5000 to 6000 thousand people. The rally could not attract even 10 percent of the SLFPers in Habaraduwa. It is a pathetic situation and it’s failure affects both the JO and SLFP.” He also said that they expect more and more rallies be organized by JO on monthly basis so that the fall of the JO could be visible clearly.
He also said that it was questionable if the JO had any pact with some other parties to divide the SLFP.
“During the rally, the JO criticized only the SLFP and not the UNP. On the other hand the UNP also had not criticized the JO rally in Habaraduwa,” Minister Weerakkody said however the UNP too would be pleased to see the SLFP being divided .
He also said that the people expect the SLFP and JO to join together and work for the country.
