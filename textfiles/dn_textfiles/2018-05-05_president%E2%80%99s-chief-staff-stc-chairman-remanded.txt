President’s Chief of Staff, STC Chairman remanded

President’s Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake who were arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) last Thursday were remanded by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara until May 9.
They were taken into the custody by CIABOC while allegedly accepting the bribe in a hotel in Colombo and later produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe.
According to CIABOC officials, I.H.K. Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory.
Mahanama had allegedly attended to this matter of settling the transaction some time back while he was the Land Ministry Secretary. However the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was high and demanded to reduce it. Within several weeks, Mahanama had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million.
Thereafter, the Indian investor had made a complaint before the CIABOC and the two suspects were arrested by Bribery Commission officials in the car park of a leading hotel in Colombo on Thursday evening.
