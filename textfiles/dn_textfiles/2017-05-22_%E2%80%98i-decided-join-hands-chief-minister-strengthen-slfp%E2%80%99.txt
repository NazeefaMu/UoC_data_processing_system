‘I decided to join hands with Chief Minister to strengthen SLFP’

Newly appointed Irrigation, Lands, Rural Development and Women Affairs Minister of the North Central Provincial Council Sarath Ilangasinghe said he decided to accept the portfolio and join hands with the Chief Minister in order to strengthen the SLFP and prevent any break up in the party.
He debunked allegations that he was bought over for Rs. 20 million and said he is ready to declare his financial assets giving details of his own and family members' bank accounts at any public debate to disprove these allegations.
Addressing a meeting held at Eppawela, Provincial Minister Ilangasinghe said some people would be baffled to see him in a ministerial position after being a leading member of the Joint Opposition group. He said he was a person who tried hard to resolve the dispute occurred in the North Central Provincial Council. The Chief Minister and the Council Ministers as members of the SLFP had always worked for SLFP supporters.
"If there had been any change in the power equation in the North Central Provincial Council, SLFP supporters in the province would have been left high and dry unable to obtain any service from the Council. I pointed out this to other rebels in the council, but they failed to accept the reality," he said.
Therefore he discussed this with another member and decided to accept the portfolio to prevent any change in the power equation in the council which would have been detrimental to SLFP supporters, he said.
