Y.O.U?

The youth decide the the future of a country. Today it is a struggle to fit into the world right out of your cocoon but young activists are joining hands all over the island, to bring about innovative ideas, team spirit and a sense of unity!
On September 22 another such youth activist forum came into existence. The official launch of the newest youth activist forum, 'Youth Outreach Union' was held at the Royal College Union Skills Centre.
The launch initiated the inaugural activist effort of a movement aiming towards creating awareness among the public regarding the growing threats of climate change and how Sri Lanka can work on climate change mitigation through active social participation of the community.
A press briefing officially introduced the motives and the root cause of the initiative as well as the functional standpoints of the organization.
The briefing followed a panel discussion, with the presence of well-known young activists- and guest participations from the wildlife film maker/ researcher Taya F. Diaz, Indi Samarajiva- entrepreneur and Director at Yamu.lk as well as a representative from the Environmental Foundation, Sashini Gomez- Project Manager at International Organization for Migration, as well as Shayani Weerasinghe as a representative of Environmental Foundation as panelists.
The Vision of The Youth Outreach Union is to help understand and then make aware about climate issues that affect the world and Sri Lanka.
Their Mission is three-fold;
To understand how the general public reacts and views about climate change.
To develop an expert panel of activists and help make aware about climate issues that affect Sri Lanka, in contrast to the public opinion.
To use the expert panel address issues raised by the public.
The topics highlighted in the discussion were youth activism, environmental hazards and overcoming them as well as the youth and the community responsibility in initiating a positive change.
The climate change awareness campaign revolved around four focal points: promotion of public transportation, initiation of an attitudinal change towards waste management, encouragement of energy star appliances as well as recognition of biogas as a game changer in the energy crisis. The young activists of Youth Outreach Union had already launched a successful social media campaign related to the matter and had also reached out to the public with their innovative surveys and video graphic finesse, which saw a collection of valuable ideas and food for thought, that had originated from the grass root level of the society. Youth Outreach Union has partnered with South Asian Youth Environmental Network (SAYEN) alongside Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA). The initiative is in line with the United Nations Environmental Program as an empowerment for young environmental activists.
Youth Outreach Union is a convergence of young academics who specialize in an array of fields. They had joined hands as a part of the fulfillment of their social responsibility as agents of a positive social change towards the betterment of the society and the world.
According to Jedeshkeran Chandrasegaran, the founder of Y.O.U, "Climate change is a major concern in the 21st century that has triggered due to various reasons. As an effort to direct the youth towards environmental protection and mitigation South Asian Youth Environment Network (SAYEN) has initiated the youth activist forum that spans for a period of two months and the project is bolstered by the participation of a group of youth activists representing various sectors including academics, journalism, social media activism, as well as the NGO sector. The local facilitating partner for the project would be Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA)."
