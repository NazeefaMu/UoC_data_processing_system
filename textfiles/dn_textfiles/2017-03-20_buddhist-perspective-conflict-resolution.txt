Buddhist perspective to conflict resolution

Conflict resolution is a popular subject of discussion in the world today. It is a topic widely discussed in the university as well as among intellectuals. Sources and examples in field are mainly found in the Western world.
During the civil war in Sri Lanka and during communal conflicts, international peacemakers or aids suppliers brought examples from the West. However, many have forgotten that Sri Lanka is a country which has a long history with a Buddhist way of life that lasted 2,500 years and more. Recalling this, Rev. Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi, born and bred on Sri Lankan soil, and having received higher education in Sri Lanka, discusses conflict resolution methods by referring to the "Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories" in his book ‘Pansiya Panas Jathaka Potha saha Gatum Nirakaranaya.’ Rev. Fr., thus, has made us proud.
Being a son of a Buddhist father and a Christian mother, he has natural claim by birth to embrace religious co-existence. He obtained his first degree from Peradeniya University, Master of Arts and PhD from Kelaniya University, and Theological Degree from Serampo College in India. I recognized him as an intellectual and analyst of the book "Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories." He is the only Christian Father in Sri Lanka who has done a study of the book in a sociological angle for his PhD. Most intellectuals are confined to their subject of academic study, but Father Hettiarachchi is different, as he does not confine himself to only books. He stood neck-and-neck with me and other monks, and worked together to see an end to the war during that dark period of three decades.
Ignoring one’s own conveniences and going through thick forests of Vavuniya and visiting other places such as Madu Church, Malavi, LTTE Headquarters in Kilinochchi, and University of Jaffna, we, together, conducted discussions with the army personnel with the prime aim of stopping bloodshed among our people and to create a peaceful country for all. During the last few days of the war, Rev. Fr. Hettiarchchi and I, together, got into a military tank and proceeded to the battlefield to provide moral support to the three forces, risking our lives.
In writing his book titled “The Book of Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories and Conflict Resolution,” it is clear that the writer has obtained all necessary material from books and other relevant sources as well as from life experiences, which, in my view, have contributed to the success of this creative work. This is the first time that a Sri Lankan Christian Father has written a sociological book on the book of “Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories,” but there is something more about this. My friend, Sirisumana Godage, invited Rev. Fr. Hettiarachchi to launch this book for a special reason.
Father Sarath Hettiarachchi is at present, suffering from a blood cancer disease called Multiple Myeloma. According to medical advice, this is incurable, and the cost of medicine and treatment is high. However, he attended to all matters pertaining to the book by himself while either being bedridden or hospitalized, fighting all kinds of aches and pains, and bearing them up fearlessly and courageously.
When he was working hard to develop religious co-existing among people, he had to suffer immensely. Many criticized him and caused him a lot of problems. A majority of them belongs to the same faith as his. Yet he had enough courage to face such attacks although his younger sister also became a victim to a train bomb. He continued to carry out discussions with the LTTE leaders for peace because he had such intrinsic courage within him.
From his sickbed, he completed his book. It will be launched as a Godage Publication on March 31, at 4.30 pm, at the Colombo Public Library Auditorium. The revenue earned from this book will be used to meet the medical expenses of Rev. Fr. Hettiarachchi. Political leaders, artists, ambassadors, and a large number of intellectuals are expected to attend this function.
We invite all friends of Rev. Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi, belonging to all faiths, to be present at Colombo Public Library Auditorium on March 31, at 4.15 pm. Further information can be obtained by calling 071-8220910 or 071-0907801. Let us wish Rev Father Sarath Hettiarachchi, ‘Theruwan Saranai’.
