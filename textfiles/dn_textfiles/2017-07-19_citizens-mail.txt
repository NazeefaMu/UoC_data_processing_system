Citizens' Mail

Importance of the new Taxation Bill
A new Taxation Bill will be presented to the Parliament within next two months. State Minister Eran Wickremaratne mentioned that action would be taken to reduce and completely abolish several taxes gradually over a period of time. Everybody will remember that in 1977 also the same undertaking was given, but no action took place in this regard in the past 40 years.
Whether the New Taxation Bill would be passed before end of September 2017 is not certain.
In the meantime the next Budget Proposals will be announced in November 2017 which may contain certain changes which may not be implemented in proper time frame, as experienced in the past two years.
Investment Planning and Tax Planning which are very important for development cannot be successfully made unless taxation policy is maintained in a uniform manner. Uncertainty and frequent changes would result, in frustration and investor resistance.
Hope the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Professionals, Trade Chambers would advise Government on proper and timely implementation of the laws.
