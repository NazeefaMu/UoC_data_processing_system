Increase in education, health budgets

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake will present the new government's maiden budget to Parliament on November 20, the Government Information Department said.
Minister Karunanayake had earlier told the media that the budget proposals will provide a host of concessions to the public.
The minister had said that the budget will increase the expenditure for education and the health sector in a significant way. Karunanayake said the proposals will be formulated while taking into considerations the opinions of various sectors.
The Ministry of Finance last month requested the public and the private sector institutions to submit proposals for inclusion in the proposed budget for 2016.
