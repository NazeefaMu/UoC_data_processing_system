Programme to free workplaces from garbage

The programme, ‘a workplace free of garbage,’ under the concept of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha was initiated at the Ministry premises on July 14.
The aim of the programme is to maintain workplaces with favourable environments to overcome the garbage crisis and to eliminate the prevailing dengue epidemic. All the members of the ministry engaged in this programme. They cleaned the premises and disposed waste properly after segregating them.
According to the information received from the National Task Force Unit established by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, many workplaces in urban areas have been found with dengue mosquito breeding places. Therefore, Minister Faiszer Musthapha initiated this programme to make all government and non-government work places dengue free.
This was initiated as a pilot project and will be implemented as a national programme immediately.
