Combating kidney disease: New water filter to save annual health cost

A new water filter manufactured by Life Saver was introduced at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
Water samples collected from Beira Lake was purified within a few minutes with this British-made filter costing only 50 cents to purify water for four persons. It will help reduce the dumping of thousands of empty water bottles to the environment, the Finance Ministry said in a release. “The annual budget generally allocates Rs. 124 billion for health expenditure and funds could be reduced by providing drinking water for the people,” said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the event to introduce the filter. The Minister said introducing a proper mechanism to supply pure drinking water would solve several health problems including kidney disease among people.
“We planned this programme targeting residents of the Colombo North area as they have been facing a severe drinking water problem. When we searched for a prospective stakeholder, we came across this company. A programme has been initiated under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to eradicate kidney disease,” he said.
One advantage is that the cost to provide drinking water for the people will reduce and the other is that the cost for annual health will decline as diseases will decline. The government can reduce its annual cost on health - Rs.124 billion - to a considerable extent,” the minister said. The filter is currently used in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Lebanon and Colombia. Life Saving Regional Manager Stuart Elson and local agent Dareen Weerasinghe were present.
