People’s power helped defeat pseudo Govt. - Ravi

The UNP could not provide benefits to its party supporters because it practised “Yahapalana’ ideals within the party unlike other sections which engaged in politics.
October 26 created a black scar for democracy in the country. But the people’s power enabled them to restore the Ranil Wickremesinghe government in power defeating the pseudo government.
We hope to make use of this opportunity to bring about massive development hitherto unprecedented in the country Power and Renewable Energy and Enterprise Development Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at Summitpura grounds, Mattakuliya on December 28.
Minister Karunanayake who pointed out that the rupee had rapidly depreciated added that it should not be allowed to depreciate since a strong government was back in power.
“We consider it our prime duty to bring down the cost of living for the benefit of the common masses,” he said.
Karunanayake said material and human development should go hand in hand in developing the country. The future generation was the country’s most valuable asset and it should be nurtured in the education and mental spheres.
The minister distributed a stock of exercise books and educational equipment among a group of 1,000 students belonging to low income families.
