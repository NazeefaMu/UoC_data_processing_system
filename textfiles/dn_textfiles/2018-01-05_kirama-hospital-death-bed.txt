Kirama hospital on death bed

The Kirama divisional hospital is on its death bed. About 400 patients arrive at the OPD at this hospital and there are about sixty inmates at this hospital. There is an acute shortage of doctors nurses and minor staff at this hospital.
According to the sources at this hospital, there is no place to keep the dead bodies. The dead bodies have to be kept in the wards where patients are, until they are removed by the kith and kin.
The well from which drinking water is pumped to the hospital remain polluted. There are no facilities for the performance of post postmortems and as such, dead bodies have to be transferred to Katuwana and Walasmulla hospitals. The hospital has no proper kitchen and cooking is being done in a small hut that is similar to a cattle shed.
This hospital has remained as a central unit. But as of now, as a divisional hospital it needs a place to keep the dead bodies.
Plans are under way to allocate funds this year to set up a mortuary and a kitchen from the World Bank funds.
There aren't enough pharmacists and dispensers at this hospital presently.
