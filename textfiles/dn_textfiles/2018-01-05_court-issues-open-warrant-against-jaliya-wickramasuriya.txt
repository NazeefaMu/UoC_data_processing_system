Court issues open warrant against Jaliya Wickramasuriya

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued an open warrant to arrest former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for failing to appear before Court.
The FCID filed a B report at the Fort Magistrate’s Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the suspect was not present in Court.
The Court was informed through his counsel that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but has failed to return before the due date.
