Galle Dialogue 2018:
International maritime confab in Colombo on Oct. 22

The annual international maritime conference ‘Galle Dialogue 2018’ will be held on October 22–23 at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
The theme of this year’s conference is ‘Synergizing for Collaboration in Maritime Management’. The conference will be held this year for the eighth consecutive year.
President Maithripala Sirisena will be the chief guest and will make the opening address.
Galle Dialogue 2018 is being organised by the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) under the auspices of the Defence Ministry, SLN Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva said. Maritime partners from 50 countries and 17 international organisations are expected to attend the conference.
Galle Dialogue 2018 expects 137 foreign participants, including three navy chiefs to attend, Rear Admiral Silva said.
The dialogue will be an ideal platform to discuss common issues pertinent to the navies around the world and share experiences, he said.
The conference paves the way for discussion of proper utilisation of resources, exploitation of resources in the best interests of every nation, regional security, the economic sustainability of the country and contribution to world peace, and the significance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral partnerships among countries.
Besides, the conference will give an opportunity for the strengthening of the security in our seas and partnering with regional and extra-regional navies, Rear Admiral Silva said.
“It is expected that the conference will create a unique platform for participants to discuss ways and means to augment a collaborative managerial framework with better understanding and sharing opportunities,” he said.
