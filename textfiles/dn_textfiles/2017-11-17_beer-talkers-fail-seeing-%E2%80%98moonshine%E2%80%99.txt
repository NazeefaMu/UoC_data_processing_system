Beer talkers fail seeing ‘moonshine’

Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama yesterday said the people who talk about beer fail to see”moonshine” all over villages.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said moonshine retailers had closely connected with politicians and the Police.
“We will see many who involved in moonshine business receiving nomination in the future. When elections are held at electoral level, anti social elements in villages will become prominent figures,” he said. He said worldwide lower taxes apply on liquor with less alcohol volume and the same method was applied for beer though this budget.
