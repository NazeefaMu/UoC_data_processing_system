Australia’s Callum Ferguson follows up his 192 with 159 for Worcester

LONDON, Sunday - Worcestershire batsman Callum Ferguson continued his extraordinary One-Day Cup form as his 159 helped his side beat Northants to strengthen their qualification chances.
Ferguson’s unbeaten century at New Road followed Tuesday’s 192 on his debut. The Australian shared a club-record second-wicket stand of 239 with Joe Clarke (122) in the hosts’ 348-5. Rob Newton (61) and Adam Rossington (63) starred in the chase, but Northants were all out for 314.
Worcestershire are now level on points with Warwickshire at the top of the north table, ahead of the two rivals meeting at Edgbaston in Thursday’s day-night final group fixture. Victory for either would guarantee a place in the knockout stages although, if Yorkshire lose to Lancashire at Old Trafford on Tuesday, both will already be through.
Surrey beat Middlesex by five wickets to keep their slim hopes of reaching the knockout stages alive.
Ben Foakes (86) and Ollie Pope (57 not out) marshalled the visitors’ chase of 235 at Lord’s, sharing a partnership of 98 for the fifth wicket.
Middlesex stuttered throughout their innings after electing to bat first as they were dismissed for just 234. Tom Curran (4-33) claimed four wickets for a second successive List A game as opener Paul Stirling (67) top scored.
Hampshire have sealed a place in the knockout stages after a four-wicket victory over Glamorgan at Swansea.
Hampshire reached 229-6 despite a mid-innings stutter, thanks to an unbeaten seventh-wicket stand of 85 between Brad Taylor (54) and Gareth Berg (52).
Berg also struck early with the ball, taking 3-46 in Glamorgan’s 227 all out. Colin Ingram top scored with 64, but spinners Mason Crane (4-46) and Brad Taylor (2-51) claimed regular wickets. Warwickshire boosted their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages with a thumping nine-wicket win against Leicestershire at Edgbaston. Batting first, Leicestershire were bowled out for 207 as Olly Stone and Aaron Thomason both took three wickets.
Mark Cosgrove (60) and Colin Ackermann (57) were the only batsmen to make an impression for the visitors.Jonathan Trott’s 102 not out and Sam Hain’s unbeaten 69 took Warwickshire to 211-1 with 12.2 overs to spare. Former England batsman Trott has now scored two centuries in three days, following his innings of 100 in the win over Durham on Friday.
Essex kept alive their chances of reaching the knockout stages and ended those of Sussex with a four-wicket win at Eastbourne.
Tom Westley (88) and Adam Wheater (60) made half-centuries as Essex chased a target of 282 with 12 balls to spare.
Earlier, Laurie Evans’ 107 not out off 117 balls along with Jofra Archer’s unbeaten 33 off 18 balls in the closing overs pushed Sussex up to 281-7.
