President, PM to illuminate Mihintale Aloka Pooja today

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will switch on the Poson illuminations at Mihintale at 6 pm today at a ceremony at the Mihintale Medamaluwa to mark the second day of the Lake House ‘Mihintale Aloka Pooja’ held for the 56th time this year.
The ‘Mihintale Aloka Pooja’ is organised annually by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (Lake House) since 1962 to mark Poson Poya Day, a day of great historical and religious significance to Buddhists in Sri Lanka.
This year the ‘Aloka Pooja’ is jointly sponsored by the CEB, Dialog and National Savings Bank. (see page 05)
