‘No truth in accusation’

Acting Health Services Director General Dr.J.M.W.J.Bandara said that there is no truth in the accusation made in connection with the Health Ministry not collecting and announcing statistics on dengue. The Ministry collects data as usual and also publishes them.
But the doctors, nurses and all the other health staff involved in data collection are very busy with treating dengue patients and taking care of patient management. Therefore, there is a small delay in receiving data from various parts of the country.
According to Health Ministry Dengue Control Unit Community Physician Dr.Preshila Samaraweera, a total of 80,203 dengue patients and 227 deague deaths had been reported from all parts of the country by July 6, Wednesday.
