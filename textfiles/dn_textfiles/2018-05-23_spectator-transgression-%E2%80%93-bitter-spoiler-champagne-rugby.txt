Spectator transgression – bitter spoiler of champagne rugby

In full contact rugby, played at the level of intensity seen in present day schools rugby, the high run of adrenaline amongst those who battle it out in the middle is understandable. But what one cannot fathom is the moronic behaviour of senseless adults who let go of their emotions simply for not being able to satisfy their egoistic need of tasting victory, and ridiculously, at the cost of sweat, blood and effort of schoolboys, playing for the glory of the institutions they represent.
Last weekend we witnessed what most described as the best game of the current school’s rugby season, thus far.
The game between Royal College, one of the two title contenders in this year’s league championship, and Wesley College a clear underdog who almost turned tables on the favourites, was an enthralling seventy-minute affair. Whilst 30 young lads gave the rugby loving public their monies worth, a section of the crowd was in no mood to surrender their egos to the efforts of those boys whose bodies were taking a beating in their quest for victory.
Latter part of the second half of this captivating rugby match saw a 15-minute stoppage. What was appalling to know was why the game was stopped. It is learnt that the Wesley College supporters threatened one of the touch judges. What on earth do these morons think of themselves, to feel capable of taking someone’s life for not assisting the officiating referee to make decisions that are to their liking! In that side of the pavilion where this incident took place, most of the Wesley supporters had jumped out of the pavilion onto the field, which was a recipe for disaster. Much to the dismay of all, organizers without getting them back behind the fences, placed Wesley prefects in front of these inebriated and adrenaline high adults. To be fair by referee Dinka Peiris, he had no option but to stop the game until he and his fellow officials and the players could be assured of their lives, and so he did.
Most who were witness to the gestures and expressions of the foreign coach of Wesley College thought they didn’t help the situation either. Being a coach, one needs to be exemplary, and gesturing your own disenchantment in front of an agitated set of unruly supporters, could be nothing less than incitement.
Resumption of play after the adult psychopathic behavior saw Wesleyites smelling blood giving it their all and Royalists fighting back to save their reputation and to keep the unblemished record intact. At the end Reid Avenue boys felt a sigh of relief savoring victory with a wafer thin margin of a single point. The game ended and as often seen, there were the victor and the vanquished. The team that won in this instance was more relieved than in a mood to celebrate, and the vanquished surely held their heads high, but was no doubt disappointed that they lost a golden opportunity of creating what would have been the biggest upset of the season.
Match organizers and the handful of police officers on duty, anticipating some form of aggression from the boisterous Wesley supporters, escorted the referee and the rest of the match officials to safety. Whilst the two sets of players resigned to two far corners of the field for their warm downs, what transpired in front of the main pavilion at CR & FC grounds, right in front of the heads of the two schools, was horrifying.
A bunch of Wesley College supporters, led by an ex-Wesley first XV rugby player from the 2017 team and the CR & FC team, started mercilessly assaulting a Royalist, with plastic chairs, tables and whatever else they could lay their hands on. It was later found that the victim was Royal’s league championship title winning captain of 2017, Ovin Askey. Thereafter a section of Royal College supporters, as they usually do after every game, walked towards their much-loved team isolated in a corner of the grounds for their routine cheer, and quite predictably crossed paths with the agitated Wesleyites, and for a moment all hell broke loose.
In a country where club rugby is playing second fiddle to school’s rugby, the adults who enjoy watching these kids play the game for the love of it and for the honor of their schools should make a conscious decision.
If their emotions cannot be controlled, they should decide to watch the game on TV in the comfort of their homes, or to get to the venue, enjoy the game and behave as responsible adults. More importantly in the future, the host schools will need to assess and provide adequate security and crowd control measures.
This is an area that the school’s rugby authorities will have to introduce new regulations and guidelines that will ensure necessary measures and safeguards are in place for the safety of players, officials and spectators. It is a must, to further the game of rugby in Sri Lanka.
