Super Fashion to open mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja-Ela

Super Fashion Panadura will be opening two mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja-Ela this year and will be launching their own online delivery arm. The retail store would also be celebrating their seventh anniversary in May.
The General Manger, Chathura Hathurusinghe, M. Jayatissa said that Super Fashion Panadura, was built by famed educationist, Dudley Peiris on a 15 perch abandoned land opposite the Panadura Police station in 2007 and its initial plan was to offer the building on rent. “However the eldest son, Janaka (current Managing Director), saw the vacuum for a quality Mega cloth store in Panadura and decided to create Super Fashion Panadura taking a calculated risk.” 
Merchandise were imported from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, China and India and local items too were on sale and Super Fashion Panadura became an instant success.
“Due to this phenomenal growth, three years after its operation we added two additional floors and increased the permanent staff carder to 125.”
He however said that Sri Lankan suppliers are very slow in adopting to change, creating new designs and innovation this is the reason they still import.”
“We have many CSR activities targeting our employees and also the public. We also host and an annual staff get-together where our suppliers too are recognized and this year the event will be held on May 1, at Blue Water Wadduwa”.
Outlining their plans for 2018 he said that they will be opening two mega stores in Piliyandala and Ja Ela this year. “Currently we offer online purchases and soon we would be creating a special unit for free delivery within 40 km by our own staff.”
