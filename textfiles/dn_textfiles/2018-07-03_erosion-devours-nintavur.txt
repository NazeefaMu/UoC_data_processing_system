Erosion devours Nintavur

The coastline in Nintavur in the Ampara District is gradually being eroded.
People in Nintavur depend on fishing and agriculture for their livelihood. Coconut gardens, buildings, and houses are being destroyed day by day. Farming lands, especially for cattle farming and paddy and other crops, are filled with sea water.
The people of this area want relevant authorities to visit the places where erosion is being experienced to take measures to check this phenomenon.
People say that the construction of the Oluvil Harbour is the main cause for the level of erosion that is taking place.
