The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday sought the Supreme Court’s permission to intervene into the Appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) challenging the judgment of Court of Appeal to register a student of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
When the appeal was taken up before a three-judge-bench comprising Justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Sisira de Abrew and Anil Goonaratne. The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and several medical students sought the court’s permission to intervene into the appeal.

However, President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera appearing for the respondent-petitioner raised objections regarding the request made by the GMOA citing that the GMOA is not a party to be heard as it is a trade union. “There is no provisions in the laws intervene into the appeal by GMOA,” Silva added.
