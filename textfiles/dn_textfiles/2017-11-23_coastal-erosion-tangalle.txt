Coastal erosion in Tangalle

Several areas in Medaketiya, Tangalle, are undergoing coastal erosion. A vast stretch of the beach is being washed into the sea, causing damage to cultivations, hotel buildings, and access roads.
Residents and hotel owners urge the Coast Conservation Department to to lay boulders and build a breakwater at the beach as a solution to this burning problem.
Residents said that the coastal erosion worsened with the setting up of hotel buildings at an alarming rate.
