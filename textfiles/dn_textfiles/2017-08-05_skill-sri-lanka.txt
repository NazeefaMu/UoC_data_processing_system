Skill up Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has always prioritised youths, placing them at the heart of development. Youth skills development has been identified as an important aspect in reducing youth unemployment.
Although youth unemployment rate in the country has decreased to 18.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017 from 21 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, a critical need for marketable skills is reflected in the labour market.

Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training 
Chandima Weerakkody
To change Sri Lanka’s perception of skilled careers, an innovative National Mass Media Campaign ‘Ekata/Onraa’ was launched on Tuesday in Colombo with the participation of a variety of speakers and personalities.
The campaign was launched under the banner `Skill Up Sri Lanka’ and is aimed at addressing the urgent issue of skilled labour shortages in some of the growing sectors of Sri Lankan economy. It will raise awareness about the value and importance of careers in these sectors.
It is an open platform through which key stakeholders are encouraged to join to ensure that the message is spread throughout the country. The campaign `Ekata/Onraa’ targets four sectors including Lite Engineering and Automotive, Construction, Hospitality and Tourism and Information Communication and Technology.
It hopes to increase the number of young men and women, including People with Disabilities (PWDs) and youth affected by war, entering the labour market in these strategic growth industries. It will also raise awareness of current opportunities, to raise level of dignity of labour in the sectors as well as to inspire and create excitement the future of Sri Lanka and its young men and women.
Challenge
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said it was a challenge to match the quality qualified employees to the requirements in the labour market.
“The ministry is ready to undertake the challenge. Everyone is keen about their children. Parents aspire to give the best to their children. Our target is also to create trained skilled techno savvy people. Although youth is keen on gaining vocational training, the chances are limited. The intake should be expanded accommodating more students,” he said.
Minister Weerakkody said several steps were taken to address the mismatch of skills in the labour market.
“It is important to generate greater awareness of technical, vocational education and training and develop other skills relevant to local and global economies. Peoples’ attitude towards some careers should be changed. The ministry will see that all vocational careers are looked at with dignity. We will maintain the international standards, bring in the unique uniforms and councils will be established to give recognition to these careers. It is expected that it would contribute to reducing unemployment and underemployment among the youth in Sri Lanka. All stakeholders should work together to achieve this goal,” he said.
The Minister pointed out that a skills passport was launched by the ministry to make Sri Lankan youth accepted anywhere in the globe. The passport will hold the employee’s level of vocational training, language proficiency and previous experience which will make Sri Lankan youth internationally recognized.
On entering the job market, young persons face difficult situations, either due to skills mismatch between what they have learned and what kinds of jobs are available. Sri Lanka’s labour market also reflects such skills mismatches. Jobs available are either unattractive to youth due to the precarious nature of employment, perceptions of youth about the occupation, stigma attached to the particular occupation or sector of employment, or due to the fact that the labour market opportunities simply do not meet their aspirations. This is more marked among educated youth who have often secured a qualification without relevant work experience. It is perhaps better articulated as a misunderstanding of the demands of the world of work.
Hence, once qualified they raise the bar of their goals, soon to be disappointed and disillusioned. Queuing for a ‘good job’ is another issue of educated youth in the labour market. Much of this happens with the acquiescence of parents who invariably influence the aspirations of their children, encouraging them to await that ideal job.
Youth seem to lack the confidence to experiment in the world of work or move out of their comfort zones and use their academic qualifications to innovate. On the other hand, the lesser qualified are perhaps more likely to ‘take a chance’ in the world of work, moving out earlier and ultimately gaining more and much needed experience along the way. The more qualified being left behind therefore, idle and unable to realise their full potential.
Many qualified youth in Sri Lanka tend to possess the ‘technical skills’ or appropriate academic qualification for a job but lack the soft skills to convert knowledge into a profession. English is often taught as a subject rather than as a skill for the world of work. This is more often an obstacle to many educated rural youth to secure jobs particularly in the private sector where businesses engage with the global community and demand the knowledge of a ‘global’ language. Chairman, Diesel and Motor Engineering Plc,
Ranjith Pandithage speaking at the occasion said auto mobile industry, which is one of the fastest growing industries at present, lacks professionals.
“We need painters, welders and mechanics. If Sri Lankan youth do not possess these skills, we have to get skilled labour from other countries. Parents should not aspire only to create professional like doctors and lawyers out of their children, but they should be exposed to skills that are in demand,” he said.
Automobile service
“DIMO was the first to tap North after the conclusion of the conflict. We train many young persons in our automobile school. DIMO offers a comprehensive training on automobile service, maintenance and repair. They are great opportunities and youth can yield better career prospects and earn a higher income,” Pandithage said.
Speaking on the prospects prevailing in the Information Communication and Technology industry, President, Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka, Dr Kithsiri Manchanayaka said today’s youth have a responsibility to assist the ICT industry.
“The skills the youth possess are not adequate and some skills are not employable. There is a mismatch between the skills and the requirement of the industry. There is a huge potential. We are targeting five billion dollar exports in 2020 which means there will be about 200,000 opportunities available. ICT is one of the fastest growing industries which account up to 1.2 billion dollars exports at present," he said.
"Youth need to upgrade their skills to fill up the positions that would be available with the growth of the industry in future,” he said.
Manager Operations, Jetwing Hotels, Dmitri Cooray encouraged youth to enter the tourism and hospitality industry casting aside prejudices that prevail in society about the industry. He pointed out that Jetwing hotels have been training youth around the country making them relevant with the technological and social changes.
The initial investment of this campaign was made by the Government of Canada through World University Service of Canada (WUSC) – a Canadian education development agency that has had a long standing and reputable presence in Sri Lanka since 1989. As one of the largest Canadian agencies in Sri Lanka, the WUSC is active throughout the country with a focus on strengthening the vocational training sector, as well as reducing poverty and social exclusion in plantation communities.
The High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Shelley Whiting stressed the importance of vocational training.
“A vocational job offers good opportunities and vocational training creates careers that will make more people involved in the economic sector. Quality education and training will improve their relevance to labour market needs. Business community should create awareness of the importance of vocational training,” Whiting said.
She added that the Canadian Government has assisted in providing vocational training to many young persons around the country including Mulativ, Matara, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Killinochchi and Jaffna.
Whiting said social media plays a vital role in getting the message across to the youth scattered in the country. Social marketing, a dynamic approach to social change which uses commercial marketing tactics to promote social goods that can benefit the entire community will be used to address the issue of limited recognition of the value of vocational skills and careers. The social marketing campaign will incorporate television, radio, print and digital media targeting to reach at least 8.4 million people in Sri Lanka. In addition to the media campaign community engagement activities will take place reinforcing the values of vocational training and upgrading the skills in some of the fastest growing industries in the country.
Finally, all stake holders in public and the private sector need to work closely to reduce skills mismatches. It is important for companies and employers’ organizations to take the initiative and collaborate with educational and vocational training institutions while making sure that during education and training, youth, particularly those from marginalized locations and disadvantaged communities have equal opportunities to gain work experience, via internships, on-the-job training, and other schemes.
