‘Bon Odori’ festival at Moor’s Club ground on Saturday

Bon Odori, a traditional Japanese summer festival organised jointly by the Japanese embassy in Colombo and several other stakeholders will be held at the Moor’s Club ground in Colombo on Saturday (15) evening.
With the word ‘Bon’ meaning welcoming ancestors’ souls and holding a memorial service for the souls, Bon Odori is a traditional summer holiday to honour the spirits of one’s deceased ancestors where it later evolved into a family reunion holiday during which people return to their hometowns and visit their ancestors’ graves.
This custom has been popular in Japan for over 500 years and people traditionally organise Bon Odori in several communities all over Japan in the summer.
The style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region where each region has its own local Bon Odori dancing to traditional Japanese music, while enjoying various Japanese sweetmeats and assortment of snacks.
The music played is cheerful to welcome the ancestors’ souls into a happy environment and the ‘Bon Dance’ is held at night with the belief that the ancestors’ souls come in the night.
Each year, Bon Odori gives visitors a true glimpse to the exuberance and high spirits of the duty bounded Japanese community.
The events will be attended by the expatriate Japanese community in Colombo, the diplomatic corps and other invitees.
