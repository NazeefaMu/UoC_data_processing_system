CCC-SLPA open 2015-16 domestic season today

The 2015-16 domestic season gets underway today with CCC hosting Sri Lanka Ports Authority SC at Maitland Crescent in the opening match of the AIA Premier limited-over tournament.
This is the only match for the day as the rest of the 14 clubs participating will be in action over the weekend on Saturday and Sunday.
Colts will begin their campaign to defend the title they won last season by hosting NCC at Havelock Park tomorrow in a game that should draw a big crowd. There are five other matches scheduled for the day namely, Tamil Union v Saracens at P Sara Oval, Army SC v SSC at Panagoda, Bloomfield v Badureliya SC at Reid Avenue and Galle CC v Chilaw Marians CC at Galle.
Ragama CC and Moors SC commence their matches on Sunday. Ragama take on Colts at Thurstan grounds and Moors SC will host SSC at Braybrooke Place.
There are five other matches scheduled for this day - Saracens v CCC at De Zoysa Stadium Moratuwa, SLPA SC v Tamil Union at Maitland Crescent, Chilaw Marians CC v Bloomfield at FTZ Katunayake and Badureliya SC v Galle CC at Surrey Village.
The tournament which was to commence last weekend was postponed by a week due to inclement weather. With the Sri Lanka cricket team flying off to New Zealand and seven contracted players being released to play in the Bangladesh Premier League which runs concurrently with the Lankan domestic season the Premier limited-over will be sans several leading cricketers.
The teams play a round-robin phase before the top two sides from each group progress to the semi-finals from which point the matches will be televised live.
