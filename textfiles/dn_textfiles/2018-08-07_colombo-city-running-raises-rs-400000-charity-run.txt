Colombo City Running raises Rs 400,000 in charity run

Colombo City Running (CCR) recently completed a 10km charity run at the Colombo Port that raised Rs. 400,000 for the Army Para Athletic Association.
Held on July 29, 2018, the CCR charity run, in aid of the Army Para Athletic Association, was sold out well in advance, bringing together nearly 400 lucky runners to run 5km and 10km distances inside the port. The race began sharp on time at 6.30 a.m. with 15 Army Para Athletes starting the race, and was immediately followed by those running the 10km and 5km circuits joining in.
A community-based recreational running group, CCR aims to promote a healthy lifestyle through running, while also helping to build a communal spirit and connection through running-related activities. Partners for the event included Asiri Hospitals, Galle Face Hotel, Anim8, Yes FM, RBN and SIS energy drinks. While Vision Care, Zesta Tea, Wurth Sri Lanka and Child Eye Clinic were the sponsors.
The CCR charity run ended with an awards presentation, wherein the three fastest runners in the different categories received their trophies and prizes, in addition to a ceremony where Rs. 400,000 was donated to the Army Para Athletic Association.
