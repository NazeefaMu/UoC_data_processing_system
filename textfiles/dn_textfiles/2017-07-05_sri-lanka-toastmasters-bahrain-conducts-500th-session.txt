Sri Lanka Toastmasters in Bahrain conducts 500th session

The Sri Lanka Club Symposium Toastmasters (SLCST) of the Kingdom of Bahrain conducted the 500th Grand Session of Toastmasters followed by a gala reception.
The Toastmasters Symposium earned the charter in 1998 with only about 25 members. The SLCST became the third Toastmasters Club to be established in Bahrain. Today, there are well over 60 Clubs in Bahrain. The Toastmasters International, known globally as TI, was formed in 1924 in the city of Santa Ana, in the United States. Today, TI has over 15,000 clubs in over 140 countries with a total membership of nearly 350,000 worldwide. The motto of TI is 'Where Leaders are Made'.
At this iconic 500th Grand Session of SLCST, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain, Dr. A. Saj U. Mendis, stated that the Toastmasters Club of Bahrain had contributed, over the years, immensely in moulding as well as nurturing and fostering skills and competencies such as interpersonal, leadership, communication and public speaking and organizational, among others, thus, enabling a number of members of SLCST to compete both nationally and regionally. It was interesting to note that many of the members have vied at regional Toastmaster competitions not only in Bahrain but in other countries as well.
The President of SLCST, Saman Jinadasa, in his opening remarks stated that the Sri Lanka Club Symposium Toastmasters have produced and fashioned over 200 excellent leaders to serve the community be it in Bahrain, the Gulf region or Sri Lanka.
The SLCST often conducts training programs and workshops not only for adults but also for children in order to develop and to expand their communication and leadership skills, among others.
In the recent past, the Sri Lanka Toastmasters Club has invited the World Champion of Public Speaking in the year 2014, Toastmaster Dhananjaya Hettiarachchi to Bahrain to conduct training programmes and workshops, which have significantly benefited and inspired the Sri Lankan expatriates in Bahrain.
For the celebration of the 500th Grand Session of Sri Lanka Club Symposium Toastmasters, the President Jinadasa, Event Chairman Ravi Jayakody and organizers invited Kaishika Rodrigo, one of the top ten finalists of the Toastmasters World Championship to conduct programmes and workshops in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
