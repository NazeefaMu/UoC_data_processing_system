‘Joint opposion instils undue fears in people’

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said the Joint Oppositon (JO) instil undue fears in the people to gain political power.
He was addressing the gathering after distributing compensation to drought-affected people in Angunakolapelessa recently. The State Minister said the government has launched many development projects covering all districts. He said the JO was trying its best to show the people that the economy has tumbled.
“The people know that the government protects the unity, territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the country and strengthens its economy,” he said.
The State Minister said the government took over a debt-ridden economy. The taxes were increased to settle massive loans obtained by the previous regime, he said.
