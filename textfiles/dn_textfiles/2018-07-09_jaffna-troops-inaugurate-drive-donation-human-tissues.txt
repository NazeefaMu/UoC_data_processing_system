Sri Lanka Army troops in Jaffna launched a signature drive for donation of human tissues to mark Poson Poya.
55 Division troops under the Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) on Poson day (27), in cooperation with the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society, conducted a distribution of 1,500 free spectacles among the needy in Point Pedro area.
On the same day, following an initiative of Security Forces – Jaffna Commander Major General Darshana Hettitarachchi, a voluntary signature collection drive for donation of human tissues upon death of the signatory kicked off.
The SFHQ-J expects as many as 10,000 Army personnel to give their consent for donation of human tissues posthumously to the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society, enabling it to collect bone chips, amniotic membranes, and skulls, etc, upon death of the donor.
More than 650 Army troops signed up with the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society to volunteer to donate their human tissues posthumously. SFHQ-J plans to get more than 10,000 signatures of Army personnel serving in the North for this project in the next few months. SF-J Commander Major General Hettiarachchi inaugurated the drive by signing the first form on the occasion.
