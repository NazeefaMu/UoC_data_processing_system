Milk of original writing

The wait is over. The Booker winner for 2018 has been chosen, though not without attacks coming from naysayers. Anna Burns has become the first Northern Irish author to win the Man Booker prize, taking the £50,000 award for Milkman, her timely, Troubles-set novel about a young woman being sexually harassed by a powerful man.
The experimental novel, Burns’s third, is narrated by an unnamed 18-year-old girl, known as “middle sister”, who is being pursued by a much older paramilitary figure, the milkman. It is “incredibly original”, according to the Booker’s chair of judges, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.
“None of us has ever read anything like this before,” said Appiah, announcing the win at a dinner at the Guildhall in London. “Anna Burns’ utterly distinctive voice challenges conventional thinking and form in surprising and immersive prose. It is a story of brutality, sexual encroachment and resistance threaded with mordant humour.”
Written with few paragraph breaks, eschewing character names for descriptions, Appiah admitted that Milkman could be seen as “challenging, but in the way a walk up Snowdon is challenging. It is definitely worth it because the view is terrific when you get to the top,” he said. “I spend my time reading articles in the Journal of Philosophy so by my standards this is not too hard. And it is enormously rewarding if you persist with it. Because of the flow of the language and the fact some of the language is unfamiliar, it is not a light read [but] I think it is going to last.”
As the award was announced, Burns was lost for words. At the press conference afterwards, the 56-year-old author said her job as a novelist was “to show up and be present and attend. It’s a waiting process.” She “just had to wait for my characters to tell me their stories”.
Asked about how she had filled the long gap since her 2002 Orange prize listing for No Bones, she said she had done commercial events and moved houses. What will she do with the money? “I’ll clear my debts and live on what’s left.”
The win makes Burns the first Northern Irish winner – previous Irish winners, including John Banville, Anne Enright and Roddy Doyle, all come from the republic. It also makes her the first female winner since 2013, when Eleanor Catton took the award with The Luminaries.
Burns beat writers including the American literary heavyweight Richard Powers, Daisy Johnson, at 27 the youngest author ever to be shortlisted for the award, and the Canadian writer Esi Edugyan. According to Appiah, the judges, picking from a shortlist that delved into some dark themes, were “unanimous” in their choice of winner – and not influenced by concerns that picking a third American winner in a row could cause controversy.
Burns, who was born in Belfast and now lives in East Sussex, drew on her own experiences growing up in what she called “a place that was rife with violence, distrust and paranoia”. As the milkman presses his advances on the reluctant middle sister, rumours begin that she is having an affair with him. “But I had not been having an affair with the milkman. I did not like the milkman and had been frightened and confused by his pursuing and attempting an affair with me,” Burns’ narrator tells us.
The Booker prize has the power to transform the winner’s career and both the Man Booker Prize and Man Booker International are sponsored by Man Group. Man Group was recognised as a partner who mirrored the quality, integrity and longevity of the Booker Prize. The prize underscores Man Group’s charitable focus on literacy and education as well as the firm’s commitment to excellence and entrepreneurship.
Like last year’s winner, George Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, this is a very vocal book. As Appiah said: “The pleasure is in the way it sounds. I have read it three times and I will listen to it on audiobook when it becomes available. It is a novel that rewards listening as well as reading.” “Rewarding” is, he thinks, the novel’s strong point. It is “deep, subtle, unpolemical and yes, challenging – challenging in the way that walking up Snowdon is challenging but you get a great view at the top.”
The decision, he stressed, was unanimous. Indeed Appiah and his fellow judges – Val McDermid, Leo Robson, Leanne Shapton and Jacqueline Rose – didn’t even come to a vote. They had each prepared a ranked list but they were never called on. “We had a conversation,” said Appiah. “We have developed a capacity to reason together. This was our choice.” The fact that Burns is a woman and that the novel deals with issues thrown into sharp relief by the MeToo# furore did not enter the judges’ reasoning. These are themes that are as old as time and not ones specific to the current moment. And nor does the fact that Milkman shows a divided society mean that it specifically references the Irish border question that is dominating the current Brexit negotiations. This, said Appiah, is a book that uses particularity to highlight the universal and one “that will last because there will always be disturbances in society and there will always be gossip and rumour”.
In the meantime, Burns becomes the 17th female winner in the prize’s history and the first Northern Irish writer to win – indeed, although Milkman is her third novel, this is her first major prize. She will find the experience both bewildering and transformative while her publishers, Faber & Faber, will be swinging from the rafters no less vigorously. It is not uncommon for publishers to press the button for reprints while still at the prize dinner table and before the evening comes to an end.
