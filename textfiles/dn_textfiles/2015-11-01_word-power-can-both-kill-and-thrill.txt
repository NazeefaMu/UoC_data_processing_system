Word power can both kill and thrill!

I was invited to speak recently at a book launch titled ‘Creative Arts Therapies for Autistic Children’ by the famed dramatherapist Ravindra Ranasinha. At the outset may I remind you that I do not consider myself a psychologist or psychiatrist and neither do I profess being one.
You might wonder then why I, a humble journalist, had been dragooned into speaking at an event addressed mostly by erudite specialists in the field. But at the same time may I inform you that both my wife and I are qualified psychological counsellors trained by the International Samaritans in Hong Kong.
Briefly about the author Ravidra Ranasinha: He has been a ministering angel to the wretched of this nation. He has been able to provide his healing touch with those same admirable qualities of love and compassion in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds. The clients he works with have differing needs, from children in the autistic spectrum to older people with dementia, self-harming adolescents, people with histories of sexual and/or physical abuse, those suffering from a mental illness and women with post-natal depression.
Dramatherapy is essentially a creative healing therapy that uses the performing arts to promote psychological, emotional and social change. Dramatherapists are both artists and clinicians and draw on their trainings in theatre/drama and therapy to create methods to engage clients in effecting psychological, emotional and social changes. The therapy makes use of role play, voice work, myth, ritual and storytelling. Movement and objects can also be used expressively without words. It can help increase clients’ self awareness and offer a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal and social problems
The subject I chose to speak about at the launch was a far cry from the discourses of the scholarly experts on the panel who enlightened the packed audience on the programs, therapies and research breakthroughs on the immensely complex subject of Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis or ASD.
Being a wordsmith who has worked internationally I chose to make a discourse on the power of the spoken word. Words as you are doubtlessly aware are really two-edged swords - they can destroy or empower, hurt and heal and even kill. Our words have a tremendous power to bring healing and strength to another person or to hurt in a very deep way. We should never underestimate the power we have to use our words for a positive effect on a person’s life or, in some cases, a lasting negative effect.
How do we comfort the parents of such children who have been through the Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis or ASD. However well-intentioned comments that were meant to comfort can sometimes cut like a knife! Yet what do you say to parents carrying such a cross? Even with the right to be wary you must never bring yourself to say the wrong things. No you don’t blurt out that you are sorry! Because that sometimes makes things worse
You don’t say you’re sorry because these people don’t want to be pitied. And it makes things worse not better. While for many of them the life after diagnosis will be different, it is not less. While their child might miss out on some things, he or she is not considered less. You don’t say to these parents, “He’ll be fine.” ASD is very complex and no two journeys are the same. One parent told me: “Even as a mother of a child with autism I am very hesitant to give advice, as I know my son’s autism is not your child’s autism.”
We should all know better than to say “Really? He seems so normal.” Those phrases do not comfort, they simply insert an opinion when our opinion was not asked. Parents facing an ASD diagnosis do not want unsolicited advice or pity. They do not want you to minimize their feelings or give false hope.
They want you to listen. They want you to care. They want you to stay in their lives and not brand them as special needs parents. They want you to understand that although their lives might be taking a different turn, they still need friends. Their children still need friends and subtle support.
Then what the heck do you say to these people? Sure as a counsellor I too was at a loss for words. Even as a professional wordsmith I could not find the right words? Then like a bolt from the blue it came to me. The two simple and perfect words you can say: “I’m here.” And mean it. Mean it through every struggle, every victory and every passing day.
Mean it on the days when autism is all they can talk about and on the days when they need an extra set of hands. Mean it when you are making out the list of which children to invite to your child’s birthday party. They don’t need you to be an expert on autism. They don’t need you to always say the right thing. Now, more than ever, they need you to just be there.
