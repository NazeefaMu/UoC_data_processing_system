Japan to enhance defence cooperation

Japan plans to further expand defence cooperation and exchanges with Sri Lanka which will benefit both nations in the future, a spokesman for the Japanese Defence Ministry said.
The Ministry spokesman said Japan’s defence corporation and exchanges with Sri Lanka which are largely confined to maritime related matters will expand to other sectors such as the Army and Air Force in the future.
“Sri Lanka is a maritime country located at a strategic point in the middle of the Indian Ocean sea lane. Therefore Sri Lanka is so important for Japan to maintain and promote our foreign policy “Open and Stable Seas”, he added.
The Spokesman also said that Sri Lanka is also important for smooth operations of the Japan – Self-Defence Forces (JSDF) since ships and aircraft of JSDF make frequent port calls in Sri Lanka.
Highlighting some of the recent defence related exchanges the spokesman said, JSDF ships and aircraft conduct passage exercises at port of calls since 2011 and JMODSDF has been providing capacity building programmes with Sri Lanka since 2018.
Among more recent exchanges he highlighted the visits of Japanese ships ‘Kaga’ and ‘Inazuma’ to Colombo port and said they were mutually beneficial.
He said Sri Lanka has participated in the Tokyo Defence forum since 2007 and has participated in the annual Multinational Corporation programme in the Asia Pacific (MCAP) since 2010 and Western Pacific Naval Symposium Short Term Exchange programme for Officers of the Next Generation (WPNS STEP) every year since 2013. He also said Japan has taken part in the “Galle Dialogue” organized by the Sri Lanka Navy every year and for the first time had taken part in the ‘Air Symposium” organized by Sri Lanka Air Force in 2016. The Spokesman also highlighted then Japanese Defense Minister Onodera’s official visit to Sri Lanka in August 2018.
“The Japanese Minister’s visit to Sri Lanka further enhanced the defense cooperation between the two countries” he added.
Recalling Minister Onodera’s visit to the strategically located Hambantota port, operated jointly by Sri Lanka and a Chinese firm, the spokesman said the Sri Lankan Government had assured that the operations of the port will be transparent and it will only be used for commercial purposes.
