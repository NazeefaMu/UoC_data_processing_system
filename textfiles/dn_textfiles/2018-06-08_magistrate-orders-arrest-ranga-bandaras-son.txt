MINISTRY CAB CRASHING INTO CHILAW HOUSE:
Magistrate orders arrest of Ranga Bandara's son

Chilaw Magistrate and District Court Judge yesterday ordered the Arachchikattuwa Police to arrest Yashoda Range Bandara and Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan for causing heavy damage to a house and a government vehicle in a crash in Kottapitiya, Chilaw.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara’s son Yashoda Range Bandara and Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan were injured when their vehicle driven by the State Minister’s son veered off the road and crashed into a house early morning on Wednesday. Police said the cab that crashed belonged to the Irrigation Ministry and the crash happened when the driver lost control of the vehicle.
The order to arrest Range Bandara who drove the cab was given by the magistrate after facts related to the accident were presented to the court by Arachchikattuwa OIC Anuradha Herath yesterday (7). The house and cab were badly damaged due to the accident. Yashodha Bandara and Anjana Sandaruwan were admitted to the Chilaw Base Hospital immediately after the crash. Bandara was sent to the Colombo National Hospital for a scan test and had discharged himself from hospital.
Residents in the area reported that a liquor bottle was found inside the cab and added that the accident occurred because the driver was also inebriated.
