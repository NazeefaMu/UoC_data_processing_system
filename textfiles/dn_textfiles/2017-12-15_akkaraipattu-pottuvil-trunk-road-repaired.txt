Akkaraipattu - Pottuvil trunk road repaired

A news story published by this newspaper recently found immediate action when the Road Development Authority (RDA) took immediate action to repair the road.
The Akkaraipattu – Pottuvil trunk road in front of the Akkaraipattu Private and SLTB Bus Stand maintained by RDA had a trench in the middle of the road. People had to face immense difficulties as a result, especially during rainy season when making use of the road.
The road had been carpeted few years ago. The people in the area were highly worried over this sorry state of affairs and urged the authorities to provide a quick solution to this matter.
They are very much thankful to the RDA for their prompt action taken to repair the road.
