Serving  the  deserving

Rosy Senanayake is one of the most influential women in Sri Lanka. She is in politics for one purpose and that is to serve the people. Outstanding Personalities feature Rosy, a remarkable woman who strives to create change.
Q. You are a woman in politics. You were the former State Minister for Child Development. You are also an activist on several issues. Currently, you are the Prime Minister’s Deputy Chief of Staff. Do you find it challenging occupying such positions of power?
A. Being Prime Minister’s Deputy Chief of Staff is a job. I don’t consider it a power base. Deputy Chief of Staff is a responsible position. And there is an absolute amount of dedication and commitment, loyalty and sincerity that goes into the job. It is a demanding job. I don’t look at any of these jobs as a power base. Once you take on the role of being a politician, I suppose sometimes people lose the right perspective of a politician. They lose sight of the graveness of the title.
A politician is someone who is involved in making decisions with regard to an entire nation. It is a very responsible job. You can’t take it haphazardly and can’t think that this is a power base. For me every position that I have held, whether it has been the High Commissioner to Malaysia or President of the Lak Vanitha Movement (Women’s Wing of the United National Party) or the organiser for a constituency or a Member of Parliament or the State Minister for Child Affairs or being a goodwill ambassador to the UN, whatever position that has been bestowed upon me, I have always looked at it as a responsibility, as a commitment that I have made to that particular institution or the people. I need to fulfill it to the best of my ability.
I don’t look at this as a power base. It is a job that has been given to me and I basically fulfill my job to the best of my ability. Sometimes you don’t realize the capacity you have within you until you have been given that responsibility.
So no matter what I have undertaken, I have done my best. There are instances when I felt I could have done things better if I was given another chance. I suppose these are defined as power jobs, maybe because politics has been perceived in this country or by certain people as a powerbase. I suppose there is a certain amount of power bestowed upon you with the job. That power is basically to do your utmost.
Q. You have had so many portfolios. From these portfolios, what has been the most rewarding for you?
A. I would say the most rewarding thing about being a politician is to understand peoples’ needs, desires and aspirations, and to try to reach out to them to fulfill their needs, dreams and aspirations. The most rewarding for me has been the fact that I was a Member of Parliament and I was able to voice the people’s voice, especially when I was in the Opposition and to be able to represent people – their hopes and aspirations.
Out of all the positions I have held, the most rewarding would be fighting for women’s rights. Because I believe in this country there is much to be done with regard to uplifting the dignity and giving women equality and power-sharing. There is yet a lot to be done. To be able to be a part of that movement that is fighting for their rights is to me, very rewarding. Eventually to see positive results and to have positive change for the betterment of women is gratifying.
Q. You are a champion for women’s and children’s rights. Do you feel that as a political personality and a public figure, you have made a difference? Do you have a particular concern for children?
A. I think I have. In the six months I was State Minister for Child Development, I made quite a bit of change with regard to early childhood development. I managed to get a fair portion of funding from the World Bank to improve early childhood education. We are now working on the curriculum and methodology to improve early childhood education.
Medically, it is proven that the first five years of a child is the most crucial. In these very formative years, if you do not take care of children’s nutrition, health and education, there will be a lost opportunity. Early childhood education is of paramount importance. If we as a State do not take care of the most important aspects of a child, we would fail as a State.
I managed to bring new policies and push forward certain things with regard to early childhood development. I was also able to do something with regard to eradicating malnutrition among children and pregnant mothers.
I think we all should have a concern for children. When you look at the world today, there is very little respect for humanity. People will kill in the name of religion. When we grew up, we had compassion and forgiveness, giving and embracing people of different races, cultures and customs. We always put others first.
But today, people have become so selfish and self-centered. You look at others according to their culture, religion, caste and creed. God is no respecter of man. We are all created equal. It is we who bring divisions – the colour of the skin, the community and religion we belong to. There is so much conflict in the world. We are not thinking that we are equal anymore. We tend to segregate and look down on people. In order to change this, we must start from childhood. We need to place a lot of emphasis on kids – how they should be brought up, the values that should be instilled in them and the education they should be given – to make them think equal and have respect for others.
Equality to me is the key here. Molding children and giving them the right perception, cultivating their way of thinking and behaviour should start at a very early age. We should mold a child to be empathetic and respect humanity, no matter who the person is or where a person comes from. You have to create a responsible human being who cares for everyone and teach children to put others first. We live in a highly competitive, commercial world. We have lost sight of how to treat and respect others.
I am appalled hearing cases of violence against women and children. To harm a six-year-old or a two-year-old child - that is how cruel the mind has become. Especially in this country there is very little respect for humanity. We need to have a total change of thinking, change of mindset and attitude. That can be done from younger years. Molding a child to think differently and to be empathic is important.
Q. How do you evaluate your political career? What do you consider your milestones?
A. You know, I have never stopped evaluating my political career. I don’t even look at this as a career. To me this is my calling. This is a service I am doing to society. This is what I can give to the people. I believe I am truly blessed and I have the capacity to serve the nation through politics. I will do my best as long as people need me. This is not something I planned to become. It just fell into place. One thing led to another and then the next thing I know, I was in politics. I did politics for all the right reasons, because I felt there were changes that needed to be done. I will work as long as I have the strength to make changes. I am there if you want me, I will serve you, the day you tell me to go home, I will go home.
Q. As a woman in politics, have you faced daunting obstacles? How did you respond to them?
A. The biggest obstacle has been the mere fact that I am a woman. Women are taken very lightly. How many women are in politics? Look at the Parliament. Fifty percent of those in Parliament are not fit to be there. They are there for all the wrong reasons – power based! Politicians should be servants of the people. I go out to serve because I strongly believe that that is my calling. That is why God has created me and put me on this earth. If people have trusted you and put you in a particular place to serve them, then you are the peoples’ servant. But I find it strange that in this country, women are perceived as people who would be doing menial, labour-oriented low paid jobs and they are only suitable to do household chores, raise babies and be tagged ‘housewives’. You take education, most teachers are female. But if you take principals, how many women are principals at schools? If they can put a male principal in a girls’ school, they would do that!
How many women in the public service department are at key positions in boards as directors or chairpersons, additional secretaries, secretaries to a Minister? Not even 10 percent! Why? What is the reason? The biggest hindrance and stumbling block I have faced in political life is the mere fact that I am a woman and I have always been considered as second best to a man. I have been in politics for almost 28 years, but if ever I go to a political rally, the announcements will go as – here comes the beauty queen! I am not considered for the work I have done in society and titles I have held. To me it is so strange! So we need to change this.
Q. Who has been your greatest inspiration?
A. This might sound very cliché, but my inspiration comes from God. I read the Bible and I fear God very much.
I believe I have been put on earth for a particular purpose. And that purpose is to serve the people, to reach out and give, and have compassion.
That is where it comes from. We are here to give love, compassion and be empathetic to others.
