‘Govt. will expand development ventures after polls victory’

It is crucial that the government wins the upcoming Local Government election to expand the development ventures into local government bodies, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
Minister Athukorale pointed out that the government has completed an enormous workload within two years that the previous regime failed to do in 10 years.
She was speaking at a meeting held at Ratnapura, Imbulpe in support of the UNP candidates in the area, yesterday.
Minister Athukorale said the government is committed to developing the country, unlike the ‘Joint Opposition gang of thieves’ who only wants what is best for them.
“The Pohottowa attempts to bring a family into power. Why can’t anybody else but them become the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party? President Maithripala Sirisena won the election with 6.2 million votes. Pohottuwa is trying to tear the SLFP apart to build the Rajapaksa family. Rajapaksa wants to make his son the President of this country in 10 years,” Minister Athukorale pointed out.
She said the government is not at fault for the increase in the coconut price. “A large number of coconut trees were destroyed due to natural causes. Approximately 225,000 coconut trees in the Kurunegala district were destroyed due to natural causes. Nobody talks about the government reducing gas, fuel, and medicine prices,” she added.
Minister Athukorale said the government took over a country with Rs. 10,000 billion in debt, thanks to the Rajapaksa regime. “The Rajapaksa regime made ports and highways but swindled large sums from these development projects,” she said. “Now they are even trying to take the credit for the Moragahakanda project. This project was initially planned by the UNP government’s late Minister Gamini Dissanayake under the leadership of the late President J. R. Jayawardena. When President Sirisena attempted to carry out the project when he was a minister, the previous regime refused to allocate money for it. It is the present government that allocated the funds to finish the Moragahakanda project,” Minister Athukorale pointed out.
She added that some make a huge issue out of the fertilizer shortage which surfaced recently. “There may be certain delays in receiving stocks, but at least we are distributing quality fertilizers unlike the previous regime that gave people low-quality fertilizers,” she said.
