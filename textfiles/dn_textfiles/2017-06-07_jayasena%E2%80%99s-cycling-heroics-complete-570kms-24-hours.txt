Jayasena’s cycling heroics to complete 570kms in 24 hours

A 63-year veteran cyclist and a former top level bank officer who is also a member of the board of directors of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Malwanna Guruge Jayasena will take up the challenge of cycling Sri Lanka's longest distance from Northern Point Pedro to Southern Dondra Point within 24 hours. A resident of Hikkaduwa, Jayasena will start this record breaking tour on June 10 early morning 1.30 from Point Pedro and will pass Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura to reach Chilaw.
He will take a six-hour break at Chilaw and will start the final phase on June 11 early morning 1.00 from Chilaw to Dondra through Colombo, Kalutara, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Galle and Matara completing nearly 570kms. The tour is organized by the Ambalangoda Cycle Association under the purview of Sports Ministry and Cycling Federation of Sri Lanka officials. It will be the first time in Sri Lanka a sexagenarian dare to take up the challenge of riding his foot-bike from North most to South most tips of the island within such a short time (24hours).
Jayasena's main concern is not to set up a record. There will be a great chance for him to enter record books, if he succeed in completing 570kms on his foot-bike in 24 hours, but he would like to spread the message of healthy lifestyle that the foot-bike bestow on masses. Popularising cycling as a sport, a day-to-day activity and a method of transportation at all age groups and every level of the society will be paramount in Jayasena's effort. He also believes his attempt will be an inspiration to many elderly people who are very distant from sports activities and will give them the message that the mental strength matters more than physical abilities.
Jayasena is a constant long distance cyclist who has a habit of celebrating his birthdays with a cycle tour.
He last completed a three-day cycle tour from Hikkaduwa to Polonnaruwa via Anuradhapura and back to Hikkaduwa covering nearly 800kms as a celebration tour of his 62nd birthday on 20/2/2016.
In the month of June of the same year he completed a 600km, three-day tour starting from Hikkaduwa, covering the hilly terrain of Dambulla and Kandy to return on the same rout to Hikkaduwa. Jayasena' s habitual birthday cycle tours for his 60th and 61st birthdays have been two-day tours from Hikkaduwa to Kataragama with approximate distance of 400kms each.
