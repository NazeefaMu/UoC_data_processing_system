On the beach with canine pal

Beach days can be a blast when you bring along a canine pal or three, but taking a dog to the beach requires some preparation, know-how and a little common sense -- or should that be canine sense?
Anything that can harm you at the beach can also harm your dog, such as sunburn, riptides, jellyfish, broken glass, sharp shells and aggressive dogs. But a beach day isn't supposed to be about doom and gloom. Having a great day is easy when you know how to prepare for and prevent any potential mishaps. Read on for best safety tips to help you and your pal find fun and relaxation together in the sun, surf and sand.
Temperature threat
Warm summer temperatures at the beach can pose a threat to a dog's health. Make sure that your dog has a shady retreat under a beach umbrella, tree or picnic bench. Bring plenty of fresh, cool water and a doggie bowl. Offer refills liberally, making sure that the water does not get hot in the sun.
Remember that the sand can be scorching on sensitive paws, so provide a blanket or towel for your dog's comfort when he takes a break from romping in the surf.
Recall command
The key to off-leash fun at the beach is having a solid grasp on the recall command -- meaning that your dog comes to you when you call him, every single time. Teach this skill at home, and if your dog still has questionable recall skills, the beach is a great place to work on this critical command around lots of distractions.
Place your dog on a long leash (also called a long line, about 20-30 feet -- 6-9 meters -- long), available at most pet retailers. While at the beach, call your dog and give him a treat and praise every time he returns to you. You can let him play with a ball or toy for a reward as well. Use his name only for something good, like coming back to you for a treat or toy, not for scolding him.
Allow off leash
Allow your dog off leash at the beach only when you are reasonably sure that the recall command has become a good habit -- and always keep treats on hand.
While your dog is having his carefree splash in the sea, keep an eye out for beach hazards -- learn more about what to watch for on the next page.
The beach is fun, but it does come with hazards, such as ingesting questionable objects (and even ocean water), cuts and scrapes and even the potential for drowning.
Take first Aid
Bring a first aid kit with you in case of cut paws or jellyfish stings. Include cotton balls, ammonia (for stings, dilute with water before applying), peroxide and bandages.
If your dog is a puppy, hasn't learned to swim well or is a brachycephalic or a short-legged breed, consider giving him a doggie life jacket to wear so that he doesn't overtire himself in the water. Always supervise any dog while he's in or near the water and be cautious of rip tides, sharks and deep water.
Salt water on a dog's skin and paws can be irritating, so a fresh-water rinse before leaving the beach or shortly after arriving home will help keep your dog comfy and his skin and coat healthy.
Finally, for your own peace of mind, bring a thick blanket and plenty of towels to line the car seat where your dog sits for the ride home. Your dog will probably fall asleep on the way home, your own reward for a fun, safe, happy beach day.
