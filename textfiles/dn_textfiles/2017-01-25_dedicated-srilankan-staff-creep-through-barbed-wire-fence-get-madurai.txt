Dedicated SriLankan staff creep through barbed wire fence to get to Madurai Airport

SriLankan Airlines caused controversy yesterday when a viral video showed the operating crew of a SriLankan Airlines flight from Madurai to Colombo creeping through a barbed wire fence in order to get into the Madurai Airport became public.The incident which had taken place last Saturday took place as a result of the entrances to the Madurai Airport being blocked due to student protests against the banning of Jallikattu raging throughout Tamil Nadu.
The crew led by Captain R.De Alwis were blocked from entering the airport and thus had resorted to creeping through a barbed wire fence bordering the airport.
SriLankan Airlines Spokesperson Deepal Perera explaining the incidents which took place said that with the crew stranded, the Madurai authorities themselves had suggested the route through the barbed wire.
“They had no alternative given that all routes were blocked. They had suggested it and the crew had volunteered to try it,”Perera said.
He added that the company was proud of the crew for having gone the extra mile to ensure that the flight that day took off as planned.
“They have taken every precaution to avoid a delay and we are grateful,”Perera said.
SriLankan Airlines this week was also rated the most punctual among carriers in the OneWorld global alliance, during the fourth quarter of 2016. The airline achieved a punctuality rating of 90.5 percent for its arrivals and departures being on time during the fourth quarter.
