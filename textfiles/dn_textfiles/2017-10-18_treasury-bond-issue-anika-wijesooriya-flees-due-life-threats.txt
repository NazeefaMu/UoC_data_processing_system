The Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda yesterday informed the Treasury Bond Commission that Anika Wijesooriya, who gave evidence with regard to Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius renting a penthouse for former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family, has left the country due to life threats.
ASG Kodagoda said Anika Wijesooriya’s brother Wijitha Wijesooriya has received a telephone call on October 4, threatening the life of his sister and her immediate family.
According to ASG Kodagoda, the threatening call was given by Shanil Neththikumara, who is said to be a close relative of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. ASG Kodagoda also informed that the person who initiated the threat is an owner of a casino.
ASG Kodagoda requested from the Commission to provide witness protection to Anika Wijesooriya and her family. An order from the Commission is due.
Anika Wijesooriya testified before the Commission on July 24.
