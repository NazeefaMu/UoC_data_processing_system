India pick Pant, Yadav for Windies tour

New Delhi: Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav were picked Thursday for India’s limited-overs tour of the West Indies comprising five one-day internationals and one Twenty20 starting June 23.
The two youngsters replace opening batsman Rohit Sharma and allrounder Hardik Pandya from the 15-man Champions Trophy squad, which is defending its title in England and Wales.
Pant, who has played just one T20 international for India, and Yadav were already on the radar after being named among five players kept on standby for the 50-over tournament.
The duo have been rewarded for their excellent showing on the domestic circuit, including impressive displays in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. Pant, 19, hit two fifties for Delhi Daredevils in the recent IPL edition, following on from a 326-ball 308 in the domestic Ranji Trophy last season.
His aggressive left-handed batting and ability to handle the pressure of a high-stakes match impressed chief selector MSK Prasad, who described him as a “player for the future”.
Yadav piqued interest in his Test debut, clinching four wickets in India’s series victory over Australia in March.
The 22-year-old from Kanpur in northern India also put in a strong showing for his IPL side Kolkata Knight Riders. AFP
