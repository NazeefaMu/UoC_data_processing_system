No referees to be assigned until  spectator discipline is instilled
Sports Minister puts  a halt to schools rugby

Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha has taken a stern stand to eradicate spectator misbehaviour at schools rugby matches and given a directive to temporarily suspend the ongoing schools tournament until the issue is resolved and discipline instilled.
A media release from the Sports Ministry states:
“Consequent to the recent incidents spectators have taken the law into their own hands which has resulted in threats to the safety of referees, spectators and players.
“This is seen as a threat to the reputation of schools rugby. Consequent to the discussions I had with SLR & Referees Association it was decided no referee will be permitted at the ongoing school tournaments until a discussion is held with SLR, SLSRFR, Schools Association, Education Department and School Authorities to resolve this issue and instil discipline in rugby.”
The Sports Minister’s reaction comes following a spate of spectator-related unruly incidents that has taken place at school games involving Wesley College and Royal College, Maliyadeva College vs S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia and Science College vs D. S. Senanayake last week in the Singer schools league rugby tournament.
Thus the Inter-Schools Singer ‘A’ and ‘B’ Division league rugby Cup and Plate tournament matches along with the Bowl, Shield and Division II games will be postponed by a week with immediate effect.
Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) president Ranjith Chandarasekara told the Daily News: “After the meeting that took place between the schools following the advice from the Minister, all matches for this week in the league will be postponed. We will once again meet with all 16 schools both ‘A’ and ‘B’ Division principals, masters in charges on Friday to discuss matters to educate all parties to move forward without any problems. Schools Rugby will most probably resume next week on June 2.”
