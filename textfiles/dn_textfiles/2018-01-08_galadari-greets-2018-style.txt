Galadari greets 2018 in style

The Galadari Hotel was in high spirits greeting 2018 with a bang. The hotel’s celebrations were highly successful with the Coffee Shop, having its Gala Dinner which was a family affair where guests danced till dawn to the fabulous sounds of Kismet and Effex DJs.
The California Grill had a stylish New Year’s Eve celebration with Mignonne, Russ and Suraj setting the night on fire with their music vibes. The Margarita Blue provided the ambience to rock the night away with the Effex DJs.
