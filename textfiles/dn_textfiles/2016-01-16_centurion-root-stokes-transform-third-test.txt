Centurion Root, Stokes transform Third Test

JOHANNESBURG, FRIDAY: Joe Root hit a thrilling century for England as he and Ben Stokes transformed the third Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday.
England were 238 for five when the threat of lightning brought an early close on the second day, 75 runs behind South Africa's first innings total of 313. Root was on 106 not out, his ninth Test century. A fifth-wicket partnership of 111 in 78 minutes off 97 balls with Stokes (58) swung the match dramatically in England's favour after a four-pronged South African pace attack had reduced the tourists to 91 for four.
Root and Stokes counter-attacked, posting a fifty partnership off only 35 balls in a match where the average scoring rate had hovered at around three an over on a pitch offering help to the fast bowlers.
Root reached the first half-century of the match off 77 balls with nine fours.
Stokes, who hit a dazzling 258 in the drawn second Test in Cape Town, got a hostile welcome from Morne Morkel, fending a bouncer off his glove for a single.
But in the next over Stokes pulled a short ball from Rabada for six. He reached his fifty off 46 balls and his innings lasted 54 deliveries before he offered a caught and bowled chance to Morkel off a leading edge. Root continued to bat aggressively and reached his century off 126 balls when he punched Chris Morris through the covers for his 16th four.
England got off to a bad start when Kagiso Rabada had Alex Hales caught at second slip for one. It got worse when Hardus Viljoen took a wicket with his first ball in Test cricket, having England captain Alastair Cook caught down the leg side by wicketkeeper Dane Vilas for 18.
