Ronaldo marks milestone, in-form Kane fires Spurs

  Paris: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice on his 400th Real Madrid appearance as the Champions League holders defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-1, while Harry Kane grabbed a hat-trick in Tottenham Hotspur's 3-0 win at APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday.
Gareth Bale struck an exquisite volley as the record 12-time European champions secured an 18th-minute lead at Signal Iduna Park, with the Welshman supplying Ronaldo for Real's second just after half-time.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang poked in Gonzalo Castro's cross to give Dortmund hope, but Ronaldo rifled past Roman Burki to cement a second straight win for Real in Group H and leave the Germans still without a point. AFP
It was the first time Dortmund have lost at home to Real in seven European games while holders Madrid have now scored in 38 successive Champion League games.
Ronaldo, without a goal in his last two outings following his return from a five-match domestic ban, took his Real haul to 411 on what was also his 150th career appearance in Europe.
"I’m delighted for Ronaldo and Bale," said Real coach Zinedine Zidane.
"It is difficult to play in this stadium, we have never won here, so this victory was important to us, and the whole game was good for us from start to finish."
England striker Kane notched his sixth hat-trick of the year -- and made it 11 goals for club and country in September -- as Spurs backed up their opening victory over Dortmund with a comfortable win in Cyprus.
