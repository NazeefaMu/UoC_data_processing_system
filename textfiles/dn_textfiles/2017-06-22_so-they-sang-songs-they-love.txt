So they sang the songs they love

The Senior and Junior choirs of Visakha Vidyalaya recently presented ‘The Songs we Love’, a choral extravaganza in celebration of their Alma Mater’s 100th anniversary this year.
The event was graced by Chief Guest and distinguished past Visakhian Kishani Jayasinghe-Wijesekera, Guest of Honour and distinguished past Visakhian Menaka de Fonseka Sahabandu, and Principal Sandamali Aviruppola.
The nearly 80+ Visakhian choristers took the appreciative audience in a packed-to-capacity Jeremias Dias hall that evening on a delightful musical journey spanning different genres of music over one hundred years.
