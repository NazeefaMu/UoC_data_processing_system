Making them more accountable

Saving money is a healthy habit which leads way to immense benefits. Since most parents are readily meeting their child’s every fancy today, little do children realise the need for saving or the worth of the penny.
At a time when we see many adults waging a losing battle against bankruptcy, the trick lies in catching children young.
Students of Polymath College, Maharagama, were enlightened on why they should put this habit to practice on World Children’s Day. They were encouraged to save more and more when the school provided them with a piggy bank. A project to plant trees with the aim of reducing global warming was also initiated by the school.
