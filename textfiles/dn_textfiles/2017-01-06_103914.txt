NCE achieves significant successes in 2016

The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE), the leading Chamber which serves Sri Lankan exporters of products and services and service providers to exporters has acieved significant success in 2016.
The Chamber has nearly 500 Member Enterprises including some of the big export houses in Sri Lanka and a large number of SME type export oriented ventures.
Background to performance of Sri Lankan exporters in 2016 
Sri Lankan exporters who make a vital contribution to the economic development in Sri Lanka are known for their resilience, and have performed under adverse conditions in the local and external environment, particularly during the period of terrorism which lasted nearly three decades.
Export performance, and growth, particularly during the last decade has been poor in comparison to competitor countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, although they faced the same challenges in the external environment.
Some of the main constraints faced by Sri Lankan exporters vis a vis their competitors are the relatively high finance and energy costs, in-adequate infrastructure facilities, high rates of inflation, shortage of skilled labour in important sectors of production, macroeconomic, (fiscal and taxation)policy instability, lack of adequate production capacity in most sectors, and the relatively low level of demand from buyers due to high cost of production among others.
In this background the withdrawal of the GSP Plus facility, and the ban on the export of fisheries products by the European Union exacerbated their problems since the EU is the largest export market for Sri Lanka.
Policy issues
The Chamber has consistently brought to the notice of the relevant State Authorities the adverse effects of adhoc policy changes in the confidence of entrepreneurs and investors to engage in business. The imbalance of direct and indirect taxation is a case in point. State intervention in private sector wages due to the lack of a clear wage policy is another example. However, the efforts of the Chamber, have borne fruit in that the Unity Government has embarked on several measures to streamline and stabilize policies related to both Trade and Investment.
Formulation of a National Trade Policy, and negotiation of Economic Partnership and Free Trade Agreements.
The Chamber has effectively contributed to the initiative of the Government to formulate a National Trade Policy by organizing Forums with the relevant Stakeholders an dits members to discuss concerned issues, and have made proposals to the Government. Similarly the Chamber has extensively engaged with the Ministry of Strategy development and International Trade and Other State Agencies covering the activities of the proposed Economic and Technology CooperationAgreement (ECTA) with India and theFree Trade Agreements with China and Singapore. While agreeing in principle on the overall benefitsof such Agreements to the National Economyin a competitive Trading Environment, the Chamber has submitted several proposals to overcome the deficiencies in the current FTA with India, and the current regulatory environment, to safeguard Sri Lankan Enterprises, before implementing the proposed FTAs.
Measures to improve the quality of services of the Chamber 
 
* In 2016, the Chamber developed its Management Systems including documentation, and was successful in obtaining ISO 9001 Certification. Systems development and training of staff was carried outwith the assistance of Indexpo CertificationLtd. which is a UNIDO initiated National Certification Body.
* In 2016 the Chamber also embarked on the preparation of a Strategic Plan for the next five years with a new Vision, Mission, and Objectives to align itself more effectively with National objectives for Economic Development, particularly in relation to exports. The task was carried out with professional inputs from the multinational Audit Firm Ernst & Young. The work programs of the Chamber in 2017 will conform to this strategic plan.
*Further during 2016 the Chamber revamped its flagship publication the quarterly ‘Sri Lanka Exporter Magazine”. This high quality magazine which is the only of its kind in the field of exports, carries valuable articles and information of value to Sri Lankan exporters of Products and Services as well as Service Providers to Exporters.
It serves to promote Sri Lankan Products and Services in overseas markets by attracting buyers, since it is distributed to all important Trade points both locally and overseas. The material in the magazine is subscribed by a professional writers and experts inspecialized areas related to exports. Measures were adopted to increase the quantum of original articles,and include success stories of Sri Lankan exporters,particularly of member exporters to highlight their achievements andunique offers to the International Market Place. The print quality of the magazine was also substantially improved.
Skills development 
* The dearth of skills in important sectors related to exports is one of the constraints that has been discussed by the Council of the Chamber. This involves Management skills, and specially technical skills, as well as knowledge in operational aspects of exports in respect of employees in export enterprises. To contribute to overcome this constraint the Chamber on its part has conducted a number of training seminars and workshops on export related subjects of importance. Among those conducted during 2016, is a Training Seminar on the implementation of the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) both in English and Sinhala mediums specially for the benefit of SME Entrepreneurs, a Training Program on the new Food Safety Modernisation Act of the USA for export related enterprises, an Awareness Program on the opportunities to supply Branded products to China, an Educational Forum to minimize costs and maximise benefits from Free Trade Agreements, the importance and procedures related to Quarantine Issues for Import and Export of Plants and Animals, Kosher Certification for Food and Beverage Export Industries, and a Forum to Disseminate knowledge on the Implications of the Budget Proposals for 2017 including how best to use the fiscal and taxation proposals.
* To improve Management and operational skills of those employed in export ventures, and for their career advancement, as well as for school leavers who wish to engage in exports as a profession, the Chamber conducts three professional courses in Export Import Trade Management at Certificate Level and Diploma Level, through its subsidiary the ‘National Institute of Exports’ (NIOE), which is a non-profit service organization.
These courses have received the recognition of the National Vocational and Education Commission (NVEC). In 2017 the Chamber will enter into an MOU with the ITC SME Trade Academy to extend these services online through e-learning modules.
* The Chamber has also made budgetary proposals in 2016 to promote skills developmentsome aspects of which have been accepted to provide incentives and assistance to the Private sector.
Outreach programs 
* In 2016 the NCE successfully implemented a program to link producers in the North with Member Exporters in the South covering the fruits and vegetable sector, fisheries sector, and related services such as Boat Building. This program has been implemented under a collaborative arrangement with the International Labour Organization (ILO) with funding from the Australian Government.
During the year the Chamber has been able to organise several delegations of Member exporters to visit the North to explore opportunities, and link with producers to obtain their products for export. Several contractual agreements have been signed to harness the produce for export, resulting in the economic advancement of producers in the North. The products and services have also been exhibited at the Annual Jaffna International Trade fair.
This program has also enabled to complement the efforts of the Government for reconciliation between the peoples of the North and South following the Civil conflict and is known for its credibility.
* As an extension to this program, in 2017, the Chamber under its new Strategic Plan proposes to establish strong linkages with Regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry to provide extended services, especially to SMEs, to develop and promote them to link to the Export Value Chain, thereby contributing to the National effort to increase the number of exporters, and service providers to exporters, to achieve the ambitious overall export target set for 2020.
In this context it will also support the objective of the Government to increase the number of registered exporters by 1000, through a programme of the Export Development Board.
Participation at important Forums of the State
In 2016 the Chamber contributed as an active partner to the World Export Development Forum (WEDF) conducted for the first time in Sri Lanka by the Export Development Board in collaboration with the ITC in Geneva. This landmark event which was attended by several International delegations from overseas markets served to boost the image of Sri Lanka in the International stage as an important Trading and Investment destination.
The Chamber servedin the Steering Committeeto organise the event, and also to conduct the connected Trade Exhibition to showcase Sri Lankan Export Products and Services to overseas visitors.
The Chamber has also been an active participant of the ‘Ease of Doing Business Forum’ conducted by the Ministry of Finance, and the Exporters Forum conducted by the Export Development Board, to represent policy and operational issues of member exporters for their resolution.
Budget Proposals for 2017 
The NCE submitted several proposals for the Budget presented in November 2016.The main proposals included the importance of Branding Sri Lanka in the International Market Place, the need to rationalise activities which come under the purview of several Ministries related to exports to facilitate trade and investment, deficiencies that need to be corrected related to current bilateral Trade Agreements before proceeding with new ones, the need to provide innovative financial support for Capital Investment and Working Capital funding of export enterprises including the vital need to establish an Export Import (EXIM) Bank, solutions to overcome constraints for the development and expansion of the Spice Industry specially Ceylon Cinnamon in which Sri Lanka has monopoly, tax relief to companies to encourage listing in the Colombo Stock exchange, need to be flexible in granting triple tax deduction for R & D, and proposals for skills development including the establishment of a “Skills Development Fund” to support in house activities of export enterprises.
