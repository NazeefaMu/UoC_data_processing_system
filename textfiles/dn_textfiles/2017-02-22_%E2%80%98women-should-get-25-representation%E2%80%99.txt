‘Women should get 25% representation’

Nomination lists submitted for Municipal and Pradesheeya Sabha elections should contain 25 percent women representation.
If not such nomination lists are liable for rejection. A similar proposal is being considered for parliamentary elections too, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing an SLFP Women's organisation seminar at the Simon Pieris Hall, Badulla on February 19. Minister de Silva said politics today should be oriented to suit present times. A new era had dawned on the country after the 30-year-long war. War crimes allegations had been levelled against our country.
Northern Province Chief Minister Vigneswaran was demanding to include foreign judges in war crimes tribunal supported by certain bad eggs in the south, he said.
“President Maithripala Sirisena and the SLFP led by him would never condone the inclusion of foreign judges on such a machinery. No room would be left for outsiders to meddle in our country's independence and sovereignty.
“Recently Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila had alleged that the new Constitution was already drawn up and it was federal in nature from outside but not from inside, he said.
The minister said Gammanpila was highly mistaken because a new Constitution was not even on the drawing boards. The minister said he would categorically state this because he too was a member of the Constitutional Council. The SLFP would only support a Constitution which safeguards the country's unitary status and give the prominent place to Buddhism, the minister said.
The election manifesto of President Sirisena categorically stated that he would only support a new constitutional reforms which did not warrant a referendum.
Water Supply and Drainage State Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle and State Minister Dilan Perera participated.
