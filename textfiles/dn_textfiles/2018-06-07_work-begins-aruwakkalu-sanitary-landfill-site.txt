Work begins on Aruwakkalu sanitary landfill site

The project to transport garbage from Colombo to a sanitary landfill site in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam will go ahead with Cabinet approving funding for the project.
In February this year, Sri Lanka sought Word Bank funds to part finance the US$ 274 million project. The project spearheaded by Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry had planned to dispose solid waste in Colombo to Aruwakkalu and further develop an existing site in Muthurajawela.
The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry had received Cabinet approval to negotiate US$ 115 million from the World Banks' International Bank for Reconstruction and Development window. By April however, the World Bank which had released US$ 200 million for the garbage disposal project and the Kelani River Flood Protection work pulled out alleging corrupt practices in the tender process.
This week, a Cabinet paper on the subject noted that the contract for the project had already been awarded and that funds would be released to initiate the procurement process to purchase 34 container wagons and 94 container boxes which would transport solid waste in selected urban areas in Colombo to Aruwakkalu.
