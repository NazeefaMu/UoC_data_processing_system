Annual ban period on lobster fishing extended

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had instructed Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department Director General to extend the annual ban period on lobster fishing and issue the relevant gazette notification immediately.
Lobster fishing was banned during February, September, and October since the duration is their reproductive season. But lobsters' reproductive cycle has been changed.
The Minister, therefore, proposed to extend the three-month annual ban to four months.
