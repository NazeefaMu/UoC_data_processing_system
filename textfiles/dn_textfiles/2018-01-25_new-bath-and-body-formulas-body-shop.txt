New bath and body  formulas from  Body Shop

The Body Shop in Colombo has introduced brand new bath and body formulas to complement three ultimate shower routines -Tahitian Tiara Body Wash, Balkan Juniper Bath and Shower Gel, and Adriatic Peony Bath and Shower Cream.
The Tahitian Tiare Body Wash is part of the Blissful Ritual, comprising of a range of indulgent bath and body products designed to replenish the body and mind. This shower oil-in-gel cleanses and scents skin with a fragrance inspired by the Hawaiian Kukui Cream. Monoi oil-a nourishing blend of coconut oil and tiare flower extract- melds with Community Trade moisturizing honey from Ethiopia and coconut oil from Samoa to create a heady, opulent fragrance that layers skin with a warm scent and leaves it feeling calm, de-stressed and relaxed. Massage onto damp skin in circular motions or pour under warm running water to use as a foaming bath.
Plump up The Body Shop’s Firming Ritual with the Balkan Juniper Bath and Shower Gel- this ritual is perfect for customers who want to invigorate their senses with refined textures and uplifting fragrances. The Balkan Juniper Bath and Shower Gel is inspired by the fragrance of Ethiopian Green Coffee Cream, with a delicious blend of energizing juniper berry fruit oil, stimulating caffeine and Community Trade moisturizing honey from Ethiopia. Massage onto damp skin in circular motions or pour under warm running water to use as a bubble bath- the formula gently cleanses skin to remove impurities and surface dirt and leaves it clean and invigoratingly scented.
The Relaxing Ritual is enhanced by the addition of the Adriatic Peony Bath and Shower Cream, a product that cleanses skin with a soothing fragrance inspired by the Japanese Camellia Cream. The formula is a blend of delicate peony flower extract and Community Trade moisturizing honey from Ethiopia. Massage onto damp skin in circular motions or pour under warm running water to use as a foaming bath cream
