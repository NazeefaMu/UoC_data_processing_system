Blunt  ‘would pay’  to play Mary  Poppins again

Emily Blunt has teased that more ‘Mary Poppins’ movies are in the pipeline. Chatting to American Vogue, the British actress - who takes over the role of the iconic nanny from Dame Julie Andrews 54 years after the first movie - has said there ‘are more stories to tell’ and that she’d be more than open to another film.
“Oh, I would pay Rob [Marshall, director] to do it again with me,” she gushed.
“Yeah, I would. Definitely. More stories left to tell.”
Also in conversation with the magazine, director Marshall said, “I do know that there’s a lot of material there and it’s very rich with all kinds of adventures and ideas. It’s certainly ripe for the picking.”
Mary Poppins originates from a series of books by P L Travers, whom Emma Thompson portrayed in the 2013 film ‘Saving Mr Banks’, about the author’s concerns about selling the movie rights of the stories to Disney.
There were eight books in the series, published between 1934 and 1988. ‘Mary Poppins the movie’ - released in 1964 - was based on books 1-4, while the forthcoming Mary ‘Poppins Returns’ is said to be an amalgamation of books 2-8, expanding the story beyond Travers’ original stories.
Of the role of Mary herself, Blunt, 35, added, “She’s a superhero. You could say she’s some sort of angel. She recognizes what people need, and she gives it to them. Yet they discover something about themselves in the process. don’t think she concerns herself with what she is. There’s nobody else like her - which she quite likes.”
Set in 1935 London, 25 years after the events of the original film, the movie features Mary returning to visits a now-grown up Jane and Michael Banks, who have recently suffered a family tragedy.
The movie is scheduled for release on December 19. Daily Mail
