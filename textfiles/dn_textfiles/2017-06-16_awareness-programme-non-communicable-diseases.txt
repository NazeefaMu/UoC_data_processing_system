Awareness programme on non-communicable diseases

All should be aware of non-communicable diseases. People should be careful when consuming food items, Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. K. L. M. Nakfer said.
He was speaking at the awareness programme regarding non-communicable diseases at the Addalaichenai - Konawatta area, organized by the Addalaichenai Al-Ifatha cultural organization, recently.
Dr. Nakfer said due to the lack of physical exercise, most people are diabetic, suffering from blood pressure, heart diseases and paralysis.
“We should refrain from taking oily and fatty foods to prevent diseases. We suffer a lot after being affected by these diseases. Therefore, we should be cautious of our daily food intake. It will be difficult to escape these diseases once we are affected,” he added.
Include about five vegetables with one fruit in the daily diet and the chances of disease are remote. The government also encourages people to take up home-gardening under the 'Divi Neguma' programme. It is essential to carry out physical exercises 30 minutes per day, five days a week, the doctor added.
He said it is important to see that proper vegetable oil is used while cooking. If the oil is used once for frying or cooking, it should not be used again.
Nowadays, women are affected by breast and womb cancer. They should be identified at the initial stage. There are clinics being conducted at M.O.H office for cancer, Dr. Nakfer added.
Eastern Province Opposition Leader M. S. Udumalebbe, Al-Ifatha Cultural Organization Vice- President A.B. Abdul Gaffoor and Management Board members also participated.
