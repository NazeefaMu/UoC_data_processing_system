Tender deposit non refundable
Tenders are called islandwide by private sector, semi government sector, boards, Municipal Councils, government departments etc. for the supply of goods and services.
It is reasonable to demand tender deposits both refundable and non-refundable (tender fee). The tender fee could include VAT and NBT according to the requirement. It is acceptable to request for Rs 1,000 (together with VAT and NBT). Regrettably, it is observed that tender fees ranging from Rs 2,200 to Rs 10,000 being charged by those organisations.
This is done according to the value of the tender. This is not correct. The tender deposits (refundable) could vary according to the value and not the fee which should be charged for the processing of submitted tender application.
It seems some boards, councils etc. are making money exploiting the high demand.
It is high time for the government to define a norm for tender fee for the public sector and keep it fairly reasonable. The private sector will follow that automatically.
