Visually impaired are second to none - Defence Secretary

Those who are visually impaired are second to none and they can achieve any goal. No person with an impairment is less important than any other. They are very talented and reach their goals with sheer determination and commitment,Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne said.
The Defence Secretary was speaking during a ceremony to hand over Braille Character Recognition and Translation into Sinhala Text software to the Principal of the Ratmalana School for the Visually Impaired,at the Ministry premises yesterday, as part of their social responsibility drive.
Defence Secretary Waidyaratne said he had grown up with a friend who was visually impaired,but,he always felt that his lack of sight never deterred him from reaching his goals.
“In fact, my friend entered Law College ahead of me and I always took his determination as an example that if you put your mind to it, there is nothing that one cannot achieve. This event to hand over the Braille Character Recognition and Translation package to the School for the Visually Impaired is perhaps the most important duty, I have performed since I took up this appointment. Research-wise, I am proud of what we have achieved. This institution is not a profit making establishment but one that serves the country,”he said.
The Centre for Research and Development, which functions under the purview of the Ministry of Defence has developed a Software to convert Braille to Sinhala using Computer equipment.
The Centre for Research and Development was established on July 30, 2006 with the aim of establishing a world-class science and technology base providing the military a decisive edge, by equipping them with internationally competitive systems and solutions
