In pursuit of mortality

When 60-year-old Govindarajan, an Alzheimer’s patient, goes missing from a health care centre, it takes his son on a frantic search for his father.
The trio — Tamil director Radhamohan, writer Viji and actor Prakash Raj — who are fondly remembered for their beautiful stories ‘Abhiyum Naanum’, ‘Mozhi’ and ‘Payanam’, return together with their Tamil remake of Kannada film ‘Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu’.
Titled ‘60 (Arubathu) Vayadu Maaniram’ (Sixty years, medium complexion), this has Parakash Raj reprising Anant Nag’s character from the original. Vikram Prabhu takes on the role played by Rakshit Shetty in GBSM. Raj said during an interaction with the press that so keen was he in doing the film that he purchased the rights of the film even before the Kannada film released.
The Tamil version is the result of intense research done on Alzheimer’s and how it effects the patient as well as the care giver.
“We visited a health centre in Bengaluru meant exclusively for Alzheimer’s patients,” said director Radhamohan.
“The Tamil version takes a more in-depth look at the situation. It’s a very thin line that separates one from memory loss.”
Indhuja, who was last seen in Tamil film Mercury, plays a doctor working at the health centre. “I am the bridge between the father and son,” said Indhuja.
Mother-like, she attends to Govindarajan, who is more a child. And with his son, she makes him understand his responsibilities towards his father.
