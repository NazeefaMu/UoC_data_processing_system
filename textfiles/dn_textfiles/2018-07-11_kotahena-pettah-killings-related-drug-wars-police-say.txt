Kotahena, Pettah killings related to drug wars, police say

Investigations pertaining to the Jampettah Street shooting (on July 8) and the Pettah shooting (on July 9) are being carried out under the directives of the DIG in charge of the Colombo area and the Colombo Crimes Division, said Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara.
Gunasekara told the Daily News that both these shootings were connected to drug dealings.
On July 8, a husband and wife were shot and killed on Jampettah Street in Kotahena, at around 8.15 pm. The victims were Elizabeth Perera (50) and her husband Selliah Selvaraj (58). Two others who also sustained gunshot injuries are receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital.
In a previous shooting incident (on June 24) at the same location, a person known as Ganesh was seriously injured. His wife Kudu Selvy was also gunned down several years ago, according to SP Gunasekara. It is reported that the couple who were killed in Sunday’s shooting and Ganesh’s group had a long-standing feud and police suspect that Sunday’s shooting may have been carried out by Ganesh’s group.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Municipal Councillor who was gunned down in Sea Street, Pettah, on July 9, is said to be a person who was out on bail over two cannabis-related cases. The victim, Krishnapillai Thirubanandan alias Krishna (40) had been arrested twice previously for possession of cannabis. On February 7, 2016, he was apprehended for possession of 4 kg and 30 grams of Kerala cannabis and 27 kilos and 615 grams of snuff known as hans and produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court, where he was granted bail.
Further, on October 4, 2016, the Vavuniya Police had apprehended him with 102 kilos and 980 grams of cannabis and he was later produced before the Vavuniya Magistrate’s Court and granted bail.
Police suspect that this killing too is connected to the illegal drugs trade and may have been a result of conflict among rival drug gangs.
