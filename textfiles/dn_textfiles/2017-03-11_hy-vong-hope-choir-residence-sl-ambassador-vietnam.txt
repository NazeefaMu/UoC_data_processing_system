Hy Vong (Hope) Choir  at residence of SL Ambassador to Vietnam

“Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.”
That is what exactly happened on March 5, when the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Vietnam opened her Official Residence to hold the concert by the Hy Vong (Hope) Choir, consisting of students of Nguyen Dinh Chieu School for the Blind.
Initiated by the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Vietnam, Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake, the diplomatic community in Hanoi joined to support the concert. The Choir comprised of 20 talented visually-impaired singers and musicians who play Vietnamese folk musical instruments. They practiced under the direction of renowned musicians Ton That Triem and his opera singer spouse, Nguyen Xuan Thanh.
Triem formed the Hope Choir over 10 years ago training students to sing in many different languages. The current choristers sing in over 30 languages including Azerbaijani, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Malaysian, Polish, African, Georgian, Irish, Japanese, Welsh, Swedish, Polish, Armenian, Malay, Vietnamese, Sinhala, etc.
Addressing the audience the Ambassador explained that she had the opportunity to listen to Christmas Carols by the Hope Choir last December and how heart-warming it was to see their perseverance singing in many different languages.
Having come to know the Choir’s financial difficulties to continue with their good work, she had immediately talked to Friends of the Vietnam Heritage who arranged the Christmas Carols event to raise funds. The Ambassador explaining he desire to help the choir said it is probably due to her Sri Lankan culture that values the concept of donations and sharing.
