Sri Lanka opt to bowl first

Angelo Mathews won the toss and chose to bowl first expecting early assistance from the Hambantota surface, but Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer was pleased his team would be defending a score, as he felt the pitch would deteriorate as the day went on.
A ferocious crosswind that has been blowing across the ground since the morning will test both sides.
Zimbabwe made two changes to their XI. They changed one seam bowler, replacing Donald Tiripano with Carl Mumba, who was a late addition to the squad - flying in after Wellington Masakadza was ruled out of the series with an ankle injury. They also made a change in their batting order, bringing in Tarisai Musakanda for Ryan Burl.
Sri Lanka were unchanged, with Lakshan Sandakan and Wanidu Hasaranga making up the frontline spin-bowling contingent, and Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga, and Nuwan Pradeep playing as the frontline quicks.
There is no rain forecast for the duration of the match.
