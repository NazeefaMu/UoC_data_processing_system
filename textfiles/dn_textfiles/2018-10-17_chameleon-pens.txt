Chameleon pens

Alcohol-based markers can be some of the best tools in any artist’s arsenal. Whether you are an accomplished artist, a creative crafter, or a beginning hobbyist, markers like Chameleon Pens will help you take your creativity up a notch. They can easily integrate into any project you’re working on.
To understand how they work and how to unlock their full potential, it’s important to know what an alcohol-based marker is and how it differs from your standard water-based marker. An alcohol marker has pigment or dye suspended in alcohol, making them fluid and fast-drying. With vibrant colour and the ability to layer and blend seamlessly, they are a must-have item for most artists. An added bonus is that you can use these permanent markers on a wide variety of surfaces. From fabric and wood to ceramics and plastic, you don’t have to limit yourself just to paper.
Chameleon Pens is an innovative product that combines a high-quality alcohol marker and Mixing Chamber. By infusing the pen nib with the Mixing Chamber, you can create incredible gradations of colour in a single stroke. Known for achieving “Colour like no other,” the revolutionary marker opens up even greater possibilities when it comes to creating high-level art.
To get the most out of these refillable markers, let’s look at some of the key colouring techniques that a Chameleon Pen can accomplish with ease.
Bright, crisp colour is one of the hallmarks of alcohol markers. As they dry quickly, you can easily layer colour to build up the dimension in your work without worrying that the colours will appear muddy. Using a slight touch, you can feather colours onto one another for a seamless transition that isn’t possible with other types of markers. This overlay allows you to create new colours right on the page. If you think about the fact that there are 52 Chameleon Pen colours to select from even before you start layering, this gives an idea of the endless colour combinations that are right at your fingertips.
It’s even possible to stack your colours by infusing your Chameleon Pen with more than one colour top to get a silky blend of shades to make your artwork pop.
