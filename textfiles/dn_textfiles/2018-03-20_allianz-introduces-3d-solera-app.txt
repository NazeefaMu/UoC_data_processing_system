Allianz introduces 3D Solera App

Allianz Lanka announced the launch of Allianz 3D – Solera App, a revolutionary, mobile-based, assessment application that is set to transform Sri Lanka’s motor insurance landscape.
Rewriting the rules of accident damage assessment, the Allianz 3D – Solera App enables policyholders to carry out vehicle inspections by themselves in the unfortunate event of an accident. They simply need to photograph their vehicle using the app, mark the damaged area in its 3D garage and share the images with Allianz.
Having completed this simple, three step process, they can immediately move the vehicle from the spot and continue with their day to day lives. Thus, it eliminates the need to wait for assessors to visit the accident site to evaluate the damage.
Reviewing the images received, Allianz Lanka’s engineers assess the damage, compute the settlement amount and send an SMS update to the policyholder within a day. The claims team then gets in touch with the policyholder on the following day to get additional details and check if he / she is okay with the offered amount. Once an agreement has been reached, the funds are transferred to the policyholder’s bank account on the next working day.
Thus, the Allianz 3D – Solera App helps policyholders save a considerable amount of time and effort. Streamlining the entire claims process, right from accident reporting to claims settlement, it has also made it completely paperless.
“At Allianz, we continue to harness the power of technology to offer greater convenience to our customers around the world. In line with this, we are delighted to dedicate the Allianz 3D – Solera assessment mobile application to our customers in Sri Lanka,” Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka said.
Allianz Lanka policyholders can download and install the Allianz 3D – Solera App for free directly from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store or from Allianz Lanka’s website.
They can also download it through the SMS notification they receive at the time of making a claim with Allianz’scall center. The insurer is initially piloting this service between 6a.m. to 6p.m., 7 days a week, to private motorcar owners alone.
Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd. and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka Ltd., known together as Allianz Lanka, are fully-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, Germany, a world leader in integrated financial services.
