Book review:Kafka captured

English reading public will be thankful to O.T. Perera for writing a book on Franz Kafka, his celebrated novel The Trial and a critical study relevant to this novel. The content of O.T.’s book has been divided into six chapters, namely Franz Kafka: A life, The Trial: the story, Interpretation of the Trial, the problem of interpretation, the world of France Kafka and afterward. The intention of O.T. in each chapter is to forward his knowledge, feelings and understanding of Franz Kafka together with the novel- The trial.
The author has attempted to give a detailed account related to the life story of Kafka in the first chapter. A number of photos have been included in this regard to portrait different incidents associated with this great novelist. Altogether there are twenty three photos. These photos are the authentic evidence which elucidates Kafka’s life more than words. One of them includes O.T.’s visiting of Kafka’s tombstone. The second chapter includes the complete story : The Trial. The third chapter deals with the interpretation of the story. It exemplifies O.T. ‘s real contribution to Kafka’s literary service. He attempts to interpret Kafka’s philosophy and literary .views while forwarding his ideas together with details selected from other literary critics. Since O.T is not satisfied with his interpretations, he includes the fourth chapter explaining the problems of interpretation.
The other two chapters are devoted to describe the literary world created by the novelist together with concluding remarks about him. O.T concludes this chapter as follows.
“ He longed for a system of thought or belief that would transcend the distinction between the various compartments of life. It may be that he sensed, but would not accept, the limitation of reason, and new in his heart that only faith, which he thought was denied him, could answer his longing. He gives not an interpretation of the world in which there is desperate need for a synthesis of many interpretations, each of which is doubted. He exposes the apparent absurdity of reality, and equally the absurdity of the human mind that judges it to be absurd”.
At the end of this book the writer provides a list of major works of Kafka and contribution of other critics towards his literary service. Kafka was born in July 3, 1883, in Prague, capital of present Czech Republic and grew up in an upper middle class Jewish family.
Kafka did not intend to publish any of his works during the life time. All his writings were published posthumously. The following note addressed to his close friend- Max Brod- discloses this fact.
“Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me (that is, in the book cases, chest of drawers, writing- table, both at home and in the office, or wherever anything may have got to, whatever you happen to find), in the way of note books, manuscripts, letters, my own and other people’s, sketches and so on, is to be burned unread and to the last page, as well as all writings of mine or notes which either you may have or other people, from whom you are to beg them in my name.
Letters which are not handed over to you should at least be faithfully burned by those who have them”. Franz Kafka.
Bellanwila O.T. Perera while living with his beloved wife in England continue to write article on various aspects of life and society to the Sinhala Newspapers in Sri Lanka. As I understand he is interested in creative writing and analyzing the world literature. He has published a Sinhala short story book known as Bindunu Pingana (Broken Plate). Camus and Kafka (A Critical Assessment of the two writers), Sinamaven Samugat Satyajit Rayi (Life and Work of Satyajit Ray) and Rabindranat Tagore (Biography). Franz Kafka is his first book written in English. It is my fervent wish that O.T. will write more English books in the future on world literature.
