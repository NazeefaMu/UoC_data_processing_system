TREADING ON UNCOMMON GROUNDS

Her resume reads like it belongs to three or four different people. The reason behind this is that she has shown skills in many diverse directions. 26-year-old Buddhima Subasinghe continues to make waves in many sectors.
The multitalented youth completed her PhD in the field of Cyber Crime Investigation and Conflict Resolution in Social Media using Web Artificial Intelligence in 2016. She is the only Sri Lankan researcher who presented her PhD research at the first global IEEE International Women In Engineering Conference On Electrical And Computer Engineering WIECON-ECE 2015 in December 2015. She has completed the ITIL Professional Foundation Examination for IT Service Management (ITSM) scoring 100 percent marks in 2014. Buddhima has won the Best Research Paper Gold Award at the National Conference on Technology and Management 2014 for a publication of the PhD Research. She has also been appointed to represent Sri Lanka at the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), Technical Committee TC14 from June 2016 as an academic and a scholar researching in the field of Information Communication Technology.
Buddhima was the first English Buddhist news bulletin producer and presenter at the Buddhist Channel Sri Lanka. She is working in Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooperation as a presenter from 2011.
“It all comes down to your focus. If you are fully focused on something at a time, you can give your 100 percent to it. I also sleep less than four hours per day. This habit came about when I got heavily involved in the media during my university days. Media was my passion and I even wrote to several newspapers during that era,” she said.
She notes that another reason for her focus is the spiritual development that she has gained. She has been mindful of thoughts that run through her mind for several years.
“It has always been so as I have studied in the Sri Sambodhi Vihara English Dhamma School ever since I was five years. I have been brought up in a very religious background. It has been over a decade that I am teaching Abidhamma in my Dhamma School. I finished the diploma in Dhamma and Abhi Dhamma in 2007. I have been practicing meditation and training my mind to be mindful about all the tasks I do, be it lecturing, speaking at a conference, driving, studying etc. The right focus has always been the key to my success,” she added.
She stepped into the media field through the Buddhist Channel. Her first task was to present the Sinhala news bulletin there. She was 18 years old then. This too was a challenge since she has always done her studies in English.
“However I did not let the opportunity go. I decided to byheart the content and got the opportunity to do the news for a few months before starting the first English news bulletin in the channel as the producer and the presenter,” she said.

She moved onto discussion based programs later. She got an invitation from SLRC and hosted ‘Rise and Shine’ morning show and ‘Business Today’ on a rostered basis.
Buddhima was the head prefect of Willesden College International for two years. She did bio chemistry, physics and maths originally but wanted to shift to applied ITC during her second year.
“Gateway College gave me that opportunity so I went to there and studied the content of the two year Advanced Level syllabus in one year. I was basically a student of both schools during my final year,” Buddhima explained with a smile.
She completed her London GCE Advanced Level Examination in 2008 before joining SLIIT where she took up a double degree. She became the youngest graduate at the institute and joined the staff there. She completed her PhD at Peradeniya University in 2016. She will be taking up studies at the Engineering Faculty at Moratuwa University next month.
Buddhima has been invited to be a speaker at several renowned programs like IEEE Young Professionals and Women in Engineering Congress 2016, APNIC 42 International Conference, and IEEE Young Professionals and Women in Engineering Congress 2015. She was the MC and Moderator for the 13th AGM of the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development and the International Summit on Climatic Change, Adaptation and Mitigation, the Moderator and Discussion Facilitator at the World Conference on Youth, and a Young Ambassador at the Commonwealth heads of the Government meeting. She has won accolades from Toastmasters International. She has been invited to speak at the IEEE Global Women in Engineering Leadership Summit 2017 that will be held from July 13 to 15 in Goa, India.

Queried on what she found challenging in all the tasks that she has handled so far Buddhima said that she has gotten double promotions ever since her school days.
“I was always the youngest in the class. Therefore every single moment in my life was filled with difficulties. I had to put on a lot of effort to reach my goals in life,” she said dubbing her life as a ‘rollercoaster journey.’
Buddhima’s father, K D K Subasinghe, is a customs officer. Her mother, Chandralatha Subasinghe, had been employed at the Higher Education Ministry. Her brother, Umesh Ravindu, is in grade seven.
The day that she completed the defense examination of her PhD was the most memorable moment for her because that was the last stage of examination.
“That was my happiest moment in life because I have been working really hard for it. There have been a lot of professors who have offered many encouraging words throughout my life. I am forever grateful to them. I am also thankful to my Toastmasters family from which I have achieved great heights in leadership. This year I have assumed duties as the Toastmasters International Training and Leadership Institute Chair for District 82,” she noted.

Buddhima has a few words of wisdom to offer to the youth.
“If you can practice living in the present moment, you can certainly make most out of what you do in life and achieve great heights and reach the pinnacle of success. As an Abi dhamma teacher for a decade or so, I have been practicing what I teach my students, the beauty of the practice of right concentration and mindfulness, which has immensely supported me and has been a blessing in my life,” she expressed.

“I always love to do something different and inspire people as over the years it has given me a great satisfaction in seeing people taking me as an example in their lives. When people come up to you and say, ‘Buddhima, you are a role model, I want to be like you’ - that means a lot to me. I feel I have achieved myself.”
In all of the discoveries in life she believes that discovering oneself is very important. Once this is done, one needs to live his or her passion with courage, determination and the right focus.
“You can accomplish your dreams if the right action is taken towards its attainment. Do what you love and love what you do. I am who I am today all because I am passionate about what I do every single moment in my life. I adore, love, and enjoy all that I do. And I do it all with a smile,” she concluded.
