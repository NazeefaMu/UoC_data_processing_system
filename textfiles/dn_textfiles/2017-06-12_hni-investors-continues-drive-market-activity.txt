Point of view
Equities ended in the red for the second consecutive week as the benchmark price index slipped ~20 points to end at 6668.96 over the week.
The ASPI which hit a 1-week low to 6664.00 on Thursday, managed to trim some of its losses by Friday, with the 5 point recovery on Friday helping marginally lower the rest of the week’s 25 point loss.
Average turnover levels meanwhile amounted to LKR 0.87bn during the holiday shortened week (+5% increase W-o-W) as market activity was pre-dominantly HNI & Institutional driven while retail investors remained on the sidelines.

Large parcels in Colombo Cold Stores (33% of the total turnover) and JKH (7% of the total turnover) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover and these transactions accounted for ~40% of the week’s total market turnover.
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net buyers for the 19th consecutive week (since Feb’17), with foreign buying for the week rising 216% W-o-W to LKR 2.37bn in counters such as JKH,LFIN, EXPO resulting in net inflow position of LKR 0.68Bn.
YTD net inflows to the Bourse consequently add up to LKR19.61Bn cf. a net outflow of LKR 5.83Bn during the Jan-May’16 last year. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Financial flows
in Q1 reflect global EM appetite
Sri Lanka’s Trade Deficit in Q1’17 widened 35% Y-o-Y as the marginal improvement in Exports over March failed to offset higher Import expenses.
Despite Exports in March reversing the declining trend experienced over Jan and Feb, Import expenses rose +19.4% Y-o-Y on the back of increased fuel Imports (+51.4% Y-o-Y) amid higher demand for thermal and coal based power generation.
Tourist inflows over the quarter meanwhile, rose a marginal 3.4% Y-o-Y as March arrivals were impacted by the partial closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport.
Worker remittances however, declined 3.3% Y-o-Y over Q1’17 as adverse economic and geopolitical conditions continued to dominate in the Middle Eastern region.
Tracking the stronger global demand for EM/FM assets though, net inflows to the CSE rose a significant 767% Y-o-Y over the quarter while inflows to G-Securities rose ~551% Y-o-Y.
Although over a low base (inflows to CSE in Q1’17 was $83Mn cf. outflow of $13Mn in Q1’16 while foreign investment in T-bonds/bills was $282Mn cf. $43Mn in Q1’16), the increase reflects stronger risk appetite for EM/FM assets over Q1’17, which have experienced the strongest portfolio inflows since 20141.
Indeed, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) forecasts, that Non-resident capital inflows to EMs should reach $970 Bn in 2017, up 35% Y-o-Y as near-term threats of trade conflict have waned over the last 5 months.
The Group expects foreign portfolio inflows to rise to >$1 trillion in 2018 although at a net level, the IIF anticipates overall net capital outflows from EMs in 2017 due to resident capital outflows from China1.
