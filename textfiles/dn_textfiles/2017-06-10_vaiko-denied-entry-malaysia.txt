Vaiko denied entry into Malaysia

MDMK Chief Vaiko was stopped from entering Malaysia on Friday morning as his name is on the list of people who are against Malaysia. Vaiko went to Malaysia to attend the marriage of Penang Deputy Chief Minister Prof. Ramasamy that is to be held on June 10.
Vaiko was stopped at the Kuala Lumpur airport at 6.30 a.m. and the officials there told him that he could not be allowed to enter the country due to his LTTE connections.
Vaiko will be sent back to India in a flight that reaches Chennai at 10.45 pm on Friday.
