The emergence of highway infrastructure to a country will create so many benefits. The benefits are social, economical and environmental. Sri Lanka can learn many lessons from nearby South Eastern Asian countries of the importance of highways. The highway network accentuates the focus on key highways serving inter- province and international commerce.
The competitiveness of the Sri Lanka in the global marketplace relies upon expectations for improved intermodal linkages between the highway system and other transportation modes. Economic impacts arising from these linkages will yield significant effects on the overall economy, the standard of living of citizens, and the competitiveness of industry.
In order to achieve development as a country, we need to have proper infrastructure in place. The electricity, water, roads, highways, energy like solar, hydropower are the major infrastructures for a country to develop. Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle income country. The policy makers should learn lessons from nearby developed countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia so as to develop infrastructure in Sri Lanka. All these countries maintain highways and it has become one another secret behind their success compared to Sri Lanka.
Less fuel consumption
Sri Lanka needs few more highways such as Colombo – Kandy, Colombo – Dambulla towards Jaffna, Dambulla – Batticaloa, Colombo Ratnapura via Avissawella, Colombo – Matara highway extension up to Hambantota and Kataragama and those should be merged with outer circular highway in Colombo which likes a golden ring.

Then, officers do not need to find accommodation from Colombo and will have happy family lives. Their children will be with parents in the night and weekends and saved time can be utilized for worthy matter. This approach will reduce urbanization in the country.
It takes to reach Nittambuwa area from Pettah around three hours during rush hours and also to travel to Moratuwa from Pettah takes same time. This environment creates stressful among people working in Colombo and nearby towns.
