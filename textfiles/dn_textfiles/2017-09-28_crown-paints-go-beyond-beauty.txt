Crown Paints go beyond beauty

Crown Paints will be the title sponsor for the Sri Lankan crowning of one of the three most recognized international pageants in the world. CROWN Miss Intercontinental Sri Lanka 2017 will have its Coronation Pageant at the Hilton Colombo on September 24.
“CROWN Miss Intercontinental Sri Lanka 2017 is well aligned with JAT’s values which include creating leaders through a knowledge driven culture. As one of the top ten conglomerates in Sri Lanka and one known to emphasize unwavering quality and unsurpassed innovation, the pageant itself is one that exemplifies all that JAT stands for and is clearly articulated in our tag, Transforming Spaces, which is what this pageant does by transforming the pageant industry space,” JAT Holdings Managing Director, Aelian Gunawardene said.
Gunawardene adds that the company believes strongly in empowering women. “Our teams thrive on this platform of equality and meritocracy and hence, as a corporate leader, we believe we must nurture people to maximize their talent, skill and competencies to become spearheads within their communities and the country. This is the ideal springboard therefore for us to build on those qualities, empowering these young women, each of who have displayed immense intelligence coupled with beauty, a winning combination that can be honed for the betterment of society as a whole,” he added.
