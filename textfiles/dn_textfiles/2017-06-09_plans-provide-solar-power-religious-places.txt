Plans to provide solar power to religious places

Measures are being taken to provide solar power to all religious places, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said the initiative will help religious places to bring down their energy and utility bills while contributing to a more greener and a sustainable environment which will also indirectly motivate the devotees to switch to renewable energy.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony at the Dodamgaslanda temple yesterday.
“Efficient use of renewable energy will be introduced to the people by making religious places switch to solar power use,”he said. Minister Siyambalapitiya further said that solar power has contributed more than 50 Mega Watts to the National Grid in a short time. “We spend huge amounts of money to import fossil fuels. We have to focus more on the use of renewable energy sources to save foreign exchange,”he said.
