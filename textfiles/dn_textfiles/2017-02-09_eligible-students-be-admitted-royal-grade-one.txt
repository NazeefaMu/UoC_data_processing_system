Eligible students to be admitted to Royal Grade One

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said qualified and suitable students in the waiting list will be recruited to Grade One of Royal College, Colombo in place of students whose admissions were halted following the forwarding of fraudulent documents.
The Minister said that it has been scheduled to complete the Grade 1 admission process by next week after selecting students from the second list (Waiting list).
He told the media that 31 children, whose parents had applied for Grade One admissions at Royal College allegedly using fraudulent documents, were de-listed.
The admissions to Grade One had been suspended after the Education Ministry received several complaints including a complaint from the Principal of the college itself to look into the alleged irregularities in the admission process. The Ministry then launched a special inquiry into the admission process on the advice of the Minister by appointing an inquiring committee.
“The inquiry was launched after receiving several complaints about the irregularities that are alleged to have taken place in the admission process. We have investigated 147 addresses mentioned in the applications and have recovered 31 fraudulently prepared documents” Minister Kariyawasam said.
He added the documents had addresses of several public places, security counters, religious places and business establishments.
On the recommendations of the inquiring committee, seven education officers allegedly involved in malpractices during the admission process were interdicted. These officials served on the interview board and the appeal board.
Minister Kariyawasam said that investigation relating Grade One admission process of other 15 schools is being held and the Ministry will take tough action against errant officers without considering their positions.
