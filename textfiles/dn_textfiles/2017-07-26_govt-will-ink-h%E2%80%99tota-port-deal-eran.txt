Govt will ink H’tota Port deal - Eran

The government will go ahead with singing the agreement to lease the Hambantota Port to Chinese companies irrespective of protests in the streets, said State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne. “Several people have misunderstood the whole Hambantota Port deal,” he alleged.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 which kicked off yesterday at Cinnamon Grand he said that the deal is not only about leasing a non productive port in Hambantota to a Chinese company but it has multi pronged benefits.”Firstly the deal would bring in almost US $ 400 million foreign exchange to Sri Lanka within the first year of operation and this amount would increase to US $ 2.1 billion subsequently.
Since independence successive governments have neglected Moneragala and Hambantota districts and with the Hambantota deal economic benefits would directly trickle down to people in these areas ushering economic prosperity.
He said similarly Trincomalee Port too would be developed with assistance from India, Japan and Singapore and this area too would see an economic transformation.
The minister said that in addition several meaningful steps were been taken and Sri Lanka is now heading in the right direction.
Dr. Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development said that the port city development was now on track and currently 45% of reclamation has been done. “We are confident that piling could start next year and the proposed financial centre would be the main draw and the project would open out several investment opportunities to both local and foreign investors.
He however said that Sri Lanka has badly failed in the export sector and business establishments should seriously look at more exports. “Only IT and appeal exports have diversity,” he pointed out. He also said that Sri Lanka has to pay Rs 4.5 trillion as debt serving this year.
Governor Central bank Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that anti dumping bill, trade adjustment pack and several economic reforms were been formulated and implemented soon to make Sri Lanka more attractive to investors and also entrepreneurs.
The Governor further said that with the regaining of the GSP Plus and access to China, India and SAACR region, Sri Lanka has a readymade market of over 3 billion people and no other country has this kind of advantage.
