Railway unions call off strike

 
Railway unions today called off their planned 48-hour token strike following discussions with the Prime Minister’s Secretary.
H.M Athulasena, speaking on behalf of the trade unions said that the unions - comprising station masters, drivers and guards - had decided to launch the token strike in protest of the Salary and Cadre Commission’s failure to implement the recommendations with regard to their salaries.
He further said that the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has made recommendations with regard to their salaries, but the Commission had showed reluctance to implement the recommendations.
