A government English teacher died yesterday at Kuliyapitiya Governmet Hospital due to bleeding in the brain and later, her two kidneys were donated by her husband to be utilized for transplanting.
Two patients who were in need of kidneys in the Kurunegala District received her kidneys.
The female teacher who passed away was M. M. Sureen Dilanka, 29, of the Kattimahana area in Kurunegala. The husband, who consented to donate his wife’s kidneys, was Amila Niranjaya Fernando, 33. This was the first occasion in the history of the Kuliyapitiya Hospital where the organs of a dead patient were removed to be donated.
