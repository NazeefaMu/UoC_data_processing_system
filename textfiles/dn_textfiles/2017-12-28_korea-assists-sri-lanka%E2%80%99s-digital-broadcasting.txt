Korea assists Sri Lanka’s digital broadcasting

Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a part of ODA business, donated Media Assets Management and Digital Audio Archiving System to Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) for better conditions for the broadcasting environment.
The Korea Radio Promotion Association and the Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka on behalf of the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, and around 50 related parties from SLRC and SLBC attended the ceremony.
Korea and Sri Lanka have continuously developed relations on politics, economy, social and cultural spheres since the diplomatic ties established in 1977. The latest donation marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Korea and Sri Lanka.
The Korea Radio Promotion Association officials stated that with the donation, improvement in the quality of broadcasting and work efficiency is expected as SLRC and SLBC’s analog contents (tape, LPs etc) can be converted, edited, stored and managed into more than 50,000 hours of digital files through the supported system.
“We hope this serves as an opportunity for the two countries to progress and continue to enrich the field of media broadcasting through continuous mutual exchange of technologies,” the Korean officials said.
