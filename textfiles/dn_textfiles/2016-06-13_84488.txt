Japan gain first America’s Cup World Series win

CHICAGO, Sunday: Light winds again wreaked havoc on the America's Cup World Series races in Chicago Saturday, but Team Japan had the satisfaction of seeing their first win go up on the board. The Japanese team, skippered by Dean Barker, won the “substitute race” sailed on Friday, and with the winds too light and unstable to support Saturday's planned schedule officials scored it as the first official race of the Chicago stop. - AFP
