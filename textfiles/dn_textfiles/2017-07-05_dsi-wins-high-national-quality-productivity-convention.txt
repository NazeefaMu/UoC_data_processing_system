The outcome of winning 12 awards at this convention is something really commendable and it is something we should be proud of.
We must appreciate the tedious work that has gone into organizing a convention of this magnitude by SLAAQP and such yeoman service will certainly drive the organization to overcome the competition in the global arena.,” said Group Managing Director, Kulathunga Rajapaksa.
