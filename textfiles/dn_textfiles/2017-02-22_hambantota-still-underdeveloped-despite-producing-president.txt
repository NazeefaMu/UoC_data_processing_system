Hambantota still underdeveloped despite producing a President

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he was surprise that the state hospitals in the Hambantota district are still not developed in spite of the district having produced a President, Economic Development Minister and a member of Parliament.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Tangalle base hospital is located opposite the house of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but there are many shortcomings in it. This happens when decisions are being made based on political agendas.
It was decided to construct a 10 storeyed building for the Tangalle Hospital. All hospitals in the Hambantota district will be developed by this government, said Senaratne. He was addressing the inauguration of the new provincial blood transfusion centre at Tangalle hospital and engaging in an inspection tour.
He pointed out that it is appropriate to take over some base hospitals because there are shortcomings and issues in them. Some are staff issues and financial issues in hospitals administrated by Provincial Councils.
He noted that it is difficult for the Provincial Councils to manage them.
A project on effectively managing clinical waste of state hospitals is now in progress in the Colombo district with the assistance of a local company. An Australian company has proposed to implement a similar project for all other state hospitals, the Minister added.
