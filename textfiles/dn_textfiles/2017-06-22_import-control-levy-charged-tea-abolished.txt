Import control levy charged on tea abolished

The government will abolish the 1 percent import control levy charged on tea imported for re-export and instead charge a license fee of Rs.1,000 for each license issued in this regard.
A joint memorandum of the above proposal was presented for Cabinet approval this week by Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
Accordingly, the levy would be abolished by removing item No.46 from Schedule 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette No 1953/28 published on February 11,2016.
