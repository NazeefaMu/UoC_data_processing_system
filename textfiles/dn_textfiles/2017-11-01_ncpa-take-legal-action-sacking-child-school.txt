NCPA to take legal action for sacking child from school

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) will take action under Section 308 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act Number 22 of 1995 in connection with the incident where a child had been sacked from her school after vomiting one morning, NCPA sources said.
According to the sources, the child was produced before a consultant psychiatrist to find out whether she had undergone trauma when she was sacked from her school on a fabricated accusation. However, it was proven that she was not pregnant and was a virgin. According to details revealed by several investigations conducted by several parties and media reports, the child had vomited in school one morning, and school teachers and the principal had sacked her from the school stating that vomiting is a sign of pregnancy.
The school authorities had taken the signature from the child’s parents who were illiterate to a letter which stated that the parents willingly removed their child from school.
