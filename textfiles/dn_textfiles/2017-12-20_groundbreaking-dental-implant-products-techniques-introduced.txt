Groundbreaking dental implant products, techniques introduced

Oram, a company in the forefront of promoting dental implant products, has taken the initiative to introduce OSSTEM’s state-of-the art dental implants.
Strong and stable, a dental implant restores a lost tooth so that it looks, feels, fits and functions like a natural tooth when implanted by an experienced implant dentist. Other options such as dentures or bridges can lead to bone deterioration, and other activities of everyday life. Dental implants are built to last.
Oram has joined hands with the global giant, OSSTEM, which has consistently expanded in research and development in the field, to deliver the most innovative and premier quality of dental implant procedures and products, Oram Managing Director Mushtaq Jabir said.
On December 15, Oram started the Basic and Intermediate Implant Course for six days at the Hilton Colombo Residencies, Union Place, Colombo 2. The programme includes lectures, live demos, hands-on experience and surgery using the OSSTEM dental implant products. The programme is conducted by leading experts in the field of dental implantology.
Dental implantology has become a critical element of dental treatment particularly due to the ageing population, rising incomes, the growing interest in health and dental esthetic and other social factors.
Oram, which strives to expand its horizons continuously, has initiated in bringing world class education.They have conducted many workshop in dental implantology in Sri Lanka targeting medical experts in the field. Basic and Intermediate Implant Course from OSSTEM in Sri Lanka is one of the initiatives by Oram targeting medical experts in the field. Training for the first batch of doctors was successfully conducted in March this year.
“We will continuously strive to provide most excellent support to our valued clients by strengthening customer service and offering new and improved educational programmes. We will actively pursue our key management goal of “bettering the livelihood and health of all” and become the forerunner in setting the global standard in the field of dental implantology in Sri Lanka,” Jabi said
