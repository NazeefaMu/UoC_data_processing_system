SLPP to contest independently

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will contest the upcoming polls independently, party Chairman Prof. G. L. Peiris said yesterday.
The former minister said members of the Joint Opposition too will field candidates under the SLPP banner and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa MP will provide leadership to the polls campaign. Peiris also ruled out any coalition with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and stressed that the SLPP was determined to go it alone.
Speaking to journalists in Colombo, Peiris said the SLPP was confident of winning the polls as the government’s popularity was at a low ebb. He said already, the SLPP had placed candidates’ deposits for six districts. He said the SLPP will field candidates for all LG bodies.
The Gazette notice to hold the LG elections for 93 LG bodies was issued on Monday.
Nominations will be accepted from December 11 to 14.
