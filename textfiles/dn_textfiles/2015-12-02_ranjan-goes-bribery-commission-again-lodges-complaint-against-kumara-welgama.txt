Ranjan goes to Bribery Commission again; lodges complaint against Kumara Welgama

Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake accompanied by Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
This complaint has been based on a large scale financial fraud which had occurred in the importation of buses for the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) during 2013-2014.
According to Ramanayake, the former minister has defrauded Rs. 2,860 million from 2,200 buses.
Accordingly Welgama has benefited by USD 10,000 from each bus. "Though they have imported 2200 buses, Cabinet approval had been granted to import only 1,500. They had imported 700 buses without Cabinet approval. They have paid USD 50,000 for a bus, but the correct price is only USD 40,000," he said.
The deputy minister was speaking to the media after arriving at the Bribery Commission yesterday to lodge a complaint and to inquire into the fate of the complaints he had lodged previously.
"We have no any personal issue with former Minister Kumara Welgama or others who held ministerial posts during the previous regime. But we need to take legal action against those who played out public money," Ramanayake said.
He also charged that there was only one company which had permission to import vehicle spare parts and it is said to be owned by a relative or friend of Welgama.
All details in this regard will be revealed at the investigations, the deputy ministers said.
Deputy Transport Minister Abeysinghe said that the bus fare will never be increased as demanded by several private bus organisations.
He said that the ministry has called for tenders to purchase 10 new train engines, 15 power sets and 160 train compartments and all of these are done in a transparent manner.
