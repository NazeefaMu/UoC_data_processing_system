World Mental Health Day falls on October 10
Tackling mental health issues

World Mental Health Day 2018 falls on October 10 with the theme “Young people and mental health in a changing world”.
Global medical statistics reveal that half of all mental illness begins by the age of 14. There is also growing evidence that the transmission of these disorders can be reversed through early recognition and intervention. And yet shockingly, though 38 per cent of Sri Lanka’s population consist of the young people, the majority of those who are having mental disorders do not receive any form of professional care. (The term young people refer to persons between 10–24 years, as used by WHO and others to combine adolescents and youth.)
There are reasons for this negligence. First relates to our “social attitude.” Most Sri Lankans, even the adolescents, hold negative attitudes towards people with mental illness. Often the negative attitudes involve a perception that people with mental disorders are violent and dangerous. This perception is fuelled by media stories which paint violent perpetrators as “mentally ill” (without providing the context of the broad spectrum of mental illness).
The bias is not limited to people who are either uninformed or uneducated; in fact, even the highly educated people hold these very same stereotypes. The end result, however, manifests as social distancing from the persons supposed to be having mental illness.
Family attitude
The second reason relates to the “family attitude.” The average Sri Lankan parents, when their children show signs of mental disorder, seek help from local spiritual healers to get rid of the “bad influence” of evil spirits.
Only very little systematic examination has been done of the effectiveness of spiritual healing in treating mental illness or alleviating psychological distress. Certain evidence suggests that it may provide some psychosocial intervention and might help to relieve distress. However, no evidence exists to suggest that they change the course of severe mental illnesses such as bipolar and psychotic disorders.
Important facts
A report commissioned by the Ministry of Health on “Mental Health Status of Adolescents in Sri Lanka, 2017” reveals some interesting facts. (1) Suicidal behaviour is a serious problem among the young in Sri Lanka. The percentage of that reported attempted suicide at least once in 12 months was 7% while suicidal ideation was 9%. (2) The percentage of young people who have reported feeling lonely most of the time or always in the past 12 months was 9% and anxiety (could not sleep because of being worried) was reported by 5%. (3) A substantial proportion of the young also have reported having no close friends. Female students were more likely to report feeling lonely, anxious and not having close friends than male students. (4) The current use of smoking cigarettes among the young were 9%, alcohol users 3%, marijuana users 3%. (5) Overall 10% of the students in Sri Lanka use multiple substances or one of these substances in the past 30 days.
The report adds: “This data shows that a significant proportion of children had the warning signals of mental health problems highlighting need for early intervention. Appropriate measures need to be taken to prevent suicides by observing the factors significantly linked to suicidal behaviour. Steps can then be taken to identify adolescents who have serious suicidal ideation so that interventions can be taken to reduce the suicidal rate.”
Suggestions
While those recommendations needed to be considered seriously, this writer wishes pen down few of his thoughts also.
Any effective mental health care is closely linked to the culture of the community, thus culturally-sensitive programmes should be developed, e.g. in Sri Lanka we have deeply religious beliefs, strong family ties etc. At the same time, we must also understand that a substantial proportion of mental health care is provided by the informal sector (faith healers, religious healers, traditional healers). This sensitive issue needs to be addressed carefully by the Government, professionals and civil society. The practices should be scientifically evaluated and if appropriate and effective, they should be promoted.
Sri Lanka has a well-knitted community mental health model. It is the optimum direction for future development of mental health services and based on following proven observations: (a) Evidence that community-based mental health care is superior to psychiatry hospital-based care. (b) Great scarcity of qualified mental health professionals to meet all the needs of the community. (c) Problems in transportation of patients from their homes to tertiary-care hospitals. (d) Preference of people to seek health care locally in the community.
However, community mental health services should meet all the mental health needs of the community, including mental health promotion, prevention of mental illness, psychosocial needs of the community, needs of special groups (adolescents, elderly etc.), prevention of harm from substance abuse, etc.
Community mental health service should be integrated into the existing primary health care delivery system to ensure its long-term sustainability.
To make the above aspirations achievable, an essential component is the establishment of community awareness programmes. They need to focus on issues such as: (a) Medical nature of mental illness (b) Changing the health-seeking behaviour of the community (c) Stigma removal (d) Removal of myths and misconceptions (e) Ensure community ownership of the programme (f) Preparation of communities and families to care for persons with mental illness.
Prevention
Prevention of mental disorders begins with being aware of and understanding the early warning signs and their symptoms. Parents and teachers can help build life skills of children and the youth to help them cope with everyday challenges at home and at school. Psycho-social support can be provided in schools and other community settings and, of course, training for health workers to enable them to detect and manage mental health disorders can be put in place, improved or expanded.
Spending time with the family, friends and other loved ones is one of the best predictors for psychological well-being and protection against mental health issues.
The responsibility to address the needs of young people with social, emotional, and behavioural challenges often falls initially on teachers as the school is where many of them are spending a large portion of their day. Many teachers do not feel equipped to meet their students’ emotional needs, which results in many of them being under-referred for mental health treatment.
Teachers should be trained to recognise symptoms; to educate students about mental health; to administer guidance and support, and to refer students to outside services for special assistance when necessary.
This also amplifies the call to incorporate learning that focuses on students’ mental health and well-being into daily classroom activities - something that can be beneficial for all students, not just those with diagnosable conditions. The classroom teachers can make mental health a more robust part of the school day is by integrating mental-health topics, including self-esteem, body image, resilience and life-coping skills, into the existing school curricula.
Society, too, must play a role. Adults must be fully aware of the young people in their surroundings and know how to overcome the obstacles that prevent these youngsters from seeking help.
