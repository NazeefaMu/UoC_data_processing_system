Sri Lanka 1-50 on 2nd day vs Bangladesh

 
Sri Lanka was 1-50 at tea on Thursday after Bangladesh was dismissed for 513 in its first innings on the second day of the opening Test.
Captain Mahmudullah was stranded on 83 as Sri Lanka made regular inroads on day two to wrap up Bangladesh's innings one hour after lunch.
Mahmudullah held together the innings after Mominul Haque added just one run to his overnight total to be out for 176.
Mushfiqur Rahim was the other notable scorer with 92 while opener Tamim Iqbal made 52.
The captain formed a 58-run partnership with Sunzamul Islam on day two to rally the side before Rangana Herath inspired Sri Lanka get back into the game early in the morning session.
The veteran left-arm spinner struck twice to dismiss Mominul and Mosaddek Hossain in the first seven overs of the day.
Mehidy Hasan then counterattacked to keep Sri Lanka frustrated, but was run out for 20 trying to score a third run.
