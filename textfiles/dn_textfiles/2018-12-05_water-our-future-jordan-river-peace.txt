Water Is Our Future: The Jordan - River of Peace?

The Jordan River is the main source of water for Jordanians, Israelis and Palestinians. But intensive agriculture is digging away the water from the holy river. Since Israel and Jordan made peace in 1994, activists from an environmental organization have been working across borders to save the Jordan River and the Dead Sea - for the protection of the environment and peace in the region.
The film, directed by Michael R. Gärtner, will be screened at Goethe Institut on December 7 at 7 pm.
