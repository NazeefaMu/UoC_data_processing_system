No-confidence motion against Ravi will not be taken for debate: Speaker

 
The no-confidence motion against former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, submitted by MPs of the Joint Opposition (JO), will not be taken up for debate as Karunanayake has resigned, the Speaker informed Parliament a short while ago.
Thirty-three members of the Joint Opposition handed over a no-confidence motion against Ravi Karunanayake on August 3.
The former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanyake publicly resigned from his Cabinet position this afternoon.
