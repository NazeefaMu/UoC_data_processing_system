NDB first Lankan bank to receive gender certification

NDB Bank recently announced that it is the first Sri Lankan company to apply for the worldwide Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) certificate, in line with its commitments and actions to support women’s participation in the private sector.
On the occasion of International Women’s Day falling on March 8, NDB reaffirms its commitment to support the creation of more and better jobs for women, including in leadership, which will further drive economic growth in Sri Lanka. To promote women’s private sector labour force participation in Sri Lanka, NDB develops products and services that better meet women’s needs as customers. NDB also promotes women as employees demonstrating commitment towards workplace gender equality.
“As a Bank, NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement to women’s professional development and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow their lives,” said Dimantha Seneviratne, NDB’s Chief Executive Officer. “At NDB, we are proud that women make up 39 percent of our overall workforce and 41 percent among our senior management. Applying for EDGE gender certification is a natural next step for us towards identifying how we can further improve and position ourselves not only as a ‘women’s bank of choice’, but also as an ‘employer of choice’.
EDGE is the leading global assessment methodology and business certification standard for gender equality. EDGE Certification has received the endorsement of business, government, and academic leaders from around the world. For more information, visit http://www.edge-cert.org
