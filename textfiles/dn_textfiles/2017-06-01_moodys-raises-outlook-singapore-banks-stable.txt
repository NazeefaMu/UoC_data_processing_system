Moody's raises outlook for Singapore banks to stable

Moody's Investors Service raised Singapore banks' outlook to stable from negative yesterday (May 31), citing stabilizing commodity prices and improving growth conditions.
The ratings agency said deterioration in the asset portion of balance sheets had peaked, particularly among oil and gas exposure.
"Economic growth in Singapore is picking up and growth is also picking up in other parts of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), so this is positive for the banks," Eugene Tarzimanov, a senior credit officer at Moody's, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. "Another factor is we think new NPL (non-performing loan) formation, or the rate that banks get new problematic assets: This rate is decreasing.
So that's a good thing. Banks will get less problematic assets this year and next," he added.
Tarzimanov said bank profitability was also expected to improve "mildly" as net interest margins (NIM) could rise as interest rates increase, in line with monetary tightening in the U.S., and the amount of provisions needed should decrease. (http://www.cnbc.com)
