JO’s Nugegoda rally postponed

The Joint Opposition (JO) decided to postpone the rally scheduled to be held at Nugegoda today, MP Namal Rajapaksa said. “The Joint Opposition has decided to postpone the Nugegoda rally slated for today due to the ongoing tense situation in various parts of the country,” Rajapaksa tweeted.
The Nugegoda meeting was to be the first rally organised by the JO after the recent Local Government election.
