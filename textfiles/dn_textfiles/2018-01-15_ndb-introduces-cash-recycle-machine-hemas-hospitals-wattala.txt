NDB introduces  Cash Recycle Machine at  Hemas Hospitals, Wattala

In keeping with the Bank’s strategy to provide customers with first-class millennial banking experiences, National Development Bank PLC launched a new generation of Cash Recycling Machines (CRM), of which the maiden CRM was deployed at Hemas Hospitals, Wattala.
NDB has constantly been driving progressive improvements into its ATM network and the CRM offers several new advancements on the standard ATMs.
A cash recycler is a complex machine that handles simple, but important tasks such as accepting and dispensing cash.
It also stores money securely, keeps an accurate accounting of cash on hand, and automates the cash cycle. Apart from this, one of the main functions of a CRM is enabling cash deposits which are credited to the customer’s Current or Savings Accounts real time.
These new machines represent a significant advancement in functionality and versatility while enhancing the Bank’s offering in 24x7 banking services.
In 2016 NDB began its digital journey by introducing a state of the art Mobile Banking App which changed market trends and set a benchmark in the market. The Bank has now launched around-the-clock banking with this Cash Recycling Machine at Hemas Hospitals in Wattala, and has planned to roll out the same in many other identified locations during the year 2018.
NDB Bank has 121 ATMs throughout the island and Cash Recycling Machines will soon add value to the NDB network by proving greater convenience to customers.
Hemas Hospitals cover a range of medical services.
