New rice MRPs re-gazetted with local rates

As more imported rice began entering the market, the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) swiftly re-issued a new Maximum Retail Price (MRP) order yesterday for three varieties of rice-this time, with the inclusion of locally milled rice clearly spelt.
“The locally milled rice has not been included in our February 8 MRP order. We have now included local rice as well so that our millers can now get fair price. I also warn errant sellers who violate the MRPs,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday.
The order issued yesterday has now been sent to be gazetted, and became effective from yesterday.
It invalidates the Gazette 2015/24 of February 8. The order No 42 dated February 17 was issued by the CAA Chairman under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 9 of 2003’s section 20(5).
MRPs of “imported” three varieties of rice remains the same as the previous Gazette-the only new MRP addition being the prices of locally milled rice of same three varieties.
According to the February 17 order sent to be gazetted, new MRPs for Nadu, Raw Rice and Samba is as follows: MRP of a kilo of imported Nadu rice is Rs 72 (unchanged), locally milled Nadu Rs 80, a kilo of imported Raw (Kekulu) rice is Rs 70 (unchanged) locally milled Raw Rs 78, and a kilo of imported Samba (excluding Keeri Samba and Suduru Samba) is Rs 80 (unchanged) and locally milled Samba (excluding Keeri Samba and Suduru Samba) is Rs 90 per kilo.
