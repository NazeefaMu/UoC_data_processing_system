Trump nominates new Ambassador to Sri Lanka

US President Donald Trump has nominated Alaina B. Teplitz, the current US Ambassador to Nepal, for the position of Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
If confirmed by the US Senate, Teplitz would replace current Ambassador Atul Keshap.
Teplitz is a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, and has held positions in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Current Ambassador Atul Keshap has held the position in Colombo since August 2015. A three-year post is a standard tour for career US Foreign Service officers.
Teplitz has served as the Ambassador to Nepal since August 2015.
Her confirmation now lies with the US Senate, a process that could take months.
