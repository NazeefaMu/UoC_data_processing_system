Fitch assigns 'A-(lka)' rating to LB Finance; Outlook stable

LB's National long-term rating reflects its established franchise among licensed finance companies (LFC), whose higher yielding exposures have supported sound profitability.
The rating also captures its relatively higher risk appetite as indicated by its exposure to gold-backed loans.
Fitch views LB's capital as satisfactory taking into account the entity's good revenue generation.
LB's leading 11% deposit market share among LFCs, as well as its extensive branch network have supported the company's funding position. At the same time, it also exposes LB to higher liquidity risk compared with peers in particular as gross loans reached 90% of assets at end 1HFY16 which is higher than the industry.
Meanwhile, its share of liquid assets (as a % of total assets) declined to 9%. Mitigating factors include its moderately concentrated deposit base and un-utilised backup facilities.
Fitch sees LB's product exposure to gold-backed loans (17% of gross loans at end 1HFY16) as being a potential risk to its asset quality due to the volatility of gold prices even though the focus is on short tenure facilities (almost all under six months).
