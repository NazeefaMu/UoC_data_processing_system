Baddegama Magistrate’s Court drama
One out of six prison escapees arrested

One out of the six prisoners who were absconding after escaping from the custody of prison officers at the Galle Baddegama Magistrate’s Court on Monday was re-captured at Ellakanda in Baddegama, Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The escaped prisoner was re-captured by the Police Special Task Force (STF) at around 11 am yesterday.
“The 21-year old escapee is a prison inmate indicted for sexual abuse,” the Police Media Spokesperson further said.
A combined search operation was launched by the Police Special Task Force (STF) and Prison officers to arrest the six remand inmates who escaped from the custody of prison officers on Monday, while they were detained in the Prisoners’ cell at the Baddegama Magistrate Court in Galle.
Search operations are being carried out for the remaining prisoners who are still at large. On the day of the incident, Galle Prisons officials had transported 29 prisoners to the Baddegama Magistrate’s Court to be produced before the Magistrate in connection with various cases against them.
Among the absconders is a suspect who was arrested by the Wanduramba Police for a drug related offence while the four others had been arrested by Baddegama Police and indicted for rape and looting.
The other prisoner had been arrested for a drug related offence and was detailed to be referred to the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Center, Baddegama Police said. “Further to the search operations, the Police have initiated a hi-tech investigation with regard to the telephone conversations they had with their family members and associates,” the Acting OIC further said. Galle Prions Superintendent Jagath Chandana Weerasignhe said the high drama at the Magistrate’s Court on Monday took place when 29 prison inmates who were to be produced before the Baddegama Magistrate were being transported in the prison bus under the custody of six prison jailers, including a female guard.
“All Prison officers detailed for duty at the Baddegama Magistrate’s Court on that day are well trained and experienced officers with a high sense of professionalism. However, some convicts made use of the humane and caring attitude and approach of the officers towards prisoners to make their escape,” the Prison Superintendent said. “At the end of the day’s court proceedings, one prisoner had complained of a chest pain. Out of empathy towards the detainee, our officers had swiftly called the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service and arranged to transport the sick prisoner together with two officials to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital,” Weerasinghe said. “Meanwhile, the other officers had made arrangements to obtain the finger prints of some prisoners. As the officers opened the cell to take the respective inmates, a prisoner who is an Army deserter and charged for a drug related offence had assaulted the officers and tried to escape. Nevertheless, our officers overpowered the detainee and put him back into the cell. Making use of the tensed situation, six remand prisoners had broken out from the cell and escaped,” Weerasinghe said.
“We sent 50 prison officers to assist the STF in their search operation,” he further said. A joint Police STF and Prison Officers’ operation is continuing. The Prisons Department has initiated an official investigation into the incident.
