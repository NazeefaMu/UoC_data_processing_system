Schoolchildren treated to tour of Emirates A380

A group of school children were provided a rare opportunity to walk through the world’s largest passenger aircraft when Emirates operated a one-off flight with the iconic aircraft to the Bandaranaike International Airport on August, 14.
The children from schools in the vicinity were given a conducted tour of the twin-deck aircraft and its First, Business and Economy Class cabins and the unique on-board amenities such as the shower spa and passenger lounge.
Pictured here are Emirates’ Senior Vice President West Asia & Indian Ocean, Ahmed Khoory and Minister of Transport and Aviation Hon Nimal Siripala de Silva with some of the children.
