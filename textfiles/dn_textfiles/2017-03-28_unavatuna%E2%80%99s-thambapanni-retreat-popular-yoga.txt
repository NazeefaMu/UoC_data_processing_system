Unavatuna’s Thambapanni Retreat popular for yoga

Sri Lanka and specially Unavatuna is now gaining popularity as a major destination to practice Yoga, Yoga Instructress, Kathryn Anderson from United Kingdom said.
She has been teaching Yoga for the past 23 years having first learned it from an Indian instructor and then teaching in UK. “I have travelled all over the world to look at conducting these classes and came across Thambapanni Retreat in Unavatuna which has the ideal natural surroundings to do it. In addition the hotel a few meters from the beach also has a purposely built Yoga area which was ideal for my work.”
She said that then she spoke the Chairman Preshan Dissanayake who agreed to offer special packages for her guests who come in large numbers to practice Yoga for two weeks.
Her students too like to like to travel to Sri Lanka as they not only get five hour daily Yoga training but also gets a free holiday in Sri Lanka. She said that this year over 100 UK Yogi students are expected to visit Yoga in Sri Lanka opening out a new market for tourism.
She said today Yoga is being accepted as a healer and mind a body purifier for people and there is a growing demand not only from travellers but also from the corporate sector as there is no limit for Yoga.
The air-conditioned rooms at Thambapanni come with wooden flooring, dark wood furnishings and a 4-poster bed. All are fitted with a fan and an en suite bathroom with shower facilities.
