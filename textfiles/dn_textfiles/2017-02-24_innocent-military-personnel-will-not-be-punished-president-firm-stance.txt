Innocent military personnel will not be punished: President on firm stance

President Maithripala Sirisena is on a firm stance that innocent military personnel should not be punished. He was also of the view that those who had committed offences should be dealt with, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Minister Amaraweera made this observation yesterday in Parliament responding to NFF leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa.
“We know over 99.99 percent of the military officers had acted in keeping with the law,” said Minister Amaraweera. “But if there had been anyone who acted outside the law and assaulted or murdered media personnel or anyone else, they should be dealt with by law”.
He said the public too would not stand against such a decision. Even the international community is on alert on such matters. “However, we are now pressure-free due to the new government’s policy in guaranteeing the rights of all communities equally,” the Minister said. “We have to take corrective measures building on the mistakes of the previous government.”
He said unity between the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims should be strengthened. “However, the statements of several Tamil politicians in the North, especially in the Local Government institutions are hurting the sentiments of the Sinhalese community to a degree that discourage us to urge the Sinhalese community to build friendships,” the Minister said.
He said the government would not be able to prevent the Police from preventing the method of their investigations such as taking data from communication towers in connection with the Keith Noyahr’s investigation.
“However, we guarantee that steps would taken against army personnel being harassed baselessly,” Minister said.
