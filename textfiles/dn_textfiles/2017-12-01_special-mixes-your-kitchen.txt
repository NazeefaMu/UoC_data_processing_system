Special mixes for your kitchen

Knorr recently unveiled an exciting range of special mixes, the four exotic variants include Biryani, Nasi Goreng, Devilled and Chicken Curry. Now with Knorr Chef’s special mixes, home cooks and moms alike can replicate the taste, colour and aroma of restaurant like dishes conveniently, with the goodness of a home cooked meal.
The new range is a result of careful crafting by a group of expert Knorr Chefs. Each variant is a unique combination of authentic ingredients and fresh spices that are blended to perfection to give you unbeatable taste and flavour experience.

Knorr, Brand Ambassador, Chef Chathurika Anuradha and a key person behind the new range spoke of her inspiration. “Being a busy mother and chef, I go to great lengths to keep my family excited about the food I make at home. Sometimes it is challenging to create consistently tasty dishes every day and our best fans at home can also be our biggest critics. So, it is an honour for me to be able to share my passion for home cooking with mothers and home cooks of Sri Lanka through the new Knorr Chef’s apecial mixes. It takes the guess work out of home cooking.”
Unilever Sri Lanka, Home Care, Foods/Refreshment and Pure-it,Marketing Director, Makshoodh Meerasaibu stated, “Knorr has been inspiring Sri Lankan moms for many decades to add that extra touch of flavour in their daily dishes.
Today we are really excited to be able to bring families together to enjoy a delicious, restaurant like meal at home, with the new Knorr Chef’s special mixes, marking a significant mile stone in our culinary journey.”
