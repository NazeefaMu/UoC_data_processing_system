Boost for Lanka-Russia ties

The current State visit to Russia by President Maithripala Sirisena is significant in many ways. This is the first State visit to Russia by a Sri Lankan leader in more than four decades. The last Sri Lankan leader to pay a State visit to Russia was Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1974.
Incidentally it was during her husband the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s tenure that Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties with the then Soviet Union. Ever since, the two countries have had excellent diplomatic, trade, cultural and educational relations. However, actual Russia-Sri Lanka ties go back to the 1840s – records indicate that Russia’s Count Saltykov visited Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, twice - in 1841 and in 1845-46. He wrote a book detailing what he saw in Sri Lanka. A Russian consulate was established in Galle in 1891. Well-known Russian writers Anton Chekhov and Ivan Bunin also visited Ceylon. The island was also visited incognito by Russian Crown Prince (“tzesarevich”) during his round-the-world travels.
Russia has been a close ally of Sri Lanka at all times, regardless of which party was in power in either country. The two countries have worked together closely at the UN and other world forums. Russia took Sri Lanka’s side whenever unfavourable resolutions were brought against Sri Lanka at the United Nations or other world forums. Russia steadfastly helped Sri Lanka in its battle against LTTE terror.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been cited as the “world’s most powerful man” by many prestigious publications. Putin has added a new level of dynamism to the Russian Presidency and once again made Russia a major player on the world stage. President Maithripala Sirisena too is held in high esteem by the International Community for his commitment to peace and mutual co-existence. Thus the meeting between the two Presidents is likely to be very productive. Sri Lanka also has a firm friend in Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, who speaks fluent Sinhalese having worked at the Soviet Embassy in Colombo for a long period.
During the President’s visit, the two countries will enter into several new Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) to expand bilateral cooperation in several fields such as energy, trade and commerce, agriculture, education, judiciary and defence. Energy, agriculture and education are vital since they have the potential to make a difference for our future. The visit is expected to strengthen friendship and cooperation further and enhance bilateral trade between two countries, the Sri Lanka government has said.
The Soviet Union and after its break-up, Russia assisted Sri Lanka to become economically stronger in several ways. It gave 100 percent scholarships for Sri Lankan students to study at leading Russian universities, which was a turning point in our education annals. Russian literature, translated into Sinhala and English, enriched young Sri Lankan minds. The Russian Cultural Centre in Colombo gives an opportunity for Sri Lankans to get closer to Russia through Russian cultural performances and other events. Russia assisted Sri Lanka in constructing of the metallurgical plant in Oruwela, the tyre-producing plant in Kelaniya and milling and house construction plant which helped the national economy. Russia has also assisted in Sri Lanka’s oil exploration efforts in the 1970s.
Sri Lanka-Russia trade links remain healthy, though there is a lot more room for improvement. Tea comes to mind when one mentions Russia and indeed, the country is one of the biggest buyers of Pure Ceylon Tea. Russia used to buy more than 30 percent of the Ceylon Tea output. Other main export products to Russia include apparel, industrial and surgical gloves, aircraft components, desiccated coconut, activated carbon, discharge lamps, coir fiber and coir products, pneumatic and retreated rubber tyres and tubes. The main imports from Russia to Sri Lanka are base metal products, paper and paper products, non-metallic mineral products, chemicals and plastic products, electrical and electronic products, parts and machinery woven fabrics.
While improving trade is essential, more attention should be focused on people-to people contact. Russia has climbed several steps in the inbound tourism market with thousands more Russian tourists discovering the allure of this island. But there is one significant lacuna – Aeroflot has scrapped direct flights between Colombo and Moscow that began way back in 1965.
There is an urgent need for the reestablishment of direct airlinks between the two capitals. This should not be difficult, since Russian flag carrier Aeroflot still operates to nearby Male in the Maldives and a stop in Colombo can be slotted in, possibly with fifth freedom rights. This will lead to a boom in travel between the two nations, as many Sri Lankans are also discovering Russia as an emerging destination.
One newspaper article on the Sri Lankan President’s visit to Russia described Russia as an “all-weather friend”. This is indeed an apt description of a country and a people who always stood by Sri Lanka, whatever political storms swirled outside. Thus President Sirisena’s landmark State visit to Russia and bilateral talks with President Putin will help augment that very special relationship that has stood the test of time.
