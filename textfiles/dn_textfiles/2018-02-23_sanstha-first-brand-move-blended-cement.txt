Sanstha, first brand to move to blended cement

INSEE Sanstha, the most popular brand of cement in the country is the first Blended Cement launched in Sri Lanka. INSEE Sanstha is a blended cement,enriched with Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) extracted from local quarries, resulting in fresh, consistent quality that produces significantly stronger and more durable structures than any other cement.
Blended Cement has5 key benefits that make it better than ordinary cement. It has improved strength, longer durability,better workability, provides an aesthetic finish and requires less water to mix. As a blended cement, INSEE Sanstha offers Sri Lankan home builders the advantage of a cement blended with Calcium Carbonate (CaC03)particles which closes all the pores in the concrete, making it stronger.
The blended Sanstha Cement is not only more durable, but most importantly, it prevents water from entering the iron structures, preventing the iron from rusting. In fact, an entire bag of Sanstha Cement only requires 25 litres of water to mix.
The added Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) and other particles work as a lubricant resulting in a concrete mixture that is easier to apply, making plastering more efficient and the end result, more aesthetic.
Jan Kunigk, Executive Vice President / Commercial Director of INSEE Cement explained “INSEE Sanstha has been the market leader in Sri Lanka for decades due to its consistent quality.
Globally, cement markets have moved towards blended cement due to its high strength and durability as opposed to Ordinary Portland Cement (SLS 107).” “In Sri Lanka, Sanstha was the first brand to move to Blended Cement.
This proves INSEE Cement`s efforts to consistently innovate to provide superior products to Sri Lankans. Today cities such as Singapore, Jakarta, Delhi and local structures such as the Lotus Tower are all made out of Blended Cement.
Sri Lanka can achieve what Singapore is today by also using Blended Cement, whether it is for a home, high riser or port! Blended Cements are better, more durable and stronger.” INSEE Cement in Sri Lanka also known as Siam City Cement (Lanka) Limited, is a member of the Siam City Cement Public Company Limited, a leading cement manufacturer in Southeast Asia, founded in 1969 in Thailand.
