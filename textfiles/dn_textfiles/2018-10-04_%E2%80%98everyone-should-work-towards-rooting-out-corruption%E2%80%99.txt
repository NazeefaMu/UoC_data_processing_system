‘Everyone should work towards rooting out corruption’


President Maithripala Sirisena said everyone is duty bound to work towards rooting out corruption, waste and fraud, with the aim of creating a humane society. Corruption, waste and fraud should be eradicated promptly with the assistance of all stakeholders of society, the President said.  

The President was speaking at a ceremony to mark Samatha Dinaya at Temple Trees yesterday. Members of the Samatha Mandala from across the country participated.  
“All sections of society should rally round to do away with fraud, waste, bribery and corruption. It is the bounden duty of every Sri Lankan to form a corruption-free country. Regardless of whether you are from a village or town, you have to work towards this objective,” the President said.  
He added that bribery, waste and corruption are rooted in society and therefore it is not easy to eradicate. However, we should act promptly to wipe out these evils from society.   
Speaking on the Samatha Mandala’s values, the President said that the Samatha Mandala renders an immense service to society in ensuring law and order. Besides, the Samatha Mandala is an ideal solution for easing the congestion in courts.   
The President said that Samatha Mandala volunteers dedicate their time, wealth and much more for the benefit of society. Even though the Samatha Mandala system was established 28 years ago, it has never been said that even a single member has acted with a personal agenda or bias. “This demonstrates how dedicated the members are. You are doing an honorary service without hoping for any gain.”   
The President said that ceremonies of this nature will help to achieve the objectives of the Samatha Mandala.
