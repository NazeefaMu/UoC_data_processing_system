Severe drought hits Anuradhapura

A severe drought is affecting the Anuradhapura district, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Palugaswewa told the Daily News.
He said there are 73 major reservoirs and 303 medium scale tanks under Irrigation Department. About 103 tanks in the dry zone have around 13 percent of water.
“We experienced drought conditions in the past. The water levels of the major reservoirs had never come down to the present levels,” the director said.
In the Anuradhapura District, only Wahalkada, Tisawewa and Thuruwila tanks keep the water levels at 25 percent.
The water levels of the Parackrama Samudraya and Minneriya tank and all other major tanks in the Polonnaruwa district range from 12 percent to 20 percent.
Palugaswewa said reduced water levels will badly affect the 2017/2018 maha season paddy cultivation.
According to Palugaswewa, meteorology observations and reports predicted that the forthcoming maha seasonal rains would not be as much as in the past years.
He said if the water capacities of the major tanks in the dry zones range from 50 percent to 70 percent by the end of next October, water could be provided to about 85 percent of the total acreage of paddy cultivation under the major and medium scale tanks.
