‘For the wild at heart, kept in cages’

She is one of Hollywood’s leading actresses, she is an Oscar winner and she adorns the red carpet like the brightest jewel of America’s film industry. But, beneath all that glitter and glamor, she is also compassionate, loving, resilient, and a survivor.
Angelina Jolie, filmmaker, philanthropist and dashing radiance of the big screen who built herself up through darkness and difficulty. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in ‘Girl, Interrupted’ in 2000 and has received two Screen Actors Guild Awards and three Golden Globe Awards and has been cited as Hollywood’s highest paid actress. She became the youngest person ever to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2014.
Bound to darkness
Born on June 4, 1975, Jolie comes from a background of artists. Her parents, Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand and her brother James Haven are actors whereas her uncle James Voight was a singer/song writer, better known as Chip Taylor.
Following the separation of her parents, Jolie and her brother lived with their Mother who abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.
Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she reportedly felt isolated among the children of some of the area’s affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income.
Around the age of 11, she was bullied by other students for being too thin and for wearing glasses and braces. She was emotionally broken and began to show self-destructive behavior. “I always felt caged, closed in, like I was punching at things that weren’t there,” the actress once told dailymail.co.uk.
Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother’s insistence, proved unsuccessful. She was being rejected again and again for being too thin and too gloomy.
At Moreno High School, an alternative school, she became a ‘punk outsider,’ wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing and dropping out of her acting classes. As reported in people.com, at the time, she was aspired to become a funeral director, taking at-home courses to study embalming.
At 16, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies.
She was nineteen when she found herself, again, suffering from depression which led to drug abuse and two suicide attempts.
However, she found stability in life when she adopted her first son, Maddox. “It’s strange; I never wanted to have a baby. I never wanted to be pregnant. I never babysat. I never thought of myself as a mother,” Jolie said to dailymail.co.uk. But as she was shooting Tomb Raider in the year 2000, playing with children at a Cambodian school, it became “suddenly very clear to me that my son was in the country, somewhere.”
Finding success in Hollywood
Jolie’s first breakthrough in her acting career came when she portrayed supermodel GiaCarangi in HBO’s ‘Gia’ (1998).In 1999, Jolie’s supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in ‘Girl, Interrupted’marked Jolie’s final breakthrough in Hollywood. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, it was Jolie who captured most praise, secured her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
For Variety, American film critic Emanuel Levy noted, “Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna’s rehabilitation.”
Being the light of the needy
Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming ‘Lara Croft: Tomb Raider’ in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world. After much dedicated endeavors, made for the sake of many refugees, in August 2001, Jolie was named a UNHCR goodwill ambassador for refugees.
Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the US and developing nations, including the ‘Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005’. Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading US law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the US.
In April 2012, Jolie was promoted to special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees after serving as a goodwill ambassador to the UNHCR for more than ten years.
In the same year, Jolie fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. She also launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with the then English Foreign Secretary William Hague. In June 2014, Angelina led the world’s biggest anti-rape summit in London when she hosted the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict.
A beautiful mother
Three years after adopting her first son, Maddox, Jolie adopted daughter Zahara in 2005. She had her first biological child Shiloh, with husband Brad Pitt in 2006. In 2007, Jolie adopted Pax from Vietnam when he was three years old. In July, 2008, she, again, had twins, Knox Léon and Vivienne Marcheline with Pitt.
Last year, Jolie announced her decision to file for divorce from her husband Pitt after two years of marriage and 12 years together which stirred up quite a shock among her fans as the couple was adored throughout the globe by millions.
Making films
Jolie took on a painful and complex subject for her directorial debut, which she filmed in 2010. ‘In the Land of Blood and Honey’ followed the story of the Bosnian War and the brutal crimes against women that took place during the conflict. In 2017, Jolie directed ‘First They Killed My Father,’ a biographical historical thriller film.
Cancer prevention treatment
After learning she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene, Jolie revealed her brave decision to undergo a preventive double mastectomy in an op-ed article she wrote for The New York Times in May 2013.
She shared her story, “I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.”
A tattoo on her left arm reads: ‘A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages.’ For she, indeed, felt caged as a child. But she did set herself free. In an interview with daily mail, pointing out bodywork on her arm – one of her 13 tattoos – she said: “The wild heart caged. I unlocked my cage years ago. I want my children to have that freedom. I want that for other people, too.”
