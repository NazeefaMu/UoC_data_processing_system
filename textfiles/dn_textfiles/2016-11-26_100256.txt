Ivory Coast's penniless children try golf, game of the rich

YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast - Plucked out of poverty, 1,000 children in IvoryCoast are being given a unique chance to learn golf, and 10-year-old Jessica likes the idea.
“I love golf and my dream is to become an international golfer and work for the World Bank,” says the girl, who comes from the poor and often dangerous Dioulabougou district of Yamoussoukro, the country's administrative capital..
Wearing a t-shirt and black leggings, Jessica is one of 120 children in the first wave of new golfers to Le President Golf Club, which is normally reserved for Ivory Coast's elite and wealthy.
The visit is part of a “Golf for All” project which saw the STL golf academy travelling across Korhogo, one of Ivory Coast's poorest regions, and around Yamassoukro's most deprived districts and orphanages looking for potential players.
The sons and daughters of peasants, farm and factory workers were wide-eyed when they took to the 18-hole course that was built by late president Felix Houphouet-Boigny as part of his campaign to turn his home village into an international city.
Designed by former Welsh professional Dave Thomas, the course is spread over 90 hectares (225 acres) of resplendent, lush land with century-old trees lining the fairways.
“The aim is to get them out of poverty through golf and give a chance to all children in Ivory Coast, no matter what their social level,” says Jean-Claude N'Da, a golf instructor who works on the project.
A key partner is golf coach Henrik Lundqvist, who spent four months travelling across Sweden to collect 20 tonnes of equipment to donate to the project, and who believes that teaching children is the best way to introduce the sport to Africa.
“We are going to train up young Ivorians so they can make golf popular,” says the Swedish golfer. AFP
