Magical Okra!

Okra (botanical name – Abelmoschus Esculantus) which is simply known as ‘Bandakka’ and it has many fans in our island largely depending on the way it is cooked. If you fall in love with it, you fall in love for life! Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana, District Agricultural Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on this vegetable which is valued for its health benefits.
“This vegetable can be grown anywhere in Sri Lanka except for Up Country Wet Zone on a commercial scale and in home gardens. In the Dry Zone, Okra or Bandakka can be grown on a mass commercial scale. The pods of the plant are used for consumption. Because of its high nutritional value there is a big demand for Okra (Bandakka) with proteins and Vitamins. Iodine deficiency is the commonest cause thyroid disorders, and eating Bandakka can help the situation. It is highly advisable to include Bandakka in your lunch menu,” explained Jayathilake
There are many varieties of Bandakka such as MI5, MI7 and ‘Haritha’ which are department recommendations. There is the local variety which is called ‘Athdala Bandakka’. There is also another variety that has purple pods and the rest of the varieties have green pods.
“When growing Bandakka on a commercial scale is it advisable to plant/ cultivate in early September – October (Maha season) and April – May (Yala Season). In home gardens it can be grown throughout the year.
Urban gardens
In urban home gardens it can be grown in polythene bags or in containers and pots. It can be grown in a hole in home gardens if there is room. If there is no room then it can be grown in Polythene bags or pots,” pointed out Jayathilake
However since the roots system grows, it is advisable to use a Polythene bag a foot high and a foot wide.
“The polythene bags should contain organic manure and top soil and a good drainage system. Then the seeds can be planted. When growing in a hole in a garden, that too should contain organic manure and top soil,” said Jayathilake
When growing commercially it can be directly grown in the field. When planting this crop the spacing must be 90cm- 100cm.
“In one hole you must plant around three to four seeds. The hole must be one foot high and one foot wide, and organic manure must be put into the hole which will ensure good growth. These plants are not grown in the nursery. In order to grow this crop there needs to be a good drainage system. The soil also has to be very fertile. When cultivating on a commercial scale, the plant when grown, needs an added chemical fertilizer and it needs to be irrigated. In home gardens if the crop is not that good, then of course you can administer chemical fertilizer.
After planting, in a week you can see growth, and flowers appear in around a month and then the pods. Until 100 days we can reap the harvest. That is why it is ideal for the home garden. The Bandakka plants in your home garden will provide you with pods needed for your daily consumption,” informed Jayathilake.
Weed controlling
Another important step is to remove the weeds. Weed controlling is very important.
“The Bandakka plant is affected by Virus diseases. That is the biggest problem in Low Country Wet Zone. If we spot a plant affected by the Virus disease we need to get rid of it since the virus spreads. We can identify the disease by the yellow patches – Yellow Mosaic Virus. Also the virus can be transferred by the White Fly. The pods and leaves get deformed because of the virus. In order to prevent this we must use healthy seeds, and if we spot this disease we must get rid of it fast. Even weeds can cause disease. These viruses in the weeds can be transferred by insects. Insects can create a lot of problems for the Bandakka plant,” summed up Jayathilake.
