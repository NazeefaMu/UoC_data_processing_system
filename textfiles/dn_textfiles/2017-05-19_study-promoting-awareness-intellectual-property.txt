Study on promoting awareness on Intellectual Property

A study on promoting awareness on the role of Intellectual Property (IP) in promoting tourism-related economic activities and culture is underway in consultation with the National Steering Committee chaired by the Tourism Ministry Secretary and WIPO experts.
Last year, Sri Lanka was selected as one of 4 pilot countries - the others being Ecuador, Egypt and Namibia for the WIPO pilot project on “Intellectual Property, Tourism and Culture”.
Addressing the 19th Session of the Committee on Development and Intellectual Property (CDIP) held at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recently, Sri Lanka Permanent Mission Second Secretary in Geneva Dilini Gunasekera, outlining the progress achieved said, as part of future activities under the project, Sri Lanka looks forward to contributing to the development of teaching materials on IP related to tourism and promoting the inclusion of specialised curricula in tourism management schools and in national IP academies.
Areas such as Ayurveda, eco-tourism and agro-tourism may be considered for further cooperation through the project.
She said Marcelo Di Pietro, Director of Special Projects and South-South Corporation Division of WIPO who visited Sri Lanka last week to assess the progress achieved in implementing this project, held discussions with Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, the Ministry Secretary, senior officials of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) which is the coordinating agency and other stakeholders from the private sector.
