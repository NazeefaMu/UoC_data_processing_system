Hatch launches co-working office space for start-ups

Sri Lankan start-up incubation and acceleration platform, Hatch, announced plans for the launch of the island’s single largest co-working office space designed exclusively for start-ups to collaborate, create and grow.
Located in the commercial heart of Colombo, Hatch aims to redefine the future of work by providing a vibrant, cost-effective, inspiring and convenient workspace for entrepreneurs, creators, professionals and business enterprises in Sri Lanka.
The Hatch community will have the option to choose from a range of flexible plans, including hot desks, dedicated workspaces and private offices. This enables businesses to scale up or down at short notice without having to move from one location to another as in a traditional business environment. The community will have direct access to the best tools, local and international mentors who are specialists in their fields and introductions to a range of start-up funds to realize their full potential.
“Hatch is a dynamic community of industries and skills connected by a collaborative mindset, supportive attitude and entrepreneurial spirit,” says Brindha Selvadurai-Gnanam the Chief Community Officer.
“We are launching the Hatch Community because we believe that Sri Lanka has talent and we want to inspire and mobilize this talent to make a significant contribution to the economy of the country; so that every citizen can benefit from it,” said Jeevan Gnanam, Co-Founder of Hatch.
Hatch will create the perfect work environment by building a community of likeminded people who can share ideas, learn from each other, collaborate to create opportunities and chase their passion by giving their project a greater probability for success.
Access to knowledge resources will be a priority at Hatch, with the community being provided frequent access to networks and events conducted by its esteemed knowledge partners in themes such as Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence, and cloud computing to name a few. 
The facility will house over 600 workspaces, meeting rooms, auditoriums event spaces, cafeterias, coffee shops, nap rooms, breakout areas, fully functioning reprographics, video audio facilities and fabrication labs.
