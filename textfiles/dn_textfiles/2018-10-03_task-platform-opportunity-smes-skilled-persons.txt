Task platform - an opportunity for SMEs, skilled persons

Two software engineers and a hospitality industry professional have come together to set up a fully pledged interactive platform, creating a space for those who want to get professional services done and for those who want to market their skills and abilities.
Rakkitha Kumarage is a hospitality industry professional who also studied abroad. His two partners Isuru Gihan and Udara Dilhan are software graduates of the Moratuwa University. They hail from the same locality and have been friends from their childhood.
When they met as adults, they often had discussions about various economic issues and how they could put their knowledge and skills into use to support less privileged ones. They were researching for a solution to reduce the ever-increasing cost of living in Sri Lanka.
“Then we found out there are 7.1 million (46.2%) people of working age population is in the “economically inactive” due to various reasons such as higher studies, household chores and not having enough opportunities to offer their services. At the same time we found out there are lot of people who wanted to get done various professional and skilled services. This gave us the opportunity to create a platform to bring these two parties together,” said Rakkitha Kumarage. Etasker is an interactive platform that combines these two segments together that didn’t exist previously in Sri Lanka, he added.
Since then they were working on a project to set up Etasker.lk, the platform of services. “Anyone can use this platform to outsource, and to offer services. People have already started using our platform and we have taken measure to protect information and privacy of those who use the site,: says Gihan talking about security measures.
With Etasker, those who work on a full-time basis- but still have extra hours also can make money by offering their services. For instance, those who want to get the services of a carpenter can easily find one through our platform. There are no hidden charges involved. The transaction is strictly between the two parties,” Gihan said.
Dilhan said, “you can also find online marketplaces dedicated to specific areas such as education, jobs and retail goods. Their focus is on the main largest assets you have; house, car and a full-time job. Exchange of ownership is the concept of many of those- in simply, monetising your home by giving it to someone else.”
However, with the introduction of the shared economy, people started to monetise their assets to gain incremental revenue. Uber and Airbnb are the advents in this category followed by other small-scale players globally and locally.
Rakkitha says, “Gig economy may be an alien word for many of Sri Lankans, however, there are a large number of Sri Lankans who belongs to Gen Z is working on global gig platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork. Gig economy relates to temporary work (also called odd jobs) refers to an employment situation where the working arrangement is limited to a certain period of time-based on the needs of the employing organization.Etasker is a platform uses the gig concept, however, adopted to Sri Lanka market.”
Etasker is re-imagining how labour exchange in the real world. “We are not in the plan of taking existing labour and categorising them into segments. We want people to re-imagine how labour could utilise. Imagine you need to fix a TV antenna. However, you do not need to find a certified TV technician. It could be fixed by the person next door who is having general knowledge of antennas.
This is where Etasker helps you. We have hundreds of taskers registered with us who are willing to monetise their skills to help you out with everyday jobs. The taskers are vetted by using a mobile gateway. We are planning to substantially increase the verification requirements by using police checks, certifications, etc. when moving forward,” Rakkitha said.
