JHU will not support NCM

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) will not support the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, JHU General Secretary and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the JHU Head Office in Battaramulla yesterday, the minister said the NCM mainly revolves around the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issue which the Government has already tackled head-on.
“From the beginning of this issue, we were of the opinion that a fraud had been committed and those culprits must be brought to book. The Government has already addressed this matter and legal action has been initiated. Presenting the Judicature (Amendment) Bill, the Government has also proposed to refer the CB bond case to one of the separate high courts on corruption and financial crimes.
Financial crimes severe than the bond scam had been committed under the previous regime. The MiG aircraft deal and the fraud involving Entrust Securities Plc are fine examples,” the minister said.
At the same time, the minister stressed on the need for urgent reforms to the Government as well as the UNP, if the country is to move forward. “The outcome of recent LG polls is a slap in the face of Government for not acting in line with the people’s mandate received on January 8, 2015. However, we still have time for a course correction. I have presented a 45-point proposal to the Cabinet stating the urgent measures needed within next 18 months.
I await feedback of the ministers at the next Cabinet meeting. We cannot depend on traditional hands to execute this set of proposals. A Working Committee comprised of young blood is needed,” he commented.
“A clear change in the policies of the Government is a must. We have instructed the Government to be extra-cautious not to engage in self-destructive activities,” Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said. JHU President Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera and its National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe also participated.
