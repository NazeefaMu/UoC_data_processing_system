Ramesh Mendis making a bat and ball contribution that was one of his bests at U23 level helped SSC clinch a final-over win over NCC in this all important semifinal and become one of the finalists of this tournament.
Former Dharmasoka player and the skipper of SSC, Ramesh Mendis hit a sparkling 45-ball 74 with 3 fours and five sixes following his four wickets with the ball launching a perfect repair job at a time SSC’s Cup-final hopes were hanging on a thread at 47-4, chasing 176. Ramesh shared two good partnerships, 93 for the fifth wicket with Yohan Mendis (38) to bring SSC back on track and 39 with Adeesha Thilanchana (14*), one of his school-mates for the unfinished sixth wicket to get to the target with five balls remaining.
Earlier, NCC batting first after they were put in posted a formidable 175 for seven in 20 overs. Had the NCC middle order made the full use of the brutal start their openers, Niroshan Dickwella and Lahiru Udara got off to surging to 65 from just 32 balls, NCC’s final total would have been an enormous one, but except for the Lahiru Udara’s 26-ball 57 including 5 fours and four sixes and Pawan Wickramasinghe’s brisk 41 no other NCC batsman could make a sizable contribution especially against a bowling attack that became more disciplined towards the end of NCC innings.
NCC U23: 175/7 in 20 overs (Lahiru Udara 57, Pawan Wickramasinghe 41, Niroshan Dickwella 19, Ramesh Mendis 4/29, Tharindu Rathnayake 1/36, Nuwan Thushara 1/36)
SSC U23: 179/5 in 19.1 overs (Ramesh Mendis 74*, Yohan Mendis 38, Minod Bhanuka 23, Nimesha Gurusinghe 2/08)
1ST SEMIFINAL - SSC WON BY 5 WICKETS
Ashan Randika’s hat-trick wins the match for Army
Ashan Randika’s four-ball spell that earned him a rare hat-trick at a cost of a solitary run coupled with CCC’s poor batting towards the latter part of their innings deprived CCC of a place in Sunday’s final as Army after a modest show with the bat recorded a rebounding win beating CCC by 13 runs in the second semifinal played at P Sara Oval to become the other finalist in this tournament.
After Ranitha Liyanarachchi (3/14) and Shaluka Silva (2/21) restricted Army to an undemanding total of 133, CCC openers, Malindu Maduranga and Ron Chandraguptha gave them a perfect start with an opening stand of 53 from just 29 balls before CCC lost the momentum completely due to a collapse that cost them four wickets with the addition of just 6 runs to the total.
However, CCC’s middle order led by Trinity spin-wizard Raveen Sayer recharging their innings took their side closer to the victory with 26 runs to get from 15 balls. Though CCC had three wickets to do so, Ashan Randika bowling for the first time in the match got rid of last three CCC batsmen completing a hat-trick to dismiss CCC with 14 runs short of their target.
Army U23: 133/8 in 20 overs (Leo Francisco 23, Himasha Liyanage 21, Ranitha Liyanarachchi 3/14, Shaluka Silva 2/21)
CCC U23: 120 in 18.4 overs (Malindu Maduranga 27, Raveen Sayer 24, Ron Chandraguptha 23, Yohan de Silva 2/28, Ashan Randika 3/01(hat-trick)
2ND SEMIFINAL - ARMY WON BY 13 RUNS
