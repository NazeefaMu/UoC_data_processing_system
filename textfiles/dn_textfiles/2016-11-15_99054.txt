Blunt is happy to recycle old outfits

Emily Blunt nearly ran out of clothes to wear during her second pregnancy. The British actress and her husband, ‘The Office’ star John Krasinski, welcomed baby girl Violet in June (16), a sister to two-year-old Hazel.
Prior to Violet’s arrival, Emily was snapped at a farmers market wearing a pair of bright purple trousers – a unique ensemble which caught the attention of waiting photographers.
“I was wearing these bright purple harem pants that were stretchy,” Emily recalled to Britain’s Vogue magazine. “And my friend, who likes to inform me on these things, sent me the links to the article which said, ‘Emily Blunt, slumming it, wearing the same pair of purple sweatpants two days in a row. She must be running out of things to wear’. Belfast Telegraph
