Wimal ends fast

 National Freedom Front (NFF)Leader Wimal Weerawansa yesterday ended his nine day hunger strike, Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera said.
Weerawansa is currently being treated at the National Hospital after being transferred from the Prison Hospital.
He launched the strike in protest against the rejection of his bail application by the Colombo High Court.
He is in custody for causing losses to the state by misusing government vehicles during his tenure as a minister in the previous regime.
