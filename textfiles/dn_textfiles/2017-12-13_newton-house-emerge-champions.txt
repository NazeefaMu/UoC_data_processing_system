British School Athletics Meet
Newton House emerge champions

Newton House emerged champions at the Annual Inter-House Athletics Meet of the British School in Colombo which was worked off at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex in Diyagama.
Newton House put up a fine performance in both track and field events as they finished well ahead of their opponents, Noble House, Scott House and Shakespeare House in the overall championship. The meet which was conducted under the patronage of Principal Dr. John Scarth, was a great success with a host of segments being worked off under the participation of all students who keenly participated in almost every event.
