Meghan Markle’s First Royal Event

Meghan Markle has marked her first official royal engagement with the Queen as she joined the royal family in their annual Commonwealth Day celebrations today. As the symbolic head of the 53-country Commonwealth, Her Majesty attended an inter-faith service at Westminster Abbey, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry and his fiancée.
For Markle, the event arrives less than two weeks after she had her first official engagement with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Royal Foundation Forum. It just goes to show just how quickly the future duchess is getting accustomed to her new royal life, and how well the royal family is welcoming her into their world.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were seated in the row directly behind the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, and the Duchess of Cambridge during the event.
For the occasion, Markle and Middleton wore coordinating white and navy looks and the same navy suede pumps.
Markle was previously seen with the Queen for a Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. The outing also marked the Suits star's first photo op with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. She joined senior members of the royal family in celebrating the holiday at Her Majesty's Norfolk estate.
A week prior, Markle was invited to the Queen's pre-Christmas luncheon, where she rubbed elbows with about 50 members of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince George and Princess Charlotte were also in attendance; though they weren't photographed with Markle.
Markle had already met the Queen a few times before announcing her engagement to Prince Harry in November. "It's incredible.
“I think, to be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love he has for her as his grandmother," she said in her first interview with her fiancé.
"All of those layers have been so important for me so when I met her I had such a deep understanding, and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her, and she's an incredible woman," she added.
