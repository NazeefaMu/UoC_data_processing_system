Baahubali and Kattapa  to reunite at Madame Tussauds

‘Baahubali; the conclusion’ hit theatres on April, 28, 2017. It’s been nearly a year since the film released but the magnum opus still manages to be in the news for some achievement or the other.
As per the latest update, another character from Baahubali will get his own wax statue at the Madame Tussauds. He is one of our favourites and is the most powerful one after Baahubali. In fact he is the only one who could have killed the royal kin., We are talking about Kattappa aka Sathyaraj! As per reports, his characters will be immortalised into a wax statue. Looks like Kattappa will be by his side even at Madame Tussauds!
