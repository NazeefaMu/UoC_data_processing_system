Express train tickets sold at higher prices at Kandy Railway Station

The Railway Department has initiated a probe on a complaint that a person working at the tourist information desk at the Kandy Railway Station is selling tickets for express trains at exorbitant prices to foreign tourists.
The worker is allegedly buying tickets for express trains plying from Kandy to Colombo and Kandy to Badulla and selling them to foreign tourists at higher prices.,
It has been alleged that the employee sells a Rs.1,000 ticket at Rs.3,000.
The Kandy Railway Station said that an investigation was launched into the allegations. He refuted allegations that a Railway Department worker at the Kandy Station was involved in the racket.
He said that the Intercity Express trains tickets could be bought 30 days prior to an Intercity journey.
He said anyone could buy tickets prior to the journey and sell it to a third party on the day of the journey at a higher price. Only a limited number of tickets are issued for the intercity express trains, he said.
The Station Master said passengers had a responsibility to inform authorities about such illegal practices.
