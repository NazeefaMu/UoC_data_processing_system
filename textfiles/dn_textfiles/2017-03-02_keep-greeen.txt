Keep the greeen

Architecture benefits mental and physical health. The ingenious creation of spaces to kindle the mind and energize the body is the responsibility of the architect and in today’s world not only does he have a duty to provide the best to his client but also he must be mindful of the city as a whole such as the creation of vertical gardens. Arch World features Archt. Pradeep Fernando to discuss the environmental sustainability.
“It is a challenge to the architect creating different moods through his skill -not making stereotypical designs, but giving it a sense of place. On a gloomy or sunny day you have a sense of equanimity. You enjoy life, your feelings are awakened. You are comfortable at all times of the day perceiving nature and its facets,” said Fernando.
The value of preserving trees cannot be over emphasized. Good architecture ensures that you are visually connected to nature through the change of colors in the sky and the movements of the birds. You get to enjoy the changes in the weather. That is the composition of the volumes, materials, textures and indoor atmosphere, because the outdoor directly influences the indoor. It creates a perception of space.
“Trees give a lot of visual pleasure and a lot of comfort. Sometimes we live in a polluted environment. Fumes coming from vehicles. Between the road and the front garden why not grow some big trees? The trees are able to absorb the toxic air. The trees also provide shade. If you take Wellawatte, it has developed in a very ad hoc manner. Too many unplanned buildings. In the day time it is difficult to walk because of the heat. There is no vegetation. It has become a concrete jungle unlike the time when we were kids, it was a very residential area. Now it is not properly designed and it is like vertical slums. It is not very conducive for human living,” explained Fernando
So foliage and gardens make a big difference. In the past you get these sparrows that visited your garden but now they are not to be seen. Their music and sounds made living a pleasure.
“Trees cut down your heat, purifying the air and creating a canopy. Even if you are in a small garden you can select the right tree, mentioned before in the previous article - Karapincha. How about even a citrus tree? This can retard the ambient temperature. It helps enhance the environmental quality and the atmosphere. It also gives you visual pleasure,” pointed out Fernando
In his designs Fernando tries to preserve trees as much as possible and orient the building in such a way.
“My theory is that if you cut down one tree you should grow another five trees. To cut off a tree it only takes a few hours or minutes, but to grow one, it takes years. We as architects should be very responsive to global warming. Environmental pollution is a very serious issue. In some small way everybody can contribute. In your little garden space you can grow things that will enhance the environmental quality,” added Fernando
Sometimes in a little space you can have vertical gardens. Not only does it enhance your living space, it contributes to the well- being of the city. The development must go hand in hand with the environmental quality. In fact many cities are now looking to go vertical and grow gardens atop buildings.
