Contract dispute threatens West Indies on eve of World T20

Protesting players of the West Indies team could be axed from the national squad for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in March-April if they fail to accept the financial contracts offered by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) by February 14, the board said on Tuesday.
WICB has taken the hard-hitting stand after it was revealed that the 15-man squad has rejected the offered contracts, unhappy with the huge pay cut.
Darren Sammy, West Indies captain, wrote a letter to the WICB, stating that the financial terms for the World T20, which starts on March 8, were unacceptable.
"We want to represent the West Indies but the financials on offer we can't accept," Sammy wrote in his letter to the board. "We have collectively discussed the remuneration on offer to participate in the T20 World Cup. Considering that 14 out of the 15-man squad are not part of West Indies Players' Association (WIPA) - and hence have not given authorisation to WIPA to negotiate on our behalf - and a large number do not receive any significant remuneration from WICB at all, we want the opportunity to negotiate fairly the financial terms within the contract."
WICB, however, is not ready to negotiate the terms, Michael Muirhead, the board's chief executive, told a Jamaican radio channel.
"The WICB is committed to play in the tournament, let me say that first," Muirhead said. "No one will leave the shores of the West Indies without signing a contract, and if these players in particular choose not to sign, then I guess we'll be left with no option but to substitute other players for them."
Muirhead also added that the board was not in a position to improve the remuneration package, as the terms were negotiated with the players association nine months ago.
"They have had lots of time to digest and argue and do everything," he said. "Five of the players were instrumental and were there at the onset, so at this point, I'm hoping that the players will sign and take advantage of the other benefits that are there."
Sammy has called for an emergency meeting with the officials ahead of their deadline, and has proposed that the players will participate in the ICC mega event under the same conditions as during previous tournaments. Sammy said the players, who were facing a pay cut of nearly 80 percent, would earn only $21,000 each this edition as compared to $135,000 at the last tournament.
West Indies, who won the 2012 World Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka, are currently second in the ICC T20I rankings.
The latest disagreement between WICB and its players comes around 18 months after the premature end of West Indies' tour of India because of a long-standing payment dispute.
West Indies squad for World T20: Darren Sammy (captain), Samuel Badree, Sulieman Benn, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Andre Fletcher, Chris Gayle, Jason Holder, Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin, Andre Russell, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Jerome Taylor.
