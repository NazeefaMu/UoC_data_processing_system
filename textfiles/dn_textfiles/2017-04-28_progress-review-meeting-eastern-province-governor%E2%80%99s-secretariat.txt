The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) yesterday called upon the government to fulfill its obligations on the recommendations of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism (CTFRM), the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and other commissions’ appointed by the government on the issues stipulated below without delay.
The NCCSL in a statement expressed its serious concerns on the slow pace and non implementation of the required and agreed measures and steps in its efforts that the government needs to take for National Reconciliation and Harmony in the nation.
The statement:
“The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) wishes to express its serious concerns on the slow pace and non-implementation of the required and agreed measures and steps in its efforts that the government needs to take for National Reconciliation and Harmony in our nation.
“In this regard, we call upon the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to fulfill its obligations on the recommendations of the ‘Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism (CTFRM), The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and other Commissions’ appointed by the Government, on the issues stipulated below without further delay.
“Whilst welcoming the initial progress in returning lands to rightful owners, a much greater extent of land and property belonging to the people in the North continues to be occupied by the military.
“However, notwithstanding the security concerns of the State, it is equally important and elementarily just, that land and property belonging to the people are returned to them for their own use for all purposes of rightful living. Following the conclusion of the war in 2008 and 2009, the affected families whose members have ‘disappeared’ are yet to be notified of the status of these ‘missing’ persons, even after having made repeated representations to commissions, committees and authorities appointed by the government. This long delay is causing untold trauma and mental agony to the families of the missing.
“In keeping with the standards and practices of ‘good governance’, we call on the authorities to initiate urgent action to begin the legal process where indictments are to be filed and for immediate release of those against whom ‘no charges’ whatsoever are framed.
“We urge the government to be transparent in the constitutional reform process that it committed itself to during the elections, not to drag its feet on this issue and to work towards a genuine power sharing arrangement and thus win the trust and confidence of the people and contribute toward the building of a one Sri Lankan nation and present a people-oriented ‘constitutional reforms’ bill to Parliament for discussion soon and for immediate thereafter to begin the process of adopting the new constitution and its implementing power sharing.”
