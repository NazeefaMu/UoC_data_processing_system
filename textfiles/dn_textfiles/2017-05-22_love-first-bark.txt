Love at First Bark

Have you ever been awakened by a brown-eyed beauty who walks over to your bed long before the sun decides to leave his own bed, stands only millimeters away, her lips grazing your cheeks to see if you are awake (or alive)? If you pretend to be otherwise, woe betide, she will sneeze right in your face. And when you reluctantly open your eyes you see her gazing at you, smiling, panting a hello! Even though the alarm clock says its 4 in the morning, you can’t help grinning back.
Welcome to a story you already probably know a lot about: Devoted dog: Besotted owner. Sure they are more work than cats. Sure, they make bigger messes. Sure, they eat more. But they also have bigger hearts. They just want to love and be loved. And really, who can turn a blind eye to all that love, adoration and enthusiasm?
No wonder Andy Rooney once said, “The average dog is a nicer person than the average person.” And Rudyard Kipling wrote, “When the Man waked up he said, ‘What is Wild Dog doing here?’ And the Woman said, ‘His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend, because he will be our friend for always and always and always.’” And George Bernard Shaw observed,”If you eliminate smoking and gambling, you will be amazed to find that almost all an Englishman’s pleasures can be, and mostly are, shared by his dog.” And Charles M. Schulz said, “Happiness is a warm puppy.”
Sweet little bark
In the form of a bulldog perhaps, or a chihuahua or a Labrador or the best of them all - a puppy picked up from the street. All of them are guaranteed to put you on top of the world with just one sweet little bark. Miss Asia Kinney, is the bulldog who knew how to do it right and caught Lady Gaga’s, heart. Asia has her own Instagram account, has appeared in a television trailer and is even set to launch her own line of pet products. Heiress and reality star Paris Hilton’s Tinkerbell, was with her for 14 years, was inseparable and usually lived in her handbag.
Sadly, Tinkerbell is no more, but, comfortingly, she left behind three brothers and sisters who make equally gorgeous accessories for the glamorous 34-year-old. Ben Fogle of BBC’s Castaway fame has Labrador Storm. He and his wife Marina, bought Storm at a poignant time. ‘We call her Storm because of the way she stormed into our lives,’ he says. ‘We got her just after Marina had a late miscarriage, a few weeks before our little boy was due to be born. It was by no means a replacement but it was something to look forward to as a family. Having a dog teaches you to be less selfish because you have to look after them.’
Ben also believes dogs and their owners can share personalities. ‘When people choose a dog they try to match their own personality, or the personality they’d like to have. I’ve always had Labradors and I think I’m slightly Labrador-esque. I’m quite chilled, quite laid-back, l like to please people... and I’m also quite greedy.’
He could be right. Recent studies have found a very clear correlation between people’s personalities and what type of dogs they owned; for example, people who owned toy dogs tended to be more intelligent, while owners of utility dogs like Dalmatians and bulldogs were the most conscientious. Other studies have found that dog owners in general are more outgoing and friendly than cat owners. But be careful: Dogs also take on their owners’ personality traits, so if you fly off the handle all the time, it might explain why your dog is so bad tempered too!
Feelings of happiness
Hopefully, not for long. Not if you pause for a minute to gaze at your dog. A 2009 study by Miho Nagasawa of Azabu University in Japan found that one’s level of oxytocin (the neurohormone that elicits feelings of happiness) raised intensely after interacting with their dogs. And the only interaction they needed was to stare into their dog’s eyes. Those who looked longer into their dog’s eyes had the bigger dose of oxytocin.
And then there is the meaning of a dog’s “gaze,” too. Like the human gaze which is layered with nuance, dog owners may ascribe similar complexity to their dog’s gaze, too, certain that they, like parents, can interpret it. “If your dog’s gaze helps you think your dog understands you,” says Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, New York, “this can produce bonding.”
Dogs, of course, offer more than just companionship. In fact, everything about owning a dog seems to lend itself to better health. Just the act of petting a dog lowers heart rate and blood pressure. A Chinese study found that people who own dogs get better sleep at night and are sick less often. Other studies show dog owners have slightly lower cholesterol and are more likely to survive a heart attack.
While other pets have positive effects on your health as well, dogs have the added benefit of needing to be walked and played with numerous times a day. This means most dog owners get the recommended minimum 30 minutes of exercise a day, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease and keeping them in better overall shape than cat owners (sigh) or people without pets.
Sense of security
Dogs can also be an effective home security system. Studies show that barking dogs deter burglars. Just knowing that you have got a dog who can use its keen sense of hearing to detect anyone prowling around can help increase your sense of security, which is good for both your mental and physical health.
But for me, it is John Grogan, who best sums up the magic of having a dog in our lives. “A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A dog doesn’t care if you’re rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and he’ll give you his. How many people can you say that about? How many people can make you feel rare and pure and special? How many people can make you feel extraordinary?” So, the next time those big brown eyes gaze at you, deeply and lovingly and the tail goes thump thump thump on the floor, caress that silky head and let your heart leap.
Fun facts about having a dog
1: When you drop food on the floor, they will eat it. They also like to eat the random scraps of food left behind.
2: They force you to exercise. Dogs like to go for walks. It gives you the perfect excuse to roam the neighborhood at night and look through your neighbor’s windows. (But in a totally non-creepy way).
3: They are always happy to see you. Your dog will get so excited when all of you are finally home.
4: When you are home alone you have someone to talk to. And your dog will look at you and cock their heads and pretend they understand. (If you tell your puppy how smart she is she will chase her tail around until she is dizzy and falls over.)
5: A dog teaches your children and you, too, responsibility. Left your favorite shoes in the middle of the room and the dog chewed on them? Well, should have put them away where they belong.
6: A dog can also teach your children compassion and anger control. See the shoes above.
7: Dogs like to snuggle up to you and keep you warm when it’s raining.
8: Kids learn about taking care of someone other than themselves. You shouldn’t count on a kid to do all the chores related to a family pet, but they should be certainly aware of the dog’s needs to be fed and given fresh water.
