Cabinet approves Policy on National Reconciliation: Chandrika

The National Policy on Reconciliation has been approved by the Cabinet, the Chairman of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and former President Chandrika Banadaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday announced.
She said ONUR’s National Policy will be the state policy on national reconciliation and co-existence, which will serve as a guideline for carrying out national reconciliation programmes throughout the country for all stakeholders, including ministries, government institutions and NGOs alike.
Former President Kumaratunge said so at a press conference held at her ONUR office in the SEMA building, Colombo.
She said it is the first time that such a comprehensive policy has been adopted by any government.
“You can say that it is not only the policy of the government, it is the policy of state of Sri Lanka on reconciliation,” she said.
She said they finalised what they thought as the ultimate draft on the national reconciliation policy after a process of wide array of consultations with institutions, persons, ministries and NGOs that are concerned on the subject.
“We sent the draft to Cabinet under the signature of President Maithripala Sirisena, who gave us much leadership as ONUR comes under the purview of the President.
“When one of the Ministers, Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages requested some amendments to the draft with regard to two matters, namely language policy and coexistence mainly, they too were resolved and entered into the final draft,” she said and added, “the final draft being prepared by ONUR has just been approved last week, on the second of May by the Cabinet, and probably confirmed today (yesterday) by it.”
She said some of the main objectives of the Policy document have already been implemented. They include religious festivals and events, cultural programs, and conflict awareness programs to be participated by school children across the island. In keeping with these programs the children of other religions belonging to various ethnic communities are to take part in at least one main religious event of another religion,Kumaratunge explained.
She said they have already covered up to 200, 000 school children above 13 years already. “We are not going to let it stop there for there will be a second phase. We have a lot of other programs to create awareness among adults where they come and discuss the conflict, harmony and coexistence at workshops,” she said.
“We also use various art forms and sports events to promote reconciliation. Language policy is being implemented by the Minister of Languages. The resettlement or handing bank of lands to rightful owners is being done by another ministry.”
“I must also say that forces are very much involved in the resettlement process for they are building houses in the North for those who have lost them due to the conflict,” she said.
“We also talk about guaranteeing the rights of the minorities while a Constitutional process- is also in effect. Its process is somewhat slow. It is in the hands of Parliament and the government,” she pointed out.
The policy on Reconciliation has been drafted after revisiting the findings and insights contained in reports such as the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission report, Kudalagama Commission report, the Paranagama Commission report.
ONUR has also taken into account the findings of civil society initiatives, such as Multicultural Vision for Peace and several other initiatives, ONUR officials said here.
