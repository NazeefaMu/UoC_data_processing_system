Yan Oya Reservoir Project:
Call for resolution of rifts between agencies

President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed irrigation and water resources management authorities, the Mahaweli Consultancy Bureau and the Central Environmental Authority, to take prompt action to resolve all conflicts among agencies involved in the Yan Oya Reservoir Project and to accelerate the delayed resettlement programme and other relevant components.
It was learnt that due to the delay in releasing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) by the Mahaweli Consultancy Bureau, the resettlement of evacuated families, demarcation of alternative muddy lands and compensations for lands acquired, were adversely affected. Anuradhapura Government Agent and Head of Yan Oya Reservoir Project Progress Review Committee R. M. Wanninayake said that the delay being caused by the Mahweli Consultancy Bureau in providing the EIS, was unjustifiable and that the Irrigation Secretary had been requested to look in to the matter immediately.Although families had settled down at Omarakanda after receiving housing compensations, there were many legal barricades concerning house construction as jungle-clearing was only partly allowed by forest authorities.
The forest landscapes planned to be released from the Forest Conservation Department for the purpose of resettlement and for reinstating both muddy lands and highlands, was 1,400 hectares in Urawewa, Whalkada, Malporuwa, Kajuwattha, Kumbukwewa, Issanwewa, Omarakada, Moragama and Indulhitiyawa, come under both, the Trincomale and Anuradhapura districts. At present, inquiries into claims for acquired land are being held. It is understood that out of nearly 3,000 claims, inspection of suitability for granting compensation had been completed only in about 1,000 claims so far.
The construction work of the left bank canal, which is 20 km in length, is yet to be commenced and that of the south bank canal, shows only little progress. According to sources, it would take at least another two years to complete the construction of the two canals as a whole, having gone through processes such as land acquirement, payment of compensations, resettlement and soil tests. The government is to spend around Rs. 45 billion for the project.
