Ten-year plan to develop Colombo

A 10-year development plan has been initiated for Colombo under the theme ‘Ape Colombo’, the first female Mayor of Colombo Rosy Senanayake said on Monday, after taking oaths before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees.
“We are lucky to have the support of the government in implementing our 10-year plan in Colombo,” she added.
Senanayake said the 10-year plan will focus on the physical development of Colombo, giving special attention to sewage disposal which would need an enormous amount of finance. Sewage disposal was a priority after the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump which resulted in 32 deaths. The council further plans to construct 50,000 houses for underserved settlements, through the central government or by private – public partnerships.
Apart from the 10-year development project, special projects will be implemented to provide sanitation, drinking water, toilet facilities and restore the water pipes and sewage disposal systems. Projects to establish community centres and digitize services will start immediately.
“We had a great victory at the past elections after 17 years and it is our duty to give the best to the citizens, making Colombo a safe and beautiful city,” said the newly-appointed Mayor.
The Mayor also spoke about the increased female participation, stating, “This is a historic and special occasion because 29 out of the 60 members are females. There were only two women last time.”
The ceremony was presided over by the Prime Minister who witnessed the oaths taking with Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
“Dengue fever and garbage disposal are major issues in the city.
We should work to eradicate these problems and create a better life for the people,” said the Prime Minister.
Colombo was rated as the city with the highest rate of dengue casualties in 2017 with over 18,000 reported cases.
The Premier told the gathering: “You were not selected by preferential votes, but as representatives of your divisions. Your duty is to visit these citizens and be with the people. We do not need members who come to the council by bicycle and goes back with Benz cars after four years.”
