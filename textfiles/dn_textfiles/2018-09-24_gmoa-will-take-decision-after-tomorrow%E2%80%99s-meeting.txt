SAITM issue
GMOA will take decision  after tomorrow’s meeting

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will take crucial decisions on the SAITM issue after the emergency meeting of its General Committee tomorrow (25), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA will hold discussions with its membership, its lawyers, the political authorities and President Maithripala Sirisena in the next few days on the SAITM issue.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the Supreme Court judgement had considered the technical facts presented during the Appeal Court judgement. The government abolished SAITM and protected the rights of SAITM students through an Act of Parliament.
The government abolished SAITM and passed the Act in Parliament after considering the technical facts presented by experts and scholars. What the court does is to interpret the existing law of the country. The quality and standard of a doctor ensures the safety of patients. It was repeatedly proved that SAITM did not meet the required standards, Dr. Aluthge said.
