Scotland and Ireland ‘stay alive’

DUBLIN, Saturday – Scotland ended a decade of Welsh hurt and an Ireland side inspired by Johnny Sexton beat France as they each kept their Six Nations title hopes alive on Saturday.
The Scots’ 29-13 success at Murrayfield saw them come from 13-9 down at half-time and end a run of nine successive defeats by Wales, with Vern Cotter's men scoring 20 unanswered points after the break.
Second-half tries from wings Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser saw Scotland pull clear, with fly-half Finn Russell landing all seven of his goal-kicks for a 19-point haul in place of injured first-choice kicker and captain Greig Laidlaw.
Table-toppers Ireland's 19-9 win over France may have been less spectacular, featuring just the one try from scrum-half Conor Murray, but the match saw fit-again Ireland fly-half Sexton mark his return from injury with an 11-point salvo.
With reigning champions England the only side to have won their opening two fixtures and hosting a fragile Italy at Twickenham on Sunday, the other four sides in the tournament knew they had to win on Saturday to “stay alive”, in the words of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt.
