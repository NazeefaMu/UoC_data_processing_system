DirectPay and PayMedia facilitate  eLocal Government Payment Services

DirectPay and PayMedia have come forward as pioneers to facilitate eLocal government service payments which was launched on the 29th of January by Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando and Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha.
eLocal government (eLG) services is a project by The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) aimed at automating essential day to day transactions provided by local authorities. eLG allows citizens to access efficient online transactional services. As digital transactions are faster, more convenient and secure, they are set to become the preferred channel for individuals and businesses to access government services.
PayMedia and DirectPay allow payments for eLocal government services in two different ways bringing digital payment opportunities to millions of Sri Lankans. People who choose to pay through the DirectPay app can simply log in to the application through their mobile phone and pay for the selected eLocal government service. Those who do not have access to a smart device they can simply locate an eLocal Government Payment kiosk, follow the necessary steps and deposit the money into the machine. All payments happen in real time bringing a seamless payments experience 24x7 that has never been experienced by the citizens of Sri Lanka.
