Zimbabwean Ervine sends Hampshire top of the table

LONDON: Zimbabwean Sean Ervine rounded off a superb performance by taking the final two wickets to send Hampshire top of the First Division of the county championship on Monday with a crushing win over Warwickshire.
The 34-year-old -- who played five Tests for Zimbabwe and 42 One Day Internationals -- scored a sublime double century in Hampshire’s 515 in their only innings as they won by an innings and 94 runs.
His two wickets for the cost of just one run saw Warwickshire skittled out for 167 in their second innings with just veteran Ian Bell putting up any worthwhile resistance eking out his 99th first-class half century.
Despite rain causing a brief hiatus 34-year-old Ervine secured the final two wickets to seal victory -- making Hampshire the only county to have three wins to their tally this season.
It left the county’s Australian captain George Bailey very content.
“It was a fantastic win,” the 34-year-old skipper told the BBC.
“A great team performance. It is a great start to the season. I think the club will be really happy with that.
“The only thing we spoke about this morning was about getting through Trott and Bell, then see what happens after that. If it had rained, there is not a lot we could have done.
“I was proud of the way we controlled the game in the first three days.
“Full credit to Jimmy Adams (he scored 166) and Sean Ervine for their phenomenal partnership. It was really hard work and they went about it their way.”
