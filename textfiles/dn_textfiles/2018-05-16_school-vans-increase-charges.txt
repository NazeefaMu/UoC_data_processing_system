School vans to increase charges

School vans drivers will increase transport charges by eight to ten percent, after the recent fuel price hike.
The proposed increase will come into effect from June, Secretary to the All Ceylon Inter District School Van Drivers’ Association, Kithsiri Amarasinghe told the Daily News in Kurunegala yesterday.
He said the cost of spare parts, salaries of employees and parking fees too have gone up and hence this increase of transport charges is reasonables. There are about 15,000 registered members in their association and the total number of school vans countrywide is around 22,000. “Despite obstacles, we try our best to offer safe transport service to the school student population of this country,” he added.
