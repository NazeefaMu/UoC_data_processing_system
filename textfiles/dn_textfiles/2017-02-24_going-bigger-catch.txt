Going for bigger catch

The topic of fish and the Palk Straits was one of six presentations by groups studying creative diplomacy at the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies Colombo. The writer was privy to presentations.
Globally more fish are harvested than meat. Sri Lanka has traditional fishing grounds. The prospects in the industry has enhanced with the reopening of EU markets and the growth of the post conflict Northern and Eastern grounds. A further incentive is the returning to profits of the Fisheries Cooperation after a sustained drought of losses.
Palk Strait is named after Robert Palk, governor of Madras presidency from 1755 to 1763 separating the Northern coast of Sri Lanka from the Southeast coast of India. Both countries have signed bilateral agreements on the maritime boundary as per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS which became effective from 8 July 1974 followed by a supplementary agreement signed in 1976. (Both India and Sri Lanka have signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which does not recognize maritime territory based on any historical claim).
The maritime boundary between the two countries was delineated in the Gulf of Mannar from the south-western edge of the Bay of Bengal to a point further down in a south-western axis up to the point where the boundaries of India, Sri Lanka and Maldives met in the Indian Ocean. Both countries enjoy sovereign rights over the waters, the islands, continental shelf and sub-soil of the maritime area on their respective side of the delineated boundary. Indian fishermen and pilgrims have also been permitted access to Kachhativu Island which falls on the Sri Lankan side of the maritime boundary.
The Indians mostly fish at night, with boats originating from Rameshwaram, Mandapam, Kottaipattinam, Jagadipattinam, Kodikkarai and Nagapattinamin coastal Tamilnadu. Moreover, their use of gill nets and synthetic nets has caused severe damage to the ordinary nets of Sri Lankan fishermen. They come in droves by night reaching a fever pitch towards 1am.
They outnumber their counterparts roughly a by a scale of 5:1. Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen could not freely fish during the last three years of the Fourth Eelam War (2006-09) due security restrictions, particularly on night fishing. Activities of the Indian fishermen allegedly increased as a result. Use of synthetic nets and the extended area of their operations seem to have adversely affected the livelihood fishermen families in Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Jaffna.
TamilNadu’s fishermen are not allowed to freely operate in the coastal waters of adjoining (Andhra Pradesh state. It is the same situation vis-à-vis Andhra fishermen’s conventional jurisdiction off the Orissa coast. Indian fisher folk normally observe such territorial limitations and there is no reason why they should not do so off Sri Lankan waters.
Solutions
Sri Lanka does not understand why it should restrict the number of days they fish on their side of the maritime boundary and why Indian fishermen have any right to fish in the first instance in Sri Lankan waters. Fish though are not constricted underwater by man made boundaries. In January this year, India and Sri Lanka held ministerial-level talks on their long-standing dispute over fishermen in the Palk Strait. Indian Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Radha Mohan Singh met with Sri Lanka’s Minister for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera.
The Indian side agreed to encourage Indian fishermen to avoid the practice of “bottom trawling” — an unsustainable mode of fishing that indiscriminately captures aquatic life, leading to overfishing. The Indian External Affairs Ministry noted in its press release that “bottom trawling would be phased out in a graded time-bound manner within a practicable timeframe.”
Parliament is scheduled to debate two bills concerning the issue. One bill would increase fines for Indian fishermen caught fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters and the other would ban mechanized bottom trawler.
There are calls to restrict the number of Indian trawlers that are allowed to operate beyond the maritime boundary, restrictions on the number of fishing craft and their technical capacity as well as the nature of the fishing nets used.
A Palk Bay Authority
An integrated solution to the fishermen’s problems encompassing their livelihood issues and commerce in the area has been proposed. In addition to New Delhi and Colombo, the government of Tamil Nadu and the Provincial Council of the Northern Province with fishing communities in both countries need to be involved.
A Palk Bay authority, comprising fisheries experts, marine ecologists, fishermen’s representatives, strategic specialists, and government officials from both governments. The authority could determine the ideal sustainable catch, type of fishing equipment that can be used, special provisions could be made to protect the interests of traditional fishermen and oversee pricing. The focus should be on the enrichment of marine resources and a qualitative improvement in the lives of coastal people.
A win-win
India has numerical superiority on fishing capacity. Sri Lanka has rich fishing grounds with potential to develop the industry further.
An agreement to nurture the fishing grounds, fish responsibly collectively on either side of the boundary with licensed craft, provide for fair sale of the catch in Sri Lanka whilst allowing sale in India, may bring dividends to all parties. It calls for cooperation across the Palk Straits on fishing. Hence from defensive postures moving to a common understanding to preserve means of livelihood and food, exploit the revenue earning potential responsibly from the industry, whilst respecting rights over the respective maritime zones would be a mature way of going forward.
