SLIM holds CSR project on blood and organ donation

Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing held a community driven CSR project, blood and human organs donation campaign for the second occasion recently at the SLIM Business School in Colombo.
The campaign was organised with the objective of inculcating qualities of empathy and social responsibility within SLIM students. Through this campaign SLIM encouraged its students and stake-holders to donate blood and sign up to donate human organs to the sick, less fortunate and needy people in the society.
Thus, eyes and tissue donations were amalgamated with the blood donation programme. It was significant that SLIM students showed much eagerness to sign-up for the donation of eyes, tissues and limbs to the needy.
In accordance to its vision, SLIM is poised to elevate the status of marketing in the country in a socially responsible manner. The business model of SLIM thus looks beyond mere financial management and measurements, and to be in harmony with factors which nurture this blue planet that our people inherit.
In line with this objective, SLIM embarks on society driven CSR programmes from time to time adhering to the triple bottom line; society, economy and environment.
SLIM and Colombo SLIM Students’ Association organized the Blood Donation campaign together with the National Blood Transfusion Service, Human Tissue Bank and Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society.
The drive was carried out with the theme, ‘Be a Hero’, implying the opportunity for everyone to make a difference by saving lives.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake said that all SLIM activities adhere to the core objective of adding value to the marketing sphere and elevating the status of marketing in the country.
“SLIM conducted this blood and organs donation campaign to shed light on social responsibility. True marketers always make emphasis on social responsibility. CSR projects such as these add value to the effort made by SLIM in elevating the status of marketing in Sri Lanka. We groom students to become fully fledged marketers who could marvel in the global context.
Thus we inculcate qualities such as empathy and social responsibility in them, in addition to professional training”, said Senanayake.
Credible and value adding training programmes, tutoring and multiple support sessions of SLIM have been endorsed by the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka.
