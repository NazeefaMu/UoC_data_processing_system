Moves to regulate private health sector

The Health Ministry will take steps to regulate the private health sector to provide a better service for the public, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the ministry will regulate drug issuing processes and treatment to patients by private hospitals. Regulation will be put in place under the new drug policy and through the Private Health Services Regulatory Council. Private hospitals will be briefed on the regulatory process in a circular issued by the Health Ministry soon, the sources said.
The private hospitals that allow public sector employees to serve in them violating public service rules and regulations will be blacklisted. A detailed bill should be issued to patients by all private hospitals. A Consultant should spend at least ten minutes on one patient during channeling. A doctor should wait at least one hour before and after performing a surgery on a patient in a private hospital, the sources said.
The new circular will limit consultation charges levied by private medical institutions. Charges for consultation by a Consultant or a Specialist Doctor would be between Rs.250 and Rs.2,000. Private hospital fee for such consultation should be between Rs.100 and Rs.500. The maximum price of an eye lens will be Rs. 10,000. Every private hospital should display consultation charges to be easily viewed by the public. Instant raids will be conducted to detect private hospitals that violate the new circular. Raids will commence two weeks after issuing the circular. Special attention will be paid to the charges on surgeries and treatment, the sources said.
