ODEL unveils ‘Beyond the Sea’ with oceanic Spring 2018 Collection

If fashion is about dressing for the occasion, time and place, ODEL’s beach-inspired Spring 2018 Collection gives inhabitants of the paradise isle and visitors the perfect attire and accessories to effect a chic seasonal makeover.
Reminiscent of a non-stop beach vacation, the Spring Collection at Colombo’s favourite department store lends itself to looks inspired by the sea, and also explores elements of the recent, glimmering ‘modern mermaid’ trend.
Aptly themed ‘Beyond the Sea’, the just-in collection made of an assortment of textures unveiled on the February 1, features pieces fashioned from chiffon, crepe, cotton viscose, linen, crushed velvet, sequin silk, transparent sheer fabric and multiple sequin patterned fabrics.
A mix of chic and rustic designs, complete with stripes, tropical prints, and palm fringes the collection is inspired by world-renowned brands such as Balmain, Gucci, Valentino, Prada, Elie Saab, and Jason Wu; and come in shades of blue, pink, green, gold, silver, yellow, green, brown, and red redolent of the ocean, glorious sunsets and all things beachy.
“Spring is a time for frolicking, and for most, it is the time to get out there and really experience the beauty of the ocean. Our Spring 2018 Collection is inspired by the sea and its intricacies, and especially by the latest and popular ‘mermaid’ trend that’s taken the world by storm,” said Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings which owns the iconic department store chain. “We see fashion as a vehicle of self expression; and for that, the collection gives plenty of opportunity.”
The ‘seanic’ collection also extends itself to fashion lines for men and kids, which too feature tropical prints and light colours. The matching accessories collection also explores oceanic elements in lighter shades, with beads and tassels to complete the ensemble. Furthermore, in keeping with the theme, the Home Collection at ODEL showcases a product line that touches on coastal interior styles with beach tones, seaside motifs, and rustic, nautical themed items.
Staying true to the oceanic theme, all ODEL department stores are now dressed in accents evocative of the ocean, giving shoppers the feeling of a beach vacation as they pick out their outfits for spring.
