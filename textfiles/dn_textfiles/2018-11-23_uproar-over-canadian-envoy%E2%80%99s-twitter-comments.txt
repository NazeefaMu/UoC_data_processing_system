Uproar over Canadian envoy’s twitter comments

The Canadian High Commissioner has created a furore with his comments on the political situation in the country.
Commenting on a twitter message sent to MP Namal Rajapaksa by the Canadian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka David McKinnon, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador to Russia Dr. Dayan Jayathilleke in a Facebook message has stated: “shameful and outrageously intrusive” An unprovoked aggression on the part of a Diplomat? Intervening in the domestic debate to rebuke and “rebut” Namal who was criticising the UNP-JVP-TNA?.
“It is interesting to see UNP, JVP and TNA politicians meeting with the international community. Perhaps if more effort was given towards meeting with the people and communities of Lanka and paying heed to their hope for elections, Sri Lanka finally can achieve its fullest potential,” MP Namal Rajapaksa’s tweet said.
Canadian High Commissioner McKinnon in reply to MP Namal states: “You might ask some of your Podu Jana Party colleagues who they are meeting with,”. This has drawn the attention of Sri Lanka’s envoy to Russia, Dr. Dayan Jayathilleke and he throwing facts to the face the Canadian High Commmissioner has indicated that his reply shows “intervening in the domestic debate, to rebuke and ‘rebut’ Namal who was criticising the UNP, JVP and the TNA.
MP Namal Rajapaksa, while thanking the Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka McKinnon said: “Thank you for your engagement. Recalling that Sri Lanka remains a sovereign nation and home to a brilliant people, the leaders of Sri Lanka, whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people, and solving their concerns, including their call to elections”.
