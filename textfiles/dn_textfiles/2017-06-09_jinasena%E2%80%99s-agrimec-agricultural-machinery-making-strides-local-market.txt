Jinasena’s Agrimec agricultural machinery making strides in local market

Jinasena, a leading water management systems and solutions providers in Sri Lanka, is making huge strides with their range of Agrimec branded agricultural machinery.

The company also manufactures Processed Tea Cutters, Roto Slashers, Multi Choppers, Pepper Threshers, Fodder Grass Cutters and Multi Grinder under the “Agricultural Products” category. The Processed Tea Cutter is used to create similar-sized tea pieces after the processing stage. It allows factories to convert scrappy and ragged tea leaf to equal sizes and a good standard. The Roto Slasher is used for soil preparation and rotation as well as for fertilizing of coconut cultivations. With a simple attachment, the Roto Slasher can also be used for grass and bush cutting.
