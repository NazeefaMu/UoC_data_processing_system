Colombo 8 stinks
It is indeed disappointing, that after the Magapolis, Local Government Authorities Minister and the Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner have been preaching about the segregating of garbage, no arrangements have been made to collect the segregated glass, plastic and metal recyclable material from houses along Elvitigala Mawatha, Colombo 8.
Even after numerous phone calls (including calls to 1917) and visits to the CMC depot at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 8, no action has been taken by the authorities to collect this material.
We were informed, very kindly, that this material will be collected on Saturday or Sunday but no such action has taken place to date.
Will the Municipal Commissioner and all other relevant authorities, please look into this matter as it is causing a great deal of inconvenience to those residing on Elivitigala Mawatha, Colombo 8?
