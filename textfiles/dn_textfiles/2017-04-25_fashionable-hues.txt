Fashionable hues

The Kingsbury high tea monthly fashion show featuring a vibrant collection by ‘Kadapatha’ was held at the end of March at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some fabulous designs from the label ideal for any occasion. The event received a good turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety.
