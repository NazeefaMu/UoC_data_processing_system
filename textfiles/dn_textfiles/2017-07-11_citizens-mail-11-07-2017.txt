[CITIZENS' Mail - (11-07-2017)]

Look for seawater!
Sri Lanka is an agrarian country like India. Paddy is our main product. We face difficulties because of the water shortage during the dry season. The world is 97 percent seawater and it is not used for agriculture.
I understand that in South India, a special paddy methodology has been worked out. It could be worked with seawater. Plants grown in mangroves have been genetically modified and this new brand of paddy proves successful. It is better for the Government to investigate this and obtain assistance from India before it gets too late. We could be self-sufficient in paddy and stimulate export also. More jobs could be created. The foreign exchange could be earned and saved as well.
We should target to be self-sufficient in agriculture, milk and poultry. Special investment programme and tax concessions should be considered to achieve this target.
Over to you Agriculture Minister.
