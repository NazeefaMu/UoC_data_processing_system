Cock-of-the-walk and chicken talk!

I have never considered myself a fancy cock-of-the-walk by any standards. But my Chinese zodiac birth sign insists that I am. That is because I came squealing into this world in the Year of the Rooster. In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself.
To tell the truth, I found it agreeable to be associated with the positive characteristics of the chanticleer that marked me out as a bird of the feather. Naturally, so would you if you were branded with such head-swelling correlated attributes as conveyed in the ancient astrological chart. Which states: “The Rooster can be forthright, brave, enthusiastic, loyal, tenacious, resilient, adventurous, astute, well-dressed, proficient, down-to-earth, gregarious, communicative, sensible, generous, charming, ebullient and terminally witty.”
But the negative features of my alter ego described in the subsequent chapter are far from complimentary. Because just as you are floating on air with the flattering tributes ringing in your head you find yourself on the depressive down-swing of the pendulum.
Although decidedly unfavourable it appears to have a neutralizing effect on your psyche when assailed by such analysis as: “The Rooster can also be cranky, fussy, vain, self-involved, blindly egotistical, pretentious, high-handed, cynical, mercurial, self-absorbed and quixotic as hell.”
So the jaunty cockerels are virtually in the same breath adulated and admonished in the same blasted almanac. Well, birds of a feather sometimes do flop together! When I was eight-years-old an uncle once placed an almost hatched egg under the Christmas tree. It was to be my eggs-tra ordinary gift. It was placed in a cotton-wool padded shoe box with a light bulb for warmth.
When I woke up and was enjoying opening up my presents I was delighted by the sight of a fuzzy little black chick chirping at me from a cracked shell. It turned out to be quite a chic chick and began ranging the house and large garden.
Everyone was quick to call him the eggs-plorer! It was not difficult to hand-raise him. He turned out to be a bantam cockerel and I named him Bravo. The iridescent feathers of his green and red tail and wings against his black body shimmered with his cocky walk when he followed me around.
People often commented that the pet bird had an uncanny resemblance to its little owner, or was it the other way around? They claimed we demonstrated the same feisty and insufferable characteristics. But to my utter annoyance they never mentioned that he was as handsome and flamboyant as they come.
The dumb clucks stressed on the likeness of the swagger, the full-throated crowing, the cockscombs and the confrontational attitude. And never mind the wicked, insinuating hints of the bird’s personal pleasurable proclivities they predicted I would inherit in the future. I was not amused. After all, it was inconsequential cockamamie chicken talk and humour most fowl.
Chickens may seem an odd choice for a pet, but they can be very engaging, friendly and entertaining. Contrary to popular belief they can easily be tamed and trained with food rewards. Chickens have distinct and interesting personalities. Bravo had a great soul in a little body.
Still, it takes a tough man to tame a wayward spring chicken or a rambunctious old rooster. Bravo was the epitome of the ostentatious, socially dominant strutting cockerel who strayed quite often. Everyone realised that the little rooster had soon established top social rank in the free-ranging flock’s pecking order.
Although the hand-raised bantam seemed to favour my companionship more than that of his own feathered kin and followed me around on my jaunts. Yet he had a tendency to disappear suddenly.
But he would always come home to roost looking a bit bedraggled with a triumphal twinkle in his beady eye. I aptly nicknamed him ‘The Shuttlecock’. Such absences were constrained by his overwhelming passion for romancing the neighbouring free-ranging hens.
Bravo to be sure, was a plucky little fellow and displayed his fearlessness among the domesticated roosters, many of them twice his own weight. He may have been a Bantam but he would never hesitate when taking on the ruffled heavyweights.
His cocky attitude had given him a reputation for arrogance, aggression and promiscuity. The cockfights usually took place when Bravo boldly entered their domain with one thing in mind. He was courting their jealously guarded feminine flocks. And at least five aggressive males formed an impressive phalanx to guard their harems from his advances.
But the tough country cocks were no match for my beautifully-plumed bantam even when they ganged up on him. The feisty Bravo charged his opponents in one kamikaze onslaught after another.
Bravo usually had his way with the hens of his choice after several brief skirmishes with the ruling roosters of the flocks. He loved hanging around the chic chicks and even the old hens never even put up a token squawk when he made his concupiscent forays.
All they seemed to say in chicken cackle was: “Cluckety cluck, what eggs-traordinary luck!” The biggest of those roosters was a coward. He was a big blustering bully. But the fact remained that he was chicken even for a chicken. As a fighting-cock, Bravo set the feathers flying and beat him into a cocked hat.
Besides, everyone thought that the hens fancied the handsome coquettish chanticleer far more than the bland coloured males of their own brood. Concerning Bravo, we may have been the cocks-of-the walk but although we did have our differences he deferred to me in the pecking order.
After all, going by the old parody of sticking feathers up where Yankee-Doodle stuck his does not make you a chicken. You have got to have flair. So all you ‘kukula’ types out there simply shake a tail feather and start strutting your stuff.
Besides, Chinese astrology doesn’t seem all that cockeyed as far as the positive aspects of my rooster personality are concerned. As for the negative viewpoint I would say it’s a whole lot of poppycock! You can be cocksure of that.
