Business networking session on expanding opportunities in the Russian market for SL spices and coconut products

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Russian Federation, in association with the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka, has completed yet another successful story during the month of September by organizing a Business Networking Session for the sectors of Coconut Products and Spices.
This is the third awareness programme in a series conducted by the Embassy since 2015 under the guidance of Dr. Saman Weerasinghe, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Russia, who has been the driving force behind this whole process.
The first Networking Session was on the sea food sector in September 2015 and the second - on the Gem and Jewellery sector in May 2016.
The networking session was attended by more than 45 Russian importers, supermarket chain representatives and other interested parties. The companies attended the networking session from the Sri Lanka side were NMK Agro Industries, CBL Natural Foods, Abey Marin Pvt Ltd and Colombo Export and Import Agencies Pvt Ltd.
Two short video clips on coconut-based food products and spices were displayed during the session depicting the plantations, manufacturing process, health and other compliances and end products. The companies were given an opportunity to introduce their company products and the specific details of each product.
A Russian importer who was already aware of the uniqueness of the Sri Lankan spices described to the audience his experiences on these products, the clear distinction between cassia and cinnamon and the benefits of cinnamon over cassia.
The participants were given an information dossier, including an article on cinnamon indicating why the preference should be given to cinnamon, not cassia, the company profiles and the other contact details. A gift bag including the samples of spices, virgin coconut oil, confectionary and Ceylon tea was offered to the participants to feel the real quality of the Sri Lankan products.
The Sri Lankan participants found the networking sessions to be very effective, specially conducted by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Russian Federation, as Russia is a country that requires recognition and confidence of the companies to penetrate into the market. This was experienced during the period of introduction of seafood products to the Russian Federation which has gained successful results now.
This event was conducted parallel to the International Food and Beverages Exhibition “World Food 2017” held in Moscow. This is the fourth time that Sri Lanka participated in the exhibition related to the food product sector other than the tea sector since 2015.
The World Food 2017 Exhibition wass held on September 11-14 at the Expocentre fair ground and more than 16 Sri Lankan companies representing sectors of Ceylon tea, spices, coconut products, confectionary and sea foods demonstrated their products. The foundation that the Embassy put in 2015 in diversifying the export product basket to the Russian market has now been built up into a successful story and the Government of Sri Lanka recognized this participation as a priority regular event for strengthening and maintaining the trade relations between the two countries.
