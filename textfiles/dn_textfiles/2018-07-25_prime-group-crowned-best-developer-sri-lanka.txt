Prime Group crowned As Best Developer of Sri Lanka

The Prime Group is been awarded the title of Best Developer of the year 2018 at the PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards (Sri Lanka) 2018.
The PropertyGuru Asia Property Awardsis the biggest and most respected real estate awards programme in Asia and was held for the first time in Sri Lanka this year at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo.
Having secured the “Best Developer” title for 2018, the Prime Group will also represent Sri Lanka in November this year in Thailand for the Asia Property Awards.
The award is a true testament to the Group’s unmatched status as a property developer in Sri Lanka. The awarding body undertakes a stringent selection process where each potential winner is evaluated based on a range of criteria that includes reputation, image and CSR activities, quality of projects (value for money), track record, sales success, innovation in construction, marketing and functionality, major accolades and achievements of the past, brand, peer recognition, certifications, growth and efficiency.
Over the last five years the Prime Group has initiated a number of revolutionary projects within the industry and has undertaken a total of 43 projects ranging from mid-sized housing developments, gated communities to luxury high-end condominium and residential developments.
“So far we have completed and delivered 19 projects, with another 11 awaiting completion over the next six months,” said Chairman, Brahmanage Premalal, speaking on the meteoric rise of the Group.

The Group was also awarded the title of ‘Great place to Work’ for the fourth consecutive year among 25 best organizations to work for in Sri Lanka, by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The award is a direct reflection of employee satisfaction within the Group. The Prime Group enjoys exceptionally low employee turnover and zealously invests in the happiness of their employees through a host of internal programs that includes career and skills development, personal growth programs as well as programs designed to uplift individual employees.
As the market leader in real estate and land development, the Prime Group places much importance on the impact they create on their clientele, but more importantly on the perceptions they build in the minds of their employees. “We have always been an organization that has endeavoured to create a work environment which allows our people to work together seamlessly while performing to the best of their abilities, towards the success of the organization”, says a representative of the company.
As the only property developer to have secured this, much sought-after title, the organization does not hesitate to credit their multiple recognitions - as a great place to work and the best developer of 2018– to their most valued employees; as the Group thrives on the belief that great people create great places of work.
