Bouquet for Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat
Recently I visited Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat for an official matter. No sooner I entered the secretariat complex/premises, a security guard showed me a place to park the vehicle. Then we went into the main building, where a large waiting/sitting/visiting area with comfortable seats was nicely set.
At the reception, the officer on duty offered his service to assist me and then correctly gave me directions to the District Secretary’s (formally GA - Government Agent) office. The officer at the reception told me the acting DS (from Kandy) had just left. Upon my enquiry that whom should I meet next, he directed me showing another office room to meet the next in command.
At that place the officer (Head Quarter - AGA I guessed) welcomed us, offered seats and - after quickly finishing her work at hand - listened to us attentively. She took spot action taking photocopies of my documents and took my contacts to inform me the progress.
As not only satisfied clients may be possibly delighted or perhaps astonished ones we came back to the car park, where we were discussing this fantastic experience. I saw this lady officer going out. During the friendly chat we came to know she was a product of Peradeniya University. The University of Peradeniya is a leading university in Sri Lanka. The University of Peradeniya is where I started to believe myself. It is the place where I consider myself so proud and unique. The place actually became a turning point in Sri Lanka’s history of academic education. All these happened within half an hour! This is a pleasant experience in a government office!
I propose all other district secretariats to benchmark the Nuwara Eliya District Secretariat in providing a first class service to the public!
