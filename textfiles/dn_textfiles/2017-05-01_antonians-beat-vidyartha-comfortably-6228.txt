Antonians beat Vidyartha  comfortably 62/28

St. Anthony’s College began their Plate campaign with a comfortable 62-28 win over Vidyartha College in their opening encounter played at Nittawela yesterday.
Vidyartha failed to pose much of a threat to the Antonians defence but did manage to play well. The Antonians definitely played some good rugby where they rucked, drove and powered their way to score six goals and four tries which made their total of 62 against four goals by the Vidyarthians.
In the first half both teams surprised everybody with superb rugby and by the end of the first quarter it was Vidyartha who were in the lead. However by the end of the first half the Antonians had regained the lead and led 22-21 with little between the two team’s defenses.
After the turn off, the Antonians were fast on their feet and excelled in their passing. Most of their players were outstanding, dishing out an intelligent game. Vidyartha too played well, but had to be satisfied with only a goal in this half. Vidyartha were defending stoutly but if they had used the proper advice, they could have done much better.
On the run of play the Katugastota boys certainly deserved to win they did everything a little better than their opponents. The Vidyartha lads started to lose the match in the forward play, due to some superb rugby coming from the winners.
The set pieces and the line outs were shared and it was in the loose play, that the winners gained plenty of possession.
Referee: A. Jamaldeen.
