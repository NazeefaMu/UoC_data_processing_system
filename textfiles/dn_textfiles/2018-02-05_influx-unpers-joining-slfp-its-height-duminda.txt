Influx of UNPers joining SLFP at its height: Duminda

No UNPers need to be found fault with. The influx of United National Party (UNP) supporters crossing over to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to join hands with President Maithripala Sirisena, is at its height, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka. He was addressing a local government election rally held in the Rajangane area in Anuradhapura. He said surely, in 2020, the SLFP would form a single government of its own, with Maithripala Sirisena being the President for the second consecutive term.
Don’t be hoodwinked, cheated, distracted or stranded by going after other political parties. Voting for the Pohottuwa or the JVP would be politically suicidal. It would also result in the deprivation of the villages that are to be developed, the SLFP general secretary further said.
Today, the President, who is the head of the SLFP, is endeavouring to eradicate corruption, wastage of public funds, bribery and cheating which has been brought to light by the Presidential Commission inquired into the Central Bank bonds issue. He has proved that irrespective of political differences, relationships or friendships, he would not hesitate to enforce the law against such offenders, he added.
The minister said, “This has been a novel experience to the whole nation. The UNPers and JVPers, in thousands, are joining the SLFP to strengthen the President’s anti-corruption move related to the Central Bank fraud. On the contrary, certain SLFPers are backing up the Pohottuwa party under the illusion that Mahinda Rajapaksa would become the president or prime minister of the country if Pohottuwa gained power. Do not be misguided or fooled; MR is legally barred from contesting at Presidential elections—he could become neither. As such, be an SLFPer again and be wise enough to understand the political hypocrisy of G. L. Peiris’ Pohottuwa, which is conspiring to break the unity of the SLFP, as wished by Mahinda Rajapaksa who seeks revenge on President Mathirpala Sirisena.”
“Do not cast your vote to a party like the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP); their only plan is to weaken the longstanding SLFP and sabotage the Good Governance of President Mathripala Sirisena,” he said.
He said, “Would Pohottuwa be able to from a government? Think twice as to why the former President is avoiding the SLFP while being an SLFPer himself. Listen to your conscience and then use your franchise, as it is wasted on them.”
