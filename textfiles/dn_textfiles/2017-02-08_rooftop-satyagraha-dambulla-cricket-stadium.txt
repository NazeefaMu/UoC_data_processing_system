Rooftop satyagraha at Dambulla Cricket Stadium

Eleven contract basis employees attached to the Dambulla Cricket Stadium launched a satyagraha campaign on the rooftop of the viewing stand on February 7 demanding that they be absorbed into the permanent staff.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said he had already instructed to absorb them into permanent staff.
However, the employees insisted that no such instructions were given.
Media personnel were not allowed to enter the stadium by the authorities.
