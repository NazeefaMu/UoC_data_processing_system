Tattoo socks

Not sure if you're ready to commit your skin to ink? Tel Aviv-based Gabby and Idan have the next best thing. Their online shop Tattoo Socks is selling legwear that is disguised to look like tattoos, and the patterns can easily fool the passers-by if their eyes aren't sharp enough.
From an intricate black-and-white skeleton to a colorful charming fox, the duo have created an incredibly wide selection of designs. The prices of the handmade pieces vary between $18 and $33. And remember, if for whatever reason you're not feeling it, taking off a pair of tights is at least a tiny bit easier than removing or covering up a real tattoo. Bored Panda
