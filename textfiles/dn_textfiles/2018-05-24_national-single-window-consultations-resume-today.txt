This event is organised within the framework of the EU – Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance project funded by the European Union.
Forty high-level representatives will attend the event from business associations, government agencies, and trade operators. Dignitaries gracing the opening ceremony will include Dr. R.H.S Samaratunge, Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, Chandanie Wijayawardhana, Secretary Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade,.

As one of the fastest growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region, SriLanka has risen steadily to become a regional trade and logistics hub and is striving to make its economy more interconnected with regional and global markets. In this context, the Government of Sri Lanka has committed to create a National Single Window (NSW) as a national priority to reduce time and costs currently spent by traders in preparing and submitting information and documents to multiple border regulatory agencies. The National Single Window will allow parties involved in trade and transport to lodge information and documents with a single-entry point to fulfil all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements.
The objective of this second public-private consultation is to facilitate the exchange of views between trade stakeholders on the governance mechanism for the NSW. Participants will discuss how Sri Lanka can best protect the Government’s policy interests and the genuine need of the private sector for increased competitiveness through appropriate decision-making and consultations bodies.
The recommendations from this consultation will be shared with the National Trade Facilitation Committee as well as the World Bank Group who are currently involved in the development of a Single Window Blueprint that will formulate recommendations for the consideration of the Government of Sri Lanka as the country proceeds towards implementation.
