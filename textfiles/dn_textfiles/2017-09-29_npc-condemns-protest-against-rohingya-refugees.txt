NPC condemns protest against Rohingya refugees

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) yesterday adopted a resolution condemning the protest against the Rohingya Muslim refugees by a group of extremists in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday. The resolution was tabled by NPC member M. K. Sivajilingam.
Sivajilingam in his resolution stated that the NPC is capable in protecting these refugees in a safe place anywhere in the province if the Government hands over them to the Council.
Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran was not present.
