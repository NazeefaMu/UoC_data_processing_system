‘Country’s education will not be sabotaged by trade union activists’

Education Ministry Trade Union Assistant Secretary Jathika Adyapana Sewaka Sangamaya Convenor Priyantha Pathberiya yesterday assured that the government will never let the trade union activists those who depend on NGO funds to sabotage country’s education. Addressing the media yesterday at Hotel Sanora, Thalawathugoda, he said that the schools will not be closed today (26) due to the trade union action scheduled to be taken by some trade unions including Lanka Guru Sangamaya.
“Only the government has the authority to close schools.” he added.
He alleged that some trade union activists had entered schools forcefully and forced principals to postpone term tests and close schools. Speaking at the occasion, a principal who faced various difficulties due to political revenge during the previous regime said that he was transferred to 14 schools within 14 months.
He said that it is unfair to oppose the decision taken by the government to give promotions for those who lost their promotions due to political revenges.
