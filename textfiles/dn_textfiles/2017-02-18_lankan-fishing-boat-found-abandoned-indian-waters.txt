Lankan fishing boat found abandoned in Indian waters

The Indian Marine Police of the Coastal Security Group seized a Sri Lankan fibreglass boat found abandoned about six nautical miles south of Mukuntharayar, Chathiram coast near Dhanushkodi on Thursday.
On being alerted by local fishermen, a Marine Police team reached the spot in a boat in the afternoon and towed the fishing boat back to Mukuntharayar Chathiram. The boat measured 18 feet in length and six feet in width, he said. Kumar said the boat had the registration number OFRP-A-4044-NBO, indicating that it could belong to fishermen at Negombo. A fishing net and a plastic cane, containing about 10 litres of kerosene, were found in the engine-fitted boat, he said. As the boat had a hole in the rear side, apparently caused after it met with an accident, the fishermen might have drifted into Indian waters.
As seawater seeped into the boat and they could not take it back, they could have abandoned it and returned in some other boat, he said.
The police were also investigating whether the boat was used for any smuggling activity or drop Sri Lankan Tamils, he said. The Hindu
