A series of self employment projects, Montessori and English language centre were opened last three years by, 'Once in a Life Time' organization which comprise of frequent British travelers to Sri Lanka.
Some of these travelers were in Sri Lanka during the tsunami and after experiencing the devastation from it decided to raise funds to provide lively hoods to Sri Lankan affected by it.
The Sri Lanka coordination was done by Red Apple Tours and Travels.
M. Collin and Rosemary Bray two British tourists who were making their 25th tour to Sri Lanka and also founder members of the 'Once in a Life Time' organization' was in Sri Lanka last week to study the progress of the projects and CSR events they initiated.
The CSR activists of the 'Once in a Life Time' organization included offering financial assistance to rebuild houses, providing machines to supply drinking water, offering spectacles, crutches and also offering nutritional food to young mothers. These projects would be carried out in Polonnaruwa, Hali Ela and Hingurakgoda, Minneriya, Polonnaruwa, Pusellawa and in the Southern Province.
They are also hoping to bring down several instructors who would offer their services voluntarily to train youth in skill development that would lead to self employment.
