THE OTHER-SIDE OF MARGOT FONTEYN

She was perky and never more dramatic than any single moment when she danced Juliet, the intelligent portrayal with no sign that she was aware of the tragic ending; neither in her body nor in her bedchamber. She took gently the burden of an apprehensive mantle. To Margot Fonteyn the powerful confrontation with Tybalt's murder, the prospect of having Paris as her husband and Romeo's death, came lightly that she pushed back her creator, William Shakespeare to a dull corner.
She alone was responsible popularizing Juliet more than the Bard and making the ballet more powerful than the story behind it than Shakespeare intended in his drama and lighting up the world (with Romeo) as the world's young tragic lovers.
We all who have seen her in the ballet, run the full length of the stage when she speeds off to meet the Friar in desperation.
Virgin purity
So, that was the icon behind the world of ballet that her fans came to hold her in reverence as Juliet, the young godess of virgin purity, hardly-fourteen year old Princess from the House of Capulets. Fonteyn gave so much life in to this character that no one else was able to supersede her.
Or did she?
There was more in store for this perfect ballerina. This was in the wake when most dancers left Russia, departed for good under strained circumstances: never on amicable terms, so was Rudolf Nureyev, destined to be her eternal partner as they took world by storm, delighting new audiences.
Then, she was exposed.
Nowhere from the blues, a bombshell was dropped by the DANCE EUROPE magazine that shocked one and all and ripped apart her glory, Rudolf Nureyev may have died a hundred times.
Margot Fonteyn got trapped in a web of politics, intrigue and suspense like in a high-profile movie.
Legendary ballerina
She had worn a cloak of treachery around her flawless diminutive figure, fooling her audiences and choreographers.
While Britain's legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn is remembered rather more for her dancing and partnership with Nureyev than for her involvement in politics, government files recently made public at the National Archives suggest that the dancer was not as innocent as her elegant manner suggested.
The files claim that Fonteyn was involved in a planned coup by her husband, Dr Roberto Arias, to overthrow the Panamanian government in April 1959. The coup went wrong, Fonteyn was jailed overnight and Arias went missing.
Smitten and desperate, Fonteyn had bad experience in jail not knowing where Arias was.
When released, Fonteyn is chronicled as having spoken with the British Ambassador to Panama who wrote: "She knew that her husband was gun running. She knew that he was accompanied by rebels and at one point she used her yacht as a decoy for government boats and aircraft away from the direction which her husband was taking."
On returning to London, she was famously grilled by the press but graciously fended off all questions with, "If I try to explain it to you, I'll get involved in something so complicated that I will be misquoted again and so I'd rather not talk about it".
The prima ballerina assoluta subsequently visited the UK's Foreign Minister, John Profumo, and told him how she had met Fidel Castro in Cuba with her husband earlier in the year and that, even though the conversations were in Spanish, she understood that Castro had agreed to help Arias.
Profumo wrote that he was so astonished by her story that he had pinch himself to make sure that he wasn't dreaming, but having promised to keep the conversation with Fonteyn confidential, he did not pass on the information to American colleagues.
When Arias finally surfaced in Brazil in June, Fonteyn duly wrote to Profumo, "I do want to thank you very much indeed for your extreme kindness to me. My husband's definitely out at last and I am trying to fly to Rio this evening. I do hope that you and Valerie will have time to come and see us when we are both back, and definitely no plotting."
