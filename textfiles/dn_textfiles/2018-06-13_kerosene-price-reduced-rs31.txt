Kerosene price reduced by Rs.31

Cabinet yesterday decided to reduce the price of a litre of Kerosene by Rs.31 as of midnight yesterday. Accordingly, the present price of a litre of Kerosene will be Rs.70, Fisheries, Aquatic Resources and Rural Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said.
The fuel price revisions recently had doubled the price of a litre of kerosene from Rs.57 to Rs.101. This sparked protests from fishermen around the island who asked that prices not be changed.
