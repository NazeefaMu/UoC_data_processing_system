Newborn falsehood

Reply to Dr G C Illangakkoon:
I have read in the Ceylon Daily News of March 14 and 23 on the subject of FORCED BIRTH - CONTROL - NGO CULTURE, written by Dr. C G Illangakoon, (International Law). It is a very long article.
As the oldest living Past President and Past Patron of the Sri Lanka College of Obstrictritions and Gynecologists, I was very much perturbed by the accusations and allegations made by the author that forced abortions and forced sterilizations are being done in this country by some foreign NGOs.
Post Partum IUD programmes
This is a blatant lie, as the SLCOG and its members, around 300 serving in various parts of the country are the sole custodians of the health and welfare of the women and the unborn fetus in this country. So, the Yahapalana Government, Mahanayake Theras, and the chief incumbents of other religious denominations, do not have to resort to protests and agitations, as requested by the author, as there is no such thing happening in this country.
The College is celebrating its Golden Jubilee this year with an international congress with the participation of the World Federation FIGO, South Asian Federation, Asia & Oceania Federation, RCOG, WHO and other world organisations, in August 2017. The Maternal Mortality rates which were in the region of over 100 per hundred thousand deliveries 50 years ago have been reduced to 32 per hundred thousand by 2015. Thus we are the best in the whole of South Asia. We hope to achieve one-digit figures like that of the developed world in the foreseeable future. The College has received large amount of funds from the FIGO through the efforts of Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, who had his undergraduate education in Sri Lanka, who was the President of the RCOG and later was the President of FIGO few years back. These funds were received three years ago to carry out Post Partum IUD programmes in various parts of the country by our members and their staff. For this we have received the approval from the Ministry of Health.
The main purpose of this programme, which is been carried out in several other developing countries, is in order to space out the pregnancies, and to prevent unnecessary unsafe abortions that are been carried out in our developing countries in parts of Asia and Africa. Most of the developed countries have no problems with unsafe abortions, as abortions have been legalized in those countries. The Idea of this programme is to prevent unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.
Unsafe abortions
We have around 1,000 births a day and an equal number of unsafe abortions a day done by quacks in this country. It is well known that 60 percent of the pregnancies are unplanned and more than half of them are unwanted and people resort to abortion to get rid of them.
Many of these abortions end up in our specialized institutions with severe hemorrhage and sepsis resulting in deaths from septicemia, and many of those who survive suffer from other complications.
Today abortions are the third most common cause of maternal deaths in our country. The use of contraceptives can prevent unwanted pregnancies which would often lead to abortions by quacks ending up in unwanted deaths of young mothers with two or three children - which I consider a much greater evil and a terrible tragedy.
