Sampath Bank’s Green Inventor opens eco-friendly inventions from universities

Committing to a sustainable future, Sampath Bank launched the Green Inventor competition – a platform for inventors to showcase their talent and work towards environmental protection and conservation.
Celebrating 30 years as a premier financial institution, Sampath Bank PLC undertakes the duty of providing viable locally created solutions and inventions to the country by recognizing domestic talent in the field of sustainable eco-friendly development at its time of need.
Undergraduates from state and private universities are invited to compete in this initiative which will see the best local invention, project, technique or concept being crowned the Green Invention of the year.
With the aim of grooming green inventors and entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, this competition will provide undergraduates a platform to showcase their talent which will in turn lead to a cleaner and more sustainable environment in Sri Lanka.
The primary focus of this competition is based on the 3R concept (Reduce, Re-use and Recycle) in the innovations. Finalists are expected to follow a workshop organized by Sampath Bank and will be given a comprehensive training programme on developing products under the given parameters of the project before they compete in the finals.
Applicants will be judged by an eminent panel of judges who are experts in environmental science and innovations. Undergraduates can apply individually or as a group (Maximum of five members) through the dean or head of departments of their universities.
The competition will recognize the talents of Sri Lankan undergraduates by propelling their innovations which will significantly be a driving force towards a greener environment.
The winners of the competition will be awarded with cash prizes and valuable trophies. Selected participants will receive certificates for their commitment towards the competition and the respective universities of the winners will also be recognized.
Applications can be obtained at universities across the island and can also be downloaded from Sampath Bank’s corporate website. The competition is now open for students and completed applications must reach the bank through their dean’s or head of departments on or before 14th July 2017.
