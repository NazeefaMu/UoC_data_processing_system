The case of pending consensus

Hopes that the proposed new Constitution will be a unifying factor in Sri Lanka as it emerges after three decades of war and nearly a decade of relative peace receded this week, with the opposition indicating that they have no qualms about using the proposed reforms as a political weapon.
At the outset, it is worthwhile emphasising that, as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has painstakingly pointed out many times, there is no ‘new’ Constitution as such, right now. What has become the topic of much discussion and dispute is the Interim Report of the Parliamentary Steering Committee appointed for the purpose of studying a proposed new Constitution.
The report makes it clear that no final decision has been reached on several contentious issues such as the unitary status of the country, the status accorded to Buddhism, the unit of devolution of power, potential for merging two provinces and the role of the President. In fact, the report sets out the different options for each of these issues as a basis for further discussion.
Moreover, the report itself consists of only 26 pages but there are eight annexures from seven political parties and Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne totalling 66 pages. This confirms not only that there is still a significant diversity of opinion regarding the proposed Constitution but also that the interim report is far from being a fait accompli.
Even a cursory glance at the proposals of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) reveals that there are major differences of opinion between the SLFP and its partner in the government of National Unity, the United National Party (UNP) and that it will take many more rounds of negotiation to reach a compromise - a compromise that would be necessary because the two major parties need to agree on the proposed reforms if it is to have any chance of being approved in Parliament with a two-thirds majority.
For instance, with regard to the Executive Presidency, the interim reports notes that, “there was general consensus that the Executive Presidency as it exists today, be abolished” and that “the President should be elected by Parliament for a fixed term of office”.
Executive Presidency
The SLFP has opted to disagree. In its observations, the party states that: “the opinion of the SLFP is that complete abolition of the Executive Presidency that is present today is not prudent. Considering various terrorist and extremist activities that happen in various countries in the world, the SLFP believes a President should be elected directly from the public mandate with a certain amount of powers to protect the unitary status of the country and to keep and to protect the stability of the country specially in a situation where a large volume of power is granted to the Provincial Councils.
It justifies its stance saying that “thereby every ethnic group of the country without narrow ethnic, religious problems gets political power by selecting a president and gets the opportunity to become a member of the presidential election process, and hence, it becomes a practical method for national reconciliation”.
This is obviously at variance with the ‘general consensus’ noted in the interim report as well as the observations of Dr. Wickramaratne, the only UNP parliamentarian to submit his own observations. Dr. Wickramaratne has noted that he endorses the “the abolition of the Executive Presidential system of Government” and suggests that “the President should be elected by an Electoral College consisting of Members of Parliament and the (proposed) Second Chamber”.
It is relevant to note that the SLFP’s stance is also at variance with President Maithripala Sirisena himself who based his election campaign on the late Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera’s rallying cry for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. After his election and at Venerable Sobhitha Thera’s funeral, the President has re-iterated his pledge several times. To be fair by the President, he has never stated that he wishes to run again for President, although some of his party stalwarts urge him to do so and publicly proclaim him as the ‘next SLFP candidate’.
However, the Joint Opposition (JO) in particular has attempted to hijack the debate on the proposed reforms portraying them as a betrayal of the country, the majority community and Buddhism. They have now embarked on a propaganda campaign, the objective of which is to gain political mileage using the proposed constitutional reforms as a convenient scapegoat.
New Constitution
The issue escalated last week when, on Wednesday, the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya and Malwatte met and thereafter issued a statement to the effect that a “new Constitution was not necessary”. Some print and electronic media outlets gave this statement wide publicity, leading to a perception that the Buddhist clergy was categorically opposed to the process of constitutional reform.
On Thursday, it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who threw the gauntlet at the media, calling a media conference and challenging editors to prove their claims. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was to say that he had spoken to the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven Thibbotuwave Sri Sumangala Thera and found that the Thera was overseas. The Mahanayake Thera had assured the Prime Minister that he had expressed no sentiments to suggest that constitutional reform was not necessary.
In fact, when JO stalwart Dinesh Gunawardena had met him a few weeks ago, the Mahanayake Thera had reassured Gunawardena that he was satisfied with the assurances provided by both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
That has not deterred the JO. In fact, ‘Viyathmaga’, an organisation of professionals linked to the JO and to former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa conducted a meeting on Saturday where retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne insisted that the ‘traitors’ who attempt to divide the country by introducing a new constitution must be ‘killed’. Rajapaksa was chairing the meeting when these remarks were made. It is this kind of inflammatory rhetoric that is singularly unproductive in what should be an intelligent debate.
Despite evidence that there clearly is a politically motivated campaign to sway the opinion of the Buddhist clergy against the proposed constitutional reforms which are still in the discussion stage, it is clear the government has much work to do in terms of educating not only the Buddhist clergy but also the general public on the process of constitutional reform.
This was apparent when the Chief Incumbent of the Bellanvila Raja Maha Vihara, Venerable Dr. Bellanvila Wimalaratne Thera also declared that a “new Constitution was not the need of the hour”. Expressing concerns that the proposed reforms may lead to federalism, Venerable Dr Wimalaratne Thera stated that he would urge the President and the Prime Minister to stop the reform process.
National Unity government
The government thus finds itself in a challenging situation. There is no denying that President Maithripala Sirisena was elected on a platform of reforming the Executive Presidency and as such, he has a mandate for that, received from a majority of voters who were growing wary and weary of an executive presidential system rapidly converting itself into an oligarchy beholden to a single family. However, in trying to fulfil that pledge, he and his government are now facing obstacles.
If there was a mandate from the masses two years ago, that wouldn’t have suddenly disappeared into thin air and the government has a responsibility to honour that mandate.
Therefore, the need of the hour is not a clarion call to stop the constitutional reform process. Instead, it is to have intelligent discussion and debate and arrive at a rational and reasonable middle ground that would be acceptable to all communities and religious groups in the country.
This is the challenge that the government faces-and this issue, more than any other issue, underscores the importance of the National Unity government. With both major parties working together and with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, its highest priority objective should be to usher in a new Constitution in accordance with the promise it made to the Sri Lankan voter two years ago.
