Bill to facilitate organ transplantation

A Bill will be presented to Parliament to facilitate organ transplantation, Health Ministry Spokesman said.
Consultant surgeons had told Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne the importance of a Bill to make the transporting of donated organs to the hospital where the surgery is taking place, he said.
The Air Force now helps transport the donated organs to the respective hospitals where the recipient of an organ is treated and the transplantation is taken place. But the process need to be set up through a law, he said. Minister Senaratne will hold a special discussion with all surgeons to identify issues they face and to provide required facilities for them to carry out surgeries.
