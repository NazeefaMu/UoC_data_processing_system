242 Sri Lankan returnees apply for citizenship at ICMS

The Foreign Ministry said that during the Integrated Consular Mobile Service (ICMS) held in Mannar this week, over 240 applications for citizenship were received from individuals who had returned to the country after seeking refuge overseas during the war.
The 2nd Integrated Consular Mobile Service (ICMS), coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was held on August 12 and 13, 2018 at the Mannar Town Hall.
“The purpose of the ICMS was to address the consular related needs of those who had sought refuge overseas during the conflict and returned to Sri Lanka following the end of the conflict,” the ministry said.
During the two-day ICMS, 242 applications for citizenship were received, 59 consular birth certificates were issued and clarification was provided to those seeking advice and guidance on matters related to citizenship and birth certificates, the statement said.
Foreign Minister Tilak Marapona had also participated at the ICSM on August 12 and interacted with the people seeking assistance.
