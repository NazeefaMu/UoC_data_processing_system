BMS, Northumbria University UK   introduces Business Clinic

For the first time, BMS (Business Management School) with Northumbria University UK has introduced a Business Clinic for the final year students undergoing Business and Management studies.
President, BMS, Dr. W. A. Wijewardena said the ‘Business Clinic’ is launched to provide opportunities for their under graduates who have hands on experience resolving real business problems.
He said that students would be linked with the local SME sector and then the student would be with the company for over three years and offer their expertise.
He said that via their students’ knowledge the SME would be able to look at business in a new angle and also the students would gain valuable practical knowledge as to how a mini company is being operated. “The SME sector too would gain valuable insights from them,” he said.
He also said that today some of the students who went overseas to UK and India for Business and Management studies are remaining in Sri Lanka due to high quality of education BMS offers.
“In fact the brain drain has now reversed and we see Indian students joining BMS. In addition students from Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan too are now following our courses.”
He said that one of the biggest advantages of their Business and Management studies courses are that students gain employment in the last year of their course. “BMS is a provider of high quality education in association with the best of British universities. Business and Management degree is our flagship management programme.”
President Chamber of Commerce Rajendra Thiyagarajah said that today most of the youth are looking at joining banks, government institutions and the top corporate sector.
“However once employed they have limited opportunities to innovate. However in the SME sector it’s different and youth could get a better burst of energy,” he said.
Commenting on the BMS Business clinic he said that he said it was a very timely as the Sri Lankan economy is driven by the SME sector. “We (CCC) would try to nominate a few SME companies for this program.”
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, James Dauris said that there are over 70, 000 students outside UK who are studying their courses and in Sri Lanka too they are very popular.
BMS is entering its seventeen year of success in providing high quality education is association with the best of the British universities, while incorporating the flexibility of the module credit systems leading to a British degree. ss
