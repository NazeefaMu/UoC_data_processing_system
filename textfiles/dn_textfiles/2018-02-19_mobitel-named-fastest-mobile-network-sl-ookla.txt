Mobitel named fastest mobile network in SL by Ookla

Ookla® has declared Mobitel, its Speedtest award winner for having the fastest mobile network in Sri Lanka.
Speedtest Awards are licensed to internet service providers and mobile carriers around the world that are determined by Ookla to be the fastest in their market. Sri Lanka’s Award was determined using a proprietary methodology of Ookla’s analysis of Speedtest® results from Q3–Q4 2017.
In the 2017 Speedtest Awards, the awards for top providers in speed are determined using a Speed Score that incorporates a measure of each provider’s download and upload speed to rank network speed performance. Adding upload speeds is a new addition this year with awards from past years focusing on download speed only.
Nalin Perera, CEO of Mobitel said ‘Winning the Ookla awards affirms Mobitel’s commitment to deliver optimal benefits to our valued customers to enjoy being on the fastest and best network in Sri Lanka. This prestigious recognition from a well renowned international body is something that is rewarding to the organization for its commitment and dedication to ensure that customer expectations are met.”
