Cabinet nod for National Trade Policy

A National Trade Policy (NTP) which aims to be “more liberal, simple, transparent, and have a predictable trade regime promoting trade-led growth” was approved by Cabinet this week.
The main measures envisaged under the NTP are to create; “competitiveness through domestic policy reforms, market access and trade facilitation, macroeconomic balance, policy and institutional coherence and the adjustment of firms and people.”
The NTP also identified the major problems of the Sri Lankan trade regime to be the “promotion of production for domestic market through a high and complex import tariff regime, lack of attention to trade facilitation, low level of regional connectivity and ineffective trade agreements and the lack of supply side capacity for exports.”
The new policy thus would seek to: “Design and implement a comprehensive trade reform programme with timing and sequencing to re-focus the current distorted and opaque trade regime by rationalizing tariffs, para-tariffs and NTBs, minimizing the use of specific tariffs and consolidating tariff lines into three bands; conduct a comprehensive review of trade and investment related legal and regulatory structures and undertake necessary reforms in the areas including immigration in parallel to the envisaged expansion of trade agreement to safeguard domestic services and industries and protect consumer interests, negotiate deep and comprehensive trade agreements with all major trading partners, beginning with India, China and Singapore; establish a more liberal regime of trade in services, aiming to attract FDIs; develop a national single window for facilitation of trade, implement the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation, widen and deepen the tax net to reduce the budget deficit and compensate for the loss of revenue from trade taxes and from that of tariff and para-tariff reductions, if any; allow the increase of the exchange rate flexibility to reduce bias against exports and will develop Trade-cost Adjustment programmes to mitigate the adverse effects of trade liberalization on firms and people and to give time for adjustment.”
