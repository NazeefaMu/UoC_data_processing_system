GMOA cries foul over Ministry probes

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said the Ministry’s Investigation Unit is on a witch hunt against their members.
They have written to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to intervene to stop illegal and unacceptable acts of the Health Minister, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He said the person appointed by the Health Minister to head the Investigations Unit is under investigation for charges levelled against him by the Public Service Commission.
Dr.Aluthge said disciplinary inquiries are conducted against doctors on anonymous complaints made against them.
“This violates the system established in the public sector to carry out disciplinary inquiries against public sector employees. Sometimes investigators themselves make these complaints which is hilarious,”he said.
The GMOA will not support such ‘investigations’ and already informed to the Health Secretary.
A formal complaint to be made to the Public Service Commission shortly.
The fabricated complaints tactic is in practice in the entire Eastern Province, hospitals in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Galle, he said.
