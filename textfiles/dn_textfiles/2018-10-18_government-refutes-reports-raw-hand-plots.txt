Government refutes reports of RAW hand in plots

The government refuted claims that President Maithripala Sirisena had made reference to the involvement of Indian Intelligence Service (RAW) in the alleged plot to assassinate him and other members of the government.
The assurance comes in the wake of unsubstantiated claims which have surfaced in international media outlets, citing that the President had made reference to the Research and Analysis Wing or RAW as it is otherwise known has a hand in the alleged assassination attempt. It was also alluded in the media that the Indian National who remains under CID custody was part of the ploy.
The government has refuted claims adding that the President’s media wished to clarify that the President had not made references to the involvement of India’s intelligence wing.
The Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu had called on the President yesterday morning to discuss and clarify the matter. A statement by the President’s media said that ‘all matters were clarified during the meeting and bilateral relations were assured.”
“India and Sri Lanka have maintained cordial relations and cooperation since the inception of this government. Several highest level visits have taken place between the two nations that have resulted in strengthening cooperation in many fields.”
The statement by the President media adds that given these circumstances, “It is very unfortunate that some parties with vested interests resort to spreading such malevolent manipulations detrimental to the existing good relations between the two countries as well as the excellent personal rapport between the two leaders. ­­­­­­­“
In the said Cabinet Meeting on Tuesday, discussions had taken place on the alleged plot to assassinate the President. During the meeting, the President emphasised the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged assassination plot. Among other topics discussed at various times during the said Cabinet Meeting, was the development of the Eastern terminal of the Colombo port. The President highlighted the importance of Sri Lanka having a deep sea port terminal in the interest of national economy.
