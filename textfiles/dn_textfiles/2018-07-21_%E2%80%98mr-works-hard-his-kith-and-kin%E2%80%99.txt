‘MR works hard for his kith and kin’

“The public rejected the Rajapaksa regime accusing it of nepotism, corruptions and waste of public funds. This country is not for one family,” SLFP National Organiser and Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at the launch of the Seruwila SLFP District Board of Authority recently. Seruwila SLFP Chief Organiser Nalin Gunawardane organised the function. After three and half years, the former President is still working hard to give places for his kith and kin at the forthcoming presidential elections, he said.
The Minister said the SLFP and the country need a patriotic leadership to eradicate nepotism and political selfishness. "Only President Maithripala Sirisena can make the difference that the people need," he said.
The Minister said Maithripala is the only leader who could bring in a bright future based on co-existence, peace, integrity and understanding.
He said the President expressed his willingness to activate the capital punishment to curb the narcotics menace and appointed a commission to reveal the truth regarding the Central Bank bond issue. "These are rare qualities of a true leader," he said.
"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa embraced a parliamentarian at his residence in Gampaha after he was released after arresting for a alleged incident of drug dealing.
It was highlighted in the media, Former President recently challenged that he could get down Udayanga, who was issued red notice to be arrested.
This shows that former President was helping Udayanga evade the law. He is protecting thieves," Minister Duminda said.
The Minister requested the public to understand the difference between the two leaders.
"Maithripala Sirisena is a true leader unlike the other who is protecting the corrupted. Minister Duminda asked the people not to get misguided or deceived by power-greedy, bankrupted political leaders.
