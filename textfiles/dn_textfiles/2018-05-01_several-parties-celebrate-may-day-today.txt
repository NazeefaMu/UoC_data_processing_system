Several parties to celebrate May Day today

The JVP, TNA and several other parties will hold May Day celebrations today while the SLFP and the UNP will celebrate the May Day on May 7.
The government moved the May Day from May 1 to May 7 by a special gazette notification due to the requests made by the ‘Sangarathnaya’ who claimed that the May Day fell in par with the Vesak celebrations.
However, the JVP announced that they will celebrate the May Day on May 1 to commemorate the International Workers Day.
