Russian  Revolution  remembered

In October 1917 Russian comrades who called themselves the Bolsheviks rallied around their leader Vladimir Lenin to overthrow the existing Tsar regime and establish a government of their own as Soviet Union, the world’s first self-proclaimed socialist state.
These comrades comprised of peasants, blue collar workers and soldiers. Their needs were very basic, though their determination was wholehearted. They yearned for a Just society that offers them with peace, bread and land to plough.
This great happening in the 20th century ignited by the Russian masses went into the history as the Russian Revolution, October Revolution or the Red October.
The revolution induced strength and motivation to all freedom fighters in the world.
Eventually countries such as China, Korea, Vietnam and Cuba followed the examples set by Soviet Russia to enhance the living conditions of their own people.

“Dear comrades, during the past one hundred years, countries and people have changed immensely. People hate the war now. Yet, we should learn from the lessons from history to live in the modern world. President of my country Vladimir Putin has said, ‘We have had more than enough revolutions in the 20th century. What we need now is Evolution.’ So comrades, let’s now think about evolution wholeheartedly. Evolution sheds light on social development and sustainability by peaceful means. This is the most important historical lesson that we derive, one hundred years after the great October Revolution”, said Anastasia Khokhlova.

Standing on a steep riverbank, she sends her song to her lover…a soldier serving far away. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his girl will remain true to him.
