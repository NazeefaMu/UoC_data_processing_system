Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera gracing the occasion emphasized the importance of engaging in regular exercises to lead a healthy lifestyle.
“A person who does regular exercises knows the value of it. There are no shortcuts to gain a well-shaped body. Thirty four percent of Sri Lankans advocate inactivity. We must change this attitude and build passion amongst people to do regular exercises with commitment. ‘Sports for All’ program will be unveiled next year,” said the Minister.
