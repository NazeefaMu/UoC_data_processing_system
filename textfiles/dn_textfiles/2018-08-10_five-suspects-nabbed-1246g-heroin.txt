Five suspects nabbed with 124.6g heroin

Police arrested five suspects with 124.6 grams of heroin and 131 grams of Kerala cannabis during a raid that was conducted recently. It was carried out after acquiring information from a mobile phone owned by a suspect called S. F. Lokka alias Dahaiyagama Loku, who is currently in police custody.
S. F. Lokka had been kept in remand custody at the Wariyapola Prison over the murder of Karate master Wasantha Soyza. The North Central Province Police Flying Squad led by Chief Inspector Prabath Gallage, under the instructions of North Central Province Deputy Inspector General of Police Prathap Sandungahawatta, arrested the suspects, including Roomy; a chief disciple of Lokka.
Police also detected 131g of Kerala cannabis during the raid. "The market value of the seized heroin would be Rs.1.4 million," police said, "However, if they were to sell the entire stock of drugs, it would have gone for about Rs.5 million."
Roomy, who is a resident of the Galwala junction in Saliyapura, was arrested while he was speeding on a motorcycle that had been presented to him by S. F. Lokka, following a struggle with police at Sravasthipura.
Another suspect was arrested with 10 grams of heroin when he was fleeing by train on the North railway line, while another was arrested with six grams of heroin near the Pahe Ela area in Sravasthipura.
Two more suspects were arrested near a Pulleyar statue in close-proximity to the Sravasthipura iron bridge, with 2.6 grams of heroin. All suspects were within the age range of 20 to 30 years.
S. F. Lokka had been transferred from the Anuradhapura Prison to the Wariyapola Prison as he had been engaged in the heroin trade while being behind bars as well.
Police had discovered that he had been running a drug cartel while being in the Wariyapola Prison as well.
