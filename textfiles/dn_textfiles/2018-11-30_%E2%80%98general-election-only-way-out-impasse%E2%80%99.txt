‘General Election only way out of impasse’

All political parties should agree to hold a General Election and let the people’s sovereignty prevail, Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera said.
He said holding a General Election at the earliest is the best option to overcome the current political impasse.
Ven. Vijithasiri Thera was speaking at the first national convention of the People’s Movement for a General Election, held on Wednesday at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo.
The Anunayake Thera also said the current political imbroglio has taken the country on the wrong path and reiterated that a General Election was the only option out of the current crisis.
Expressing his views, General Secretary of Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said they had joined together to demand a general election to elect a stable government. “It is the most important thing at this moment, not who would be Prime Minister,” the Ven. Thera said.
“We should elect people who really love this country and whose policies are friendly to the country. For that, we need a general election,” he said.
Speaking at the convention, Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said they are demanding a General Election as Parliamentary power is not implemented properly at present. “Now the crisis of Parliament has gone to the Supreme Court. It is the responsibility of the Court to protect the law as well as the people of the country,” he said.
The Ven. Thera said a General Election is the only option for the confusion people are facing due to the existing clash between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
“For this election, we, as the Maha Sangha are in discussion to take over the responsibility of selecting proper politicians.”
“We will present a series of resolutions and support those who agree to follow it,” the Ven. Thera said.
“We are demanding a general election to elect a suitable government for this country, not to crown any particular person,” he said.
The President of the national movement Yuthukama, Gevindu Kumaratunga said the present Parliament no longer has a valid mandate due to several reasons.
They are the results of the last Local Government election, the economic crisis, the resignation of the UPFA from the Unity Government, and the lack of a simple majority for any party in Parliament.
“When no one has a majority, they have to listen to the voice of the minor parties. We cannot allow the separatists to control this country. Therefore, we request a general election to elect a new government,” Kumaratunga said.
President’s Counsel Manohara De Silva, Prof. Premalal De Silva, Jagath Wickremesinghe, Anupa Pasqual and several others addressed the occasion.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, politicians, artistes, and supporters of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna participated in the convention.
