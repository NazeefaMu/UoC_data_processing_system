Point of view
Turnover levels hit a 3-month high this week, as renewed Institutional and HNI interest buoyed market sentiment. Crossings over the week, accounted for 72% of the week’s LKR6.0Bn turnover, helping push the week’s average daily turnover levels to LKR 1.23Bn, the highest since Dec’16 when strategic buying pushed turnover to a 41/2 year high.
Crossings over the week were driven by mid-cap and Blue-chip stocks with Kotmale Holdings accounting for 32% of the market’s total turnover ( 44% of the week’s crossings) and JKH accounting for 16% of the total market ( 23% of the week’s total crossings). Significant interest in counters such as EXPO, VLL, LLUB, DIAL and banks such as HNB, COMB and SAMP also helped drive the rebound in turnover. Revived interest in equities was partially driven by strong market earnings over the Dec’16 quarter.
Total earnings of 94% of market which have reported results rose to LKR 74.3Bn, up 29.5% Y-o-Y relative to the LKR 57.3Bn reported by the total market in Dec’15. Quarter on quarter performance was also positive (total earnings in Sep’16 was LKR 60.4Bn), and the strong earnings performance helped push market PER levels lower to 11.94x (cf.12.04x last week).
Despite the robust corporate performance and the revived HNI and Institutional interest however, the benchmark ASPI dropped 37 points over the week to close just 1.5 points above the 6100 level; since falling to a low of 6068 points in early February, the benchmark ASPI consolidated around the 6100 level over the month of February.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum, although the US Fed’s policy rate decision today is likely to impact the direction of EM asset performance in the week ahead.
ASPI not immune to revived interest in EM assets
Although at an initial glance Sri Lankan equities appear to not have gained in tandem with the emerging market rally, and the ASPI’s YTD* loss of 1.1% looks grim in light of the MSCI EM (+8.6% YTD) and MSCI FM (+5.6% YTD) market gains, domestic equities have not in fact, been completely immune to the renewed interest in EM stocks. From a monthly perspective, Index losses have eased over Feb (+0.03% cf. -1.5% over Jan).
Net outflows from the CSE meanwhile have slowed, and at the end of Feb was LKR 0.07Bn cf. an outflow of LKR 1.60Bn during the same period last year. Although this is not to say that market sentiment over the past two months hasn’t been extremely dull, markets have stagnated at these 6100 levels, which when compared to the free-fall the ASPI experienced in the same period last year indicates improvement.
Part of this ‘stability’ has stemmed from the improvements on the macro-economic front. Although, policy uncertainty and fiscal concerns persist, the major pressure on the LKR, interest rates and on the fiscal front in Q1’16 have eased in Q1’17 and this is being reflected within the equity space.
Thus, while the ASPI hasn’t rallied as strongly as other EM’s in the aftermath of the US Presidential elections, some consolidation appears evident.
The ASPI does not necessarily move in tandem with the rest EMs for multiple reasons such as i) the South Asian region’s lower trade and portfolio investment exposure (cf. East Asian markets) to global markets and China, ii) Sri Lanka’s low market liquidity, iii) the lack of equity market representation by some of the country’s major growth sectors and, iv) higher-than-peer FX volatility all of which makes it less prone to contagion (both on the upside and downside).
