Sixty-six addicts complete rehab programme

The reintegration of rehabilitated drug-addict beneficiaries was held on June 22 at the Tertiary and Vocational Literature Training Centre, Senapura, Welikanda.
During the ceremony, 66 beneficiaries were reintegrated into society having undergone a comprehensive rehabilitation programme.
The Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake graced the occasion as the chief guest, while other officials, next of kin of the beneficiaries, and staff members also participated.
Addressing the ceremony, the Commissioner General explained to the beneficiaries how valuable their life is and that they are significant to this country’s development. He noted that the government is spending a significant sum of money to rehabilitate them and transform them into productive members of society.
A mother of a rehabilitated drug addict, speaking on the transformation of her son, said that she had seen a significant change in his mental and physical health after rehabilitation, which was endorsed by the rest of the parents gathered at this ceremony.
This facility was initially set up for the rehabilitation of former LTTE cadres, but with their gradual reintegration being completed, the programme to rehabilitate drug addicts was initiated under the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation.
