eMarketingEye achieves six wins at Interactive Media awards

After a record-breaking performance at international competitions in 2016, eMarketingEye (www.emarketingeye.com), the award-winning Sri Lankan Digital Marketing Agency and a pioneer in the industry, welcomed the new year with six “Best in Class” wins at the Interactive Media Awards (IMA) competition held recently.
The haul at the IMA included wins for Aitken Spence Holidays, Jetwing Holidays and Mosvold Sri Lanka ("Travel/Tourism" category), Ayura Studio ("Fashion/Style" category) and Dilmah Food Services ("Food/Beverage" and "Retail" category).
The Interactive Media Awards (IMA) is a competition that aims to increase the standards of excellence on the Internet. It is open to individuals and organizations involved in designing, developing, managing, supporting and promoting websites with nominations being accepted from around the world from web design firms, advertising agencies and corporate marketing departments, as well as individual web designers and graphic artists.
The competition’s judges evaluate websites based on five key criteria - Design, Content, Feature Functionality, Usability and Standards Compliance. In order for a website to win a coveted IMA Award, it must excel in each criterion by standing out from the competition and deserve to be a top choice for the target market.
Established in 2007, eMarketingEye has grown to be one of the best in the Asian region over the past ten years, having gained international recognition for its expertise in providing end-to-end online marketing solutions to the travel and hospitality industry.
Commenting on the latest wins of the company, Rajitha Dahanayake, CEO of eMarketingEye, “2016 was a ground-breaking year for eMarketingEye in terms of the number of award wins. It is clear that we have carried forward that winning trend into 2017 as well. While we have always been consistently winning awards for our solutions in the Travel and Hospitality industry, it is encouraging to note that we were able to bag awards in categories such as Fashion, Food & Beverage and Retail. While it highlights the fact that we have got our approach spot on, we can look forward to more wins in diverse industries throughout the year.”
