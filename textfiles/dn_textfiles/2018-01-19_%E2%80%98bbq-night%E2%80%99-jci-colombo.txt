‘BBQ Night’ by JCI Colombo

JCI Colombo organised a ‘BBQ Night’ for the second consecutive year at the Colombo Jaycees Secretariat recently. National President of JCI Sri Lanka for 2017, Jc. Dr. Shafraz Saleem was the Chief Guest while the Chairman of JCI Senate Sri Lanka for 2017 JCI Sen. Malik Cader and his wife, Immediate Past National President Jc. Isuru Samarage of JCI Sri Lanka for 2016 and President of JCI Colombo Jc. Dr. Dilhan S. Jayatilleke were among those present. The purpose of organising the project was to strengthen the ties between JCI Chapters and the National Committee.
The proceedings commenced by paying a floral tribute to the Founder of Jaycees in Sri Lanka, the Late JCI Sen. Sam Wimalasekara. A two minute silence was observed in memory of all the members of Jaycees who represented the Colombo Chapter and all other Chapters in Sri Lanka, that are not among the living anymore.
Chairman of JCI Senate Sri Lanka JCI Sen. Malik Cader addressed the gathering on ‘Down Memory Lane’ about his experiences with the Jaycee Colombo Secretariat. Following afterwards, began the more fun side to the event, with a live movie screening and a delicious BBQ setting. Action games were also conducted and the winners went away with valuable prizes.
The games included segments such as ‘Tallest Gent’, ‘Tallest Lady’, ‘BBQ King’, ‘BBQ Queen’, ‘Hat Passing’, and ‘Hairiest Man’.
