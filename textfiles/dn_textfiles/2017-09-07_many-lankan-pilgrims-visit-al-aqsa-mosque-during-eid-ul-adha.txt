Many Lankan pilgrims visit Al-Aqsa Mosque during Eid ul-Adha

Around two pilgrim groups of 150 - 200 Sri Lankan Muslims arrive monthly to Al-Aqsa Mosque in Palestine which is one of Islam's holiest sites.
This was the first time that more than 40 Sri Lankan Muslim pilgrims arrived at Al-Aqsa Mosque during Eid ul-Adha. Around 500 – 600 Sri Lankan Christian pilgrims also visit the Nativity Church in Bethlehem, monthly.
Al-Aqsa Mosque Grand Mufti Shiekh Mohammad Hussein made special prayers for Muslims of Burma and called Duaa’s to bless all communities in the world with peace, unity, prosperity and harmony, the Sri Lankan embassy in Palestine said.
