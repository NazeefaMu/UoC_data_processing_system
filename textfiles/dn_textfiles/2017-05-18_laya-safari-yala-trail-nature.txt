Laya Safari Yala, a trail into nature

For unbeatable access to the world-renown Yala National Park, there is no better place to stay than Laya Safari, a true trail into the nature and sea, surf and sacred sites that borders Sri Lanka's virtually untouched jungle heritage.
During the months of May and June, you could enjoy a third night free of charge when you book a two-night stay.
A one-of-a-kind destination extending all the way from the Wilds to the Indian Ocean, Laya Safari is also widely recognised as one of the best and most unique places to stay for those who want a true Yala safari adventure. In fact, the hotel often welcomes curious wild game wandering on to premises to get additional food to eat, free of charge of course!
Choosing to visit Laya Safari Yala in September and October can also avail themselves of the opportunity to enjoy 25% off on bookings for two or more nights.
Laya Safari Yala also boasts 20 remarkable deluxe rooms to truly make your stay a pleasure, all benefiting from refined hospitality, and ringed by shifting sand dunes, secluded golden beaches as well as the peace and tranquility of a sylvan habitat, where you are lulled to sleep by the soothing sounds of the lapping Indian Ocean.
While these guest accommodations are supremely luxurious in their own right, adding a whole new extension to the jungle experience, are two fully decked out Thicket Villa retreats, for a natural experience without equal in Yala.
