MMDA needs reform: All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama

 
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, in a statement released today, said the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) needs reform.
‘The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) is a topic which has been spoken widely in many circles and forums these days,’ it said in the statement.
‘In this regard, the ACJU believes, without doubt, the MMDA as it stands today definitely needs reforms.’ 
Quoting the Quran it said, ‘ “Oh you who believe do not hold as unlawful the good things Allah has made lawful for you" (Chapter 5, Verse 87).’
‘It is clear from the above verse that the ACJU neither has the power to make what is unlawful lawful nor the power to make what is lawful unlawful.”
‘ ‘Unfortunately, the statement made by the President of the AC]U that the "Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) is ‘perfect in its present state’ has been subjected to misinterpretation.
‘In fact, what he wanted to express was that our predecessors who were involved in formulating the MMDA had taken great efforts to make it near perfect.
Of course, given the circumstances of that period.
This does not imply that need not be any reforms today to the Act, mainly in the administration of Quazi court system.
‘There has also been an unfair allegation against AC]U that it is not ready to listen to the grievances of the women,’ it said.
‘There is no truth at all in this allegation.
ACJU wishes to highlight that it will be a gross violation of Islamic religious teachings to ignore the women or not to give them the honour and respect that Islam has bestowed on them.
ACJU is therefore, bound by these religious teachings.’
‘These misconceptions and the communication gap that is dominating events today need to be removed. We strongly believe that it is through dialogue that we can sort out all our problems.
The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, is a topic which has been spoken widely in many circles and forums these clays.
In this regard, ACIU believes without doubt, the MMDA as it stands today definitely needs reforms. ‘…As Religious Scholars are willing to be flexible and accommodative to the fullest extent.’
