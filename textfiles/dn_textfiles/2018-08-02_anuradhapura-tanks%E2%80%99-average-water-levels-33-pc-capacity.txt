Anuradhapura tanks’ average water levels at 33-pc capacity

The average water levels of the 73 major tanks coming under the Irrigation Department, is currently at 33-percent capacity.
The Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Unit Director of Engineering Wasantha Palugaswewa told the Daily News that in the Anuradhapura district, the average water levels of 13 major tanks was at 30-percent capacity, which had caused a sharp drop in the current Yala cultivation.

However, as a whole, under the 73 major tanks and 303 medium-scale tanks in the country, a record Yala paddy harvest of 950,000 metric tonnes had been expected. Sixty percent of the total irrigable landscape in the Anuradhapura district, 750,000 acres, had been cultivated so far during the 2018 Yala season.
In Polonnaruwa, under the Giritale, Minneriya, Kaudulla tanks as well as the Parakrama Samurdraya, 50,000 acres had been cultivated.
An area of the same magnitude had been cultivated in the Batticaloa district as well, under the Punnichchai, Nawakkiri, Rugam and Vakarai tanks, while 25,000 acres of land had been cultivated in the Trincomalee district. Sixty-thousand acres and 10,000 acres of land were cultivated in the Ampara and Badulla districts, respectively, Palugaswewa said.
