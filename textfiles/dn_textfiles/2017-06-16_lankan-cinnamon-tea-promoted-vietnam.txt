Lankan cinnamon, tea promoted in Vietnam

The Sri Lankan Embassy in Ha Noi organized a Ceylon Cinnamon and Ceylon Tea promotional event with the support of Dilma Tea at the official residence of the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Vietnam Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake, recently.
The Ambassador made a brief introduction on the history of Sri Lanka’s tea industry, noting that 2017 marks 150 years of commercial tea industry in Sri Lanka, followed by screening of a video on Dilmah Tea.
Representative of Dilmah Tea in Vietnam Hoang Phong Mai introduced Dilmah Tea, as well as CSR projects of Dilamah Tea in Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The Dilmah team also arranged a tea corner to taste different kinds of Dilamh tea for guests.
A comprehensive presentation on Ceylon Cinnamon was made by the Ambassador. She explained the difference between Ceylon Cinnamon and Cassia Cinnamon in detail, highlighting the advantages of Ceylon Cinnamon as it has a low Coumarin level of 0.017g/kg compared with 0.31g/kg to 6.97g/kg for Cassia type Cinnamon. She explained that research has revealed that regular consumption of Coumarin could lead to liver damage and as such, Ceylon Cinnamon can be consumed on a daily basis without undue concerns.
Two samples of Ceylon and Cassia Cinnamon were passed among the guests to identify the difference of the two types of cinnamon. The Ambassador explained the health benefits of Ceylon Cinnamon, its contribution to the Sri Lankan economy, as well as “Pure Ceylon Cinnamon” Brand.
Guests appreciated the presentations and especially on Cinnamon, as it highlighted differences between Ceylon and Cassia Cinnamon. Numerous queries were raised on how to obtain Ceylon Cinnamon and what the reliable brands are.
Samples of Ceylon Cinnamon and Dilamh tea packs were provided to all guests.
Over 28 members of the Diplomatic Partners Association were treated to a Sri Lankan buffet as well.
