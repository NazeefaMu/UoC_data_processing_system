Dinesh and Sachira clinch top titles

Dinesh Jayawardena driving a Mitsubishi Evolution clocked 32.65 seconds to register the fastest time on four wheels as well as the fastest time of the meet while Sachira Rajakaruna riding a Honda CRF 450 clocked 34.58 seconds to be the fastest on two wheels at the 21st Southern Eliyakanda Hill climb held in Matara last Sunday.
There were over 200 entries, the highest number of entries received for the Eliyakanda Hill climb this year but the Marshals and other race officials under the guidance of incumbent president of SMSC Ashshar Hameem with twenty years of experience behind them conducted this year’s race to perfection and on time. The race was not held up even due to the few spills as the recovery crews were extremely swift and efficient.
The Eliyakanda Hill climb is conducted by the Southern Motor Sports Club which is celebrating its 20th Anniversary this year and sponsored
by Sri Lanka Telecom, CEAT Tyres, Mobil, Thamalu Enterprise, Douglas Sons, Viraj Learners and Wurth.
