NEW YORK TIMES REPORT ON ALLEGED US$ 7.6 MN FUNDING
UNP moves adjournment motion against MR

The United National Party has decided to move an adjournment motion over the New York Times report on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for allegedly accepting USD 7.6 mn from China Harbour Merchant Company for his election campaign.
UNP MP Dr. Ashu Marasinghe said they will move the adjournment motion on Thursday (19).
Marasinghe also said that there was a discussion with regards to moving an adjournment motion over cases filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as well.
“However, we are allowed only one Adjournment Motion per week, so we decided to go with the New York Times report,”he said.
