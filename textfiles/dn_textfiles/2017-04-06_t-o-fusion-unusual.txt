T a o: A fusion of the unusual

Tao, Cinnamon Grand’s fabulous fusion cuisine restaurant is about harmony with the natural order. As the principal of yin and yang goes, the restaurant in every essence is about taking the seemingly opposite forces and interconnecting it to make them complimentary. Set on a walk path next to the azure pool and a pond where koi fish swim leisurely, Tao serves Asian fusion dishes designed by the Hotel’s expert chefs combining the varied diverse culinary traditions of the continent.
Tao’s menu presents exotic dishes with a western and pan Asian twist, offering fare such as cashew crusted prawns on Thai omelette with sweet and sour sauce, Hokkaido scallop capriccio in green curry emulsion, sizzling duck and pan-fried duck sausage with onion mash potato and red emulsion or the lemongrass and pinot noir infused lamb cutlet and coconut marinated grilled salmon pavé with Moroccan couscous and red curry cream.
With curators to explain the dishes and recommend the ideal beverage options, this restaurant balances itself between fine dining and ethnic eateries.
In total, the menu lists over 60 dishes to try out, which includes starters, soups, mains, sides, and even a special vegetarian menu with separate starters and mains, and dessert.
On Thursdays, the restaurant celebrates epicurean cuisine with a special 24 dish menu that gives diners the option of seven starters, three soups, seven mains and seven desserts per person.
