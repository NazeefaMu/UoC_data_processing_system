2019 WC rocket explodes in launch pad at Abu Dhabi

So, the unthinkable has happened. The ardent cricket fans must have pinched themselves to make sure they were not dreaming when they woke to the bad news yesterday morning of our cricket team suffering a humiliating defeat to Afghanistan, and exiting the Asia Cup in the first round. It surely isn’t a dream. We were right royally thumped out of the Asia Cup by a margin of 91 runs with 10 overs to spare, and the rocket that was bound for World Cup 2019 has exploded in the launching pad. Such is the sense of despondency sweeping across our die-hard cricket fans, and the cricket loving population at large.
It does not make much sense to perform a post mortem as the weaknesses were plain to see and were highlighted in these columns long before the campaign started. What is more infuriating to the ardent cricket fans of this country Is the total apathy shown by the leadership and the officials in charge of sports on the devastation taking place under their very noses. As already pointed out, the reason for such poor performances is certainly not dearth of talent as some incompetent people in the system attempt to show. An objective examination to try and pin point where the fault lines lie reveals:
Fault No.1: Is the inability to identify talent and slot players in the right format. The three Selection Committees appointed by the Jayasekera/Sumathipala coterie headed by Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya and Graeme Labrooy has not identified a single player who was worthy of a national cap. In fact, Labrooy went on record that Lasith Malinga was not in his World Cup plans. Look what has been exposed now. There has been a string of players who have been gifted national caps for one reason or the other who have exited the team faster than they entered. In the current context, the situation is much worse with the coach being entrusted selection responsibilities. Where does he find time to watch domestic cricket and identify new talent with his coaching work load? Things get murkier when the support staff tries to justify selections to the press without focussing on their areas of responsibility. The Asia Cup squad was picked on the performances of a hurriedly organized T20 contest. The lack of technique in batsmen picked on this basis was clearly exposed during these two games. What is more alarming to note is the management team of expatriate locals were visiting their adopted countries whilst these matches were going on. Such is the ignorance and lack of care prevalent in the management team at present.
Fault No. 2: It is abundantly clear that there has been too much tampering with the techniques of the batsmen from the lack of form and absence of runs from the top order. The freedom with which these players made runs appears to have deserted them. How come?
Fault No. 3: There appears to be too much outside meddling going on in all fronts. The cameras captured several instances where commentators were seen dishing out pre-match advice and pre-tournament pep talks, and comments on who should be captaining our World Cup 2019 team. For whose benefit is all this advice been dished out? One can understand if such support was translating into motivating our team to perform to their potential which unfortunately is not the case. It would have been far better to seek inspiration from a player in the calibre of Arjuna Ranatunga who actually shepherded his team across the line and to World Cup glory in 1996.
One can go on pin pointing the weaknesses, but, that would achieve no purpose. What is abundantly clear is that this ship is way off course with an ill equipped crew to boot. The honourable thing to do would be for the entire selection and management teams to tender their resignations, so that with barely eight months to go the Minister of Sports can hurriedly assemble a fresh set of true professionals and draw up new plans and charter a new course headed for World Cup 2019.
But, this is Sri Lanka and no such thing can be expected where honour goes out of the window when livelihood and subsistence is on the line. Of course the Minister of Sports can demand for their resignation. That too is highly unlikely to happen considering what is happening in the cricketing ambit where the Minister of Sports has even chosen to ignore instructions dictated by the ICC to appoint an independent committee of management.
If none of the above is going to be happening, and the caravan is allowed to happily roll on, the least the Minister can do is invite the selectors and the management of the national netball team to take charge of selections and management of our team, and summarily dispatch the current cricket management to the IT Division of SLC so that everyone lives happily ever after - as people like to do in this resplendent island of ours - where Accountability is non-existent.
