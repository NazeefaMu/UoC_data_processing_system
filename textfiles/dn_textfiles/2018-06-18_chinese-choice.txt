Chinese choice

Science and technology will bring ancient history alive in a wondrous way with a unique exhibition that will reawaken old traditions in the 21st century. It is jointly organised by the China Cultural Centre in Sri Lanka and the Network of International Culturalink Entities (NICE). The exhibits displayed at the Chinese Cultural Centre are unique Chinese cultural relics, incorporating unique design elements of China. The items displayed were beautiful and magnificent.
Inside the Chinese Cultural Centre, a screen offers guests a chance to interact with these relics by putting on equipment. For them, it is like watching 3D. It is absolutely a thrill providing the users with an opportunity to experience China’s culture in a modern and exciting way.
The exhibition attempts to blend the cultural heritage with technological advancements in a developing China, preserving the most cherished cultural identity of China. The exhibition branded as ‘NICE Choice’, is an initiative where they attempt to join culture and development as China moves into the next millennia.
The exhibits are categorised under six unique themes: Beautiful Life, Rhythm of Porcelain, Dream about Dunhuang, Festival Gifts, the Legend of Chinese Kong Fu and Digital China. The People’s Republic of China believes that this exhibition will add value to the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative which will connect the silk route countries together with a developing China. NICE is a cultural organisation sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People’s Republic of China.
All six themes touch China’s history, trade, health, martial arts, festivals and science and technology.
China Cultural Centre Director Liwen Yue stated that promoting mutual understanding and friendship between Sri Lanka and China is of much importance to the Chinese Cultural Centre here in Sri Lanka.
“The program that we are presenting here is also for this purpose. Today you can see cultural products here with a difference. So we would like to present these new forms to the Sri Lankan people. Here we want to familiarise Sri Lankans with Chinese industries and trade. We feel that this exhibition is very creative and hope that Sri Lankans will appreciate it and enjoy it. We want to increase the interest Sri Lankans have in China. In the following days, we hope Sri Lankan people will visit this exhibition and enjoy. We would like to see it grow in popularity. By the six themes, you can get an idea of the Chinese Industries. That is what we want to share with you. The theme we are touching on this year is Creative Cultural Products,” said Yue.
Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said that this is an excellent opportunity for Sri Lanka to be updated on the developments in China.
“I would like to congratulate both the Chinese Cultural Centre and NICE on this exhibition under the theme of ‘Creative Cultural Products’. I am very confident that initiatives like this will only afford Sri Lankans the opportunity to learn about China and its developments concerning Chinese Culture. This will pave the way for both countries to learn about each other and learn from each other. Cultural Creative Industries is also a driving and determining force when it comes to economic relations between our two countries and in the world. China is a country that attaches great importance to the development of the cultural industry with any country it engages with. Both Sri Lanka and China have a rich cultural heritage. This foundation links our people together and has been the case for centuries. Our cultural exchanges and corporation are very important promoting in our bilateral relations. In trade too, Sri Lanka and China have an understanding. The Chinese Embassy is working towards this very goal in Sri Lanka,” said the Ambassador.
‘Chinese Creative Cultural Products Week’ is the 2018 theme of Chinese Cultural Centre’s international unified program ‘China Week’.
