KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Fazil Marija’s swan song at Nittawela

The league match of the season against Havelocks SC will be special for Fazil Marija as he will make his last appearance for Kandy SC at Nittawela before hanging up his boots. The Clifford Cup knockout matches will not be played at Nittawela. This veteran is one of the best players in his position as fly half and his decision-making and general play helped Kandy SC to be victorious. His performances has been one of the standout features for his school Kingwood College, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka. Fazil retired from national rugby last year having played for the country for 14 years. His last game for Sri Lanka was in the final to Malaysia at this year’s Asia Division I championship in Malaysia. As a schoolboy he was spotted by Kandy SC’s godfather Malik Samarawickrema in the match between Kingswood and Royal, and was invited to play in the Clifford Cup knockouts and today he is a legend inrugby.
Municipal Community sports centres blown off side
Sports at Municipal Council Community Centres has been blown off side by themselves. In the good old days they gave a big hand to promote sports like TT, Carrom, Chess, Iron Sports through the Playgrounds Department Community centers, at grass root level, among the poor youth. They had 42 community centres but sad to say now nearly 13 centres have been closed and they are planning to give these to outsiders, which is going to affect the young sports lovers in a bad way. Some of the closed centresare at Deyanawella, Katugastota Road, Getembe, Wattegoda, Yatiyawella, Bogambara, Aniwattha West, Devi Road, Nawa Katukelle, Jalasayapara, Simonwatha, Asgiriya, Pooranawatha and Galklandewatha. All these centres closed down in the last five years. These centres were provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in the urban area and the New Territories with table tennis tables, fitness rooms, Iron sports rooms, Carrom boards, Chess boards, TV facilities etc.
Rajans have lost 5 games
Dharmaraja is one of the oldest cricket playing schools in the country and this season they are not in good form. They have lost five games and are not doing so well. They lost to Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa by an innings, Gurukula, St Anthony’s, Royal and Nalanda (for the Bandula Warnapura Trophy). The traditional; game played for the P.W.Perera Trophy was called off on the second day as only 10 overs play was possible due to rain and Ananda retained the trophy.
Club football forgotten in Kandy
The year 2017 was one of the worst years for football at club level in Kandy. No tournaments or AGM was held. Kandy was once a powerhouse of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. The FFSL is not showing any interest in Kandy football. It is time they woke up from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy in the right direction which has today received step motherly treatment.
Dialog’s Suren wins at golf
Suren Prematilake, a product of Trinity College attached to Dialog, who is a keen follower of golf did well to win the “C” division plum in the annual Nuwara Eliya Golf Club championship. Suren is a pretty good golfer, if he takes the game seriously he is sure to win more and more tournaments. He has played on golf courses all over the country.
Antonians on a winning note
A change of format brought through their new coach Sampath Perera has a brought a change for the Katugastota Antonians. They have won eight matches this season after losing the first game.
At one time they were a major force in school cricket producing not only several champion teams but have also some of the finest cricketers who have done the country proud by their achievements. Thanks to Sampath Perera’s coaching cricket is back on a good footing. Last season they had a good chance of getting promoted but the losses to St. Benedict's and Vidyartha deprived them of it. They are now in a position to get that overdue promotion to Division I category,
CP Referees AGM on Sunday
The AFGM of the Central Province Rugby Referees Society will be held tomorrow (Sunday) at the Kandy SC club house at 10 a.m. The talk among the referees is who will become the president.
Last year’s elected president has been out of the country for eight months, and the society’s affairs are in a mess. Last year the AGM was held at the same venue in April.
Hillwood Sports meet
Young Hillwoodians enjoyed participating in their annual sports meet and proved their physical fitness.
The day was brightened by the presence of Maj. Gen Nissanka Ranawana who graced the occasion as the Chief Guest. First place went to Bellerby House, 2nd place to Nash House and 3rd to Ireland Jones. A big hand should go to OGA president Sirini Dunuwille and her committee and to the principal Nelum de Alwis and her able staff for a good job well done.
Rajan Dissanayake swims well
S.N. Dissanayake from Dharmaraja College won the under 19 championship at the Vidudaya Ritzbury Interschool Swimming Championships concluded recently at the University of Sri Jayawardenepura.
Billiards and Snooker on the decline
Billiards and Snooker at one time was at its best. Today the game is in the doldrums with no club promoting the game.
Tables are there but no proper guidance is given. The Billiards and Snooker Controlling body of the country should look into it. No tournaments are conducted and some clubs play the game for fun and most of the clubs use the billiard room as their store room.
It is high time the controlling body appoints the right person to handle the sport in Kandy. Clubs get active only in the month of December to get their liquor license renewed.
