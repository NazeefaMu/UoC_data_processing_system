Anora eager to reveal her secret

Anora the second feature film made by senior artiste Hector Kumarasiri after his maiden film Abhinikmana is to be screened shortly.
Anora revolves around somewhat unusual theme that has not been adapted earlier by the local cinema.
Akash a master in Kathak is in love with Anora, his brightest pupil. While planning for wedlock Akash also strives to participate with his dance troupe at a dance festival.
Suddenly to Akash’s astonishment, his intended bride and main dancer of his troupe Anora starts avoiding practices. Being tied up with dance practices and wedding arrangements Akash makes a desperate attempt to communicate with his love.
Anora’s reluctance to meet with him and talk to him keeps Akash in a state of utter confusion. This distraction and Anora’s unavailability in dance practices lead Akash to create misunderstandings with sponsors and organizers of the dance fest. Sweeny another potential female dancer in the troupe becomes the successor to Anora. Yet her performances do not impress Akash. In the meantime Anora reveals a secret to Sweeny. Anora tells, she is undergoing a sex change and is feeling dejected. She also tells her friend, she is shy to face the world.
Without knowing Anora’s dilemma, her leftist grandfather (W Jayasiri) keeps telling her about the change took place in Russia with the leadership of V Lenin for the betterment of the federation. Anora eventually undergoes a sex-change surgery done by a compassionate doctor (Mahendra Perera) and becomes the male, Chathura.
