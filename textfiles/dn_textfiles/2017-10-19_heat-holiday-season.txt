Heat up the holiday season

If you saw ‘Frozen’ then you know that Olaf, the snowman with the heart of gold (voiced by Josh Gad), sure knows how to steal the show. That’s why Disney is releasing a featurette in November called ‘Olaf’s Frozen Adventure’, which is starring Olaf (don’t worry—Anna and Elsa will be there too).
The 21-minute animated film will open in theaters before Disney/Pixar’s full-length animated feature ‘Coco’ begins on November 22.
But before the short film skates into theaters, fans will be able to get their hands on a slew of Olaf’s Frozen Adventure products for purchase.
From Olaf mac ‘n’ cheese to a real-life sled built for two and Elsa costumes, there’s gobs of stuff to put a smile on a wee one’s face.
