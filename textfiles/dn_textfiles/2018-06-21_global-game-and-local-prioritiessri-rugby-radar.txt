The global game and local priorities...:Sri rugby on radar

The month of June 2018 will long be remembered with a simplified need to be fit, agile, strong, quick, skilled and powerful enough to handle the pressure in the middle for the 80minutes regulation.
This is the basic need for all players with a hint of ambition for the team and their colours of origin.
Naturally it revolves around your preparation...be it school, club, country or full international.
June, glorious June, was all that and more ...the profusion of rugby around the planet, impossible to ignore and impressive to the last drop.
The summer internationals with northern and southern hemisphere reputations at stake. World series 7s scintillating and mind altering. World Cup focus with the next generation of gladiators in France for the IRB U 20 World Cup.
Super rugby capturing the impressive skills that define southern hemisphere flair.
Northern hemisphere form shining brighter than ever and hardly a gap the faithful claimed?
Locally, not to be outdone ...the schools knockouts are full on and hugely followed despite all the drama we had last month during the last strides of our premier Singer League 2018.
Add the Sri Lanka club 7s to this hefty schedule and it really is a tough ask, to grab some sea level oxygen in the city by the sea.....
Life on planet rugby is justifiably, a heart thumping, lung busting, mind over matter, and all to play for script, that is impossible to imagine and beyond all expectations.
Stopping to catch your breath between matches, countries, stadia, and time zones ...is quite the mind numbing designer challenge indeed.
Needless to say, but grateful relief to have the planet’s most prolific Setanta channel looming large and live, like a kind physician with potent solutions to save our planet.....delightful and compulsive.
History will record the impressive stats and facts ...mostly predictable, but some real surprises ...thank you Ireland for shocking Australia in Melbourne and even bigger, USA beating Scotland in Houston in front of a stunned home crowd.
What a grand development for global rugby and hope for more magical results leading up to the world cup.
If magical was fair for Scots and U.S. hearts…then try to absorb how thrilling and pure inspiration the French revolution in the U20 World Cup. They beat defending champions New Zealand in the semis to alter the form book ...then at home as polite hosts, they set about stamping England out of the way ...beating them 33-25 to win that elusive world title...and French hearts a singing.
What a phenomenal result and more hints about the changing order in this remarkable sport.
Expect to see these young French gladiators graduate with distinction in the seasons ahead and dismiss the traditional pecking order.
On that note ...can’t help but feel for England who must be straining at the gills, trying to accept runner up last world cup and a second final loss to France last Sunday, despite all their preparation and form.
On the day, in the middle, it was 33 points from an amazing team effort that set Paris on fire.
In Colombo the Milo knockouts sees passage for Peter’s, Wesley, Kingswood and Joseph’s into the semi finals.
Joes are the defending champions and look the part for sure.
Wesley’s win over Patana, certainly shows us the massive teamwork that changed everything.
This also lines up wonderful possibilities for the semis:
Peters v Wesley.
Joseph’s v Kingswood.
Resident experts stand up ....who will it be in the final?
Incredible if it’s a Joe-Pete repeat and mesmerizing opportunity for both to cap a long arduous season.
Wesley v Kingswood also on the cards ...as we know, anything, absolutely anything is possible in knockout rugby.
June is all impact and unforgiving demands on all the team’s looking for victory and supremacy.
Islanders enjoy the rugby appetite and be proud of our code ...the spirit is strong, but the mind is stronger.
Bula bula Sri api!
