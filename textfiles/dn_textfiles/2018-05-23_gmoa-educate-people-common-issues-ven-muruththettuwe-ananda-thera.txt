GMOA to educate people  on common issues  - Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is making all efforts to educate the people on all common public issues, Public Service United Nurses Union President Ven.Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Ven.Ananda Thera said that the Government should immediately abolish the Free Trade Agreement signed with Singapore and consult the people before signing such as agreement, whenever the Government receives an opportunity to sign a Free Trade Agreement with a foreign country. He was addressing media in Colombo yesterday.
“The union will take stern trade action if the Government fails to consult the people before taking crucial decisions on behalf of the country,such as, entering into Free Trade Agreements. The Government has handed over the entire sea area of Sri Lanka which is eight times larger than Sri Lanka, to Singapore through the signed agreement,”the Thera said.
“There is no clause mentioned in the agreement in connection with withdrawing from the agreement/abolishing it.Under the conditions included in the agreement, obtaining employment in Singapore will only be a dream for Sri Lankans. But, any person who has Singaporean citizenship can come to Sri Lanka.
This is totally unacceptable, the Thera added.
