The staff donated finance from their salary in which the Bank’s staff, management and trade unions organized and bought goods that were much needed by affected people.
Trucks carrying dry rations and other essential commodities including bed-sheets and mats were dispatched from the Bank of Ceylon head office on May 31, with the participation of the Bank’s Chairman, members of the Director Board and the General Manager.
Several members of the bank’s Board of Directors, representatives of the Bank’s Corporate and Executive management and other officials visited the flood areas with the donation and provide necessary manpower to distribute them following the directions received from Divisional Secretaries of the said areas and the Bank’s Provincial Assistant General Managers.
Speaking on behalf of the staff the Bank’s General Manager D.M.
