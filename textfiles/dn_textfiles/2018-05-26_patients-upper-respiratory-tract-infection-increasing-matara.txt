Patients with upper respiratory tract infection increasing in Matara

Figures obtained from hospital sources showed that the number of patients admitted to the Matara District General Hospital with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection had almost doubled in the past week with relation to the week before.
A total of 313 patients (145 children and 168 adults) diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection were admitted to the Matara District General Hospital between May 14 and 20 while only 164 patients (89 children and 75 adults) were admitted between May 7 and 13. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza viruses circulate and cause disease in humans every year. In Sri Lanka, for the last few years, it has been generally observed during April to June and again in November to January. It spreads from person to person through sneezing, coughing or touching contaminated surfaces. Seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals. Persons at increased risk for severe disease include pregnant women, the very young and the very old, immune-compromised people and those with chronic underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.
Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can get infected multiple times throughout their lives.
Sources at the DGH Matara said patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection are admitted to the hospital throughout the year while there is sharp increase at this time of year as the climatic conditions become ideal for the virus to spread. It was stated that the unusually sharp increase within the past week was a matter of concern.
A WHO report states that Influenza A (H1N1) is the commonly circulating seasonal influenza - a virus subtype in Sri Lanka. During the current season, it has been observed to generally cause severe disease. This seasonal A (H1N1) virus is the same virus that caused the influenza pandemic and it first appeared in Sri Lanka in two waves during 2009/ 10 period’.
Ten to 15 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections warded at the DGH Matara are sent to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for testing each month. Of the 15 samples submitted in April, only one patient tested positive for Influenza type A virus while in the month of May, 5 of the 39 samples submitted have tested positive.
Two deaths of persons suffering from respiratory tract infection have been recorded at the DGH Matara in the months of April and May. One was a 26-year-old female who was pregnant while the other was a 59-year-old male. Although samples obtained from the deceased had been submitted to the MRI, the authorities had not received the results as yet.
The hospital authorities in Matara had taken all measures to stop the disease from spreading and may even restrict the number of visitors to two per patient as a precaution.
