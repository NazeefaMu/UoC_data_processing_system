No one can topple Govt: Kabir

 This government is stable and none can topple it until 2020,Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
He also said that in 2020 the UNP would set up a government of its own. “No body can prevent it,” Minister Hashim said. He was speaking at the UNP’s May Day Rally at Campbell Park in Borella yesterday.
Minister Hashim also said that those who were in power are attempting to topple the government, which is impossible. “The UNP as a political party is geared for elections at any moment,” Minister Hashim said.
Speaking at the rally Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was the President thought that the ships passing the sea off Hambantota would come to the Hambantota port when he waved a flag. He added that the project was a white elephant. He also said that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was not in Sri Lanka when his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa contested for the Presidential Election.
“When Mahinda Rajapaksa won the election he came to the country with only USD 10,000,” Minister Fonseka said.
“But, later he is alleged to have amassed wealth and property with a massive fish tank with sharks in it. He had to spend Rs.10,000 to feed the fish aloneo,” Field Marshal Fonseka said.
