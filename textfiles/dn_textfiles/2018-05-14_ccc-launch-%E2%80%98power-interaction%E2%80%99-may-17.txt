CCC to launch ‘Power of Interaction’ on May 17

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) is launching a new initiative titled “Power of Interaction” with the aim of bringing together various groupings of high powered officials, in order to provide the private sector a purposeful platform of interaction.
This event would be held every quarter starting from May 2018, with the first of this series taking place on May 17 at Shangri-La, Colombo.
For the first of the “Power of Interaction” series, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is bringing together High Commissioners and Senior Staff of Missions in the Asian Region to interact with the local business community. The session will provide private sector businesses, which are interested in trade and business development in the Asian region, the opportunity to gain practical insights through interaction with the officials, which can be of benefit for their business strategies.
Diplomats and officials from countries including Afghanistan, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Maldives, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam have confirmed their attendance for the event.
If the private sector wish to attend and draw on the opportunity to meet these high powered officials, they can contact the chamber.
