SLC’s Chief Financial Officer remanded

The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Sri Lanka Cricket Piyal Dissanayake who was arrested for alleged financial fraud has been remanded until November 1 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage. Piyal Nandana was arrested on Monday following a complaint lodged by the SLC to the Inspector General of Police.
The arrest of the Sri Lanka Cricket CFO is related to an alleged financial fraud, which was unearthed last September.
The SLC had managed to successfully thwart the fraudulent attempt to transfer US$.5.5million of SLC’s Media Rights sponsorship funds, which was due from an international Media Network, to an offshore account.
The SLC had cited the CFO Nandana as the prime suspect, who had claimed that his e-mail account had been hacked and sent a request to transfer the money to an off shore account. He was sent on compulsory leave.
The money was one of the three tranches coming from Sony Picture Networks for broadcast rights of the England tour.
