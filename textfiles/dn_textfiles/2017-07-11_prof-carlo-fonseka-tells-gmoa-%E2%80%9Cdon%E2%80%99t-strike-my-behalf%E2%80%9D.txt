Prof. Carlo Fonseka tells GMOA “Don’t strike on my behalf”

Former Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Prof.Carlo Fonseka has asked that the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) not strike on his behalf.
“I was quite cut up about it,” said Prof. Fonseka when contacted by the Daily News. He further explained that the GMOA had pointed out to him that there was a legal issue and that according to the Medical Ordinance, the chairman needed to serve a full term of five years when appointed,” he said. Prof.Fonseka who completed his five year tenure at the beginning of this year, had sought a six month extension which was granted to him, “I was not aware of this.
I of course worked on the assumption that my last day of office was June 30, 2017 and I am going to stick to that now”, said the 84 year old Professor.
The GMOA, headed by its President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya and Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge had met the former chairman at his home in Nawala last morning and handed over a petition asking that he not leave his position as SLMC Chairman.Earlier they had warned that they would launch an indefinite strike if a new Chairman was appointed in Prof.Fonseka’s place.
Prof.Fonseka in return had informed the GMOA that he was not in favour of a strike and asked that the doctors not put the lives of patients in danger as a result of him.
When asked whether Prof.Fonseka would accept an extension of his term if offered,he said, “I will have to wait and see what happens. I have not made a decision regarding that,”Dr.Aluthge said.
