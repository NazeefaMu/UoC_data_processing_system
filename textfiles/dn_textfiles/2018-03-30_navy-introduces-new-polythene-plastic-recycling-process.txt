Navy introduces new polythene, plastic recycling process

The Sri Lanka Navy Marine Conservation and Monitoring Unit has introduced a new polythene and plastic recycling process as a sustainable solution for garbage disposal in Sri Lanka.
This project consists of three phases and as its first phase; the production of items such as flower pots, fence posts and interlocks for gardens, had been tested. It was proven that such items could be produced with less effort.
During the second phase, it is expected to spread this technology countrywide, through the Naval Community Welfare Project and make the general public aware on the proper methods of garbage disposal and how to use garbage as a resource. Further, social organizations would be provided the necessary technical assistance in this regard.
It had been planned to conduct experiments to identify methods of disposing non-polythene/plastic garbage with the assistance of the Naval Research and Development Unit, under the third phase of the project and to introduce a polythene/plastic recycling machine by utlising injection-molding technology.
After giving thought to the current issues revolving around non-degradable waste, polythene and plastic which damage the environment, the Sri Lanka Navy introduced this new technology for the first time, after years of experimentation.
Accordingly, the process would be a suitable solution to effectively manage solid waste that withstands deterioration.
Under the directives of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, this project was conducted with the supervision of Operations Director-General and Marine and Eco Friendly Projects Steering Committee Head Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva, Western Naval Area Commander Rear Admiral Nishantha Ulugetenne and Marine Surveillance Director Commodore Dammika Dias. The project was administered by Lieutenant Commander Aminda Kalupahana.
