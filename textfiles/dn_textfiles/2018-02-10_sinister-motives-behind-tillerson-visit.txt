Sinister motives behind Tillerson visit

United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has completed a visit to six Latin American Countries – Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Jamaica, Mexico and Peru in January. The objective of the visit was to ease tensions and improve relations among Latin America and the United States.
Currently, the United States is not very popular in the Continent. There are differences over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the construction of a wall in the US - Mexican border, the inclusion of Latin American countries also in President Trump‘s derogatory remark about “s....... countries”, US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord et al.
However, it soon became apparent that its real objectives were sinister. Just before the visit Tillerson, in an address given at the University of Texas indicated the desire of the United States to coordinate an Energy Union extending from Canada to Chile. Nothing could be more familiar to the former CEO, Exxon Mobile Corporation whose association with oil business is four decades long.
When Chávez re-nationalized the oil industry in 2007, his company rejected the conditions of compensation for its contracts in Cerro Negro, in the Orinoco basin. The draconian demand for 1.4 billion dollars in payments for the alleged losses is still maintained. Now, from the State Department, he seems determined to collect revenge.
In the same address he referred to the infamous Monroe doctrine proclaimed in 1823, almost 200 years ago which declared Latin America out of bounds for other powers. “Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their peoples,” he said. His remarks were intended for China and Russia whose relations with the continent has been increasing sharply. Tillerson further added, “I think it is relevant today as on the day it was written”, thus ignoring its anachronistic nature and displaying imperialist arrogance.
The United States had never hidden its hostility towards the Cuban ad Venezuelan revolutions. In the same speech at the University of Texas he called for hardening of the economic blockade of Cuba and his remarks hinted at US plans to influence the outcome of the April elections in Cuba after which President Raul Castro will relinquish his office.
As regards Venezuela also Tillerson did not hide his intentions. He called upon the governments in the region to assist the overthrow of President Maduro, who was elected with a large majority at democratically held elections. He did not rule out military intervention.
When the Secretary of State of the united States encourages military to replace democratically elected governments, it is a very serious matter since Washington has been associated with each and every military conspiracies and coup d’états in the Continent for decades and decades and has openly supported fascist and dictatorial regimes from Mexico to Chile.
Its modus operandi has been causing food and drug shortages, instigating violent mob reactions and an international media campaign disseminating fake news.
Not only did Tillerson receive a lukewarm response to his proposals but also the ground situation has improved in Venezuela. Last January 31st, the Venezuelan Government and the Opposition came to a preliminary agreement on cooperation to peacefully settle their differences following prolonged negotiations in the Dominican Republic.
Negotiations are continuing. President Maduro has already called for Presidential elections next April.
In a bid thwarting United States attempt to exclude Venezuela from the Summit of Americas scheduled in Lima, Peru in April 2018 President Maduro has already accepted the official invitation sent by the President of Peru.
Germany gets a government at last
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU has successfully negotiated a coalition with the SPD to form a government ending four months of uncertainty following the general elections last September.
The SPD or the Social Democrats had earlier ruled out another coalition with Merkel. But since the failure of CDU/CSU talks with FDP (Free Democrats) it changed mind, especially in view of the common challenge from the far right AfD or the neo-fascist Alliance for Germany.
According to the agreement SPD will get six ministries including Finance, Foreign and Labor while CDU will be in charge of key ministries of Defence and Economy among others. SPD Leader Martin Shulz is expected to be the Foreign Minister while Hamburg Mayor Olaf Sholz would become Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor. Andrea Nohles will be the new leader of the SPD, the first woman to hold the post in the party’s history. The two parties have 399 seats in the Bundestag which has a total of 789 seats. However, it will be a shaky coalition in view of the political differences of the coalition. Health, housing and refugee policy are particularly sensitive areas.
However, the Agreement has to be ratified by the general membership, of the SPD which numbers over 460,000. Voting will be by post. There is considerable opposition to any agreement with the CDU, especially among the youth who have even formed a group called NOGROCO (No Grand Coalition). If the membership fails to ratify the Agreement Germany will have to face another election, the outcome of which also may turn out to be a hung Parliament.
The European Union has already welcomed the Agreement as a factor guaranteeing political stability in Europe. Investors and friendly countries also are happy that uncertainty will be eliminated.
