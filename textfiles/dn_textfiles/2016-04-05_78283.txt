Junior Match Play Golf Tourney from April 18 to 21

 
The Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) will conduct the Sri Lanka Junior Match Play Golf Championship 2016 for the Rukmani Kodagoda Challenger Trophy at the Royal Colombo Club course, Colombo from 18th to 2st April. This major golf championship for junior golfers in the country will be once again sponsored by Perera and Sons Bakers Limited.
This championship organized by the governing body for golf in Sri Lanka has drawn the best junior golfers in the country and is a very good move by the SLGU as it will give the promising young golfers an opportunity to compete with golfers within their age group as otherwise they will have to compete with seniors in other tournaments.
The championship will be played in the following divisions:
Gold Division: 15 to 17 years
Silver Division: 12 to 14 years
Bronze Division: 10 to 11 years
Copper Division: 9 years and under
This Junior Golf Championship was inaugurated in 2014 with Perera and Sons Bakers Limited coming forward to sponsor the event and this will be the third consecutive year in which they will be the sponsors and will be played for the Rukmani Kodagoda Trophy. The objective behind this championship is for the SLGU to focus attention on young golfers especially those under 14 years with an eye on the future and to identify and develop their talents.
Late Rukmani Kodagoda is a double international having represented the country in two sports - golf and tennis. She won the national Amateur championship in 1979 besides many other tournaments. Ruki as she was affectionately known established herself as one of the top sportswomen in the country at that time winning trophies after trophies. She held the post of chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ladies Golf Union in 1990 and 1991 and was also the captain of the Ladies section of the Royal Colombo Golf Club. It is a fine tribute that this championship is being played for a trophy named after an eminent sporting personality.
Last year's championship saw some top performances with Prashan Peiris winning the Gold Division. Tanya Balasuriya the Copper Division, Lavon Niyarapola the Bronze Division and Yanik Kumara the Copper Division. One of the top contenders for the Gold Division and the Overall title will be Tanya Balasuriya who is in good nick having won the Mackwoods Sri Lanka Ladies Match Play Golf Championship 2016 played at Victoria last month.
Then there are other promising top golfers like Ananda Flamer Caldera, D Dhanarajan, S Fleming, Januka Dilshan, Tien Kapilasena, Nirek Tejwani, Levon Niyarapola and Sathsara Nilshan who could shine in their own divisions.
