Minister requests Saudi to increase Haj quota

City Planning and Water Supply Minister M. L. A. M. Hizbullah had officially requested Saudi authorities through Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Abdul Naser H Al Harithy to increase the Haj Pilgrimage quota by 2,000.
A letter was sent to Dr. Salih Bin Mohammed Thahir Panthen, Saudi Minister for Haj and Umrah and Dr. Rafath Ibnu Ismail Ibraheem Bathr, Director for Haj and Umrah for South Asian countries to consider the request of Muslims in Sri Lanka, said Minister Hisbullah.
“Saudi Arabia provides a quota of 3,000 for Sri Lankan pilgrims annually, but we receive over 13,000 applications for the Haj Pilgrimage annually. We are unable to send all applicants to do the Haj Pilgrimage due to the insufficient quota,” the minister stated.
“If the Saudi Arabian Government accepts the request, we would be able to send a minimum of 5,000 to Makkah every year to perform the Haj,” said the minister.
