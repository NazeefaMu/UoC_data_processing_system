New technological equipment for planetarium

The Sri Lanka Planetarium will be strengthened with new technological equipment drawing support and assistance from technologically developed countries, Science, Technology and Research minister Susil Premajayantha said.
"This will bring the planetarium up to international standards enabling visitors to gain a better knowledge and understanding about the universe," he said.
The minister said during an inspection tour of the planetarium recently.
Premajayantha said the observatory was set up concurrently with the industrial exhibition held in 1965.
It is a matter of pride to see the planetarium being in a position to enable people including schoolchildren to observe the universe including the constellation with the help of digital and other technology, he said.
