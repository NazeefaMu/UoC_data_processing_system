CA directs AG to file CID progress report on investigation

The Court of Appeal yesterday directed the Attorney General to file the progress report of the CID investigation into the Welikada prison riot on the next date.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal fixed the writ petition for March 5 in order to file the progress of the CID investigation into Welikada prison riot in 2012.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General informed Court that the CID has commenced a broad investigation into the incident and the progress of the investigation into the Welikada prison riot has been reported to the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court through B reports.
The Attorney General made these observations pursuant to a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time of the alleged incidents took place had filed this writ petition citing Commissioner General of Prisons, Director of CID, Inspector General of Police, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that he was wishing to bring to the attention of the Court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining relief.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm the petitioner and other prisoners atWelikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation.
The petitioner got to know that there was an argument between prison officials and a contingent TID, STF waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation. The petitioner stated that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time 27 of the prison inmates had been killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence.
The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
The petitioner stated that although four years has lapsed since the brutal killings of these prisoners no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct the investigation and prosecute the offenders.
This petition was filed through Senior Counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera. Senior State Counsel Madawa Tennakoon appeared for the Attorney General.
