35th Mercantile Inter Firm Team Badminton:
McLarens emerge Overall champs

The McLarens Shuttlers illustrated total and complete domination at the two month long 35th Inter Firm Team Badminton Championships 2018, which proved to be a massive success. McLarens Shuttlers impressed yet again by emerging Overall Champions, with a total team score of 328 points. Having fought their way into being overall champions in 2016 and 2017, this year’s win shattered that benchmark and set an even more admirable one when the team scooped up 9 championships across 32 divisions. This has been the highest number of championships won by any team at a MBA tournament.
One of the biggest tournaments in the badminton calendar, the Inter Firm Championships comprised 97 companies and 224 teams competing across 32 divisions. With new categories coming in, the competition became more intense and matches more vigorous and challenged the players to adapt to the new format. These alterations were no game changer for the McLarens Shuttlers, instead they adjusted and set new records in the sport. Securing the overall championship by winning divisions is simple but securing 9 divisional championships by commanding control at the top most, highest ranked divisions was the icing on the McLarens championship cake.
The championships won included Men’s and Women’s A Division, Men’s and Women’s B Divisions, Men’s Veteran’s A Division, Women’s Veterans, Mixed B Division, Men’s Masters, and Men’s Veteran’s C Division. In addition to this outstanding achievement, the teams managed to secure other divisional podium finishes. Mixed A and B Divisions and Men’s B Division became runners up, Men’s A Division and Mixed C Division finished in third place while Mixed A Division, Men’s Veterans, Women’s A Division became 4th.
Apart from exceptional team accomplishments, there were noteworthy and outstanding performances by individual players whose tactful and experienced skills played a monumental role in bringing home the championships. Accolades were given to Sachin Dias, Thilini Hendahewa, Subash J. de Silva, Naduni Prabashini, Pradeep Welageadra, Kaushali H. Dissanayake, Lalin Yatawara, E. M. Chandrathileke and Dulshan Alahackone for their brilliant performances.
The hard work of these young aspiring sports men and women and all our Shuttlers is a testimony to the dedication that will always live on at McLarens.
