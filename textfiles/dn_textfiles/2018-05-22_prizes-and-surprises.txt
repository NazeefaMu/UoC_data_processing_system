Prizes and  surprises

The first prize-giving ceremony of Sri Ananda English Medium Dhamma School concluded at the Lyceum Adventure Park, Kurunegala. This Dhamma School, which is also affiliated to Maliyadeva Vidyarakshaka Pirivena is the very first Buddhist School of its kind in the North Western Province that is conducted by an international school.
The Maha Sangha appreciated Lyceum’s efforts to spread the knowledge and philosophy of the Buddha’s teachings, despite being an international school.
