Drought affected in Anuradhapura receive dry rations sans delay

Dry food rations are being distributed in the Anuradhapura district transparently and efficiently. About 157,503 drought affected farmer families in 694 Grama Niladari divisions in the district would receive the relief, the Anuradhapura Government Agent said. "We have distributed dry ration packs (a pack worth Rs. 5,000) to needy families in 294 GN divisions. The farmers in the Thirappane DS division did not receive the relief yet due to some operational issues. The recipients are expected to contribute manpower for five days per month for few hours per day in the morning at 965 works sites. Rs. 200 million was allocated to cover the phase one and Rs. 250 million is required further, he said.
"About 76,606 persons of 22.404 families in 15 DS divisions are now provided with drinking water. The water is supplied by 22 bowsers. Another 15 bowsers are required to expand the programme," he said.
