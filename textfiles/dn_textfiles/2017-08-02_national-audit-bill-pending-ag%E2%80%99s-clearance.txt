National Audit Bill pending AG’s clearance

The final draft of the much-awaited and long overdue National Audit Bill was completed and is pending the Attorney General’s clearance, Additional Auditor General W. P. C. Wickramarathna said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the main concerns raised by various parties have been duly addressed in the final draft, while retaining the provision for the Auditor General to impose surcharge on public officials to recover losses on account of financial fraud or irregularity that they are responsible of.
“The main concern on the provision to impose surcharge was that it goes against the natural justice as the Auditor General, who issues the surcharge notice, also becomes the appellant authority that reviews and decides appeals.
In the earlier draft, the Audit Commission chaired by the Auditor General was the appellant authority. Now we have brought an amendment to establish a separate audit appeal committee for that purpose. The Committee members will be appointed from the Audit Service Commission, but the Auditor General should not be a member that by law,” Wickramarathna said.
The spirit of legislation has been preserved while duly amending the problematic clauses, Additional Auditor General added.
Wickramarathna added that he was informed by the Attorney General’s Department on Monday that they have certain concerns on the final draft. “We are waiting till we receive them. Then we will have to revisit the draft and make necessary changes after discussing with the Legal Draftsman,” he said.
The first draft of National Audit Bill was formulated in 2004 and it has been dragging on for 12 long years now. We hope that we will be able to push the Bill through this time,” he added.
Sri Lanka Audit Services Association President K. N. M. Kumarasinghe said that they were in agreement on the content of final draft sent to the Attorney General, adding that all the progressive features seen in the initial draft have been incorporated into the final. “As we are aware the final copy has already been sent to the Secretary to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has stated that he needs to place it before the Cabinet again before publishing in the Gazette,” Kumarasinghe said.
