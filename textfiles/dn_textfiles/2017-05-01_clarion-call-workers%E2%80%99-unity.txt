Clarion  call for  workers’  unity

Piyasoma undoubtedly would have left the living world by now, but I shall always recall him about this time of the year: the crotchety, silent mechanic in overalls with his side pockets stuffed with all types of tools. Old Piyasoma was a wizard with the automotive repairs and the workers liked him although they scarcely understood his strange quips which, I suspected, they regarded as the signs of approaching senility.
“May Day is the workers’ New Year Day,” he said. “Anyone who works for a living starts his year on May Day.”
Piyasoma kept on talking about his concept of May Day. Today, forty May Days later, I have come to believe he wasn’t far from right. He had said, with a sweep of his arm that nobody at his workplace understood what May Day meant, but that the time would come when they, like him, would regard it as the year’s beginning.
May Day, he said, means freedom; all over the world it comes in the springtime and, in Sri Lanka, it comes just couple of weeks after Aluth Auvrudda, when workers think of a better life.
Today I pay homage to Piyasoma, one of the obscure, unsung millions of Sri Lankan workers; he crops up in my mind every time May Day rolls around. I thought of him those many May Days when I saw our labouring men and women parading through the streets.
Reform
May Day, or International Workers’ Day, is traditionally a celebration of the international labour movement and left-wing movements. It is a day which traditionally was reserved to help promote worker rights and recognise the practice of labour laws.
However, in Sri Lanka May Day rallies have shifted from the arena of workers’ rights to an opportunity for the political parties to promote their political agenda.
Going back the history, we find that it was in 1922 under the leadership of A.E. Goonasinghe that Ceylon founded its first ever trade union, the Ceylon Labour Union. And, five years later, same trade union celebrated Sri Lanka’s first May Day. Maybe, that is why A.E. Goonasinghe was often referred to as the “Father of the Labour Movement”.
Subsequently, other trade unions joined the bandwagon and May Day rallies were held at a number of places in Colombo and outstation. It was in 1936, Sri Lanka’s first political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) held its first May Day rally presided over by Colvin R. de Silva.
Turbulent times
This year the workers across the world will commemorate May Day in one of the most turbulent and traumatic periods in history. The world is ravaged by wars, terrorism, bloodshed, economic catastrophe and unprecedented poverty, misery, disease and destitution. The vast majority of the human race has been plunged into the abyss of deprivation, hunger and agonising suffering.
After the failure of the Keynesian model in the 1980s, free market enterprise or the “trickle down” economy has led to the biggest financial crash in the history of capitalism. And the exploitation and drudgery of the working classes has worsened. The gains of the workers through immense struggles of the last thirteen decades are being drastically slashed even in the advanced capitalist countries.
Statistics
According to The New York Times, the richest one percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Office for National Statistics (UK) reveal that Britain’s richest 1% have accumulated as much wealth as the poorest 55% of the population put together. Australia has always lauded its working-class culture, and the subsequent rise of the middle class. But, today, the very nature of society is changing dramatically: the wealth of the highest 20% households on average is 71 times that of the lowest 20% households.
Sri Lanka is no exception. 38 percent of our national income is shared by the richest 10 percent of the population while 1.5 percent of the national income is shared by the poorest 10 percent of the population. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, current Governor of the Central Bank, said that Sri Lanka has been extremely successful in terms of social development according to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals but has not been able to achieve the appropriate balance between social development and wealth creation/employment generation.
The same story is repeated throughout the democratic world. India has 20 per cent of world’s population yet hosts about 40 per cent of world’s poverty and yet now there are more billionaires in India than in Japan.
These figures tell us in simple terms that the aspirations of the May Day pioneers, including the people who sacrificed their lives, have not yet fully materialised.
In his book, “Reformism and revolution”, the renowned theoretician, Alan Woods gives a graphic description of this disaster. He writes, “The crisis of the capitalist system is reflected in a crisis of materialistic values, morality, religion, politics and philosophy. The mood of pessimism that afflicts the bourgeoisie and its ideologues in this period is manifested in the emptiness of its spiritual values.”
Memory
In the context of these stirrings of the working class, May Day 2017 attains an extraordinary significance.
Spirit of ‘May Day’ has been clearly reflected in the Sri Lankan Constitution which has provided for Sri Lanka’s commitment to a welfare state. Few articles which find mention in the section called ‘Fundamental Rights’ too provide protection to the working class.
Sri Lanka is currently estimated to have a total workforce of about 8.3 million of which 63.3 percent are males and 36.7 percent are females. This is expected to grow by 12 per cent every year over the next 10 years. Therefore, the Government should realize the significance of the increasing size of the work-force and emphasis has to be given on a planned investment in skill development of the workers in the country.
The Government also needs to put in place a coordinated action for skill development. For this purpose, this writer suggests that the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training should set up a National Council for Skill Development to synergise public and private streams for skill development and also a National Skill Development Corporation set up as well to promote private sector led action.
Fight or flight
Workers are the backbone of our country’s economy. A nation like ours cannot genuinely progress and prosper making its working force unhappy. A lot remain to be done to ameliorate the conditions of the workers, particularly, in the unorganised sectors of our country.
Much of controversy has arisen around injustice done to the poor who are engaged on temporary or contract basis. Apart from their anxiety about their future engagement, they are subjected to several kinds of exploitation. At the same time, the workers in the unorganised sectors are forced to work longer with less wage and corrective measures in this regard are yet to be formulated.
Workers are also partly to blame for their ordeals and miseries. Workers – in both organised and unorganised sectors – are yet to develop class consciousness. Being guided by ‘false consciousness,’ they are divided into several groups and sub-groups resulting in lack of unity and cohesiveness among them. Political affiliation is the most serious obstacle to the joint fight of workers for their common maladies. Political parties drag them in different directions to promote their partisan interests at the cost of the genuine interests of the workers.
Workers everywhere want decent work and decent pay so that they could be contented and in control of their lives. If they are denied these rights, they will ultimately stand up for what they want.
Sri Lanka is a socialist country which means, among other things, that it should be employee friendly. There are approximately 30 Acts of Parliament which are applicable to employees regulating everything from work hours to the cubic space a worker is entitled to. Unfortunately, majority of employees are totally unaware of their rights. Even senior executives have rights given to them by law with regard to their employment.
But they are not going to get recognition and justice by sitting divided and silent. They need to continue their struggle relentlessly on a platform of unity and solidarity.
Karl Marx gave a clarion call to the workers of the world to unite. He said they had nothing to lose but their chains. What he said 132 years ago is valid even today.
