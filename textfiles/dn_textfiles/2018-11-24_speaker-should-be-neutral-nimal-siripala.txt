Speaker should be neutral - Nimal Siripala

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya’s adamant actions is leading the country into anarchy by totally violating the Standing Orders of Parliament.
However, through such actions, they cannot take back the Premiership nor the government and we as the UPFA government will continue our work unhindered, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Addressing a media conference at the Parliamentary complex yesterday, he urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to stop acting in this adamant manner and take a neutral stance and serve the country.
“If they want to show the majority, they should appoint the committee of selections in the proper manner, appoint the business committee and thereafter bring a no confidence resolution to parliament in the proper manner. If we lose that then we will not remain, we will leave.
At the Party Leader’s meeting Rauff Hakeem spilled the beans and said that they had taken a short cut for fear that parliament would be prorogued.
Hence, it is clear that they themselves have accepted that this system is wrong.
Therefore, they cannot throw out the Prime Minister and government that was appointed legitimately by the President.
If they want to they should show their majority according to proper procedures,” he said.
