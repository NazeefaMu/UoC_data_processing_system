Dominant Royal beats  Wesley to enter semi-finals

 
Royal College Colombo staged a spectacular display of running rugby to down Wesley College by 29 points (5 tries, 3 conversions) to 21 (2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, 2 drop goals) in their Milo inter-school 'A' Division knockout rugby tournament quarterfinal match played at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue yesterday. Royal led 17-6 at half time.
Wesley shocked the spectators present as they drew first blood in the 3rd minute of play when off a turn over ball their fly half Mursheed Doray put over a brilliant 35-metre drop goal mid left to go into a 3-nil lead.
In the 4th minute off a scrum Royal set their line in motion where centre Janindu Dilshan foxed the Wesley defence and gave an off load to his winger Shabith Feroze who made the overlap and darted down for a brilliant try near the right corner flag. Ovin Askey missed the conversion and Royal took the lead 5-3.
Royal further increased their tally to 10-3 when in the 19th minute when off a rolling maul second row Ashen Fernando touched down for a try mid right. Askey once again missed the conversion.
In the 32nd minute Royal scored again when off a superb rolling maul hooker Azmir Fajudeen fell over for a try mid left. Askey was successful with the conversion and Royal led 17-3.
On the stroke of half time Wesley slotted a 30-metre penalty through scrum half Avishka Lee to make it 17-6 at the breather.
After resumption in the 51st minute Royal scored once more through Fajudeen off their famous rolling maul but Askey missed the conversion. Royal led 22-6.
Four minutes later off a five metre scrum Wesley prop forward Dayan Sabar crashed through for a try near the right upright. Avishka Lee made the conversion to cut the Royal led down to 22-13.
In the 61st minute, off another rolling maul Royal second row forward Harith Lokugamage fell over for a try near the left corner flag and the difficult touch line conversion was put over beautifully by Askey to increase the tally to 29-13.
Wesley again cut down the lead immediately when in the 75th minute their replacement fly half Mohomed Bahardeen fired across a neat 30 metre drop goal to take the score to 29-21.
In injury time off a sweeping three quarter move Wesley scored through replacement centre Dineru Ranaweera a brilliant try near the left corner flag after going through the entire Royal defence covering nearly 55 metres. Avishka Lee missed the difficult touch line conversion and scoreline read 29-21 in favour of Royal when the final whistle blew. - (WAI)
