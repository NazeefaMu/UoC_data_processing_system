Legacy bequeathed

Unduwap Poya is of great historical and cultural significance Inauguration of Srimaha Bodhi and Bhikkuni Order is good evidence When propagating Dhamma by Emperor Asoka’s mission Lanka was the first to attract his attention The great faith that Arahat Mahinda stressed Was embraced by the king devotionally impressed Then the females with their outlook broader Wished to enter the pious Bhikkuni Order This had been discussed by the duo already For which the king Asoka’s daughter was ever-ready Therini Sanghamitta arrived to inaugurate Bhikkunisasana Turning a new chapter in the history of Buddha sasana Lanka was blessed with two precious things As a result of the friendship of the two kings Now the arrival of Therini Sanghamitta was urgent Which led to the most glorious sacred events Srimaha Bodhi the most venerated in the world Said to be the oldest, nearly 2600 years old It was the southern branch of the original Bo tree Under which Buddha put an end to his searching spree Asoka in Jambudweepa Had stood on the shore amazingly gazing At the ship sailing far and returned home weeping It is said the waves of the ocean were stilled Lotus flowers had blossomed all around Devas had offerings manifold With non-stop “Sadhu” in the sky above and around His friend Devanampiyatissa at this end Had the roots spotlessly cleaned and decorated Encamped in the seashore awaiting arrival honoured Anxious king, when the ship was sighted Filled with much joy and highly excited When the golden pot bearing the sacred sapling Brought to Sri Lanka by Ven. Mahinda’s sibling King placed it in a specially constructed pavilion Villagers from far and wide paid homage in millions Then to the capital, it was taken in a procession As the greatest treasure, he had in his possession Finally, planting ceremony was held in Mahamevna gardens On the sacred spot where it now stands Revered and respected by all Buddhists in the globe Leading to the fulfilment of their beautiful hopes- Rupa Banduwardena
