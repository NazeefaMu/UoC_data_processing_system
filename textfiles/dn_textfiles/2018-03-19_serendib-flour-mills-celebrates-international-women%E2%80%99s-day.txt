Serendib Flour Mills celebrates international women’s day

Serendib Flour Mills celebrated International Women’s Day recently under the theme ‘7 Star Women - Empowering you for Tomorrow’ to salute the remarkable contribution made by women towards society.
As a responsible corporate citizen, Serendib Flour Mills too marked the event in a memorable manner by holding a forum at Jetwing Colombo Seven, where prominent women were invited to share their thoughts on the occasion of International Women’s Day. The speakers at the event were Roshani Morias – Executive Vice President of John Keells Holdings, who spoke about her experiences and challenges faced as a woman in the corporate world; Anoja Rajapathirana – Founder of EASE Foundation, who shared her thoughts on her journey as a woman, a mother and a teacher; and Melissa Dharmadasa of Bakes by Bella, who elaborated on her rise to the top of the culinary sphere. The riveting sessions were followed by a panel discussion after which the floor was thrown open for questions from the audience.
The speakers reiterated the need for women everywhere to consider themselves equal to men, despite operating in a largely male-dominated society. Women’s ability to multi task is their key strength and it should be appreciated in every realm they enter.
The speakers urged women to be true to themselves and be proud of their identity and achievements, even though at times they have to work harder than men in order to prove their worth.
The event concluded by hailing the power of women.
The Year 2018 also marks the 10th anniversary of Serendib Flour Mills and the company has exciting plans to make this year a memorable one.
