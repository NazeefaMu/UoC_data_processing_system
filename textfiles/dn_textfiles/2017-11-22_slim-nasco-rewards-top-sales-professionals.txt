SLIM NASCO rewards top sales professionals

The National Sales Congress (NASCO) 2017 organized by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) drew to a successful conclusion recently at Eagle’s Lakeside, Colombo, awards ceremony.
Attracting the highest number of entries in the history of SLIM NASCO this year, the event was graced by R. .Renganathan – CEO and Director, Ceylinco Life PLC as Chief Guest and Mahen Perera - Past President SLIM as the Guest of Honour for the evening, who felicitated the winners.
The overall winners list includes Amal Bulathsingala of Nations Trust Bank in the ‘Sales Executive’ category; Lasantha Pushpakumara from Astron Limited in the ‘Front Liner’ category; Safeekhan Siddique of Siam City Cement in the ‘Territory Manager’ category; and Natalie Samarasinghe of PowerHouse Ltd for ‘Best Female Sales Personnel’.
This year’s edition of SLIM NASCO recorded over 550 entries across categories of sales frontliners, executive, supervisors and territory managers from 22 industries. A total of 96 companies came on-board of which 12 were first-timers at NASCO, which reflects a steep rise over the previous year.
Commenting on SLIM NASCO 2017, Karthik Elangovan – President of SLIM, said, “I would like to express my best wishes to all the winners at the SLIM NASCO 2017, which is an annual highlight in the nation’s corporate calendar. We urge all sales personnel to put their foot forward and look ahead for exciting new categories at the next SLIM NASCO awards.” Adding further, Suranjith Swaris – Vice President of SLIM said, “SLIM is playing a strategic role in elevating standards among sales professionals in the country and SLIM NASCO awards have become the most coveted corporate recognition in the country ”
Commenting on the success of NASCO 2017, Manthika Ranasinghe – Project Chairperson of SLIM NASCO said, “The SLIM NASCO 2017 was successful beyond our expectations and we owe this success to our financial sponsors and media partners.”
As the National Body of Marketing, SLIM has been in the forefront in fostering marketing knowledge and best practices in the country, and SLIM NASCO is the only national level event which recognises and rewards sales personnel covering a spectrum of business sectors.
NASCO consequentially paved the way to regain the lost glory of the sales profession and thereby attract the young school leavers and graduates.
