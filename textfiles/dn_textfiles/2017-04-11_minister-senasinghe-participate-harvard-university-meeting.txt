Minister Senasinghe to participate at Harvard University meeting

Sujeewa Senasinghe, State Minister for International Trade has been formally invited for the second time to attend a prestigious meeting at the Centre for International Development (CID) at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
This latest programme is a platform where 100 leading international policymakers, Chief Executive Officers, Heads of foundations and multilateral organizations and development experts will meet and discuss important issues relating to global sustainable development and prosperity.
Furthermore the conference known as Global Empowerment Meeting (GEM17) will examine innovations and inspire discussion towards joint action to address these issues.
The discussion will largely focus on moral foundations and societal identities and how these forces play an important part in policy making and setting priorities in today's development agenda.
Among the leading speakers are Robert Wright, Bestselling author and journalist; Dani Rodrik, Professor of International Political Economy at Harvard, Joshua Greene, Professor of Psychology and Director of the Moral Cognition Lab at Harvard; Maria Ramos, CEO of Barclays Africa Group Limited: Michele Lamont, Director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and Mark Blyth, Professor of Political Economy at Brown University.
Sujeewa Senasinghehas had a strong connection with Harvard University's Centre for Economic Development (CID) having participated earlier in August to September 2016 at an Executive Education Programme titled "Mastering Trade Policy: Understanding and Acting in Today's Economy" which was initiated by Prof. Robert Z Lawrence of Harvard University.
Hence the participation by the State Minister at the 9th annual Global Empowerment Meeting will be an excellent opportunity for him to interact with many leading figures in a wide spectrum of specializations and to make a strong case in favour of Sri Lanka as a partner for trade and for Foreign Direct Investment.
