Green light from people for new Constitution: Bishop

The Methodist Church Sri Lanka expresses its appreciation to all the political parties that have remained involved in the process and exercise of drafting a new Constitution, without giving into the attempts made by certain politicians and even religious personnel to bring to a halt, a mandate that the people of this country clearly gave at the elections held in 2015, said Methodist Church President /Bishop Rev. Asiri P. Perera.
Issuing a statement, the Bishop said, “We should not forget the fact that both Mahinda Rajapaksa (who received 47% votes) and President Maithripala Sirisena (who received 51%votes) pledged to the people of Sri Lanka that they would bring in a new Constitution if they were elected the President of the country on the 8th of January 2015. Therefore, all right thinking people of Sri Lanka must realize that the green light for a new Constitution has already been given by 98% of the people who voted at the Presidential Election on January 8th, 2015.” The statement added: “All those who now try to bring to a halt the exercise of formulating a new Constitution must realize that they are acting against the will of the majority of the people in Sri Lanka and we as a Church call upon all such persons and groups to kindly give up their campaign and stop their irresponsible actions and join in the process of formulating a new Constitution.
“It is no doubt there are differences of opinion when formulating a Constitution that seeks to satisfy all sections of people who live in a country like ours. But these should be first debated at the appropriate forums rather than dragging them to the streets to provoke the masses through unhealthy slogans.
“The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka entreats all people of our land and especially the Christians to pray and get involved in healthy discussions and dialogue that promotes the need to find a lasting solution to a burning issue that has cost so many valuable lives in our country, and resolve the same through appropriate constitutional change."
