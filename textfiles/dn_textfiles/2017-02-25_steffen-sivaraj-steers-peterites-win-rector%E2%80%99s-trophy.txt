Steffen Sivaraj steers Peterites to win Rector’s trophy

St Peter’s College vice-captain cum fly half Steffen Sivaraj starred as he scored a sensational try and put over three conversions along with two penalties with a total aggregate of 17 points out of his schools 27 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 2 penalties) to 25 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties) win over St Anthony’s College Kandy in their Singer ‘A’ division league rugby inter school’s opening rugby match played at Bambalapitiya yesterday. The Peterites retained the Rector’s trophy for another year.
After leading 24-15 at lemons, the Peterites came back strongly in the second half to snatch victory from Antonians with a brilliant display of rugby.
The Rectors’ Trophy was donated jointly by the Rugby Foundation of St. Peter’s and the Rugby wing of St. Anthony’s in honour of the past Rectors of the two schools Rev Fr. Joe Wickramasinghe (Rector of St Peter’s College from 1978 to 1994) and Fr. Dom Aiden de Silva (rector of St. Anthony’s College from 1968 to 1974).
It was an awesome performance orchestrated by Peterite Sivaraj with a fabulous display of kicking to go along with fast open rugby throughout the entire game where he totally dominated the game by over running the opponents with his spectacular footwork at will.
Both teams carried out a superb game by giving the crowd some anxious moment and got a value packed match for their money.
For the winning St. Peter’s the three tries were scored by prop forward Nikhil Yapa (one), scrum half Ravin Fernando (one) and Sivaraj (one). The three conversions and the two penalties were fired across by Sivaraj.
Prop Kavinda Amarakoon (one), hooker Pulasthi Dassanayaka (one) and winger Jehan Seelagama (one) scored the tries for St. Anthony’s. Full back Samuel Maduwantha put over two conversions and the two penalties.
Referee: Sarath Madugalle.
