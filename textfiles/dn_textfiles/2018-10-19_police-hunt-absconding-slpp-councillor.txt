Alleged molestation of schoolboy
Police hunt absconding SLPP councillor

Acting Matale Headquarters Inspector Lal Hettiarachchi said that a special police team had been deployed to arrest an Ukuwela urban councillor of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) who had allegedly molested a schoolboy.
The team has been deployed after a complaint was lodged with the Matale Police Children and Women Bureau. The child’s relatives had said that the crime had been committed at a funeral house in Guralwela.
Police said the suspect had fled the area after the complaint was made.
