Pathfinder confab on enhancing Indo-Lanka connectivity

The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of The Pathfinder Foundation, Carnegie India together with Vivekananda International Foundation in India conducted a conference in Colombo with the participation of leading academics, professionals, subject Matter Experts and scholars from both the countries seek to discuss six major areas of concept of connectivity.
Sectorial experts of the Indo Sri Lanka meet at the Colombo discussed opportunities and challenges for the better connectivity benefit for the communities.
Pathfinder Foundation Chairman Bernard Goonatilleke said that target this conference is to focus on three broad themes including past connectivity and the sources of decay, identifying the current possibilities and assessing the enduring obstacles and exploring ways to overcome them.
At the second stage of the project, specific sectors could be taken up for more detailed examination he adds.
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Collomboge, Director, Center for Indo Lanka initiative of Pathfinder Foundation brief in presentation, any effort to promote connectivity between the two countries must be understood by the ease of movement across the frontiers in the past and its deterioration in the second half of the 20th century due to the armed conflict and changing political dynamics.
Six major sectors covered with six sessions in this one day conference its included coastal shipping in the Bay of Bengal framework, multimodal surface and air links between Sri Lanka and Peninsular India, developing and promoting religious tourism, power grid connectivity and finally energy security through the strategic storage of hydrocarbons; resilient international telecom connectivity in the context of UN ESCAP’s vision of an Asia Pacific Information Superhighway. After the presentation participants comment with their views and experience how to do handle the issues better than in history.
Enhancing connectivity, which has been a subject of discussion in the SAARC and BIMSTEC context, has also been a major national priority for both India and Sri Lanka. Promoting internal, trans-border and regional connectivity have become an urgent imperative for both nations, as they seek to sustain their rapid economic growth into the coming decades.
Both Delhi and Colombo have rediscovered their geographic advantages and are determined to leverage these.
India is now acutely conscious of its geo-economics location at the cross-roads of Asia and the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lanka has begun to emphasize its Indian Ocean identity and wants to leverage its position as the maritime fulcrum of the trade routes in the Indo-Pacific littoral.
While past policies of self-reliance and the dynamic of local conflict devalued connectivity between the two nations, two and a half decades of economic liberalisation have compelled Delhi and Colombo to focus on privileging their physical proximity. Trade volumes have rapidly grown in recent years, and so have mutual investments.
The growing infrastructure linkages between the two countries are reflected in the fact that Colombo has become the second largest port (after Mumbai) for the movement of goods in and out of India.
Dr. C. Raja Maoha, director Carnegi, India who expert of foreign policy analysis said in his presentation Sri Lankan President three times and Prime Minister twice visited India.
‘‘Delhi and Colombo have signaled the political will to build on this interdependence and deepen connectivity between the two nations.” Captain Suren Ratwatte CEO, Sri Lankan Airlines said that air connectivity has excellent potential Indian travellers will be triple within two decades.”
With current infrastructure facility of Katunayake airport Sri Lankan can meet the challenge, we have understood there is potential market for both country he brief in his presentation.
