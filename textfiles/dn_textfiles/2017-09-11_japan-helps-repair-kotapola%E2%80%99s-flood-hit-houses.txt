Japan helps repair Kotapola’s flood-hit houses

The ceremony for repaired houses which were damaged by flood and landslides in May was held in Kotapola, Matara, in the presence of Japanese Embassy’s Deputy Head of Missions Koji Yagi, Kotapola Assistant Divisional Secretary Shanika I. Perera and PARCIC Project Manager Chisato Takahashi.
The monsoon torrential rain in May hit across the country and caused serious loss and damages in Ratnapura, Kalutara and Matara Districts. Especially in the Matara District, a large number of houses were damaged and the affected families were displaced to shelters.
In response to this situation, a Japanese NGO, PARCIC, had decided to implement this project with financial support of 30 million JPY (Approx. Rs. 42 million), from Japan Platform which was jointly established by NGOs, business communities and the Government of Japan.
About 150 families in 15 Grama Niladhari Divisions of the Matara District will benefit through rebuilding/repairing of 50 partially damaged houses, 100 kitchens and 25 toilets, providing construction material and skilled laborers.
In addition, non-food items such first-aid kits will be also provided to 200 families in this project. In addition to PARCIC, several other Japanese NGOs have been working on disaster relief projects in different areas to support the affected communities by the flood and landslides. The Government of Japan hopes goodwill of the people of Japan will contribute to the early recovery of livelihood in the affected areas.
