Sarva Integrated hosts another successful inspiration session with Michel Nugawela

Sarva Integrated concluded another successful ‘Inspiration Session’ for clients, friends and members of the marcom community, featuring revered Brand Consultant, Michel Nugawela. Titled “Consyoumer”, the session, which was held on the 24th of March, revolved around the importance of understanding the psyche of consumers, by better understanding ourselves.
Sarva ‘Inspiration Sessions’ have become a regular event at the agency that has consistently achieved stellar growth for clients, with installments every few months featuring respected personalities, including Management Consultant, Hilmy Cader and Crisis Communication Management Expert, Tyron. The sessions are designed to build synergy between members of the community and to establish a base for knowledge sharing. “I've attended the last two Inspiration Sessions at Sarva, and both times, I left feeling enlightened, and inspired. I can't wait for the next one.” reflected Rochelle de Silva, Director Marketing at The Central Hospital. Rajieve Fernando, Director of Audi Colombo, agreed and added “I believe knowledge-sharing within the industry is important to keep one another updated and inspired with what it takes to push the envelope and Sarva has managed to do just that.”
“A rising tide lifts all boats”, explained Managing Director Chrishantha Jayasinghe.
