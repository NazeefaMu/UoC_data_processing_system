Cabinet approves technological faculties for three universities

Three new technological faculties in the Kelaniya, Rajarata and Sabaragamuwa Universities and an Engineering Faculty at Sri Jayewardenepura University are to be set up under the government’s Technology Human Resource Development Project.
Cabinet this week approved the proposal put forward by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to obtain a loan of US$ 145 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project which is expected to cost a total of US$ 165 million. The government will invest the remaining US$ 20 million.
The Prime Minister, in his Cabinet paper, noted that this would “nurture a new breed of technology-oriented graduates equipped with market relevant skills and entrepreneurial spirit.”
The US$ 145 million ADB loan has been split into two packages, it is learnt. One would a USS 83.02 million loan from the Regular Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) of the ADB and the other would be a US$ 61.98 million loan from the concessional OCR of the ADB.
The first has a repayment period of 29 years, including an eight-year grace period, whilst the second has a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace period of five years and a two percent annual interest rate. The establishment of innovative technology learning and research environment, implementation of quality and industry-relevant higher technology education programmes, strengthened industry linkages and international collaborations, strengthened faculty management and supporting newly proposed higher education projects focusing on science, technology, engineering and mathematics are to be the main objectives of the project.
