Female lead for  ‘Aramm’


With Nayanthara taking the lead role in 'Aramm', we have a female lead playing the protagonist in a Tamil political drama, after a long time. The theatrical trailer assures yet another stunning performance from Nayanthara. The Lady Superstar, who plays a district collector in the film, tries to help commoners in a village in Tamil Nadu and saves them from the glitches of water scarcity.
In the directorial debut of Gopi Nainar, Nayanthara plays a simple yet powerful collector. Aramm is gearing up to release on November 10 and the star cast includes Ramesh and Vignesh of 'Kakka Muttai' fame in supporting roles. Ghibran has scored the music. In the meantime, Nayan also has a slew of films in her kitty including Sivakarthikeyan's 'Velaikkaran' and 'Imaikkaa Nodigal', which marks the debut of Bollywood actor and film maker Anurag Kashyap.
