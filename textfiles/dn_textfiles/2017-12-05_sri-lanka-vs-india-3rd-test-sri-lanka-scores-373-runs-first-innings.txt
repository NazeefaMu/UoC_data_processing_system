Sri Lanka vs. India 3rd Test: Sri Lanka scores 373 runs at first innings

 
The Sri Lankan team scored 373 runs at the first innings of the fourth day of the 3rd Test against India today.
India secured a 163-run first innings lead after taking remaining Sri Lankan wicket in the sixth over.
Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's captain, was the last man out, having extended his overnight 147 to his highest Test score of 164.
Chandimal added 30 for the last wicket with Lakshan Sandakan, who ended up unbeaten on 0 off 20 balls. The No. 11 was beaten multiple times by Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami, but defended stoutly when the line was on the stumps.
At the other end, Chandimal went for his shots, and picked up three fours in the morning, two of them with cuts and uppercuts. That shot, in the end, cost him his wicket, as he sliced Ishant straight to Shikhar Dhawan at third man.
