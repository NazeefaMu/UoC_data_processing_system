Charges for national IDs revised

The charges for registration and issuing identity cards have been revised from September 1.
The public is reminded that the receipt, obtained from the Divisional Secretariat of the Grama Niladhari Office after paying the fees with effect from September 1, should be affixed on the place assigned for that purpose on the application and forwarded to the Department for Registration of Persons. The fee to obtain the National Identity Card for the first time upon reaching 15 is Rs. 100. To obtain an amended duplicate of a National Identity Card, the fee is Rs. 250 and for obtaining a duplicate of a lost National Identity Card the fee is Rs. 500.
If a person is unable to pay the charges due to poverty, a certificate for exemption from paying the charges obtained from the Divisional Secretary should be sent along with the application.
More information from the Divisional Secretariat.
