Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA :
President to hold special discussion

President Maithripala Sirisena will hold a special discussion on the freshly-signed Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) next Tuesday (May 22), Secretary to the President Austin Fernando said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday, the Secretary said the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has also been invited to this meeting scheduled at 12.30 pm at the Presidential Secretariat.
He said the prevailing matters with regard to the FTA would be discussed at length at the meeting, which will be attended by all relevant parties and officials.
“I hope this meeting will pave the way to take the necessary decisions and resolve the existing problems,” he said in response to a journalist whether the FTA was in line with the National Trade Policy of the country. The Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement was signed on January 23 with the intention of enhancing economic ties and trade flows between the two countries.
The GMOA yesterday launched a token strike in protest of the FTA with Singapore.
