Football FANTASY

Hilton Colombo IL Ponte has been transformed into a football field during FIFA world cup with a revelling atmosphere, filled with scrumptious food stalls, international beverages, games and activities, competitions, live entertainment and a whole heap of fun.
The guests can watch the match on a giant screen while enjoying some great food. The daily draws and more prizes including the grand prize of two air tickets to Singapore inclusive of two nights’ accommodation for two on bed and breakfast will add to the excitement of the evenings. Daily news photographer Shan Rambukwella witnessed the happenings at the venue.
