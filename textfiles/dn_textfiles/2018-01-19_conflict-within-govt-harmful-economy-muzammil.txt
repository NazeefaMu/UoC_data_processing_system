Conflict within govt. harmful to economy: Muzammil

The conflict between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) factions in the government is harmful to the national economy as this would reduce foreign investment, said National Freedom Front (NFF) Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil yesterday.
He said the conflict between President Maithripala Sirisena-led faction and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe-led faction would lead the country to severe political instability.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the NFF party office in Pitakotte. Muzammil said the SLFP faction in the government attempts to win the impending local government election alone while the UNP attempts for the same. He added that this was nothing but a play that would last until February 10 and then they would go together.
He added that only the English copy of the report of the Presidential Commission on the Bond issue had been handed over to the Speaker and it cannot be presented to Parliament until the Sinhala and Tamil translations are handed over to the Speaker.
"So this matter cannot be taken up before Parliament soon," Muzammil said.
