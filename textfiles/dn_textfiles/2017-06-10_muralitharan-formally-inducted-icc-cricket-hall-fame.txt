Muralitharan formally inducted into ICC Cricket Hall of Fame

The most successful bowler in Tests and One Day Internationals, Muttiah Muralitharan was on Thursday formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame by ICC Chief Executive David Richardson during the innings break of the India versus Sri Lanka ICC Champions Trophy match at The Oval.
The retired Sri Lanka spin great was awarded the honour along with Arthur Morris, George Lohmann and Karen Rolton by fellow ICC Cricket Hall of Famers and members of the media.
He became the first player from Sri Lanka and the 83rd overall to be formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame when Mr. Richardson presented him with a commemorative framed cap.
Muralitharan: “It is a moment of great pride and honour to be receiving this award, especially from the ICC which is the ultimate any cricketer can aspire to achieve.
The induction during this prestigious ICC Champions Trophy makes it even more remarkable.
“I thank the ICC for making this possible because this is a moment I will cherish throughout life.”
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson: “Murali’s record speaks for itself.
His control of line, pace and length coupled with his ability to spin the ball prodigiously are legendary. Once he developed the “doosra” he became almost unplayable.
“A character popular with fellow players and fans alike, he not only helped raise the profile of Sri Lankan cricket but was a player people came out to watch the world over. I congratulate him on behalf of the ICC on being inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.”
