TODAY IS GOOD FRIDAY

Today is Good Friday where Christians throughout the world commemorate the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Good Friday is the culmination of a 40 day period of Lent where the faithful undergo penance and acts of mortification. It is also the period where the devout undergo repentance and renew their bonds with Christ.
