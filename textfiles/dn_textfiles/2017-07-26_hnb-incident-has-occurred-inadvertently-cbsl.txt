HNB incident has occurred inadvertently- CBSL

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issuing a statement on the Leakage of Customer Information by Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) says that a preliminary investigation was conducted by CBSL.
As per the information available at present, it appears that this incident had occurred inadvertently relating to certain banking information of 4,630 customers. It is also observed that this incident is attributable to internal lapses in managing and using customer information within HNB. Therefore, this subject is under further investigation by both HNB and CBSL.
Accordingly, interim supervisory measures have already been initiated to take action against those who are responsible for the incident in terms of legal provisions as well as relevant supervisory standards.
