‘NBRO certification needed for  all buildings in Colombo’

All buildings in Colombo which are over 25 years old have to be certified by the by National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) to check whether they are still stable in structure and do not pose a threat to the people,Irrigation and Water Resource Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said if there are any visible dangers,the owner will have to make the necessary repairs. However,if it cannot be repaired or renovated, the building will have to be demolished.
“We have identified several old buildings situated along the coastal line that need to be demolished to ensure people’s safety and protect other properties.
Minister Range Bandara further said that the designing of buildings giving prominence to safety to avoid any disasters in Sri Lanka is essential in the future.
“Structures used by the public like schools, hospitals, assembly halls, government buildings, commercial building and apartments should be constructed by taking the maximum safety precautions. Another important factor is that when high rise buildings are constructed, all safety precautions should be followed and adhered to,” the Minister said.
