All party consent to be taken to establish Sainthamaruthu PS - Minister Mustapha

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha Mustapha said the final decision to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu will be taken with the consent of all relevant political parties of that area.
Minister Faiszer Mustapha met Opposition Leader R. Sampathan, MP M.A Sumanthiran and representatives from other main political parties yesterday.
They discussed about the request to establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu.
The meeting was held at the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.
The Minister and the leaders of the political parties who were present decided to have another meeting on November 22 to discuss the matter further.
People from Sainthamaruthu have been demanding for a separate Pradeshiya sabha in Sainthamaruthu, from the Kalmunai Municipal Council since 1988. However, it gained momentum only after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised during his election campaign that he would establish a Pradeshiya Sabha in Sainthamaruthu.
Minister Mustapha said the President and the Prime Minister also insisted that a final decision regarding a separate local government authority for Sainthamarithu cannot be taken without the consent of all political parties in that area.
MP Maavai Senadhirajah and MP H.M.M Haris of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) were also present at the meeting.
