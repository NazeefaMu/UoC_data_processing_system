Railway unions to strike from Wednesday

Sri Lanka Railways trade unions have decided to launch an indefinite train strike from Wednesday August 29 midnight since discussions with relevant authorities failed to provide a viable solution to their grievances. Railway Trade Union Collective Co-Convenor Lal Ariyaratne said discussions held last Wednesday with President Maithripala Sirisena and government officials by trade union representatives including engine drivers, controllers, guards and station masters were unsuccessful.
“Even though, we had earlier planned to launch the strike from Wednesday midnight, we did not do so as it would affect rail commuters visiting Kandy for the ‘Dalada Perahera’ and students facing the Advanced level examination.
We decided to resume our trade union action from next Wednesday (29) midnight.
