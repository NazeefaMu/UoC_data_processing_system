Current priorities of trade unions: Personal and political issues

When I was involved in trade union activities, I held discussions with former Presidents and was able to solve issues. Former Presidents respected doctors.They were late Presidents such as J. R. Jayewardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the discussions that were held between trade union leaders and heads of state were entirely different from today. Current trade unions give priority to personal problems and political issues.
He was addressing the second Annual General Meeting of the Graded Medical Officers' Union held at the SLFI in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that he accepted the invitation extended to him by the Graded Medical Officers' Union, as it was good to see that truth could be informed even to a part of the doctors by taking part in the event. The salaries paid to doctors and engineers are not adequate. Doctors' salaries should be increased and by taking this step, we could stop them leaving the country.
"I will support doctors to get their privileges back and solve their salary anomalies. I always dedicate myself to meet the demands presented by professionals, even though they criticize me.
Quarters also would be provided to doctors before the end of next month, using foreign investments. Now doctors' transfers are expedited by the Public Service Commission and therefore there would be no issues concerning them.
