Bribery case: Mahagamage denied bail

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake denied bail for former Import and Export Controller Mahagamage Gamini who was remanded for allegedly soliciting a bribe of Rs.200,000 from a businessman, yesterday.
The Colombo Chief Magistrate said that the Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the suspect had previously submitted five special circumstances for granting bail, adding that no such circumstance was present.
Gamini had allegedly solicited a bribe from a businessman in Weligama, to provide a report containing recommendations necessary to import two vehicles from Japan.
The magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to submit a progress report, while remanding the suspect until September 4.
