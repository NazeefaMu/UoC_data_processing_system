Running in the family

To be an offspring of a living legend is a rare gift bestowed by destiny on an individual.
Jayantha Rathnayake being Dr Victor Rathnayake’s first child responsibly takes forward many imaginative attributes of his bloodline.
Jayantha has proved his mettle in the sphere as a resourceful music composer, music director and a singer. Jayantha Rathnayake celebrated his 50th birthday recently amidst a gathering of close associates in private and professional spheres. On the verge of releasing a couple of innovative new songs Jayantha engaged in an interview with the Daily News T&C.
Q: Tell me about your school days.
Even when schooling, my passion was towards music. This may be because we had a musical background at home. My parents however wanted me to pursue studies in medicine. I still wonder, what would have been the reason for that. My peers and teachers appreciated my works in music at school events such as concerts.
Being Victor Rathnayake’s son brought me many privileges even during school days.
Q: What was your mother Chithra’s contribution towards the family?
With his family 
My mother was my guardian angel. She actually shaped me to live like Victor Rathnayake’s eldest son, respecting father’s reputation as a senior and popular artiste.
Her priority however was looking after my father not only as a wife but also like a mother.
She was reluctantly compelled to limit the freedom of her children to leave room for my father to indulge in his creative works.
When we schooled my father who was in the helm of his career was taking his SA one-man concert to the nook and corners of the country.
When he is at home mother used to give priority to his leisure while offering hospitality to his peers.
We were instructed to maintain silence at home. We were obedient children though our freedom was compromised.
Q: After leaving school you lead the band Rajantha Miyasiya and joined Shakthi band which became Siha Shakthi eventually.
I had the privilege of associating with seniors like Ananda Perera, Anthony Surendra, Sangeeth Wickramasinghe and Jayantha Gallage while contributing to Shakthi and Siha Shakthi as a musician.
These individuals were unique. They had radical approach to contemporary music and their creations were innovative. The fans loved this music.
Q: SA one-man concert was the most preferred one of a kind concert. The song Podi Kumarihamiye was sung at the concert with just two musical instruments, Tabla and Harmonium. You became the successor to Alien de Zoysa to play the Harmonium for this song in SA.
I was schooling when I played Melodica for the two songs, Thani Wennata Mage Lowe and Thuru Lapalu Lathawo in the SA concert.
I played the Harmonium part of Podi Kumarihamiye with the Melodica initially as a student. Eventually I was groomed to play the Harmonium for the song. That was a memorable experience for me. But I could never reach the heights of Alien de Zoysa to play the instrument for that song. He was a maestro of the instrument. Everytime he played it, he added value to his performance.
Expert musician D D Gunesena too played the Harmonium for the song from time to time.
Q: What were your other experiences with the SA concert?
Though my father sang in this solo concert, it was a family event for us. My mother, two sisters, myself and my younger brother did ground work for each show with much enthusiasm. Eventually I was offered to be on the stage as a musician. I was privileged to associate with greats like M K Rocksamy, Edgar Perera, Alien de Zoysa, Dr Rohana Weerasinghe and Wijeratne Ranatunga.
That was a self-learning process for me. Merely watching these experts indulging in music was like attending a university.
They were true masters. Every time they played instruments in SA they used to bring out some innovation and my father liked it.
In time I became the event manager and overall music director of SA concert with my father’s blessings. My sisters Chandani (demised), Manjula and my little brother Lelum too joined as chorus singers.
Q: You are a resourceful music composer and a singer. People say you have a touch of Victor Rathnayake in your creations.
Premakeerthi de Alwis once gave me some lyrics and told me to come up with a tune for my father to sing in ‘Aradhana Swara Dehena’ radio program. I was just 12 at that time. However I managed to create a melody and my father sang this song live in the programme.
After some years I recorded a few original songs. A patriotic song like Ruwan Bima and a set of romantic songs for which I have composed music and recorded were in my first CD.
Many FM channels do not air songs of the genre I follow. My contemporaries’ too are exposed to this vicious cycle.
I have recorded some new songs recently and give them to radio channels.
I had the opportunity to contribute to SLRC’s children’s programmes with melodies. The late Titus Thotawatte, Somapala Rathnayake (Victor’s younger brother) and Athula Ransirilal supported me. At present I mostly contribute to corporate events, weddings and parties while pursuing a career as a music director.
