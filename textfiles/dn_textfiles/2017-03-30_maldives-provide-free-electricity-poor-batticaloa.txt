Maldives to provide free electricity for poor in Batticaloa

Sri Lanka Hira Foundation signed an agreement with the company named Renewable Energy Maldives to offer electricity free connection to those who live under poverty line in Batticaloa District.
The agreement was signed between M.L.A.M.Hisbullah, State Minister of Resettlement and Rehabilitation and the President of Hira Foundation with the President of Renewable Energy Maldives Ibraheem Nasheed.
People who need electricity and live under poverty line will be identified and offered solar panels to each house in Batticaloa District. The identification will be carried under Hira Foundation. The houses can also get electricity from the Solar Panels.
Hisbullah further said that this project is going to be implemented under the eradication of Poverty Project carried out by Hira Foundation. This project has to be implemented soon in the Batticaloa District. Through this project, people can get electricity free of charge and it would be a way of earning money for their needs every month.
