Gang kidnaps girl

A six-member gang had assaulted the father of a 17-year-old girl from Walewatta, Ambalanthota and kidnapped the girl.
Wasantha Muthumala lodged a complaint with the Ambalanthota Police that six people had broken the front door of his house and threatened them with a pistol. Another gang member had threatened his elder daughter with a knife. The gang then broke open the door of his other daughter M.P.Nipuni Wathsani’s room and forcibly took her away.
He said the crime was committed around 2.30 am yesterday. Muthumala said he was alerted when he heard a commotion in the sitting room of his house.
