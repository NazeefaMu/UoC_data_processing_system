Cabinet paper to consider bus fare hike

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Transport Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe told the Daily News that he would soon forward a Cabinet paper to consider the increase in bus fares with the recent rise in fuel prices.
The matter was to be discussed with the National Transport Commission yesterday. Thereafter, the decision would be forwarded to the Cabinet to decide on the rate.
“Some Private Bus Owners’ Associations and their trade unions are planning to launch a bus strike over the issue. But I request them not to take such measures in a hurry and allow the government to take reasonable solutions to it. Do not put commuters in trouble. Be sympathetic towards them,” requested Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
