Students compete in Festival of Glory

One hundred and thirty-five students from around Colombo competed in the Festival of Glory, a performance competition focused on bridging Sri Lankan culture and the English language, recently.
The festival was hosted at the New Town Hall in Colombo. Cleon Academy (the organising body) Founder Panthea Goonetillake said the competition was meant to inspire confidence in every performer.
“It takes courage just to walk up those steps,” she said, “The goal is to fulfil your dreams and become a better person.”
The students, who ranged from age 4 to 20, competed in categories such as dance, song, speech, and dramatic reading. They were judged by two Irish drama specialists with experience in international competitions.
The top scorers from Colombo, Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya, and Kalutara are to compete in a final competition at the New Town Hall on March 3.
