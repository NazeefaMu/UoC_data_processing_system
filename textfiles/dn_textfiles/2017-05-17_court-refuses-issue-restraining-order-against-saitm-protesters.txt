Court refuses to issue restraining order against SAITM protesters

 
Colombo Additional Magistrate Shanima Wijebandara turned down a request made by Peliyagoda Police today to issue a restraining order preventing protest organisers from organising a street protest that was to be passed through Kelaniya area today against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The Additional Magistrate observed that the Police can use minimum power in accordance with Police Ordinance in an event of causing any disturbance to the public. 
Meanwhile, Colombo Chief Magistrate's court has issued an order preventing the protesters being nuisance to the public, during a street protest that was to be held in Colombo city against the SAITM. 
Issuing this order in terms of section 106 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara observed that this order would not hamper any attempts by the protesters to engage in a peaceful protest without causing any disturbance to the public.
