Drought parches Ampara

The Ampara District is experiencing a severe drought.
District Disaster Management Unit Assistant Director A.S.M. Ziyath said that over 39,000 people of Pathiyathalawa, Alayadivembu, Mahaoya, Thirukovil, Thambiluvil, Central Camp, Navithanveli, Damana, Lahugala and Pottuvil were affected severely with the drought. District Secretary D.M.L Bandaranayke said that drinking water is provided for 64 Grama Niladhari Divisions with bowsers.
People in several areas protest on main roads demanding water. They complain the water that they are given is inadequate even to quest their thirst.
Residents of Thandiayadi, Sangamankandy, Umiri,Nerupuram, Thangavelayuthapuram, Kanchirankudah, Manadana and Sagamam carried placards along the main road demanding a solution.
They handed over a memorandum to MP Kaveenthran Kodeeswaran, Divisional Secretary S. Jergarajan and Thirukovil Predeshya Saba Chairman I.V. Kamalarajan.
Many lament that they cannot engage in their livelihoods without water.
The Irrigation Department sources said paddy farmers cultivated only 124,000 acres for the Yala season because they do not get sufficient water even though they could cultivate 36,000 acres if they had enough water.
