David Stanford elected as CIMA President

David Stanford FCMA CGMA has been elected as 84th president of The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA).
On his new appointment, Stanford said: “I am privileged to become CIMA President at such a key time in our history. CIMA joining forces with the AICPA will take accounting to a new and dynamic level, by providing highly-skilled accountants with the knowledge, insight and drive to meet the demands of today and the challenges of tomorrow. I strongly believe the work of the new Association, such as our ongoing commitment to members’ training and employability, will have a huge and positive impact on the profession.”
Over the course of a one-year term, he will be responsible for overseeing the governance of CIMA around the world and promoting management accounting and the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation.
Stanford has built up a 50-year career that included a number of senior finance roles in industries like electronics and retail.
Leaving school at 16, he wanted to be a fashion buyer, but became a cost clerk for rubber goods manufacturer Uniroyal in Edinburgh.
Starting his CIMA studies in Scotland, Stanford qualified as a management accountant in 1973, after moving to Manchester with his family.
Stanford has given a lot back to CIMA, serving on its governing council and several local, regional and global committees.
