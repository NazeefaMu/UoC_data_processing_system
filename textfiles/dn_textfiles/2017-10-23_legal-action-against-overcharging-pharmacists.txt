Legal action against overcharging pharmacists

Legal action will be taken against the pharmacies that do not sell drugs at recommended prices under the article 132 of National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act number five of 2015, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at the Prof. Senaka Bibile Commemoration held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said the Health Ministry reduced prices of 48 essential and commonly used drugs one year ago. The drugs used for diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and gastritis are among them.
He said drugs required for the country it would produce by the end of 2019 and agreements have already been signed in this regard with 38 drug manufacturing companies.
The Chinese Government will provide a drug quality testing laboratory for the NMRA soon. After that all drugs would be prescribed in their generic names and prescribing drugs in their brand names will be banned, the Minister said.
