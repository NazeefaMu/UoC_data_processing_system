Rathupaswela shooting: Brigadier Anura Deshapriya arrested by CID

 
Criminal Investigation Division (CID) arrested Brigadier Anura Deshapriya Gunewardana today for being involved in the shooting incident in Ratupaswela.
The CID arrested three army personnel on March 24 in connection with the shooting.
On April 3, Counsel Jayantha Dehiattage, who appeared for the aggrieved party, submitted that the suspects arrested on the incident were officers of lower ranks, and prayed that the CID be ordered to arrest the higher-ranking officers who issued the command to open fire.
