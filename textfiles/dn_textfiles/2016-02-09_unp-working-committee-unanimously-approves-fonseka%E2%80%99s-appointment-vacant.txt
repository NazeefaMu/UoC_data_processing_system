The United National Party Working Committee unanimously approved the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for the Parliamentary seat which fell vacant with the demise of Lands Minister M.K.A.D.S Gunawardena.
According to UNP Acting General Secretary and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Working Committee unanimously approved Field Marshal Fonseka for the vacant Parliamentary seat at the Working Committee meeting held yesterday evening.
