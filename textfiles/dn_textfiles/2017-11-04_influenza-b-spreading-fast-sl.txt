Influenza B spreading fast in SL

Influenza B virus is spreading fast in Sri Lanka currently, a Consultant Virologist attached to the National Influenza Centre of the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha, told the Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Jayamaha, a seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and runny nose.
Cough could be severe and can last up to two or more weeks. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention.
The incubation period is about two days, he said. Seasonal influenza spreads easily and can sweep through schools, nursing homes, businesses or towns.
When an infected person coughs, infected droplets get into the air and another person can breathe them in and be exposed.
The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses, he said. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, and wash their hands regularly, he added.
