Malik - 25 years with Kandy SC

Today, Kandy Sports Club is known as the cradle of rugby, it is said that Kandy SC takes to rugby like a duck takes to water. It also has a long and proud history and the man who has made a significant contribution to the game at this club is none other than Malik Samarawickrema who will be completing 25 years of dedicated service. When the history of Kandy Sports Club rugby is recorded, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will stand out as one of the greatest administrators of the club and Sri Lanka rugby.
His contribution to the club should be weighed in gold. It was he who was behind to see members of the club all working together to help the sport become a success. Malik ventured into areas where no other man had gone to bring Kandy SC to where it is today. He was a listener, mentor and father figure to players who will always cherish his contribution. If not for Malik, rugby would have suffered the same fate as cricket, football and hockey which now lies in the funeral parlor at club level. Malik startedhis rugby at Royal College as a scrum half from 1966 to 1968.
He also played for Low Country team in the Capper Cup game against Up-Country and was a member of the Sri Lanka President’s XV before hanging up his boots in 1977. Even after moving out from national administration, Malik played his part in inaugurating the Singer SriLankan Airlines International Sevens for ten years. Kandy SC has done well at rugby purely due to this man’s efforts and support.
Kandy’s sportsmen and women
Successful sportsmen and sportswomen from Kandy can be proud of their achievements. This was possible due to the keenness and the backing they got at school level from parents, school authorities and coaches.

What Kandy requires now is the backing from the Sports Minister to uplift sports at club level. Kandy also lacks a proper ground with all facilities. Many MP’s and ministers have come and gone, but nothing has happened for sports.
