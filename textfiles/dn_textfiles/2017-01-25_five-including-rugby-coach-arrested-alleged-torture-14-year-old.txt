Five including rugby coach arrested for alleged torture of 14-year-old

Dematagoda Police investigating a complaint of torture made by a 14-year-old schoolboy attached to a Grade 10 class of a school in Dematagoda have taken five people into custody in this connection  including four schoolboys and teacher of the school who functions as the Rugby coach. The boy in his complaint said while he was engaged in Badminton training sessions the rugby coach insisted that he should take up rugger and handed him over to four boys involved in rugger. The boys took him to a room and forcibly hung him on a cross bar and ordered him to swing. When he failed to do it the four boys assaulted him with several clubs.
Police said the five suspects were due to be produced before the Hulftsdorp Magistrate yesterday.
