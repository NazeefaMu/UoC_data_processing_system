Amalians enjoy the joys of football

Amal International School has relaunched indoor and outdoor football as an official sport in the school extra-curriculum. As an inaugural event the school organised a Futsal tournament for under 9, 11, 13 and 15 categories at Futsal World, Maradana. Amalians were privileged to share their joy among their fellow students at this event.
