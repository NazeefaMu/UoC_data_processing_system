Met Gala: Katy Perry attracts criticism for John Galliano dress

 
Katy Perry has attracted criticism for wearing a Maison Margiela dress by John Galliano to the Artisanal Met Gala. 
As co-chair of the event it was expected that Perry would wear a striking design, but some fans have taken issue with the man behind it.
Galliano was sacked by Christian Dior in 2011 for "odious behaviour", after being arrested over a video which showed him making racist and anti-Semitic insults at a bar in Paris. 
In September 2011 he was sentenced to pay a fine after being found guilty of making anti-Semitic remarks. He attributed his behaviour to alcohol addiction and sought rehab treatment. 
In 2013, for the first interview given since the incident, Galliano said: "I am able to create. I am ready to create... [and] I hope through my atonement I'll be given a second chance."
While he has been welcomed back to the industry by several insiders, his role in such a high profile event has caused controversy.
