Mainstream peace- building methods: Should they be questioned?

There is no magic bullet for sustainable peace and community development. Contemporary, western-oriented peace-building approaches are not sustainably working with local entities. This article questions the mainstream, western-oriented peace pedagogy.
We all know that human society is complex and it has great capacity to change and adapt. Therefore, a linear reductive approach is not satisfactory to understand complex systems. To understand the chaotic system, we need a non-linear approach. Social entities are interconnected in a chaotic way. The movement of one entity of the complex system may impact upon two or more or whole entities of the system. Therefore, western reductive conflict resolution methods, which mostly privilege reductive approaches, may bring complications or dangers to the social fabric.
The human body is a 'complex adaptive system'. A complex adaptive system is a collection of individual agents with freedom to act in ways that are not always totally predictable, and whose actions are interconnected so that one action changes the context for other agents. Complex systems should be defined carefully to understand the connection among all entities. Reductionism defines entities as 'whole is the sum of all the parts'.
However, in a biological perspective 'sum of all the parts may be much more or much less than the whole once all these individual parts start to interact often in unpredictable ways'. It is not to say that in order to understand complex social systems, reductionism is completely useless. Rather, to understand complex systems, a reductive approach is insufficient. Using inadequate approaches to understand complexities may lead to serious consequences. Hence, reductionism is not sufficient to analyze social conflicts. Reductionism is not an appropriate approach to understand complex systems.
Reductionism
Reductionism is an eliminative approach to understand complexities. The reductive approach is less complex but more logical. A popular example is the broken clock example: a broken clock can be fixed in a point-by-point reductive way. Simply, each part is fixed in an order based on the argument of 'whole is the sum of all the parts'. The reductive approach works with fixing clocks.
The reductive approach is also applied to working with live entities. This is evident in the field of medicine. Most medical treatments are based on 'specific molecular pathways'. For example, if high blood glucose levels cause morbidity in patients with diabetes, then control of those levels should return the system to normal and the patient's health problems should disappear. However, in a recent study, this strategy of more intensive glucose control resulted in increased risk of death. H. Q. Hendry questions "why do unexpected consequences occur after years of treatment? More simply, does the treatment that addresses a specific disease-related component harm the individual as a whole?"
Hendry argues that the reductive way of medical treatment for complex systems cause complex challenges. It is not only problematic with the complex human system.
Reductive method is also problematic with ecological systems. For example, how can we find why clouds do not rain all the time? We cannot apply reductive knowledge to that complex system. We can divide clouds part by part in "specific molecular pathways" to investigate. But we cannot reconstruct clouds in the same way.
If the system is sufficiently complex, it may not be practical or perhaps even possible to know the details of each local interaction. Complexities should be understood not as single entities but as behaviour of the system as a whole.
Thus western reductionism is inadequate to understand complex non-linear systems. It would require a whole different explanatory system to understand complexities. Society is a complex system."To understand the complex society, social scientists tried to find a non-linear concept that has explanatory value of understanding social systems" (Daniel J. Svyantek).
Complex systems
Protracted social conflicts are examples of complex social systems. But the prevalent practices in the field tried to solve complex social conflicts using reductive approaches: for example, finding root causes of conflict in reductive eliminative ways.
We have seen in the past decades that killing humans one by one cannot bring sustainable solution for conflicts. Most conflicts ended up with enhanced complexities. The western liner reductive way of thinking dominates conflict resolution and peace-making. Therefore, the notion of mainstream conflict resolution is based on reductionist approaches.
Revolutionarily, Holland brings the idea of complex adaptive systems. He point outs that immune systems and ecosystems share certain properties that make them useful to consider them as instances of a class of phenomena that he terms complex adaptive systems. It is spreading into anthropological thought such as society, culture and politics.
Initially, the idea of complex adaptive systems tends to be limited to the areas of mathematics and biology. Later on the notion of complex adaptive system moved to the arena of social science. Systems-oriented social thinker Walter Buckley had already been using the phrase "complex adaptive system" as early as 1968. Later on W. Buckley further develops the concept and argues: "Complex adaptive systems are open systems in intimate interchange with an environment characterized by a great deal of shifting varieties" and he also says that society is a complex adaptive system. Buckley mentioned about the society and the adaptive systems and he also argued that the society is a complex adaptive system. C. S. Holing also comes up with idea of complex adaptive systems. If the living society is a complex system, how can we understand the elements of this society? Can the reductive approach be used to understand the complexities?
Most modern conflict mapping systems and solutions are designed in a reductive linear way. To understand complex systems, we need look into the system through a chaotic way. Chaos is not a modern or a totally western concept.
The concept of chaos can be traced back to the 18th century in western philosophy. But the concept of chaos can be seen in classical Buddhism in the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. The concept of chaos theory takes its root in the study of nonlinear dynamic systems.
The basic concept of chaos, which is "Stability of Instability" is similar to the Buddhist concepts of Anichcha/ Anicca. Anichach is a part of the three marks of existence in Buddhist philosophy. Anichcha comes from Sanskrit meaning 'insatiability'. Chaos paradigm is a powerful instrument to get from natural science to use as a tool to understand 'nonlinear dynamic conflicts'. I consider the elements of nonlinear dynamic conflicts similar to 'Properties of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems' as described by R. A. Thietart and B. Forgues. Time-dependent variables are not always linear in protracted social conflicts. The system of conflict is directed by negative feedback and positive feedback, which support to keep the conflict system at a point of 'equilibrium'.
Protracted social conflicts are more chaotic. Small change of one entity can be multiplied to impact to the whole conflict. Hence, a small change can lead to dramatically different paradigm shifts. One entity can impact two or thousand or more entities. Social systems work in a chaotic way and not in a linear way.
