Maternity ward opened

A new maternity ward at the Dambadeniya Government Hospital in Kurunegala was opened recently.
The ward was built at a cost of Rs. 12 million funded by Incumbent of Siri Sasanaramaya Temple, Pallegama, Venerable Galahitiyawe Vijitha Thera.
“Several doctors of this hospital asked me to help to put up a maternity ward as many pregnant mothers who seek medical treatment here undergo much inconvenience due to non-availability of adequate facilities.
That is why I thought of building this ward for the benefit of mothers of all faiths and all communities,” the Thera said, speaking at the opening ceremony of the ward.
The ward was opened by Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
