Eight nations for U23 Emerging Cup

Youth cricketers from eight Asian countries will be seen in action in the under-23 Emerging Cup Tournament conducted by the Asia Cricket Council (ACC) in Bangladesh next month. According to the SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala, the Council made the decision during its recent meeting. ACC hopes to make the tournament an annual affair and Sumathipala said those who excel in this tournament will get the chance to qualify for the ‘A’ team and then to the National side.
Youth tournaments of this nature will greatly helpful to produce substitutes for the national team, he said. – FM
