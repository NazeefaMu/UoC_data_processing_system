Podujana Peramuna rally overcast by unruly crowd

The maiden election rally of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna was held at Salgado grounds in Anuradhapura under the patronage of Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the participation of parliamentarians belonging to the Joint Opposition group, on November 12 afternoon.
People attending the rally, brought from all parts of the country in about 470 buses and lorries, created ugly scenes in the Anuradhapura city shouting and casting obscene remarks to passers-by. The unruly behaviour of most people brought for the rally were captured by some of the photographers who covered the event.
One Rajapaksa loyalist fallen in front of the War Hero Memorial in Anuradhapura after taking one too many, was seen muttering filth while another intoxicated youth was seen fast asleep on the ground, oblivious to the goings on in the rally.
Shortly before the rally started, there was a mini battle between a group of women and a group of men, with the women beating men with umbrellas until they were broken.
An ambulance carrying a critical patient from a rural hospital to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital was held up on the main road opposite the Salgado grounds.
