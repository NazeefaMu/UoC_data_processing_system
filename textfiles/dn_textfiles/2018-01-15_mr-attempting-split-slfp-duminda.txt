MR attempting to split SLFP: Duminda

SLFP General Secretary, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of attempting to divide the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
In a discussion with the Daily News the Minister said Rajapaksa was trying to divide the SLFP for petty political gain.
He urged voters and political representatives of the SLFP not to be fooled by canards spread by some politician close to the former President.
“The Political conduct of the former President is jeopardising the SLFP by splitting it to fragments,” he said.
"The leader of 'Pohottuwa" party G.L. Peris, supposed to be a renowned expert in law, is not competent even to prepare a nomination paper correctly. Could there be any political future or stability for such a party?” he asked.
He said the SLPP could not hoodwink the people and the SLFP would give a fitting reply on the election day.
He noted that the Rajapaksa and his supporters were hindering efforts to bring in new constitutional amendments and were spreading falsehoods in an attempt to scuttle the necessary changes from coming into effect. Dissanayake said that after a lapse at 26 years, today the SLFP was contesting under the Hand symbol with the UPFA. He said those who follow Bandaranaike policies should follow the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLFP General Secretary warned that any member of the party working against the party’s interest will be dealt with legally .
“No SLFPer has the right to work against the mother party, having got energised politically from the SLFP and it is totally wrong ethically," he said.
The Minister said the SLFP would win 18 Pradeshiya Sabhas and one Municipal Council.
The government has so far spent Rs. 1,500 million on the Anuradhapura District to provide it with drought relief and will continue to do so, the Minister said.
