Point of view
Domestic equities continued its relatively positive momentum for the 3rd consecutive week, gaining ~10 points W-o-W as the Central Bank held policy rates steady for the 4th time this year (since its policy rate hike in Mar’17).
Despite a 15 point loss on the Index early in the week, the benchmark ASPI recovered ~26 points over the remainder of the week to close at 6430-levels. Greater certainty since Parliament passed the new inland revenue bill in early September has helped equity markets rebound marginally, with the Index gaining ~1.2% (~76 points) since September 7th when the bill was passed.
The monthly return on the Index has consequently been positive in September, with the Index gaining 0.74% over the month relative to the losses of 3.7% recorded in August and loss of 1.6% recorded in July.
Despite the relatively positive index performance, market activity remained largely dull over the week, with average daily turnover levels falling to Rs.0.73Bn over the week, down ~18% from last week although crossings continued to account for 24% of total market turnover yet again this week.
Average daily turnover levels for the year have been Rs. 0.91Bn, and Rs,0.86Bn when excluding the significant transaction in Singer when Hayley’s acquisition of a 61.7% stake in Singer helped push up daily average turnover to Rs. 11Bn (the highest since Dec 2016).
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to remain net equity buyers over the week albeit at a lower Rs. 0.27Bn (cf. Rs. 0.87Bn last week). Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely flat as sentiment and activity remains broadly similar to that of this week.
External sector continues to improve in July
The Central Bank on Tuesday held rates steady for the 4th consecutive time this year, citing expectations that inflation levels will moderate over the remainder of the year while private credit growth would moderate amid the prevailing high nominal and real interest rates in domestic markets.

The CBSL was also positive on the country’s external front, adding that the increased flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate has eased pressure in the domestic FX markets and resulted in a cumulative depreciation (till Sept 22) of 2% (against the USD) cf. the 3.8% depreciation recorded in 2016. Sri Lanka’s external sector continued to improve in July, amid increased exports and inflows to the financial account.
Despite the trade deficit widening over the month, export earnings rose for the 5th consecutive month. Inflows to the financial account meanwhile continued to strengthen amid net inflows to the G-sec, long term loans to the government, continued portfolio investment inflows to the CSE and receipt of the 3rd tranche of the IMF EFF facility. Consequently.
The country’s Balance-of-Payments during the first seven months of 2017, recorded a surplus of $1,448.5Mn compared to a surplus of $356.0Mn recorded in the corresponding period of 2016. Sri Lanka’s gross official reserves as at end July 2017 meanwhile, amounted to $6.7Bn, equivalent to 3.9 months of imports, while total foreign assets amounted to $9.0Bn which is equivalent to 5.3 months of imports.
