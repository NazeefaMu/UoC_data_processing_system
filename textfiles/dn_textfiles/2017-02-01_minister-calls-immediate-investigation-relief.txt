Minister calls for immediate investigation, relief

Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne had instructed Labour Commissioner General Chandani Amaratunga to investigate into the recent death of a miner inside the Bogala Graphite Mine and to take all necessary action.
Amaratunga said she had sent the Avissawella Assistant Labour Commissioner General to the mine as soon as the incident had occurred. The management had explained to the Assistant Commissioner General the measures they would take, she said.
The management had promised the dependents Rs. 3 million insurance, and they would receive his monthly salary until the day of his scheduled retirement. His family can reside at the official quarters of the miner as well, he said.
Amaratunga said the department had sent an officer from its Engineering section to evaluate the compensation needed for the miner’s family.
The deceased, Pradeep Kumara (42), was a resident of Arukgammana. He had started work at the mine in 1996. On January 28, the 350 ft deep tunnel he was walking through collapsed, crushing him to death.
