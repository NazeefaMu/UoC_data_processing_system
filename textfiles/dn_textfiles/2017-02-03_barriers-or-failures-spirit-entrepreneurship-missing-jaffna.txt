Barriers or failures : Is the spirit of entrepreneurship missing in Jaffna?

It is one of the biggest trade fairs to come to Jaffna. Over 60,000 people have visited the 350 stalls in the three days the Jaffna International Trade Fair was held last week. The crowds thronged the stalls, admiring the merchandise and indulging on all the food stalls, few however have made use of the opportunity to build trade links and improve their businesses. The answer is simple- there are few entrepreneurs left to invest.

The Trade Fair held in partnership with the Associated Chamber of Commerce (ASSOCHAM) brought in 65 Indian companies to look at the possibility of tying up with Jaffna based entrepreneurs, but many left disappointed.
“This is the first time India is taking part in the fair on such a scale,” said D. S. Rajora, one of the organisers from ASSOCHAM. He was optimistic with the potential for trade in the region and said Indian companies which had been limited to Colombo were willing to do business directly with Jaffna.
Rajora has suggested that the Jaffna Chambers help create a more entrepreneurial environment and build a solid base in Jaffna, “If they do that, we can ensure whoever comes to Colombo will also visit Jaffna.” With very local industries to invest in, the companies have been limited to appointing their agents or distributors to sell their goods.
Indian businesses who are looking for a long term market for their goods are keen on seeing local industries develop but as Goyum Screw Press, Director (Marketing International), Harish Singla puts it, “The spirit of entrepreneurship is missing” in Jaffna.

They also found out that most businesses in Jaffna were run by traders and not entrepreneurs. “Most source their business from Colombo. The exporters are also from Colombo. The local agent has no decision making power,” said Amandeep Azad from Azad Engineering company and queried as to why the local man made no effort to cut out the middleman.
The answer, according to Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yalpanam (CCIY), K. Vignesh lay in the fact that airports and ports in Colombo were controlled by exporters from Colombo. “It is easier to sell to the middlemen from here. If we have an airport in Jaffna, we can break that dependence,” he said and added, “Why should we go 400km to export it?”
The excruciating 8-13 hour journey to Colombo or to the nearest functioning port or airport simply added to the list of reasons as to why it is hard to get business moving in Jaffna.
“The potential for joint investments in various fields are limited due to logistical issues. The government of Sri Lanka has to address this,” said Rajora and he suggested that at least the ferry service from Thalaimanar be opened to make goods transportation from India faster.
Azad quipped that the option of opening up Palali Airport would also make things easier, “If that is opened, we would take just five hours to set up rather than eight,” he said.
Rajneesh Mehrish who sells medical equipment added, “If the government wants to develop Jaffna, they have to take measures to connect it with India better. It is too far to come from Colombo, we are wasting time. Connectivity with India must be smooth.”
The call for greater connectivity with India is not a new request and many have advocated for proposals such as the building of a road to opening up Kankesanthurai (KKS) Port and Palali Airport to make it easier to trade with Jaffna.
The Indian remarks are echoed by Vignesh, “We have asked the government to open up Palali and KKS. This is not a new concept, it was always there. They should at least open it up for domestic freight,” he said.
At present however, only Sri Lankan Air Force flights which operate from Palali Airport and while Indian companies and other local private companies have been called to apply, Vigensh pointed out that the landing and taking off fees were too high for commercial cargo to operate in.
As the crowds concentrate around jewellery and food stalls, Azad has had very little business. The small scale agricultural machines he was here to sell have not had much of a market. He blamed the lack of purchasing power amongst the local populace for the low sales.
“We see that coconut in Jaffna is Rs 34 but in Colombo it is Rs 44. They send the coconuts to Colombo, where it is processed into oil and sent back to Jaffna at a much higher price. We must follow the Chinese concept of making the factory where the source is,” observed Azad.
“People want small machines, it is a lucrative market but few here have the purchasing power for it. There needs to be micro level financing for the industry to grow at a much faster pace,” he added.
Financing and micro financing in particular is not the problem in Jaffna. Vignesh pointed out that over 350 finance companies were catering to a population of 650,000 in Jaffna.
Dr. Muttukrishna Sarvananthan in his research paper, ‘The Pains of Labor in the Post-Civil War Development in the City of Jaffna, Northern Province, Sri Lanka’ highlighted that the banking density was highest in the Northern Province among the nine provinces in the country. He explained that there was an ‘over-supply of banking services’ along with high levels of indebtedness among the Northern population.
Vignesh in turn highlighted that most of these companies concentrated on providing finance to buy commercial goods rather than investing in businesses and industry, “We have also found that accessing government financial aid has not been easy and that has limited growth,” he said.
Where is Jaffna’s economy headed?
Dr. Sarvananthan’s research showed that “The Provincial GDP of the Northern Province had grown remarkably in 2010 and 2011 but decelerated in 2012 and 2013 after the end of the civil war in 2009” (statistics only available up to 2013)”.
“This immediate spurt in growth fueled by pent-up demand for consumer goods and services in the Northern Province reflects the Eastern Province where the provincial economy recorded 33% growth in 2008 (the year after the end of the civil war in the East in 2007) and then decelerated in the subsequent years,” he added.
The main areas of growth were in the sectors of: other food crops (which includes red onions and chilies), fisheries, construction, domestic trade, transport, banking, insurance, real estate, and government services (including defense and public administration).
Vignesh also explained that while there were around 700 industries in Jaffna, most were small and medium scale enterprises,
“We have about 2-3 big industries in the Acchuveli Industrial zone, they specialize in hardware,” he said. His organisation has around 300-375 active members with around 65-70 being female entrepreneurs.
The main issue he perceives is the lack of value addition in many of the fields including fisheries and agriculture.
Where are the jobs?
When it comes to unemployment Dr. Sarvananthan pointed out that between 2011-2014 most jobs have been found in relatively “lower paid elementary (54%), clerical (32%) and sales and service workers (28%)” as their bases were higher with very few available to take up more professional (24%) and technical employment (30%).
“The Northern Province, including Jaffna district, is lagging behind not only in terms of the quantity of employment created, especially in relatively higher paid jobs, but in the quality of new employment created as well,” stated Dr. Sarvananthan’s research.
In addition, Vignesh also pointed out that “many families live on foreign remittances and hence their children expected higher salaries. They won’t work if the salary is low,” he said.
Dr. Saravananthan speaking to Daily News also explained that the lack of entrepreneurial skill was also due to the fact that many famed for their entrepreneurial skills had left Jaffna during the conflict,
“The islanders, those from Velanai, Kytes, Delft and Poongudithivu are very good at business. But they migrated over time. In the last two years however we have seen an upsurge in Diaspora spending on private investments and on consumer goods,” he said. Vignesh added that even though they had the physical infrastructure, they lacked the human resources to follow through. As a result many have had no option but to bring in labour from outside to fill in higher paying jobs- a consequence not liked by many in Jaffna.
“We need steady growth, then we will be able to cope with the boom,” said Vignesh.
More importantly they have also had problems in attracting employment into the private sector.
“The government has always been the main employer in this region. It is only after the war that the private sector has come in and it is hard for the community to accept that and adapt,” said Vignesh.
Mechanization
The Chamber is also working on promoting the adoption of technology into many businesses in Jaffna so that they can grow faster,
“Most of our shops still operate manual systems. The Mudalali spends countless hours writing from morning to night. They have to be told what is out there,” said Vignesh.
This is a phenomenon Azad too noticed and he said that many may not be interested in the machines due to not having seen one in real life.
“People haven’t seen much industry here. They will understand better if they see it for themselves,” he said and has proposed that the next Trade fair make arrangements to bring down working models for demonstrations.
Governance
He compared Jaffna to what India was like 50 years ago, “We had the same problems, but in the 1970s, we had government officials who would push and nurture entrepreneurs to help them come up,” said Azad.
Vignesh too would prefer to have a more proactive government supporting business and he observed that there needed to be a change in mindset among government servants before any improvement can be made.
“The government (both provincial and central) has been lethargic and alienated from the private sector. We are conducting awareness programmes to make them more aware of the needs of businessmen,” he said.
Many have also come to feel that those from outside of Jaffna receive preferential treatment compared to local investors,
“Many investors from outside come here with all the permission and approvals, it is harder for us to get them. At times have to go all the way to Colombo,” said Vignesh.
“In the Acchuveli Industrial zone, the infrastructure is bad. If the basics are improved upon, our people are ready to take it on,” he added.
Acchuveli also has the problem of location. Neither the airport, port nor a main highway exists in its immediate vicinity, making many industries reluctant to invest there.
International Trade
At the end of the day however, convincing locals to invest in industries has not been easy. Vignesh sadly remarked that on a recent visit to Canada, he found Jaffna curry powder made in Kerala, India.
Dr. Sarvananthan was of the opinion that traditional industries which existed before the war would no longer be able to compete with a more open economy.
“Many of the products can be bought for cheaper prices from India or China. The global economy has changed but the structure of ours hasn’t changed much,” said Dr. Sarvananthan.
“We need a knowledge based service. The Indians can have BPOs here as we also speak Tamil. We need to change our industries. Rather than trying to go back,” added Dr. Sarvananthan.
For India, investing in Sri Lankan businesses, especially in the North is of geopolitical importance, especially as China steadily infiltrates the market.
“We have done well in Sri Lanka but the Chinese are beating us the world over. Their products are cheaper and look better than ours. Ours maybe more expensive but it will last longer,” observed Singla.
India thus has become a willing source of investments into the North as it desperately looks to improve its economy.
“If society is to improve, we need industries to come here. Keep the youth occupied if you don’t want them to fight,” said Vignesh.
