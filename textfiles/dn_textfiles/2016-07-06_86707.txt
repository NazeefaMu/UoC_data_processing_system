JO member lambastes Al Hussein

What moral right has the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein to interfere in the country’s internal affairs by suggesting a hybrid special court led by international judges to be incorporated into the proposed new Constitution, asked UPFA MP Niroshan Premarathna.
The MP addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday said the Human Rights Chief has expressed this proposal presenting an oral update on Sri Lanka to the ongoing 32nd sessions of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva last month.
“We totally oppose it. We will not allow to set up courts to fulfill the needs of Western nations. Al Hussein has come here to take our war heroes to the guillotine, but we won’t allow that to happen,” he said.
Al Hussein has also said that the Sri Lankan Parliament adopted a resolution establishing a constitutional assembly to create a new constitution to go for a referendum in 2017.
Premarathna questioned as to how the Human Rights Chief could call for a referendum on Constitutional reforms process where even the government has not announced any such move to hold a such a referendum.
The government is engaged in imprisoning patriotic forces. MP Udaya Gammanpila and Media spokesperson of the National Freedom Front, Mohammed Muzammil have been remanded because they oppose bringing in a federal constitution. The government and a section of the Opposition have already given their consent to a federal Constitution and only the Joint Opposition has opposed this suggestion, he said.
Earlier, the JVP was the first to oppose the government when it was going on the wrong path. But, the situation has changed and the JVP is today engaged in protecting and promoting the FCID. It is shameful, Premarathna said.
Today, Buddhist monks are jailed and there is a witch hunt against the war heroes under the guise of the Commission of Inquiry into Disappearances. The 6.2 million voters, artists and civil society members who voted for the government in 2016 are now ready to bring it down, he said.
The MP said all members of the Joint Opposition have agreed on the new political force led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with an operational role for former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
“The government is scared of Basil Rajapaksa because he is a good manager. We made certain mistakes last time, but now we have rectified all the mistakes and come on the correct path. We will face local government elections as a separate group and all further elections will be contested under the same force. We already have a large number of provincial politicians supporting our cause,” he added.
