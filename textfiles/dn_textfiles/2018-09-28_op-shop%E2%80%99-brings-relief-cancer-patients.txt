Internationally renowned ‘Op Shops’ are charity collection centres that sells numerous items including readymade garments, clothing materials, home appliances, toys, educational equipment, footwear, school bags etc.
The entire proceeds obtained from the sales of the Op Shop are utilized for the welfare of cancer patients all over the country. Sri Lanka Cancer Society is a charity organization, established decades ago to help cancer patients.
The `Op Shop’ is open on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10.30am to 2pm.
SLCS, Public Education Committee, Chairperson Indrani Nanayakkara said this kinds of charity shops are world renowned and the SLCS was able to initiate this project due to the generosity of kind hearted people who wish to donate items to the shop. She said she would use the `Op Shop’ as a forum to educate the buyers who visit the shop about the importance of early detection, medication, diet and the change in life styles in the prevention and cure of this dreaded disease.
She said the Cancer Society is also running a hospice near the Apeksha Hospital at Maharagama for the benefit of terminally ill cancer patients.
