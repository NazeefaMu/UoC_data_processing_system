President opens submarine cable system landing station

President Maithripala Sirisena opened the new building of the South East Asia – Middle East – Western Europe 5 (SEA-ME-WE 5) state-of-the-art submarine cable system landing station built by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), at Matara, on Monday.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system spans approximately 20,000 km, offering POP-to-POP (Point of Presence) solutions from Singapore to Europe via France and Italy.
The system connects 17 countries and serves as a new platform for development in the ICT industry.
The conceptualization of the new submarine cable system evolved around the capacity requirements of inter-continents to support the next generation of internet applications, which come from all parts of the world. The SEA-ME-WE 5 is designed to provide upgradeable transmission facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art multiple 100 GBPS technology. When fully loaded, the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system is capable of carrying a total 24 terabytes per second: the equivalent of transmitting around 4,800 high-definition movies every second.
The President opened the new building of the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system in Galle using the digital technology and he also laid the foundation stone for the network station located in Galle.
Ministers Harin Fernando, Mangala Samaraweera, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Deputy Minister Tharanath Basnayake and Southern Province Minister Chandima Rasaputhra and several other ministers, Sri Lanka Telecom Chairman Kumarasinghe Sirisena and the Board of Directors were also present on the occasion.
