Business Design Consultancy Consulus Global in Sri Lanka with Hummingbird International

In response to the relentless speed of change and the impending disruption that industry 4.0 will bring to business and global community, Hummingbird International, which was a representative of Consulus Global, has its consultancy division upgraded to a fully-fledged partner as Consulus Lanka.
The launch event was held with a CEO Breakfast Meeting at Jetwing Colombo Seven with Dr. Paolo Frizzi, Regional Director-North America & Europe addressing the audience on Industry 4.0 and its Impact on organizations.
CEOs and senior leaders of industry and officials of Consulus Global and Hummingbird International attended the event.
Hummingbird International has extensive experience supporting Sri Lankan organizations on critical organizational design and development areas. Whilst these initiatives continued to connect people with their organizational strategy, the next natural progression of re-imagining and realizing the organizational existential purpose to prepare for the coming industrial revolution becomes increasingly essential.
For this urgent reason, Hummingbird has taken the bold step to become an accredited and fully-fledged member of Consulus who has extensive experience in helping companies transform their business models through innovation. Our Consulus Lanka consultants will look forward to providing innovative solutions to Sri Lankan companies on their transformational journey to become more relevant in the future. “In partnership with other Consulites present in 11 countries from Brazil to Singapore, we will also look forward to add our Sri Lankan perspective to the network.
While international in outlook, Consulus' practical and integrated approach of combining business, organisational development and design is a good fit for the business realities in Sri Lanka”, said Shiraz Latiff, CEO of Consulus Lanka.
“Leveraging on the Consulus experience (spanning over 20 cities and helping companies with an aggregated turnover of $5.2 billion), Consulus Lanka will be able to bring to this country the tested innovation methodologies and expertise. Consulus Lanka will have consultants accredited by Consulus Global and would offer to Sri Lankan companies quality organisation transformation solutions by Sri Lankans and supported by global experts”said LakshiniKurukulasooriya, COO of Consulus Lanka.
