Constitution making a collective effort: PM

Making of the Constitution is a collective effort and there will be no separate drafts from the UNP or the UPFA, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of 'Seminar on Constitutionalism' organised by
the Parliament of Sri Lanka with USAID support, at Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla.
The Prime Minister said unlike in the making of the first and second Republican Constitutions when the ruling party enjoyed a two thirds majority, no party has a two thirds majority in the current Parliament.
He added that a national government was formed with the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena to fulfill the people's aspirations to introduce a Constitution that strengthens democracy, unity and rights of the people.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out the powers of Executive and Legislature should be clearly defined in the new Constitution, adding that President Sirisena had expressed his willingness to give more powers to Parliament.
He said the entire Parliament has now been integrated to the Constitution making process by forming a Constitutional Assembly, adding that the Steering Committee for the purpose would be appointed on April 5. The Premier expressed his confidence that a new Constitution would be finalised by 2017 when the Sri Lanka Parliament celebrates it's 70th anniversary.
"Upholding the people's sovereignty and rule of law are key factors that should be kept in mind when making the new Constitution. The Constitution making will go ahead as of the public opinions gathered by the Public Representations Committee. Discussions are on among Party leaders on an electoral reform based on mixed member proportional system. This is the central focus of constitutional amendments," he said.
He said power sharing and decentralisation should also be considered in a manner that suits the country avoiding any harm to the unitary character.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said his endeavour is to empower the Committee system in Parliament and thereby integrate all groups in Parliament for the governance of the country.
He added that Parliament should take the initiative in deciding what the people need in the Constitution, while studying the models in other countries.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap commended the steps taken by the government to protect and promote civil rights of the people including freedom of expression and rule of law.
He said the government is faced with more challenges in the spheres on reconciliation and accountability.
Keshap assured US support to build a stronger democracy and future prosperity, and said it is ready to partner with the government to carry out oversight responsibilities on public service to make them more effective.
