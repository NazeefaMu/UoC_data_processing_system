Grave injustice for dryden and pope in Sri Lanka

I have always been an anglophile since I began to suck the nectar of English language. One would be compelled to label me as a Brown Sahib or a man licking the boots of the colonial masters when I pen these lines in favour of the great poetic figures of that far away land. Let me also remind them that I quite palpably understand those who criticize the west send their children there for their higher education. Our Sri Lankans are both double tongued and double minded. I always call a spade a spade. We should give the devil his due. We, as responsible and rational minded senior citizens, should leave behind a legacy for our posterity to thrive.
The circumstances compel me to focus the much needed attention of the relevant authorities to the aforementioned topic with the least delay. The defects of this nature seem to run in the blood of the department of examination because our poetic icon of Chimney sweeper fame suffered the same when had been anthologized for GCE (O/L) English literature. Not a single question was set on his highly successful poem ‘GARDEN OF LOVE’ once a few lines had been given for name’s sake. There is something wrong somewhere.
My concern here is another acute defect connected with the GCE (A/L) English Language and Literature question paper bearing the subject number 73. I do not wish to underrate the vast subject knowledge of the question paper panel on this subject, yet the visible absence of DRYDEN and POPE in the array of literary periods in the paper. A careful and analytical perusal of the past papers would drive home the idea that no proportional representation of the periods and writers could be found. Due to lack of journalistic acumen among most of the teachers of English Literature in the country vital subject areas do not come into discussion in the print or electronic media.
The writer would like to play the devil’s advocate on the above title if any competent authority would come forward.
Poetic icons
Another pertinent aspect is that a new syllabus is said to have been drafted to be effective from 2019. This particular syllabus would remain only for this year and the next. The panel of the examination board will have to repent forever, if they are palpable enough, if they don’t do justice to the above poetic icons this year.
JOHN DRYDEN and ALEXANDER POPE were the high priests of the AUGUSTEN period of English poetry. It is heard that the students enjoy their poetic efforts develop a very critical outlook of the society. Their universal applicability opens their flood gates of imagination. Not only that but also the inspirational value of these poems has paved the way for their creativity. The last decades of the 17th century and the early decades of the 18th century of England were greatly benefited by their poetic endeavours. They were the pioneers of the neoclassical period of English literature. Their great efforts to effect social reforms in England deserve to be honoured in Sri Lanka at least by setting a question on the said paper. In their view, classical theory and nature of the world were inseparable. It is the time-tested truth. Hitherto it has stood the test of time.
Moral values of public figures
The million dollar question is that in relation to other literary periods the two Auguston poets in our discussion rendered a yeoman service for the uplift of the moral values of the public figures for the betterment of the society. On the other hand, their relevance to today’s Sri Lanka is immense.
Our politicians and other public figures could be highly benefited if we could prepare a guide book and impose some parameters for their rational conduct based on them. Their poetry was basically biting satire on politicians. They took public figures and incidents of the society and fired well targeted salvos to put them on the correct path.
It goes without saying that the upper class society in any country is rotten with unspeakable failings or foibles. To bring back social harmony was their ultimate aim. They made a concerted effort to be inspired by classical literature and pass the benefits for social progress. The drawing room society and the illegitimacy came under their hammer. Their diction in writing was superb and mockery did the needful. Their hyperbolic presentation of the characters is good read. Humour and sarcasm could make the classrooms ribs breaking.
‘THE PORTRAIT OF ZIMRI’ and ‘THE RAPE OF THE LOCK’ respectively by JOHN DRYDEN and ALEXANDER POPE are anthologized for the students to study for their examination purposes. A microscopic view of the past question papers from 2011 to 2016 convinces to us that the same poems have been repeatedly chosen for the exam to test the students. Yet, these two great poets have been sidelined for no apparent reason. England deserves their due share from us if we use their assets for our intellectual nourishment.
The time is opportune to create a genuine interest in the children to study English literature both at GCE (O/L) and (A/L) because of the very reason that it paves the way for good English. The standard of English of both teachers and students is poignantly dwindling. Thus, the results have gone down.
