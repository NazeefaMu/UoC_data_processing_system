Police seek AG’s advice regarding Gnanasara Thera

The Organized Crimes Preventive Division has sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over a complaint that he had allegedly committed a number of offences including obstruction of Police from discharging their duties in the Welikada areas last year.
When the case pertaining to the incident came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Ms. Kanchana de Silva, the Court was informed that the Organized Crimes Preventive Division had sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding the case in order to determine future legal action against Gnanasara Thera.
Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for November 2.
Police had filed a B report against Gnanasara Thera on charges of obstructing police duties, threatening police officers, instilling disunity amongst the public and expressing hateful sentiments at Welikada last year.
