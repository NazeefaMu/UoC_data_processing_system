Tamannaah in Vashu Bhagnani’s next

Tamannaah, who is gearing up for the release of Baahubali 2, has revealed that she will soon be seen in a Hindi film produced by Vashu Bhagnani, and that her character in the film will be visually challenged and hearing impaired. The film is a remake of the yet-to-release Tamil-Telugu bilingual film Kolaiyuthir Kaalam, which is also a production of Vashu, who is jointly bankrolling it with Yuvan Shankar Raja, who’s also scoring the film’s music in Tamil. Nayanthara plays the female lead in the original.
“It is a woman-centric film, and the lead character requires an actress with a potential to perform. Nayanthara fit the bill in Tamil but for Hindi, the makers required a familiar face and that’s why Tamannaah was roped in,” claims a source.
Tamannaah has already begun shooting for the film which also stars Prabhudheva and Bhumika in key roles. Deccan Chronicle
