Police violated HNDA students' rights - SLHRC

 
The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission yesterday determined that the Police violated the fundamental rights of Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) students by dispersing a protest by them opposite the University Grants Commission.
The commission recommended that compensation be paid to the students who were subjected to assault and sustained injuries due to police assault.
The police was recommended to pay Rs. 25,000 as compensation to Shashini Sandipani Kumarasinghe who is receiving treatment after being assaulted by police during the HNDA protest.
The commission also recommended police to pay Rs. 15,000 as compensation to seven other students admitted to hospital following the attack.
Police was also informed to identify the police officials who assaulted the students and take disciplinary action against them.
The Department has also been ordered to inform the commission about the steps taken by the police in this regard before February 1 next year.
The commission made these decisions and recommendation after two complaints made by the Jathika Balaya Organisation and IUSF convenor Lahiru Weerasekera were taken into consideration.
Inspector General of Police N.K. Illangakoon, Western Province Senior DIG Pujith Jayasundera, DIG Gamini Maturata and SSP Champika Siriwardena were among the 11 respondents cited as respondents in the complaint.
The commission in a report consisting 31 pages said not a single woman police constable was among 200 police officials at the scene.
The commission has upheld that the students were subject to inhumane and disgraceful treatment and the action taken by the police to disperse the protest was not legal.
The commission has also drawn the attention as to why the IGP has not brought this matter into serious consideration at that moment.
