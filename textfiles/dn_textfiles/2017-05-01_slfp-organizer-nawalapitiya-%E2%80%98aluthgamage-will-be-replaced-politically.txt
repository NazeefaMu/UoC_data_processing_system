SLFP organizer for Nawalapitiya: ‘Aluthgamage will be replaced by a politically stronger person’

 Mahindananda Aluthgamage will be removed from his post of SLFP organizer for the Nawalapitiya electorate and replaced with a politically stronger person who will be brought in as a member of the Central Provincial  Council in future, said Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake.
Speaking to the media in Kandy, Minister Dissanayake said Mahinda Rajapaksa who went home after willingly handing over the SLFP leadership to President Maithripala Sirisena, dreamt of becoming Prime Minister after being deceived by some of his henchmen.
It was the duty and responsibility of Mahinda Rajapaksa as a civilized person to assist President Sirisena in steering the SLFP to greater heights.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa’s earlier plan was to become Prime Minister and dispose President Maithripala Sirisena from power.
