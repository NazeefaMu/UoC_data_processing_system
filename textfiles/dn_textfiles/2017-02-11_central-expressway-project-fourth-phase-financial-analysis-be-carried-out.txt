Central Expressway Project fourth phase: Financial analysis to be carried out

The Economic Affairs Committee will carry out a financial analysis on the fourth phase of the Central Expressway Project, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriaarachchi said.
It is reported that the financial analysis will result in a slight delay in the commencement of the construction of the fourth phase.
Under the fourth phase of the Central Expressway project,  it has been planned to construct a section of highway between Kurunegala and Dambulla spanning 58.7 kilometres of four lanes. It will be constructed at a cost of Rs.161.61 billion.
It is said that the contract for the construction of the fourth phase of the Central Expressway project has been awarded to a Chinese company since it is an unsolicited proposal.
The project has already received Cabinet approval to obtain a loan from the Exim Bank of China. Sources said that the construction of the fourth phase has been scheduled to commence of February 27.
Accordingly, the agreement was scheduled to be signed next week and work would be initiated at a ceremony presided over by President Maithripala Sirisena the following week.
The Daily News tried to contact Highways and Higher Education Minister Laksaman Kiriella several times in this regard, but he could not be reached. When Highways Sate Minister Dilan Perera was contacted over the phone, he said that he refused to comment and requested us to contact the Minister of Highways.
