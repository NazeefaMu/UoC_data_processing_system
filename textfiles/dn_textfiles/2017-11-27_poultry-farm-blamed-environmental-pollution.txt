Poultry farm blamed on environmental pollution

Discharge of chicken offal from a poultry farm in the St Helias Estate into Agra Oya, a feeder canal of the Wimalsurandra Reservoir, has caused a serious environmental hazzard in the region, residents said.
The chicken body parts strewen all over the area by dogs and crows streaming into feed on the offal has created a nauseating smell in the entire area.
The residents say the poultry farm has thousands of birds.
All complaints made to relevant authorities had fallen on deaf ears, residents said.
