Asiamoney names HNB ‘Best Cash Management Bank’ in SL

HNB, Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank, has been recognized by Asiamoney as the ‘Best Cash Management Bank in Sri Lanka’. This prestigious award to HNB is a first for a local bank in Sri Lanka in cash management.
A part of the Euromoney Group, Asiamoney is considered among the most influential financial magazines and a leading authority on finance, banking, investment, and treasury in the Asia-Pacific region and is read and trusted by the region’s leading companies, bankers, brokers, investors, regulators and policy makers.
Asiamoney’s ‘Best Cash Management Bank in Sri Lanka’ award is based on an independent survey where corporates are given the opportunity to rate the quality of service provided by their local and multinational banks, across 20 core products and services.
HNB is the first local bank to offer a web-based, fully integrated Payments and Cash Management (PCM) platform – HNB Online. The Bank, leveraging on this state-of-the- art platform, along with a dedicated business team that is considered the best in the industry, within a short period of time has been able to make significant strides in securing a leadership position in the cash management, which was previously a captive business of the multinational banks.
Corporates using HNB Online have real time control over their day-to-day management of collections, payments and liquidity investments whilst enterprise-level clients have the ability to integrate HNB Online directly with their Accounts Payables and Accounts Receivables of their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems such as SAP and Oracle.
HNB’s cash management solutions offering covers corporates ranging from multinationals, large local conglomerates, mid-market enterprises, financial institution groups and non-banking financial institutions.
Ruwan Manatunga, DGM Corporate Banking said, “Winning this title within a year of the launch of HNB Online is a proud moment and a testament of the hard work and effort put in by the PCM team not only to develop a platform that is best in the market but also to provide the Bank’s corporate customers solutions that create significant value.”
Dhananjaya Samaraweera, Head of Payments and Cash Management, said, “HNB’s fully integrated Payments and Cash Management platform was launched just over a year ago and winning this award is a reflection of customer confidence in HNB being able to provide end-to-end electronic cash management solutions that creates significant efficiency and convenience.”
