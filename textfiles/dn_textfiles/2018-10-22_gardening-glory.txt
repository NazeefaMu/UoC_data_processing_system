Gardening glory

* My rule of green thumb for mulch is to double my initial estimate of bags needed, and add three. Then I’ll only be two bags short. ~Author Unknown
* We come from the earth.
We return to the earth.
And in between we garden.
~Author Unknown
* Yes, I am positive that one of the great curatives of our evils, our maladies, social, moral, and intellectual, would be a return to the soil, a rehabilitation of the work of the fields. ~Charles Wagner
* With fronds like these, who needs anemones? ~Frank Muir
* God loved the flowers and invented soil. Man loved the flowers and invented vases. ~Variation of a saying by Jacques Deval (God loved the birds and invented trees. Man loved the birds and invented cages.)
* The moment that a child can walk, like that in which it first can talk, is a precious start of exploration into landscapes of creation.
Walking, walking, walking, walking, walking on the earth.
By sense of touch the feet assess the nature of the wilderness of earth beneath; yet human speech cannot express what feet can teach.
Walking, walking, walking, walking, walking on the earth.
~Francis D. Hole (1913–2002), “Walking on the Earth”
* I saw all the people hustling early in the morning to go into the factories and the stores and the office buildings, to do their job, to get their checks. But ultimately, it’s not office buildings or jobs that give us our checks. It’s the soil. The soil is what gives us the real income that supports us all. ~Ed Begley, Jr.
* I doe hold it, in the Royall ordering of Gardens, there ought to be Gardens, for all the Moneths in the Yeare: In which, severally Things of Beautie, may in then in Season. ~Francis Bacon
