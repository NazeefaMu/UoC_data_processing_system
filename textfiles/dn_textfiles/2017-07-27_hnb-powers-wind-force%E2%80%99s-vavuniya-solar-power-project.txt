HNB powers Wind Force’s Vavuniya solar power project

HNB’s project finance team of their corporate banking division lauded the success of Wind Force (Pvt) Ltd, on completion of their 10 MW solar power project in Vavuniya. Under the name of Vydexa (Lanka) Power Corporation, the solar power project achieved a record-breaking commissioning period of just 64 days.
HNB's Head of Project Finance Majella Rodrigo said that as the largest private bank in Sri Lanka, HNB was proud to be the sole funding partner of this renewable power project.
"The focus and relentless commitment by the entire team, through their commitment to green energy concepts and green initiatives makes this project important to us."
“It is a clear indication of our allegiance to projects of national interest.”
Rodrigo said this is the country’s fifth mega-scale solar power project to be commissioned to the national grid and HNB is proud to be the financing partner of two of these significant projects.
Vydexa (Lanka) Power Corporation is the second solar power project in Sri Lanka to utilize the innovative ‘single axis tilting facility’ technology, which tracks the movement of the sun to optimize positioning of solar panels.

HNB will continue to lead the market in providing innovative solutions to this vital area of investment and corporate clientele.”
