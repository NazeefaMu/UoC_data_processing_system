Peradeniya Bursar who vanished with Rs 32 mn sacked

Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor has sacked the senior assistant bursar of the University who went missing with Rs 32 million from the University’s Post Graduate Institute of Science.
The letter was sent to the suspect’s house through the university security last Thursday.
The senior assistant bursar who had withdrawn the money from a government bank had thereafter fled the area. The CID is working on apprehending him. The university administration has also taken action to seal the office of the senior assistant bursar at the Post Graduate Institute of Science. Initial investigations also show that the suspect had misled the director of the Institute to have him approve the transfer of the money from the government bank to another bank and obtained his signature with regards to such a transaction.
It has been 10 days since the suspect had fled with the money and a source at the University speaking to Daily News revealed that the investigations undertaken by the University authorities with regard to case have yielded no results thus far.
