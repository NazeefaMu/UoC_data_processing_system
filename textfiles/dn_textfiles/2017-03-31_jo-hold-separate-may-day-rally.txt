JO to hold separate May Day rally

The joint opposition will hold a separate may day rally this year, Kandy District Parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said yesterday.
He said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party members in the government will not take part. However, Amunugama did not mention the location the JO was planning to hold its may day rally.
Amunugama said, in the current context he does not see the possibility of the JO members and the SLFP members in the government teaming up together even in the event of the latter severing its ties with the United National Party. Speaking at a public event in Nugawela, Amunugama said, "we have made it clear that we will work with the SLFP members in the government even if they were willing to sever ties with the UNP. However, I believe the time has now passed for such a merger. I think it is no longer valid. It is better for us to go our own way."
He further noted that the SLFP members in the JO were prepared to face any disciplinary inquiry.
He stressed that the SLFP members in the JO knew the desire of the party members and supporters and were always willing to make any sacrifice to fulfil their expectations.
