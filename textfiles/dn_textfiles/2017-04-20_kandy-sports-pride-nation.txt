Kandy sports pride of the nation

Sports in Kandy play a significant part in the lives of the folks living in the hill country. Over here in Kandy it is represented by all races of the island, Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers and Malays. Whatever said and done rugby is the most popular sport in the central hills at school and club level. In the early day’s football, cricket and hockey were very active at club level. But it is not so today. Some of the other popular sports were netball, badminton, athletics, basketball, tennis, cue sport, volleyball, table tennis, elle, golf, swimming and baseball. Credit should go to schools for regularly organizing sports events at top level. This is largely due to the efforts of principals and the past pupils. As a result, Kandy has produced many national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, football and hockey. Today most of the state schools lack funds to equip themselves and also no proper playing fields.
Rugby is the most popular sport and crowd-pulling game. This is because Kandy SC is the one and only club out of Colombo playing the game at the highest level. They are the reigning club rugby league and knockout champions. Football, however, is the common man’s sport. This sport still continues with limited resources and facilities. But it is sad to say that in the last eight years, football in Kandy has taken a back seat. Hockey at school level is a happy story, with most of the schools, especially girls’ schools, dominating the game. Cue games, billiards and snooker, however, have also taken a nosedive with hardly any activity, today billiard rooms are used as stores in clubs, Only Mahnuwara YMBA is the active club in Billiard and Snooker.
Basketball has returned to its former position. Table tennis and badminton too are in good shape with participation at every level being more than satisfactory. Volleyball is at low ebb. In recent times, Kandy has produced some impressive athletes, but the eye-opener has been swimming where Kandy has produced some top notch swimmers, especially at school level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest level. Kandy is urgently in need of proper ground facilities for football, cricket, hockey and athletics.
The sporting fraternity of Kandy wants to appeal to the Sports Minister to look into the shortcomings of Kandy sports. Malik Samarawickrema now a minister has supported rugby for many years, it was he who helped Kandy SC to win the first trophy. If not for him Kandy SC will be nowhere in rugby. The Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake who was a onetime president of the Basketball Federation, and present president of Central Province Cricket is a keen follower of all sports and gives a big hand.
Shanthini Kongage gives support for Netball. What Kandy needs today is good knowledgeable administrators at District level and good coaches. The majority of coaches at present don’t have the proper knowledge to develop talent that is at club level, at school’s they must have MIC’s who know the game and keen in sports, most of them does not know the captain’s name.
All sportsmen and women in Kandy hope that their immediate needs be met by the present authorities in the near future.
