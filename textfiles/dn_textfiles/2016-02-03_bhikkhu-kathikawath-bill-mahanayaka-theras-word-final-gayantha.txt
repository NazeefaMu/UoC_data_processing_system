Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill: Mahanayaka Theras' word is final - Gayantha

The Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill that will give legal authority to Adhikarana Sangha Councils to conduct its disciplinary measures on members of the clergy regarding their moral conduct including violations of the monastic code, has entered its final stages, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday told the Daily News.
He said the Draft Bill would be presented to Parliament in stages only after the government receives written approval from the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte, Ramanna, Asgiriya and Amarapura Nikayas.
"The Mahanayaka Theras have advised and recommended that the Bill be made law soon," said Minister Karunathilaka and added, "Minister of Buddha Sasana and Justice is working on it."
He said, " I moved the the Bill in Parliament as the Chief Government Whip."
"The Bill having been presented in Parliament, was later withdrawn and referred back for necessary amendments to be made by the Mahanayake Theras. This was in keeping with a decision arrived at by the the Cabinet, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, that the Bill shall be brought to Parliament in stages with written approval from the Mahanayake Theras," the minister said.
Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs Chandraprema Gamage said on being asked whether the Mahanayake Theras have given their written consent to the Bill, that the Mahanayake Theras of Malwatte and Ramanna Chapters have informed them in writing that that the bill is suitable for registration. Asked if the Mahanayake Theras had proposed some amendments, Gamage said ,"Yes. We worked with them and include them in the draft," he added.
