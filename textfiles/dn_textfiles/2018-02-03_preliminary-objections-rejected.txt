Case against Keheliya:
Preliminary objections rejected

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court yesterday rejected preliminary objections raised by former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman over a corruption case.
This is for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs. 230,984 to the government after paying former Minister’s mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
The defence had raised preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the charge sheet.
While rejecting preliminary objections raised by, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe, the case was fixed for trial on March 2.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had induced the CPC chairman to pay his mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government, while serving as the Mass Media Minister.
The Bribery Commission had named former (SPC) Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this case against the former minister and former SPC chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
Counsel Anuradha Siriwardena, the Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission appeared for the prosecution.
Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
