Siddhalepa hosts partners for  family holiday at Wadduwa

Siddhalepa felicitated the cream of their wholesale and retail traders countrywide in a grand gesture of hospitality at the Siddhalepa Ayurveda Resort, Wadduwa, last week.
Nearly 1000 traders from all parts of the country who are the backbone of the company’s countrywide sales,were hosted to two nights stay with their families at the Resort.
The top 50 partners in each of the four sales areas of western, southern, central and north central were hosted in four separate batches of about 200 people in each batch. The two nights stay at the resort for the whole family was a golden opportunity for the busy partners to spend some quality time with their families in the serene, relaxed landscape of the seven-acre resort hotel overlooking the ocean.
The program was a perfect balance between a comprehensive introduction to Siddhalepa’s multi - faceted businesses under Hettigoda Industries Pvt. Ltd. and discovering the pleasures of resort tourism.
Partners checked in with their families at their convenience for dinner and had the rest of the evening to spend at leisure.
The program began next day with individual area managers welcoming their best performers and families, followed by an inspirational welcome address by Siddhalepa Chairman, Dr. Victor Hettigoda.
A presentation on the group was followed by a talk on the Ayurveda Hospital. Introductions and presentations were also made by relevant managers on the Leisure Sector of the Group and their pioneering and leading CSR activities in environment protection in schools and religious sites, dengue prevention and children’s educational skills.
The traders and families were pampered with Ayurveda treatment at the Ayurveda Spa in the hotel and were also given the opportunity to experience a yoga session in the afternoon before the evening’s fun and games began and dinner and DJ music continued to rock the resort, making it a memorable stay for Siddhalepa’s partners who achieved best sales throughout the year.
A family photo with Siddhalepa Chairman, Dr. Victor Hettigoda was presented to each family as a memento of their holiday at the resort.
