First Cabinet paper to promote organic farming

The first Cabinet paper to promote organic farming will be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers next week, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Ministry has taken measures to promote organic farming to cater to the rising demand for organic products in the local market.
“The demand for organic products in the local market is in a growing phase. So organic farming should be expanded to provide opportunities for farmers to earn more income,” he said.
According to the Minister, around 3,800 farmers currently engage in organic farming and they cultivate around 4,955 acres of paddy fields.
“These farmers mainly grow traditional paddy varieties. They can get a good price for these toxin-free traditional rice varieties since there is a huge demand for them in the local market,” said the Minister.
Minister Amaraweera added that the main objective of submitting the Cabinet paper is to encourage more farmers to engage in organic farming.
The Ministry will provide financial assistance for farmers who engage in toxin-free farming, he added.
