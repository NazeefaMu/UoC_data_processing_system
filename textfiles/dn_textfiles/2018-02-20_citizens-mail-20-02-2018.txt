Response to Ephrem Fernando
Not meant for anyone!
Any human being with even the least amount of intelligence understands that alcoholism and smoking are killers. The only issue is that, some act on that intelligence and make a conscious choice to become teetotallers, while some, even while being fully aware of its adverse repercussions, keep poisoning themselves. So far, Fernando’s logic is absolutely faultless and any human being in her/his right mind would laud him for saying what he says in his article, “Not meant for ladies!”
Still, as the article progresses, a deep shadow is cast over this valuable and timely message; the shadow of a deeper shade of benevolent patriarchy and sexism, dangerously coated in “culture.”
First and foremost, pubs are bad for both men and women. It’s not especially bad for women. However, the article sadly emphasizes how a drinking woman belongs to a worse breed than a drinking man. It also completely homogenizes a class of “wealthy women.” This makes his approach to this complex topic rather simplistic, as it puts all women of wealth into a constricted category and typecasts their behaviour. No human being can be absolutely categorized in this manner without losing out on the heterogeneity of the complex society we live in.
On the day of their marriage, not only a woman but a man too makes vows. Then why is a husband who comes home drunk and beats up his wife let go quite easily in Sri Lankan “culture”, under the great illogic of ‘men will be men,’ while a woman drinking a glass of wine is bad for “culture”? Which “culture”? Whose “culture”?
And if the idyllic and nostalgic Victorian dream of the yesteryear stay-at-home mother is to continue, that has to be done on the funeral pyres of all professional women who believe that they too can participate in the basic human rights of educating themselves, finding professional success and leading their own independent lives. According to this mindboggling formula of “Good mother=A stay-at-home mother,” my mother would have been a “bad mother.” But no. She was a working mother and she raised me into becoming the independent, free-thinking, educated and humane woman I am today.
And I am sorry Ephrem Fernando, no matter how many children I may have, the last thing I would do is to “sacrifice” my life and my dreams and constrain my life at home in the name of motherhood!
Prescribing different rules for men and women is called “sexism” and “gender-discrimination”. Besides, let the jungle have its own laws. I am a woman and a “human being.” Not an elephant!
