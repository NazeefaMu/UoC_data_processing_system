South Africa hopes to move closer to semi-finals

With a place in the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 still its for the taking, South Africa captain Dane Van Niekerk insists team confidence is at an all-time high as it prepares for its next challenge.
That comes in the form of Sri Lanka at the County Ground, Taunton on Wednesday, with Inoka Ranaweera’s side still searching for its first win of the tournament.
South Africa, in contrast, has three victories to its name, the latest coming in a 115-run triumph over India on Saturday – a game in which Van Niekerk took four wickets and hit a half-century.
But while South Africa’s opponent is yet to get its tournament up and running with points on the table, Van Niekerk admits her team is in no doubt of the battle that lies in wait.
“The performances Sri Lanka has shown in this tournament have been really good,” said the all-rounder. We know how good they are, and we’re not going to go out there underestimating them.
“We are going to go there to play our best cricket, the way we have been playing and our brand, and hopefully that is good enough to get another two points.
Sri Lanka come into its tie with the Proteas on the back of a 47-run defeat by the West Indies at the weekend, and while it has already been confirmed it will be heading home at the conclusion of the pool stage, the team is optimistic it won’t leave without a win.
For batter Chamari Atapattu, the team has already pinpointed areas for improvement, and is determined to put practice into play come Wednesday.
“South Africa is a good team, they have two or three fast bowlers, but we have played a lot of cricket against them, both home and away,” said Atapattu.
“We have won a few of those games and I scored a few 50s and hundreds against them. I think we have a chance, and we will do our best.
“I think our spinners are good but we are struggling in that area on this tour. I think in the next match, Inoka [Ranaweera], Shashikala [Siriwardena] and Oshadi [Ranasinghe] can do very well.”
