EBC Radio, first Sri Lankan Radio team to ADFEST

 
EBC Radio has once more blazed a new and innovative path, elevating the standard for the future of local radio, by sending a delegation to this year's ADFEST, a regional advertising festival held recently in Thailand.
Made up of a mix of operations, marketing and programme content professionals, the EBC Radio team had the opportunity to sit in a number of creative workshops and sessions, including a highly informative one by international radio heavy hitter Tony Hertz.
Importantly, ADFEST 2016 also featured a number of innovative and insight-heavy programmes, particularly those encompassing new and evolving electronic media trends, which will ultimately impact not only global, but also Sri Lankan, radio going forward.
"It is important for us at EBC Radio to always remain at the top of our game, and the creative festival that is ADFEST is where Asia's top talent go to teach their skills and discuss tomorrow's trends and new media possibilities. We are proud to be Sri Lanka's first radio delegation to this important creative festival, and look forward to using what we have learnt to continually raise the bar for local radio", EBC Radio Chief Operating Officer Chalaka Gajabahu said in a release.
