Hazardous Trans fat found in adulterated coconut oil sold in market

The sample testing carried out by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) on directive of the President on palm oil available in the Sri Lanka market has reveal that it contains high level of Trans fat that is very hazardous to the human body.
The test has revealed that every sample of palm oil consisted of 0.50-1.39% of Trans fat which has been identified as the main cause of heart attracts in Sri Lanka. It was also disclosed that none of the oil samples complied with SLS Standards. The Palm oil samples did not comply with its relevant SLS 720:2016 Standard and the Palm Olein did not match with the SLS 961:2016 Standard. Moreover it was revealed that most of the oil sold in the market under the name Palm oil was actually Olein oil sold in the guise of Palm oil.
With coconut and coconut oil been part and parcel of Sri Lankan food from yesteryear this has raised alarm bells among health circles because it is no secret that coconut oil adulteration is taking place in mass scale in Sri Lanka. Large quantities of cheap palm oil which contains Trans fat is continued to be imported into Sri Lanka and unscrupulous oil traders conveniently mix this cheap oil with coconut oil. This adulterated coconut oil is being sold in the market for a lesser price as a means of attracting consumers.
Research has revealed that coconut oil consists of Lauric Acid which is available in breast milk, a body immunizing element. Coconut oil is now considered a oil with health benefits, but the Sri Lankan public is being deprived the benefits of coconut oil due to fact that vendors have been given a free hand to mix this very health hazardous palm oil to produce cheap adulterated coconut oil which occupies over 85 percent on the consumer market.
Murthaza Lukmanjee, Managing Director, Adamjee Marketing said most Sri Lankans buy and consume adulterated oil unconsciously and some consciously because of the price factor, but if the dealer can educate and sell those to the consumer, even if it has a small difference in price it will immensely help the community to sustain good health. Similarly, Lukmanjee said the consumer too has a responsibility to find out whether they were buying a good quality product or not.
Manjula Rathnayaka, Head of Operations and Sales Manager Vending Department, Adamjee Marketing (Pvt) Ltd (AML) said they have taken measures to protect their coconut oil products from vendors who adulterate coconut oil by introducing a unique tamper- proof method.
He said that to arrest the adulteration of their high quality pure coconut oil, even at the hands of the retailer, the company has introduced coconut oil tanks called ‘Oil Master’ with a tamper-proof seal, at all retail points where they supply their coconut oil. These tanks have an opening on top where the oil is filled and once the oil is filled, the top opening is sealed by AML. The vendor can only pour oil out to sell and is prevented from inserting anything to adulterate the contents inside the tank. When replenishments are needed, ALM would break open the seal, fill the Oil Master and re-seal it.
Rathnayaka said that they are supplying the retailers with 140 litre foolproof tanks and now have more than 200 such tanks in shops all over the country. Meanwhile coconut oil retailers say customers have expressed satisfaction with the pure coconut oil they purchase from the ‘Oil Master’ which consists a tamper-proof seal .
Customers too could purchase the Coco+ White Coconut Oil with a guarantee of purity, though the price is little higher than the adulterated stuff. Adamjee Lukmanjee & Sons (Pvt) Ltd’s large coconut oil factory which is situated at Grandpass is an ultra modern factory and there is no hand operation from the copra feeding point to the finished oil that is stored in the gigantic tanks. Only at the feeding point copra is inserted by hand. He said they were involved in various promotional activities and meeting consumer groups to educate them on the use and supply of coco plus white coconut oil .
Adamjee Lukmanjee Group Chairman Khazaima T Gulam said the sustainability of their business is mostly dependent on the consistent quality products that they manufacture and that they will never compromise on that. The prime idea in introducing the unique tamper- proof method was to protect the Sri Lankan coconut oil consumer from adulterated oils which were very health hazardous.
Pure coconut oil can be used as a medicine if not adulterated. The ancient Ayurvedic texts clearly highlight the attributes of Coconut Oil and the numerous illnesses that could be cured by its use. Adulterating, bleaching or adding chemicals to coconut oil is unethical and harmful to the health.
The benefit of using organic vegetables and food is completely negated if adulterated Coconut Oil is used in the cooking rendering absolutely no benefit to the public and conversely poisonous elements entering the human body.
