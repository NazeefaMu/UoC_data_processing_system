CBK bashes religious extremists

Extremists are trying to undermine the peace and reconciliation process in Sri Lanka, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said in a speech Wednesday evening.
She said that a small minority were igniting the flames of religious extremism.
Former President Kumaratunga was speaking at the All-Island School Art and Essay Competition awards ceremony at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. Over 9,000 students submitted art and essays on the theme “unity in diversity is the strength of our nation.”
“The vast majority of our country, our religious leaders, want unity and reconciliation,” she said. “Let the minority shout while the majority does what is correct.”
Kumaratunga said the examples of student art, dealing with ideas like tolerance and acceptance, signified hope for the future. “To create and instill such ambitions in the minds of our children, in order to establish peace and unity, is a very praiseworthy task,” she said.
