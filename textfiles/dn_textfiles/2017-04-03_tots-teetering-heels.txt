Tots teetering in heels!

Growing up, many of us honed our love of getting dolled up thanks to stylishly-attired mums and older sisters.
Badly applied lipstick, bangles stacked to the elbow, dousing ourselves in perfume and stomping around in adult-sized heels - these are all part and parcel of playing ‘dress-up’.
It’s not for every child but many do seem to have a magpie-like fondness for their mums’ shoes, clothes and accessories.
Now one company based in Pennsylvania have cut out the ‘middle mum’ and come up with dinky baby-sized high heels! Of course, there’s a big difference between your little one donning a pair of your heels for a few minutes once in a while and actually buying them a pair to wear regularly.
As much as you might be OK with the former, we’re also warned about the damage high heels can do to our feet. So what makes these a good idea?
According to founder Michelle Holbrook, Pee Wee Pumps have been made for babies - and with their developing feet in mind. Yes, don’t worry - your bundle of joy won’t be taking their first steps in a nice pair of courts.
Described as ‘infant crib shoes’, the designs are described as ‘flexible’ and ‘soft’ - and the heel is collapsible. And it seems the idea existed before Pee Wee Pumps. Michelle took inspiration from a pair of crib shoes she saw before falling pregnant with her daughter.
However, after tracking the shoes down Michelle found they would not stay on her baby daughter’s feet, and she set about coming up with a design more suited to babies.
Should fashion statements be earned with age? ‘Baby heels’ have opinion divided.
On the one hand, they don’t do any harm to a child’s foot in the way our high heels have done to ours. But there is a counter-argument that the very design is another example of children growing up too fast.
