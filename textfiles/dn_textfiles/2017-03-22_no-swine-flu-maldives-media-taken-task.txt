No Swine Flu in Maldives; Media taken to task

Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundera Bandara yesterday blamed the media for inaccurate reportage pertaining to Influenza AH1N1.
He said: “Recently, a media organisation irresponsibly and inaccurately reported that there is Swine Flu in Maldives and one of those affected had arrived in Sri Lanka from Maldives”.
“There is no truth in it at all. The media should stick to scientific facts when reporting health matters,” the acting Director General of Health stated. Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said there is certainly Influenza in Maldives, and, other than that, there is no other disease there. Influenza AH1N1 has been in Sri Lanka for three years now. It is not something new or information to panic. Persons with AH1N1 travel all over the world without any restriction.
According to Dr. Bandara, patients with Influenza AH1N1 were reported from areas such as Kandy, Bibile, Kilinochchi etc in the recent past and immediate steps were taken to control the disease, without letting it to spread to other areas. There is a well-established system at the BIA and other places to control diseases coming into the country through passengers’ arrival from abroad.
The media should not destroy the booming tourism industry in the country by reporting health issues inaccurately and irresponsibly, without being based on scientific facts, he added.
