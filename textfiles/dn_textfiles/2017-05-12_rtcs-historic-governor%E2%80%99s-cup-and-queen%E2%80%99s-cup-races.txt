RTC's historic  Governor’s Cup and Queen’s Cup Races

 Deepthika Jayakody bagged it all as her horses dominated to win both prestigious races, the Governor's Cup and Queen's Cup when the Royal Turf Club (RTC) April 29 race day came to an end at the scenic Nuwara Eliya racing track.
The legendary horse Alcazaba rode by the Indian ace jockey Y.S. Srinath won Deepthika the top title of the day, the Governor's Cup, which she won back-to-back while Captain Haddock rode by jockey Irvan Singh won her the Queen's Cup.
The governor's Cup is considered as the Sri Lanka’s version of the Kentucky Derby in USA, Ascot Gold Cup in the UK, de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and the Turnbull Stakes in Australia.
The 2017 races made history when the Board of Stewards of the Royal Turf Club, opened the Governor’s cup, which was limited only to Class 1 horses and the Queens Cup which was limited only to Class 2 horses, to all horses of all classes without any restrictions, for the first time ever in over a hundred years. This historic decision was made on April 23 provided an equal opportunity to all horses and all owners to compete and win these two prestigious races on the 29th.
The day was opened by the 1070-meter Class 5 race, the HNB Grameen Cup, which was won by Krabi who jumped out and decided to play the waiting game, finally passing Augusta and Blazing Berry to confirm an astounding victory with a 3 length lead. Coming back to racing only in 2016 after RTC took over the race course, Owner Dhanawardene Guruge was to savour the sweet taste of victory after 2 decades.
Local Jockey Punithraj on his mount Vigorous, prevailed over Indian Ace Y S Srinath, in the 1070 Meter Hi Magazine Cup, beating both Stormont ridden by Y S Srinath and the usual contender Torpedo, proving the metal of Local riders and the excellence of the training provided by Sinclair Marshall, Deputy CEO, who is also the founder and Principle of Sri Lanka’s first ever Jockey training school. Owned by one of the oldest Horse owners Ajantha De Soyza of Monaro Stables, the 7-year-old Brown mare out of Lucifer Sam (USA) and Taxido proved that she is the better horse in no uncertain terms.
This was followed by the most exciting race of the day, when the 6-year-old Brown Mare Stormy Petrel, ridden by Ravi Kumar and trained by Madialagan, went in to almost a blanket finish with back to back winner Honorius was defeated by less than a neck in the Class 5, 1400 meter Blackpool Hotel Cup. Owned by Anjali Stables, Stormy Petrel proved that she is a horse to be watched out for.
Excitement mounted, as it has been for the last 97years, when the horses came out to the Paddock to run the Queens Cup 2017. The race was open to all horses, first time since the inception of the race in 1920. In the paddocks were Governor’s cup 2016 winner Roswald owned by Deepthika Jayakody, and Meheran owned by Hasanga Jayaratne who won the RTC Magic Millions in a major upset just 2 weeks before, beating legendary Alcazaba by a neck. Anura Delgoda’s response to the challenge Celestial Fire was among others. Arabian Gold owned by Mr. and Mrs. Rienzie Edwards also a serial winner of the Queens Cup had to be withdrawn at the last minute due to Veterinary grounds.
Initially Celestial Fire took the lead and beat Meheran convincingly with a half a length lead when Jockey Irvan Singh on Captain Haddock, owned by Deepthika Jayakody made short work of the race beating Celestial Fire by 1 ½ Lengths and Meheran by a massive 2 lengths. In his first Major win in Sri Lanka, the 5-year-old dark brown horse out of Admiral of the Fleet (USA) and Belladee (IRE) who had won 6 Stakes in the 9 races he had run in India, emerged a force to reckon with in Sri Lanka as well.
Excitement and anticipation reached a peak on the course as the horses lined up for the Governor’s Cup 2017. The lineup saw a variety of horses from different classes due to the Board of Stewards opening this race to all horses for the first time in 150 years. This most historic and the most prestigious race for every owner started under starters orders exactly at 12.20pm. The Queen of Nuwara Eliya, the legendary Alcazaba was ridden in the most brilliant ride ever given to her by the Indian ace Y.S. Srinath. Srinath maintained Alcazaba in the 5th position till the last 600 meters allowing Santos, Silver Streak, Charlemagne and Kingston Town to dictate terms. Alcazaba shot through in between Charlemagne and Silver Streak like a bullet around 200 meters and took over the running to win the Prestigious Governor’s Cup for the second time in line for Deepthika Jayakody.
In form horse Kingston Town, owned by Hasanga Jayaratne, was showing lot of promise but he too had no answer for the Queen of Nuwara Eliya Alcazaba nor to the class 1 horse silver streak who finished 4 lengths behind the Queen of Nuwara Eliya. Finally, Kingston Town managed only to beat the pacemaker of the race Santos in the last 50 meters to gain the fourth position.
Renowned Fashion Designer Deepthika Jayakody’s Fashion show grabbed all the attention of the stylish audience. ‘RTC Fashion Parade is all about elegance, so the April 29 race day wear collection was inspired by the horse racing elements combined with elegance,' said Deepthika.
The chief guest, Highways and Higher Education minister Lakshman Kiriella and guest of honour Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayaka presented the Governor's Cup while the Deputy British High Commissioner Laura Davis handed over the Queen's Cup to winners.
Another Governors Cup race day finally drew to a close with Glittering ridden by Irvan Singh and owned by Mr. and Mrs. Rienzie Edwards winning the 1400-meter Highway and Higher Education Ministry Cup for Class 3 horses and Eye Touch ridden by A Dilan, winning the 1000-meter Pony Welfare Raffle Cup for ½ bred horses.
