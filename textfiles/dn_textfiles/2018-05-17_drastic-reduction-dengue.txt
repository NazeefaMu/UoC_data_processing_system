Dehiwala – Mt Lavinia MC:
Drastic reduction in dengue

There has been a drastic reduction in the number of dengue patients recorded in the Dehiwala – Mount Lavinia Municipal Council area this year compared to the statistics last year.
This was pointed out by the MoH of the area at a meeting of the Regional Development Committee held recently.
Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faizer Mustapha presided. A press release issued by the Ministry said the MoH, tabling statistics, said 821 patients were recorded during this period last year (2017), but this has reduced to 178 during the corresponding period this year.
This was achieved due to awareness programmes conducted on dengue prevention and the strengthening of street committees on the direction of Minister Mustapha.
