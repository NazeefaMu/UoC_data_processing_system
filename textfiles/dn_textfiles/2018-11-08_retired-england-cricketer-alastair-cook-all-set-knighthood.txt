Retired England cricketer Alastair Cook all set for knighthood

A couple of months ago, English cricket lost one of its greatest cricketers in Alastair Cook, who eventually decided to hang his boots after going through a rough patch over the last one and half years. He made the announcement after the Three Lions’ fourth Test at The Ageas Bowl in Southampton.
Cook made his last international appearance in a Test against India at Kennington Oval in London. In his last match, he churned out a half-century in the first innings followed by a superlative ton in the second innings.
To add to his delight, the Poms won the encounter by a mammoth 118 runs and also bagged the five-match series 4-1. After making his announcement of bidding adieu, the veteran mentioned that he had given everything and had nothing left in the tank.
Recently, it has been learned that the 33-year-old is set to be the youngest cricketing knight. The proposal to award Cook with knighthood has been tabled in the House of Lords. Right Hon Lord Andrew Tyrie, a member of the House of Lords, who tabled a Parliamentary question proposing Cook for a knighthood, praised the experienced campaigner.
“It is not just that Alastair Cook is unquestionably the best batsman England has produced in recent years but that he can make a massive contribution as an ambassador for cricket at home and abroad. Nobody could be more deserving,” Andrew Tyrie was quoted as saying in Metro.
Graham Gooch, Cook’s mentor in Essex at the English domestic circuit also spoke highly about the retired batsman. “Alastair is England’s greatest run-scorer and has played the greatest number of Tests for us making him an all-time great, so it would be fitting for him to be honoured this way. He’s played the game the right way, behaved the right way and set a brilliant example to everyone. He’s excelled in all areas,” Gooch said.
