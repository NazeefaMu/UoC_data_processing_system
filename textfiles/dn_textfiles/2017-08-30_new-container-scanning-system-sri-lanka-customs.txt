New Container Scanning System for Sri Lanka Customs

The ground breaking ceremony for setting up a new Container Scanning System for the Sri Lanka Customs was held last Monday at the Colombo Port premises. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the prevailing Customs legislation is almost 200 years old and it should be modernised to help Sri Lanka become a global trading hub. “In fact, we are in the process of updating many of the archaic laws in other areas as well.” Here Minister Samaraweera breaking ground for the new Container Scanning System at the Colombo Port.
