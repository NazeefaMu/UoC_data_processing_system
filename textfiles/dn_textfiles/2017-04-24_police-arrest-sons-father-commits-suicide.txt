Police arrest sons: father commits suicide

A 52-year-old father of two has committed suicide after his two sons were arrested by the Police on charges of stealing tea from a tea actory in the Galaha area.
He had consumed poison and was found dead a day after his two sons were found guilty to the charges by the Court.
The Superintendent of the Muloya tea estate had handed the two suspects to the Police after they were caught stealing around 18 kg of tea from the factory. The suspects had been employees of the tea estate at the time of the incident. The Court had imposed a Rs.18,000 fine on the two suspects.
