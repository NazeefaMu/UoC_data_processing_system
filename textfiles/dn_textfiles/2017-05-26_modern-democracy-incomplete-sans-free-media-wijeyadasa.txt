Modern democracy incomplete sans free media: Wijeyadasa

Modern democracy is incomplete in today’s context without a free media, people’s participation and constant vigilance, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
“The old definition for democracy says that it consists of the legislature, executive and the judiciary but it is incomplete without a free media, people’s participation and constant vigilance”, he said.
The Minister was addressing the 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium held in association with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka in Negombo yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe emphasized that from the inception of modern democracy, one question that remains unresolved is how to identify the representative that one is going to elect.
He quoted Aristotle, “If there is someone who thinks that he knows everything, but in fact he knows nothing; he has all the making of a politician”. Minister Rajapakshe said that although democracy is imperfect it may through voting, people from all economic backgrounds and social strata can express their viewpoints and help members of the government who best reflect those points of view.
“Elections are used to ensure popular support and legitimacy for those who make governmental decisions. Electoral systems shape the nature of parties and party systems and they affect the behavior of politicians and the strategies of voters. By voting one is making his voice heard and registering his opinion on how he thinks the government should operate”, he said.
He further said that voting and democracy is very important in a nation because it provides people with an opportunity to voice their opinion and vote for what they believe in, it holds elected officials accountable for their behavior while in office, and it prevents a minority from dictating the policies of a minority.
