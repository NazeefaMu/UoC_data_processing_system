For film buffs only

Title: On films seenAuthor: K S SivakumaranPublisher: S GodagePrice: Rs 650 USD 10
Understanding the film medium has become an essential prerequisite. Usually most of us see a film purely for entertainment. The entertainment value in all arts is always there, but its emphasis vary in terms of its purpose. The purpose again is manifold. If we take the film medium as an art form, we find that there are basically three kinds of films: The entertainers termed commercial films, the arty films which are creative and personal statements of filmmakers and the middle cinema which is neither too arty nor too crude as a banal commercial film. Therefore viewing a film can be in many ways. But the real enjoyment of seeing a film can be derived only if we understand the medium thoroughly. Cinema too is a functional art meaning that every component in the film has a definite purpose.
Such is how K S Sivakumaran sees cinema. Reading Sivakumaran is significant as he takes us a few decades back.
For many writers, the dream of a regular newspaper column is as heady as the scent of fresh newsprint. The bad news is that shrinking circulation and bottom-line management are making it tougher for would-be columnists to land coveted spots at large metropolitan dailies.
“It’s probably fair to say that the golden age of the columnist is past,” notes Sam G. Riley, author of The American Newspaper Columnist (Praeger) and a professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. And yet, Riley suggests, if today’s newspapers lack pluck and personality, then “talented columnists are the best antidote.”
The editors of smaller local papers agree—and might be willing to give your column a chance.
Seasoned columnist K S Sivakumaran is a rare media personality whose contribution has reached almost every newspaper of this country in both English and Tamil. ‘On Films Seen’ is a collection of the newspaper columns that Sivakumaran has seen outside Lanka. About 58 films have been reviewed and commented. Some comments on a few Sinhala films appear in his facebook timeline as well as elsewhere.
The purpose of this book – as Sivakumaran aptly mentions – is to enable film buffs who could not have had an opportunity to see some of the films to gather information.
Movie reviews are of paramount importance, content-wise, for a movie buff. Movie reviews should be their content foundation upon which all other content is built upon and around. If there is one thing that you should do consistently, it is reviewing in-theater movies. Movie reviews should be your Number One Priority. Everything else is secondary to that.
David Bordwell suggests in his book Making Meaning, that there are four key components present in film reviews. These components consist of a condensed plot synopsis, background information, a set of abbreviated arguments about the film, and an evaluation.
Generally speaking, when a reviewer is evaluating a film he/she tends to be assessing some, or all, of the following: the motivation for what happens in the film, the film's entertainment value, the film's social relevance and social value, and the film's aesthetic value. If it were easy everyone would be a film critic. It is a great job, most of the time. Unless of course, you are watching a genuinely bad film, the sort that once caused a notable film critic to comment, "That is 90 minutes of my life I can never get back."
Film critics frequently find fault with the film's motivation. That is not to say that they did not like the film's central theme but rather to say that they are looking for the relevance of a particular narrative event, or a justification for a specific action or section of dialogue. Bordwell classifies motivation into four categories: compositional, realistic, intertextual, and artistic. Compositional motivation probes the film's cause-effect logic - that is, does the movie flow logically from one scene to the next. Realistic motivation examines whether the actions that occur within the film are plausible or believable within the realms of the film's fiction. Intertextual motivation examines the relationship between the film and its genre and source material (a novel, a play, etc.) - for example, what would make sense in a musical would not make sense in a western and vice versa. Artistic motivation examines the way a film is made, its use of mise-en-shot and mise-en-scene to achieve a particular artistic look and feel. It is important to note that what is artistically motivated to one reviewer may be distracting to another.
Once again, it all comes down to individual taste. But that individual taste matters when a seasoned columnist like K S Sivakumaran is at it. Which is exactly why, his latest book is worth reading.
