First hijab beauty queen in Miss England final

Sara Iftekhar, a law student from Huddersfield, is one of 50 contestants in the final stages of the Miss England beauty contest.
She is also the first Muslim woman wearing a hijab in the final. Earlier this year, Maria, another Muslim contestant wearing a headscarf, was the first Muslim contestant to enter the competition but Sara, 20, is the first to get this far in the elimination rounds.
She will walk down the catwalk at Kelham Hall in Nottinghamshire, when the winner is decided.
After winning the Miss Huddersfield 2018 and Miss Yorkshire Popularity 2018 contests, Sara has her eyes set on the Miss England title, the woman from the UK who will go on to represent the nation in Miss World.
“Wow, I can’t even comprehend how amazing it felt for my name to be announced as a finalist in the Miss England Finals 2018,” she told her Instagram followers.
“It was an incredible experience and something which I will never be able to forget. The opportunities which I have received with being a finalist in Miss England are opportunities which I would never have thought of, and will forever be grateful for.”
The competition is raising funds for Beauty with a Purpose, a charity that has helped underprivileged children, displaced children in Vietnam and cleft palate teams in South America, Sri Lanka and Russia, as well as people affected by natural disasters.
Sara has used her platform to show support for the charity and set up a Go Fund Me page. On the page, she wrote, “I participated in Miss England 2018 to show that beauty doesn’t have a definition. Everyone is beautiful in their own ways, regardless of their weight, race, colour or shape.”
If Sara wins the title, she’ll be going to Sanya in China to represent England at Miss World. Metro
