NEW YEAR MESSAGES

Decisive year to determine future: Sampanthan
It is a year that could be decisive in determining the future of our country and people.
My hope and prayer, therefore, is that we would unite in the coming New Year, to achieve our dream of building a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka that upholds the dignity and equality of all communities, stated Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Tamil National Alliance Leader in a message marking the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The full text follows:
“I would like to extend my heartiest wishes to all those celebrating the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
“As always, a new year marks a new beginning and brings new hope and expectation for everyone. As a nation, we have a crucial year ahead of us. It is a year that could be decisive in determining the future of our country and people. My hope and prayer, therefore, is that we would unite in the coming new year, to achieve our dream of building a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka that upholds the dignity and equality of all communities.
“I believe, however, that this dream could only be realized through a new constitution. Hence, I call upon all citizens to support the promulgation of the new constitution, ensuring the realization of the dream of a new Sri Lanka.“As we celebrate the new year, I would also like to encourage that we remember our brothers and sisters who are vulnerable, marginalized, and grieving among us.
“They deserve our attention, support, and urgent action.
“May this new year bring true happiness, peace, and prosperity to all.”
Fine example to depict spiritual bondage: Ravi 
I extend my greetings wholeheartedly for Sinhala and Tamil New Year 2017 which is celebrated in an honorable backdrop where people’s supremacy is assured, freedom of expression and freedom for life are secured, stated Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in his message for the New Year.
The message adds: “Having passed several decades of gloomy and agonizing eras, I believe that we are today walking down the red carpet of coexistence and equality.
“Coexistence is not a new concept. We celebrate Sinhala and Tamil New Year together since time immemorial and it is a fine example to depict the spiritual bondage among all Sri Lankans irrespective of their caste, class, creed or race.
“Simultaneously, we know that all of you are patiently tolerating so much hardship by making a lot of commitments for the wellbeing of the future of this country. Wrong decisions and lack of managerial skills in our economy in the past have compelled us to suffer today.
“However, the principle of my life is that any determined person with self-confidence can face any challenge.
“Therefore, let’s face challenges together and let’s stand together.
“May your lives be prosperous and such spiritual strength brings you merriment in this Sinhala and Tamil New Year!”
Festival of happiness: Ekanayake
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year based on the trajectory of sun and moon can be described as the national festival that creates happiness and joy among the common masses, stated State Minister of Lands T. B. Ekanayake.
The message adds: “The dawn of blessed springtime in the month of ‘Bak’ bringing a rich harvest consolidates national unity.
“The New Year ushered in according to auspicious times giving pride of place to customs and traditions creates new hope and aspirations in people’s hearts.”
