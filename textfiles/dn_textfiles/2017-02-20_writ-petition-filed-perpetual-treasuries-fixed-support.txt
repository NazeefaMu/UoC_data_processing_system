Writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries fixed for support

 
A writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Private Limited, seeking an Interim Order restraining the Central Bank from taking action under the directives issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, was today (20) fixed for support on March 3 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah directed the petitioners to serve notice on Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Monetary Board of Central Bank and two other respondents to appear before the Court on the said date.
The petition, filed by Perpetual Treasuries (Private) Limited - a primary dealer in government securities - Perpetual Asset Management (Private) Limited and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Private) Limited, through Counsel G.G. Arulpragasam seeks to quash the directives made by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank dated November 7, 2016 in respect of the Perpetual Treasuries.
The petitioners stated that the directions issued on November 7, 2016 is unprecedented regulatory control over a primary dealer by the Monetary Board, and is wholly disproportionate to violations and regulatory concerns cited in the petition.
The petitioners have said the directions are unlawful, unreasonable, unjustifiable, arbitrary and capricious and are in violation of legitimate expectations of Perpetual Treasuries and were imposed without a fair hearing.
The petitioners stated that the directions were issued beyond the scope of Regulation 11(2) of the Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No.01 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009 Regulations No.01 of 2009 dated June 24, 2009.
The petitioners also stated it is not possible to sustain operations without the risk of bankruptcy and all attempts to seek redress, clarification or relief have been largely ignored by the respondents and that the petitioner has no other recourse than to seek relief from Court.
The Monetary Board of Central Bank had issued directives against Perpetual Treasuries that was involved in controversial bond deals.
President's Counsel Nihal Fernando with S.A. Parathalingam PC appeared for the petitioners.
Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the Central Bank and the Attorney General.
