Grade 5 scholarship allowance upped

Cabinet approval was granted to increase the allowance paid to low-income Grade Five Scholarship holders, according to a proposal by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.

About 15,000 Grade Five Scholarship holders will obtain this allowance annually from the government, Minister Kariyawasam told the Daily News.
He added that a proposal would be forwarded to the Cabinet next week to consider the possibility of increasing the number of scholarship winners who could get the allowance.
