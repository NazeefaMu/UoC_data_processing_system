Jumbo issue tramples rural lives in Hambantota

Hambantota District Secretary W.H .Karunaratne said 400 to 500 wild elephants were invading the villages in the district in search of food as they had lost their natural habitats.
The Divisional Secretary was addressing the Hambantota District Agricultural Committee meeting held recently.
Karunaratne said deforestation for the sake of development and human activities worsen the situation.
He said two wild elephants entered Walasmulla and Weeraketiya and four invaded Ambalantota and suburbs and villagers were undergoing severe difficulties as a result.
District Secretary said wild elephants entered villages in fear of fire crackers. "Instead of firing crackers, villagers must assist Wildlife officers to tackle the issue," he said.
"An electric fence was erected covering Hambantota, Tissamaharamaya, Suriyawewa and Angunukolapelessa on the request of the people but wild elephant invade villages as the fence was not properly maintained," he said.
Hambantota Range Wildlife Office J.A.P. Wijeyakumara said people get together to get rid of the shortcomings arising from the human activities.
He said small forests near villages should be cleared to remove wild elephants. Vijayakumara said an area from Hambantota to Mattala were reserved to manage wild elephants but it was not gazetted.
Therefore, people enter the area and clear the jungle, burn it, and hunt wild animals and chase the elephants. "The elephants enter the villages and a limited number of officers at the Hambantota Wildlife Office cannot carry out their duty properly," he said.
