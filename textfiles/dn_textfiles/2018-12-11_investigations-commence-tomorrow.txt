Unruly incidents in Parliament
Investigations commence tomorrow

The Special Parliamentary Committee appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuirya to investigate into the unruly incidents in the Chamber on November 14, 15 and 16 will have its first meeting at 10 am on Wednesday.
The reports on estimates of the damages to Parliament equipment carried out by Parliament and the Insurance Company would be presented to the committee on Wednesday, Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri told the Daily News yesterday.
The six-member Committee headed by the Deputy Speaker includes MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Bimal Ratnayake, Mavai Senadhiraja, Ranjith Maddumabandara and Chandrasiri Gajadheera. The committee will go through the CCTV footage of the Chamber and will conduct a comprehensive investigation on the misbehavior of MPs.
Once the investigation is over the Committee will present its findings to the Speaker. Attacking Police personnel and MPs with water mixed with chilli powder and a wooden chair, sneaking in a knife into the Chamber, pouring water on the Speaker’s Chair, damaging the microphones on the Speaker’s table, hurling the copies of the Constitution and other books at MPs, exchanging fisticuffs, hurling abuses at the Chair and conducting mock sittings were some of the indecent witnessed in Parliament on November 14, 15 and 16.
The Police are conducting a separate investigation into those violent incidents. The six-member committee was appointed on November 29.
