No Messi, problem as Argentina down Chile

Santa Clara, Tuesday: Argentina shrugged off the injury absence of Lionel Messi to launch their Copa America Centenario campaign with a 2-1 defeat of defending champions Chile here Monday.
Goals from Angel Di Maria and Ever Banega secured a deserved three points for Argentina, who exacted sweet revenge for their defeat to the Chileans in last year’s Copa America final.
Chile substitute Jose Fuenzalida scored an injury time consolation for the holders.
The Argentines will now be firm favorites to progress to the quarter-finals as Group D winners with games against Panama and Bolivia to come.
Injured Argentina captain Messi watched from the substitutes’ bench at Levi’s Stadium after failing to recover in time from a sore back suffered in a friendly win over Honduras last month.
But the Barcelona superstar’s absence was barely noticeable, with Nicolas Gaitan slotting into Argentina’s attack and making an instant impression, hitting the woodwork with a header after only two minutes.
That missed chance set the tone for the early exchanges of an entertaining first half which saw Argentina create the lion’s share of opportunities without managing to find a breakthrough goal.
Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo was the next to test Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, unleashing a dipping shot from 20 yards which the Barcelona stopper comfortably saved in the 17th minute.
In midfield meanwhile a fascinating battle for supremacy was unfolding between Argentina’s rugged enforcer Javier Mascherano and Chile’s combative Bayern Munich star Arturo Vidal.
Vidal did not wait long to make his mark on the contest, crashing into the back of Gaitan with an ugly challenge to earn a yellow card from Uruguayan referee Daniel Fedorczuk.Chile, fielding the core of their victorious Copa America side, gradually grew into the game.
But it was Argentina who continued to look the more threatening and they might have taken the lead on 22 minutes after a lightning fast counter-attack. AFP
