CPJ finds intimidation of journalists ‘worrisome’

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on opposition politicians in Sri Lanka to stop intimidating foreign journalists in the aftermath of the New York Times article that accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of receiving 7.6 million USD in campaign contributions from the Chinese government.
CPJ’s Asia Program Coordinator, Steven Butler, expressed concern regarding politicians singling out
Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan, the New York Times correspondents who assisted with reporting from Sri Lanka.
Butler said that politicians have the right to dispute the findings of a news report, but called the public
accusations leveled against Bastions and Wamanan, “a worrisome development in a country noted for attacks on journalists and unsolved journalist murders.” Butler asked that all political parties in Sri Lanka “publicly affirm support for press freedom and journalists’ safety.”
Meanwhile, the Foreign Correspondents Association (FCA) of Sri Lanka released a statement
condemning Members of Parliament for “publicly vilifying” the writers of the report. The FCA urged politicians who have issues with the report to follow the norm of expressing their dissent through editors as opposed to intimidating journalists.
The statements come after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accused the New York Times journalists of being tools of the current government and after a Member of Parliament reportedly showed a photo of one of the journalists at a press conference.
