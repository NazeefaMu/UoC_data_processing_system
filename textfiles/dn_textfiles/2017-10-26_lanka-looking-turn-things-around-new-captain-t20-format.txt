Lanka looking to turn things around with new captain in T20 format

Wednesday: Sri Lanka with a new T20 International captain Thisara Perera will be hoping to turn things around in what has so far been a fluctuating tour for them in the UAE.
When Sri Lanka beat Pakistan 2-0 in the Test series the impression given to everyone was that the team had put back the previous defeats and turned the corner and they would carry on the form into the ODIs as well. But unfortunately no. The five ODIs proved a disaster as Sri Lanka were whitewashed 5-0 to suffer that ignominy for the third time this year (the first two being at the hands of South Africa and India).
Now with several of the ODI players including the T20I captain Upul Tharanga pulling out of the T20 side as they were not happy going to Lahore to play in the third T20I of the three-match series, the national selectors appointed hard hitting fast bowling all-rounder Thisara Perera to lead a squad of 16 players that includes seven players who had been part of the ODI squad and excludes eight (including injured Angelo Mathews) from the squad selected for the one-off T20 against India but who have shown concern in travelling to Lahore.
“I believe in my team and think we can give a good challenge to Pakistan,” said Perera in his inaugural press conference with the media yesterday.
“We have good talent and young players. In this kind of team, I believe we can do something special, better than the ODIs,” he said.
“I have given 100 per cent to my team players. If they are playing this series, they don’t need to fear, just give 100 per cent.
“I’ve already spoke to them, and told them this is a good opportunity for everyone. If we do perform well, this can be a turning point in their lives,” Perera said.
Perera who was an integral part of the ODI side was of the view that every team goes through a lean phase and that Sri Lanka would come out of it soon.
“Every team has at times failures. It is part of the game. The selectors and I have given these new players 100 per cent confidence. Don’t be a selfish player, but give 100 per cent of what you have to the team.”
“It is an honour to represent my country, especially as captain. It is a new challenge for me, and my team,” said Perera who will be captaining a team for the first time in his cricket career. A product of St Joseph’s College, Colombo, Perera who played his cricket at school alongside Angelo Mathews, Dimuth Karunaratne and Roshen Silva said that he missed out captaining his school when the age limit was lowered to 19.
“I have not had the opportunity to lead any team except be vice-captain to Dinesh Chandimal.”
Sri Lanka’s T20 International record for the year is not as bad as their ODIs.
They have won two away series 2-1 in Australia and South Africa, drawn one-all at home with Bangladesh and lost a one-off T20I at home to India.
So overall they have 5-4 win record in 9 matches.
However not much can be said about their bilateral ties with Pakistan where they trail 5-10.
“T20 is one format where you can’t say one team is favourite. Our focus is on the first match as it is always important to start on a high and then target the remaining matches,” said a confident Pakistani skipper Sarfraz Ahmed.
“I know a lot of these new players who have come into the Lankan team. I know them as I have played against them when they were with the ‘A’ team. I know Mahela Udawatte, (Danushka) Gunathilaka and (Isuru) Udana. T20 is a different form of the game and whoever plays better on the day will win. It will be an interesting series and fans will be able to see good cricket,” he said.
Pakistan will be strengthened by the return of their star bowler Mohammad Amir from injury. Amir missed the ODI series but his absence was not felt when newcomers Ruuman Raees and Usman Khan Shinwari turned up with match winning performances.
“It is good that whichever players we are giving chances are performing and it shows how much talent we have in Pakistan cricket. All the players selected are looking to prove a point,” said Sarfraz.
“Usman Shinwari came and performed, Faheem Ashraf also performed so it is good that we have a strong bench strength and it has become difficult to decide which bowlers have to be included and whom to be rested,” he said.
