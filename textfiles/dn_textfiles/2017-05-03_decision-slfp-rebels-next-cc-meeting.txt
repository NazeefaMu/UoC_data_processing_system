Decision on SLFP rebels at next CC meeting

A decision on taking disciplinary action against the SLFP members who did not turn up at the SLFP May Day rally in Gatambe will be made at the next Central Committee meeting, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
However, the CC members have not yet been informed of the date of next CC meeting. “The attendance to Getambe rally was made compulsory to all SLFP members. The CC will have to take a decision on those who failed to do that,” Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
However Social Welfare Minister S B Dissanayake said the unity of SLFP is what matters at this hour, adding that the internal disputes within the party would only benefit the other rival parties. He added the party’s division is detrimental to the country and its people.
A number of SLFP and UPFA bigwigs including Parliamentarians Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Dullus Alahapperuma, Kumara Welgama, Udaya Gammanpila, Mahindanana Aluthgamage, C. B Ratnayake, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Bandula Gunawardena, S. M. Chandrasena, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Gamini Lokuge, Jayantha Samaraweera, Chamal Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa, Roshan Ranasinghe, Dilum Amunugama, Lohan Ratwatte, Prasanna Ranatunga participated at the Joint Opposition’s May Day Rally on Monday.
