Boom times last with a joyful blast from the past!

My last two columns on ‘Baby Boomers’ certainly appear to have sparked a good deal of hot deliberation among readers, if the written responses I received are anything to go by. Both columns for some reason prompted an unprecedented deluge of mail. Among the first to respond was my brother Denis who usually introduces himself and me, his journalist sibling as: “Hi! I’m Denis and this is my brother the menace!”
Denis teasingly claims that he buys this newspaper on Tuesdays mostly for the Crossword. But now that the crossword has not appeared for a considerable period his excuse is that he buys it through habit. He states in his latest missive which I quote verbatim: “Your last two columns would certainly have given the reader a real feel for what daily life was like for all Sri Lankans living in that decade, especially for kids growing up then.
Thanks so much for bringing up memories of our crazy past world that seems to have disappeared. It astonishes me how much has changed. In all, your pieces were a delightfully therapeutic blast from the past.”
My old schoolmate Andrew, who we nicknamed AndyPandy had this to say: “Thank you Gaston, old buddy, for taking us on a journey back in time which will touch each and every member of the post-war baby-boomer generation and remind them of their own journey through life. I thoroughly enjoyed both columns as they brought back so many fun memories of an earlier time and place in our country. Those times in our lives were so free and easy. You captured this freedom with vivid descriptions and wonderful wit.”
Here’s another from a lovely lifelong family friend, Yves: “Dear Gasto, I must express my appreciation for your enchanting recent columns providing a stroll down memory lane. Thank you for allowing us to escape to a gentler time, a simpler place. As usual I loved the content, loved the writing style.”
It is possible that I may have been overwhelmed by nostalgia by penning some nostalgic cameos of the past.
After all, we all know that feeling when those spacious times seemed beautiful and there is an uncontrollable longing to belong to an era that has already passed. Most of us romance our carefree childhood and want to relive those special moments every now and then. There is no gainsaying the fact that this nation, its politics, its economy and our whole way of life have changed beyond recognition and there is no going back. But we need to remember the past and learn from it. Kids today have grown up never knowing what things were like before modern technology changed our lives forever. But we do remember when these everyday things were the latest and the greatest.
Do you remember the time when little boys wore navy blue tussore shorts and white socks all year round and little girls wore white uniforms with the school initials and logo embossed on them complemented with the popular white ‘tennis shoes’ or ‘sneakers?.’ Only girls had pierced ears then. Much to the annoyance of the girls I uncharitably called the girls’ shoes ‘Sloppy Tennisuns.’ We learned to write decent cursive sentences with G-nib pens stuck on wooden holders which we dipped in ink wells and learned from ‘The Royal Copy Book’. That is obviously why we can string sentences together, spell and have proper conversations now because of a solid three R’s education.Many of us remember our first primers, ‘The Radiant Way,’ a series of four books, written in a novel way to develop in the child a liking towards what he or she was learning. It had mellowed the various approaches to teaching the English language speech sounds for proper pronunciation, short sentences to understand language conceptualism through illustrations and exercise. Stories and tales had been selected bearing in mind the child's very limited vocabulary so as not to irk the student of this level.
Not long ago I was invited to my grand-daughter Moya’s school to talk to her class and parallel classes about what school and life were like when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s. The presentation was for a hall-full of eight-year-olds. What caught the children’s attention most was that we never had computers, the internet, iPads, iPhones or any digital devices and back then, if you were naughty at school, you got the cane. I was reluctant to be too specific about the sort of punishment we Baby Boomers copped as kids. It was the sort of treatment that would now constitute a criminal offence. Back in the day though the cane was considered an important tool to maintain discipline, and discipline and the fear of the Almighty were the two things the Christian Brothers belted into us without fear or favour.
It was my belief then, that education came in a poor third. Discipline was strict. It was quite common for a disruptive child to be rapped over the knuckles, on the buttocks or on the palm of the hand with a wooden foot ruler. In boys’ schools our teachers hit us with rattan canes and threw the blackboard duster or a chunk of chalk at us if they thought we weren’t concentrating.
It is true that there was not much margin for error in that time and place and corporal punishment even for the slightest infraction was the norm.
British-style formal caning was fully lawful in Ceylon schools then and strongly supported by the government. Most of the country’s secondary schools used the cane, which was a significant element in the disciplinary system. But such punishment rarely fitted the crime and provided a free rein for appalling abuse by many tyrannical pedagogues.
In retrospect, on the surface the boomers may have appeared to be a frivolous lot living in a perpetual state of prolonged adolescence clinging to the things that connected us to our youth, like our classic rock music, and weird fads. Perhaps our fixation with the past is what keeps us young at heart and inspires us to defy time and age so we can, as we used to say, ‘Keep on Rockin.’
Sure, sometimes our actions were misguided, and we often lost our way taking dark roads of excess that led to pain, ruin and some monstrously horrible fashions. But for a time, we stood together as one and discovered the power of unity and for better or worse, changed the status quo. And while some may argue with our generation’s grandiose view of itself, others will join us in saluting our cherished legacy with our ostentatious cry, “Say it loud: I’m a boomer and I’m proud!”
