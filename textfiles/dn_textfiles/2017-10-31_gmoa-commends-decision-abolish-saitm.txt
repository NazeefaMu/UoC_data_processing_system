GMOA commends decision to abolish SAITM

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) had sent a letter to the President requesting an appointment for a meeting in order to inform him the GMOA’s stand (in detail) on SAITM solution presented by the Government, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said during the meeting with the President, the GMOA also expects to discuss the unclear facts mentioned in the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue.
“It is commendable that the Government decided to abolish SAITM, remove the ownership of SAITM from its current owner and his family and to legalize the minimum standards of Medical Education according to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) document. The GMOA will extend his fullest support to implement the set of proposals (with certain amendments), Dr. Aluthge said.
“But it is very confusing the proposed new institution to be set up after abolishing SAITM. Whatever new institution must obtain the compliance certificate from the SLMC. This new institution should be scrutinised by a state body.
The `Government / State Policy’ mentioned in the Government’s statement is not clear at all.
An Interim Committee should be appointed under the SLMC immediately to look into the issue of current students in SAITM. The country’s law should be implemented against the current SAITM owner for all grave offences executed by him so far,” the GMOA Secretary added.
