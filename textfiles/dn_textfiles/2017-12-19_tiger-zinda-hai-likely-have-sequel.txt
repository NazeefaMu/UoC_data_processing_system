Tiger Zinda Hai likely to have a sequel

‘Tiger’ franchise’s second installment is all set to release this week. The film will see Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan’s reunion after five years.
During an event, Salman Khan revealed about the third installment of the ‘Tiger’ Franchise, he said, “If Ali (Abbas Zafar- director) or Kabir (Khan- filmmaker) decide, then maybe next year we’ll (Salman and Katrina will) be back.”
Helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar under the banner of Yash Raj Films, ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’ is scheduled to release on December 22, 2017.
Earlier this year, during an interview Ali Abbas Zafar spoke about the aura of Salman Khan on silver screens, he stated, “Actually, anyone will fall for bhai. Woh ankh utha kar dekhte hai, to sabko unsey pyaar ho jata hai (The moment he lifts his eyes and looks at you, you are surely going to fall in love with him).”
The film involves some crucial but perilous action sequences. Talking about the same Ali Abbas Zafar said, “Tiger’s encounter with the wolves marks one of the most important chapters in the film. The idea was to do something which has never been seen on the Indian screen and give Tiger’s character an edge. This is a very dramatic chase and action sequence that Tiger has with a pack of real wolves.”
Hopefully, the film will manage to create a storm at the box office. Until then, fingers crossed for the sequel of ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’.
After ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’, Salman Khan will be next featured in ‘Race 3’ opposite Jacqueline Fernandez, whereas, Katrina Kaif will be seen in ‘Thugs Of Hindostan’ with Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Fatima Sana Sheikh.
