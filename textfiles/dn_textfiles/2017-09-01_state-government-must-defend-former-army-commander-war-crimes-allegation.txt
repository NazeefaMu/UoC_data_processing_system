State, Government must defend former Army Commander from war crimes allegation: Champika

The State and the Government should intervene on behalf of Former Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of the Sri Lankan Army Jagath Jayasuriya to defeat the war crimes allegations levelled against him by a South American Human Rights Organization, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing a media conference held yesterday at the JHU office.
"The Sri Lankan military defeated the LTTE in 2009 putting an end to the killings of civilians and armed groups. Even the countries such as the USA, France, who considered LTTE as liberators are now experiencing cruelty of terrorism," he said.
The Minister urged the Tamil communities not to promote any attempt that destroy peace and reconciliation of the country.
Commenting on the incident of distributing leaflets in the North claiming that the LTTE was still in operation and was planning to revive its operations, Minister Ranawaka said such incidents occurred during past few years after defeating the LTTE.
He stressed the necessity of suppressing any attempt of destroying prevailing reconciliation of the country cold kindheartedly.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana spoke.
