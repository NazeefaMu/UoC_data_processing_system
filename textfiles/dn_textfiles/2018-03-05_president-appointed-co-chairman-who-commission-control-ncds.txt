President appointed Co-chairman of WHO commission to control NCDs

President Maithripala Sirisena is among the five international figures appointed as Co-chairmen of a leading Independent World Health Organisation Commission to control non-communicable diseases.
The other four international figures are the President of Finland, President of Uruguay, Health Minister of the Russian Federation and a former Minister of Pakistan. The Commission is vested with the responsibility of making practical recommendations towards controlling non-communicable diseases to achieve sustainable development targets.
A Health Ministry release said President Sirisena has relegated his functions as Co-chairman of the Commission to Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
As a first step in this direction, Dr. Senaratne exchanged information relating to the control of non-communicable diseases with other member countries of the co-chair on Skype last Saturday.
