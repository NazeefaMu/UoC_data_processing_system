Medical students’ parents to launch hunger strike

The parents of medical students are to launch a hunger strike demanding an immediate solution for the SAITM issue.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals’ Association in Colombo yesterday Government Indigenous Medicine Officers Association Chairman Dr. Nimal Karunasiri said this was a crucial month for the SAITM issue which drags on for long time and a special summit would take place in Colombo on October 29 to announce the date to commence the hunger strike.
Dr. Karunasiri said the strike would be launched by the parents of state medical students along with SAITM medical students’ parents.
“The President and the Prime Minister cannot be silent now. It is questionable why two ministers protect a businessman.” he said.
SAITM Medical Faculty Parents’ Forum Convener Gemunu Wijeratne said the parents could sacrifice their lives for their children. “If a medical student commit suicide, the whole responsibility goes to the Government,” he said.
A written request with four main demands handed over to the President and the Prime Minister to resolve the SAITM issue. “My child is waiting in SAITM for seven years now. The issue should be resolved in this way or the other.
“I am a trade union leader and I can pressurise the Government,” he said.
