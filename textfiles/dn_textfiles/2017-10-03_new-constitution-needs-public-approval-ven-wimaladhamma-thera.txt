New Constitution needs public approval: Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera

The proposed new Constitution after being adopted by Parliament with a two thirds’ majority, should be placed before the people at a Referendum to seek their approval as it is the most appropriate thing to do, said Ven. Dimbukumbure Wimaladhamma Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera said a copy of the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms submitted to Parliament had been reviewed by him too.
The Anunayake Thera said this during the course of an Anusasana when Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene called on him at the Malwattee Viharaya and received his blessings on September 29.
The Anunayake Thera said the government had still not formulated a draft Constitution bill and what had been tabled was only an interim report of the Steering Committee. But some detractors were trying to whip up public opinion by giving a wrong picture about it to the country.
He said he never believed that the government would introduce a new Constitution inimical to the national interest. If that happened, the Maha Sangha would strongly oppose it. But he did not condone efforts made by certain sectors of the Maha Sangha to dabble in politics and trying to propagate political agendas of certain parties.
He said he will study the interim report and announce his observations on it to the country.
