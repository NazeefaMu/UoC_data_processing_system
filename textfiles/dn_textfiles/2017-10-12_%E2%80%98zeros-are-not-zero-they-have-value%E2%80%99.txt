‘Zeros are not zero, they have value’

Great leaders should not rule by fear, but always rule by respect, said Anura Perera, Division Director, Toastmasters International District 82 Sri Lanka/India.
“Not even the leader should be above the rules and if they do wrong they should get the same punishment that is meted to other employees and create an environment where everyone feels equal, ” Perera said.
He made these remarks when he was invited to deliver a special speech at the Vancouver Entrepreneurs Toastmasters Club in Canada, recently. He spoke on 'Zero are not zeros, they have value'.
He also said that youngsters should have goals and work towards them.
“When I was young like you, I had a goal, and I always wanted to achieve it. I started working in 1980 and started my Toastmastering career as a zero in 2014 end.” “Normally zeroes are zeros, but they have value. Through commitment and hard work, today I have I progressed to become an Administrative Secretary of the Free Trade Zone Manufacturers Association.”
“In team sports, you have captains and rules; in business we have leaders and teams at different levels. If you want to be a good leader, you have to walk the talk.”
He said it’s very important for youth aged between 15 to 24, (60% of total youth population live in Asia) to get engaged and enabled and to contribute to the development process in their countries.
He also said in this world nothing is impossible. “Scientists send astronauts to the moon and now they are trying to go to beyond the moon.
If you think you can, you can. Never underestimate your ability as you've got some kind of talent in you to be a future leader.”
He said being a Toastmaster helps to build a person’s character, bring out leadership qualities in a person and would also help to improve the public speaking knowledge which is very important for the future.”
“If you become a Toastmaster and you become a good public speaker, this would mould you to become a good leader."
