Wiping out corruption indication of good governance- SB

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said that the measures taken by the President to wipe out fraud and corruption is a good indication of good governance.
He said that both major parties of the Government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have unanimously agreed to take action jointly for the eradication of fraud and corruption. That is a fruitful measure for safeguarding the qualities of good governance.
The Minister further said that people had doubt whether the government would not take any action against the people who were responsible for the Treasury bond issue. He made this comment recently at the Kiwullinda area of the Pahatha Hewaheta Electorate.
“When we took action against the responsible persons of the Treasury bond issue, certain persons thought and predicted that there would be clashes within the government. There is no truth in those predictions and the aim of the government is to create a society without fraud and corruption,” the minister said. He further added that the UNP has clearly understood that the action taken by the President on the Treasury bond issue is not against any person but against fraud and corruption. Therefore, the UNP also supports the ongoing process of wiping out fraud and corruptions.
