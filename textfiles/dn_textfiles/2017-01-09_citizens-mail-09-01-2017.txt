It is disheartening to find that education in Sri Lanka has mostly turned out to be a private enterprise in spite of free education introduced by late C.W.W. Kannangra. Both the poor and rich people used to enjoy the free education in government schools for quite a long time. So, it was a blessing for Sri Lankan children in educational field. Since education was freely available to all from primary level to University level, there has been a tremendous development among the less privileged people of the country.
But, the new trend in privatisation of both academic and technological education has created a lot of problems among the poor section of the people. Because of fashion for foreign imported high rated courses, the affluent parents admit their children to international private schools are pursuing such attractive courses without basic education.
As a consequence the less income earners too try to admit their children to the money motive private educational enterprises by getting loans on payment of interest. What I would like to stress is that the Government should restore the period of Kannangara’s free education system in the present Yahapalanaya introduced by President and the Prime Minister as soon as possible.
The educational planners should embark on implementation of a uniform system of education where every one must enjoy free education with free books and free uniforms. Then only the real objectives of education will be fulfilled in our democratic country. Education for all without discrimination must be available in our country.
