Captain Tissa Wimalasena further remanded

Two suspects including Captain Tissa Wimalasena, the driver and security officer of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until July 18 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court for allegedly operating an illegal quarry on a government-owned land in the Koratota area causing a loss of Rs. 29 million to the government.
Two suspects Tissa Wimalasena and Lal Priyantha Peiris, a former member of Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha, were arrested by the FCID under the provisions of the Public Property Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The suspects were charged with having operated a rock quarry, situated at the Land Reclamation Commission, claiming that it belonged to the Maga Neguma project.
When the case came up before Additional Magistrate Chanima Wijebandara, the Additional Magistrate refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail.
Meanwhile, the second suspect yesterday informed Court that he is ready to make a special statement before the Magistrate regarding the incident.
The Additional Magistrate is to consider this request on the next hearing date.
