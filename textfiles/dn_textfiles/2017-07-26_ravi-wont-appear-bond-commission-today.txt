Ravi won't appear before Bond Commission today

 
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayakes’ Counsel informed the Bond Commission that Karunanayake is unable to appear before the Commission today due to a Security Council meeting.
The Counsel further informed that Karunanayake will appear before the commission on August 2.
The Treasury Bond Commission issued a notice last week summoning Minister Ravi Karunanayake to testify before the Commission.
