MTI’s M&A unit links Grants Advertising with Dentsu Aegis

MTI Consulting, as part of a regional initiative, are intensifying their Corporate Finance/M&A practice in Sri Lanka.
“The growth of the Sri Lankan economy and the consequent search by high potential local companies to link with international strategic investors is increasingly evident and enabling us to intensify our in-country Corporate Finance/M&A practice,” said Hilmy Cader, CEO of MTI Consulting.

MTI Corporate Finance is the corporate finance arm of MTI Consulting, a boutique strategy consultancy with a network of associates across Asia, Africa and Middle East. MTI Corporate Finance provides a comprehensive range of services, including due diligence, feasibility studies, funding new businesses or capitalisation of existing ones – from IPOs to private placement facilitation, M&A facilitation, and advisory on governance, compliances and risk management.
For organizations in an inorganic growth phase or those in proactive search for new opportunities as part of their growth strategy, MTI facilitates the development of a strategic roadmap for mergers and acquisitions.
MTI also provides highly in-depth and comprehensive insight and analysis of equity investment opportunities, assisting investors in their decision-making process, and allowing them to capitalize on available opportunities. MTI’s Equity and Debt: Structuring and Sourcing ensures consistent growth by developing an optimal capital structure with regard to the specific requirements, scale and nature of the organization, followed by the pursuit of cost-effective sources of funding. By taking a systematic approach to assess the risks an organization is subject to (with regard to, for instance, a growing body of legislation, or dealing with an increased number of stakeholders), MTI proposes remedial action to enhance an organization’s governance, risk management and compliance.
