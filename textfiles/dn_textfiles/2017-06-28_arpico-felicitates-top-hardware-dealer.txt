I therefore extend my heartiest thanks to the entire team who has worked hard to strengthen this brand promise” he said. Further elaborating on these prospects, Director Distribution of the LMD sector of Richard Pieris & Company, Shantha Kularatna stated, “the local construction industry has witnessed exponential growth this past year and I have no doubt that it will continue to grow.”
Commenting on Arpico dealer network's formidable performance, Head of Sales at Richard Pieris & Company, Duminda Perera said, “Our dealer network plays a vital role in taking our top-quality products to a large customer base across the island. It is not without their valuable support that we could have achieved such strong growth over the past year.”
