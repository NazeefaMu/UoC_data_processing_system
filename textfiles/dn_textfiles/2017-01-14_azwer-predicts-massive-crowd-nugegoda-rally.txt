Azwer predicts massive crowd at Nugegoda rally

A massive crowd from all districts will assemble at Nugegoda on January 27 to show a strength of power against the so called Yaha Palanaya, which had failed to keep up to the promises it gave the people at elections, and also against the anti-Muslim campaign it carries on, former minister AHM Azwer said, addressing a meeting in Battaramulla.
He said since the government refused to listen to the woes of the Muslim ministers and MPS on problems faced by the community like the re-settlement problems of Jaffna and Mannar Muslims, the absence of a Muslim – and also a Tamil – representative in the Archeological Commission appointed by the President, the continued attack on Muslim places of worship – over 60 instances have been reported and documented – the forceful occupation of Pottanai Ziyaram in Akkaraipattu and the Mosque and land belonging to a 70-year-old Muslim woman, the Muslim Pressive Front invites Muslims to join hands with Mahinda Rajapaksa to chart out a future programme for their wellbeing, he said.
