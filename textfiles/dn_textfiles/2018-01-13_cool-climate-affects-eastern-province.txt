An unusual cool climate is prevailing in the Eastern part of Sri Lanka.Schoolchildren wear coarse clothing and coats and attendance in many schools in these areas was reported to be less, school authorities said.
Death rates of the elderly people in the coastal areas too are reported to be increasing. Five or six deaths on a day are recorded in coastal villages mainly due to elderly people unable to bear the cold.
The weather condition lasts till noon and prevails in the afternoon. Farmers await rain and if this weather condition prevails, they have to abandon paddy cultivation.
