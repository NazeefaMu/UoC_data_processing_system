‘Little Kalu’   Cricketing  Craftsman from  Moratuwa

When he got going he was dynamite. Bowlers could not find the right line or length to bowl to him, as with classy footwork and strokes all round the wicket he tore into the bowlers with disdain to accumulate his runs that flowed like the Duninda Falls
That was ROMESH SHANTHA KALUWITHARNE who took to the game when he was knee high to a bat at the school in Moratuwa St.Sebastian’s College.
He came under the care of high class coaching by Brother Gurusinghe. Bro. Gurusinghe, a cricket fanatic and who had the knack of spotting an uncut cricketing gem when he saw it, quickly spotted the young man and quickly cut and polished it . The outcome was a gem of a wicket keeper/batsman in KALUWITHARNE.
Moratuwa is a town famous for wood craftsmen and pop singers. But KALUWITHARNE was a different kind of craftsman. He was a magnificent craftsman with bat in hand and would cleverly and craftily cut and destroy bowlers with stroke play that was lapped up by those watching with awe and admiration.
Fantastic and promising
After a fantastic and promising career in school scoring heavily in inter–school cricket, he walked into the Sri Lanka team as a wicket keeper batsman in 1992 when 'Captain Cool' Arjuna Ranatunga was at the helm of affairs and immediately served notice of the talent that was oozing in him by slamming a magnificent unbeaten 132 with 26 boundaries against Allan Border’s Australians at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in a Test match on debut in 1992.
I was present at that match and watched in amazement the dash and daring of the young man as he walked in like a General and began to heap misery on bowlers of the caliber of Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney, Shane Warne, Greg Mathews and Border. Here he was cutting, driving and lofting in an innings that he will not probably repeat. The spectators and the writer were lucky to enjoy and bask in the sunlight that Kalu dazzled us with.
That Test was nicely poised for Sri Lanka to wrap up a memorable and exciting victory, thanks to this great knock from KALUVITHARNE. But it was inexplicable the ugly manner in which the batting crumbled in the second innings when chasing a comparatively easy target.
Victory written all over
Going into the final day, there was victory written all over it and I wrote my ‘COMMENT’ column headlined – A game is not won or lost till the final ball is bowled – reminding the cricketers about this axiom. And that the Sri Lanka cricketers just collapsed in a heap to hand the Australians a victory that they were convinced was not going to be theirs was to say the least inexplicable and unacceptable. What was also memorable in that Test was that it was in that game that the famous leg spinning sensation SHANE WARNE launched his phenomenal career.
Another unforgettable knock that KALUWITHARNE produced was in Carisbrook, Dunedin, New Zealand in 1997 when he made 103 against New Zealand. I was there covering that series too for the 'DN' and 'SO' in the company of cheer leader Lionel Navaragodagedera ‘the legend’ and did not Lionel cheer himself hoarse proudly sporting the Lion Flag urging ‘the little dynamite’ ‘to keep exploding and bashing the Kiwi bowlers. Seeing this gallant innings from ‘ Little Kalu’, coachformer Australian off spinning all rounder Bruce Yardley described it as a gem and that he was fortunate to watch it being played.
To veer away and a little anecdote about Lionel. Exhausted after vociferously cheering KALUWITHARNE, Lionel found a cosy chair for a little rest and unknowingly fell asleep. An alert photographer from a leading newspaper in NZ got a picture of Lionel snoring away and the pic was carried the next morning with the caption –Lionel the legend caught napping – This copy was shown to us by our Tea Commissioner in New Zealand Mohammed Iqbal and did not everyone enjoy a hearty laugh. Lionel looked embarrassed worried whether the local papers would repeat that picture.
Dash and daring
KALUWIHARNE was all dash and daring in on-day game. With ‘Black Superman’ Sanath Jayasuriya he formed a feared opening pair and was at his best in the 1995/96 World Cup when the pair slogged and slaved all bowlers and added a new dimension to the game by going over the top in the first 15 overs and collecting a harvest of runs which paved the way for the winning of the World Cup.
Teams playing in that World Cup were flummoxed and watched helplessly as the pair put on show their heroics.
As a gloveman he was second to none. He had quick reflexes took the snicks that came be it off the pacemen or spinners and batsmen who ventured out of the crease were stranded as ‘KALU’ whipped off the bails like lightning.
His career was cut short when another legend Kumar Sangakkara began taking centre stage.
KALUWITHARNE’S career – TESTS 49 –RUNS 1933 – HIGHEST 132 no – HUNDREDS 3 - FIFTIES 9. ODIs 189 – RUNS 3711 – HIGHEST 102 – HUNDRED 2 – FIFTIES 23. Test debut – vs Australia at SSC August 17 in 1992 – LAST TEST – vs Pakistan at National Stadium Oct. 28 in 2004 – ODI DEBUT vs India at Nehru stadium Dec. 8 1990 – LAST ODI – vs Australia at Rangiri Stadium in Dambulla Feb. 28 in 2004.
Dazzlers pf the caliber of ' LITTLE KALU' are hard to find. Even rarer are cricketers who though their legendary performances stay in our minds decades later.
