Previous regime turned SriLankan Airlines to loss making venture: Amunugama

The SriLankan Airlines earned a large profit to government coffers earlier, but now it has become a complete loss making venture and a burden to the Exchequer due to corruption during the previous regime, Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
He said the airline ran at a profit when it was operated as a joint venture with Emirates Airlines earlier.
But it became a burden on the state due to nepotism during the previous government.
“Now the government is looking for a means to enable the airline to make a financial turnaround,” he said the media at Aludeniya, Galagedara.
