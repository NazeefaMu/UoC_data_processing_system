CB’s former female superintendent  displayed integrity on  bond issue: President

 President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the evidence given by a former female superintendent of the Central Bank before the Presidential Commission on the bond issue showed how she tried to impart her duties honestly and with integrity.
The President said among the evidence recorded so far by the Commission, the former female superintendent’s statement stood out as an example of a woman trying to fulfill her duties with honesty and steadfastness.
The President was speaking at a ceremony organized by the SLFP Women’s Front to mark the International Women’s Day at the SLFP Headquarters.
Speaking further on the evidence given by her, the President said not only she had spoken truthfully and honestly, but had also admitted that she was under pressure when taking some actions and that there was nothing that could be done in her capacity to change them.
President Sirisena said this can be looked at as an example of how women react with honesty and with sincerity when vested with high responsibilities,
He added that female representation in politics would be legalised and increased in the upcoming polls. He said Government policies would be formulated to give priority to women and female representation would be further enhanced to establish a nation free from corruption.
