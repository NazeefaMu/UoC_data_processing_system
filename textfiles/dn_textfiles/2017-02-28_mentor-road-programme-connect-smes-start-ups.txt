Mentor on Road -Sri Lanka will not be charging any fee from beneficiaries, as this tour is being undertaken with a purely philanthropic point of view.
After a year, Mentor on Road - Sri Lanka aims to create 20 success stories in improved Business Development and Export related activities.
The programme has mentored start-ups, rural enterprises, micro, small, medium enterprises, corporates, women business empowerment institutions, in India, Sri Lanka and across 20 countries.
After having worked in 102 clusters in India and in 23 other countries, Founder and Chief Mentor Jagat Shah is convinced that one way to motivate SME business community world over to upgrade their technology and production processes is by “convincingly proving the big size of the cake” i.e. the market. This can be achieved by market access through exports. Once they see the huge overseas opportunity, they will willingly invest in their production processes in order to match demand requirements.
The most challenging project of his lifetime has been in Afghanistan where he worked with support of USAID with 20,000 carpet weavers, 6,000 dry fruit farmers and 2,000 handicraft artisans to not only take them out of poverty but to make them into exporters with warehouses and offices in USA, Germany and India. He strongly believes that if change can be brought about in Afghanistan, then it can be brought about in any country in the world.
