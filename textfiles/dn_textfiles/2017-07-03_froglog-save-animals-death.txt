FrogLog to save animals from death

Having a swimming pool is a super fun way to stay cool during the summer. For the small animals living in your backyard, however, it can be a death trap. Wildlife biologist Rich Mason is out to change that with his simple, yet ingenious invention – the FrogLog.
“In June of 2004, good friends who had recently built an in-ground swimming pool on their wooded lot near Baltimore, Maryland, called to let me know frogs were dying in their pool,” Mason wrote on his official website. Deeply troubled by what he was hearing, Mason decided to construct a life-raft of sorts that animals could use to climb out of the pool if they became trapped.
The FrogLog consists of an inflatable platform with an attached mesh skirt, a weighted pouch that secures the device to the pool’s edge, and mesh ramp connecting the two ends. Mason fashioned the prototypes of the FrogLog completely by hand using fabric and foam.
After Mason’s thoughtful invention made headlines on The Dodo, it managed to attract over 68 thousand likes, and a wave of praise. “What a special human you are [for] caring about [these] seemingly insignificant lives…” one user commented. Every creature deserves a chance to survive, and the FrogLog is now one more way to make sure that happens.
