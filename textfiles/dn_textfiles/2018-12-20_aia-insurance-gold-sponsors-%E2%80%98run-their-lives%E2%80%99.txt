AIA Insurance gold sponsors for  ‘Run for Their Lives’

AIA Insurance was the Gold Sponsor for this year’s ‘Run for Their Lives’ (RFTL), for the second consecutive year.
Over 4000 people participated in this year’s charity run, which is held annually to create awareness on and raise funds for Cancer. Organized by the Rotaract Club, the run is aptly aligned with AIA’s brand promise of helping people live healthier, longer, better lives. The AIA Vitality Zone at the event was a great hit with many enthusiasts trying out the Plank Challenge, the Vitality Juiceter and other fun activities.
AIA Vitality is a first of its kind, science-backed wellness program that provides participants with the knowledge, tools and motivation to improve their health.
