‘Football Without Borders’ tour to Sri Lanka commences

Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL), the governing body of football in the country has initiated a 14-day sport tour for ‘Football Without Borders’ team from Switzerland who embarked on a goodwill tour to Sri Lanka which commenced on November 18.
The sport tour by the Swiss team will continue until December 2. FFSL, aims to promote football in Sri Lanka and to raise awareness among youngsters about football, as many local clubs will garner exposure from the visiting foreign team.
The tour also will serve to promote Sri Lanka not only as a destination in terms of tourism but also to promote sport tourism. One of the key objectives here is to increase awareness about the diversity and rich-culture of the country.
“As FFSL, we want to use opportunities like this to interact with European based clubs and other organizations with a view to support football in Sri Lanka in terms of development programs and exposure.
We are delighted about this opportunity as there are many former professional players accompanying this team. ‘Football without Borders’ team will also be engaged in a few charity related activities during the tour, extending their engagement in Sri Lanka beyond football,” said FFSL president Anura de Silva.
The team will be touring across the country with friendly matches being organized in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya and Matara. The Swiss team comprises of 25 members with 16-player team captained by Gianni D’Agostino and a staff team of 8.
The goal of ‘Football Without Borders’ is to narrow the borders among nations through sport by continuing to develop football in countries with lesser resources and equip teams with the basic requirements such as footballs, jerseys, pants and socks. In the process, they wish to make awareness about culture, geography, people and allow a mutual insight into the team’s culture as well. Through synergies with relief organizations and football clubs, they also strive for sustainable cooperation.
Emil Franklin Kronemberg, Chairman of ECD Holidays partnered FFSL for the Swiss team’s visit in Sri Lanka said that his team of holiday specialists are excited to be a part of this great tour.
