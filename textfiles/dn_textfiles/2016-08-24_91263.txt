South Africa, New Zealand Test wash out

DURBAN, TUESDAY: South African captain Faf du Plessis and New Zealand coach Mike Hesson both expressed disappointment after the first Test between South Africa and New Zealand was abandoned as a draw due to poor ground conditions on Tuesday.
No play was possible on days three, four and five because of a wet, soft outfield which the umpires decided would be dangerous for players.
No play took place after rain fell during the lunch break on the second day on Saturday, when New Zealand were on 15 for two in reply to South Africa’s first innings total of 263. Rain continued throughout the rest of Saturday and into early Sunday morning. The weather cleared and there was no further rain but the outfield conditions did not improve sufficiently for play to resume.
“We were dying to get out there,” said Du Plessis. “New Zealand were in a spot of bother on a wicket which was giving a lot of assistance.”
Despite that Du Plessis said that he respected the decision of the umpires.
“There were areas that were muddy and loose underfoot. The message was clear from the umpires that the players’ safety was their main concern,” he said. AFP
