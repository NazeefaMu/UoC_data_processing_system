Over 1,000 householders issued red notices

Seventy five PHIs conducted a house-to-house inspection in both, Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP to find mosquito-breeding grounds. The PHIs inspected 29,890 houses and business premises.
Accordingly, 1,161 householders were issued red notices and 149 households were found to be infested with mosquito larvae. A special Dengue Investigation Committee was established in the NWP and the owners of religious places, school heads, and others who maintain mosquito-breeding grounds, would be punished at Courts.
Twenty five PHIs have been deployed to conduct constant raids in the province to nab mosquito-breeders, said Kurunegala Senior Asst. Director of Health Dr. P. Jayasooriya yesterday.
