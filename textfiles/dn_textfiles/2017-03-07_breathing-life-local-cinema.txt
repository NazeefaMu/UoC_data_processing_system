Breathing life to local cinema

The Film Directors’ Guild of Sri Lanka aka FDGSL in a bid to revive local film industry has proposed a policy package to the authorities. The package consists of ‘short term’ and ‘long term’ plans for uplifting the industry and making it a profit making trade once again.
At an event held at Mahaweli Centre with the participation of a number of film personalities, media personnel and film enthusiasts, FDGSL Chairman Bennett Ratnayake read out the proposed policy package. He said FDGSL being the strongest lobby-group in the local film sphere currently is committed to make the package legislative with the help of film personnel, film lovers and authorities.
The proposed policy package mainly focuses on streamlining distribution and screening of local films.
“The local film industry is 70 years old now. In 1972 the National Film Corporation was formed. NFC made the film industry flourish. Dr D B Nihalsinghe spearheaded this operation. Diverse factors following that for decades contributed to the downfall of local cinema. Now we are in a digital era. We have to fast track our initiatives to revive local cinema”, said Ratnayake.
He said a 21 page proposal is already submitted to the President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunatilleke and Secretary to the Ministry Nimal Bopage, Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and NFC Chairman Deepal Chandraratne.
The need to establish a National Film Regulatory Board, Film Screening Circuit Evaluation Committee and an entity established for the Development and Promotion of the Local Film industry is highlighted in the proposal.
Ratnayake added, “We intend to make this package a legislative document with the support of relevant quarters. We as filmmakers must unite to pressure the authorities to make this noble cause materialize”.
FDGSL Executive member Jackson Anthony said any industry has its customers and consumers and the filmgoers are the consumers of a film industry. He said the film industry must provide ‘credible products’ or good films to satisfy its consumers. He said an action-plan must be implemented to put this viable proposal of FDGSL into practice.
FDGSL Executive member Jayantha Chandrasiri said cinema represents the art sphere while operating as an industry. He said this industry should evolve to provide benefits to filmgoers.
Somaratne Dissanayake said FDGSL proposal has to be fine-tuned to strike a balance prior to implementing since more relevant parties will have feasible ideas. He said another proposal with the knowledge of former FDGSL Chairman Prasanna Vithanage has been submitted to authorities.
FDGSL Secretary Udayakantha Warnasuriya appreciated entrance of youth to the local cinema sphere as film directors at a transitional period like this.
He said inferior quality films made in 1990s was one crucial factor that made the industry lose its credibility and distribution of films go haywire.
Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja, Jeevan Kumaratunga, Sunil T Fernando, Mohan Hettiarachchi, Dilhani Ekanayake were others occuping the head table.
