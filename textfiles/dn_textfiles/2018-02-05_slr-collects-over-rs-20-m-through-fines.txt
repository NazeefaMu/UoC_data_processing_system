SLR collects over Rs. 20 m through fines

The Railways Department has collected a record income of over Rs. 20 million as fines from errant commuters, through mobile ticket inspections and sudden raids made in trains during last year.
According to officials attached to the Sri Lanka Railways Investigation Unit, the total number of detections made during the period was 14,809. These mobile raids were carried out covering the three railway zones of Colombo, Nawalapitiya, and Anuradapura.
Ticketless travel, travelling in class one and class two compartments with class three tickets, and travelling beyond destinations specified in their tickets, were offences committed by the fraudulent commuters.
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) is a public transport service. The provision of an efficient and effective service to commuters would be the main objective of the department, SLR authorities said.
The Railways Department is being deprived of a large amount of income due to these malpractices, authorities added.
With the aim of minimizing these offences, fines imposed on fraudulent train travellers have been increased from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000. In addition, mobile inspections and sudden raids in trains have currently been further intensified, SLR Commercial Superintendent G. W. S. Sisira Kumara added.
