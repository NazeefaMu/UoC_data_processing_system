‘Mersal’ could be the biggest release for a Tamil film

With just a week to go for Vijay's Mersal, theatres across the globe are finalising screens for the film. Riding on high expectations, Mersal has been confirmed to release in 3,292 screens worldwide, making it possibly the biggest ever release for a Tamil film.
Hema Rukmani, director of Sri Thenandal Studios, the makers of the film, posted on her Twitter page recently and confirmed the screen count. The number is expected to grow in the next few days and might even touch 4,000 screens, according to reliable sources.
In Tamil Nadu, the film is expected to open in 700 screens, amid rumours that the release might be postponed due to the ongoing tussle between the Tamil Nadu Film Chamber of Commerce and the state government over double taxation. In Kerala, the film has been confirmed to open in 350 screens, surpassing the previous record held by Baahubali 2 which opened on 320 screens. Mersal, in Malaysia, is expected to release in 800 screens which is a record of sorts.
In Mersal, Vijay will be seen playing a panchayat head, a doctor, and a magician. To play the role of the magician, he was tutored by three popular magicians for the characters. They helped him learn some magic tricks. According to well-known magician Gogo Requiem, the magic potion in Mersal will be astonishing.
The film, which also stars Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Nithya Menen, marks the second collaboration of Atlee and Vijay. Produced by Sri Thenandal Studios, the film has music by AR Rahman and also stars SJ Suryah in a key role.The News Minute
