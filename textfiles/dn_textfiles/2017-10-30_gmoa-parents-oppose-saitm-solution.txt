GMOA, parents oppose SAITM solution

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has opposed the solutions presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
The other parties which protested against SAITM had expressed the same view during a meeting held last night.The association of parents of state medical faculty students and other civil organisations were among them.
Earlier, the parents association was planning to announce a death fast campaign yesterday.
They said they will launch the fast unto death campaign on November 6, if the Government does not present an acceptable final and lasting solution to the SAITM issue.
All organizations inluding the parents of SAITM students, demand a solution based on the five proposals presented to the Government by the Deans of state medical faculties, which includes an acceptable solution to the SAITM students.
