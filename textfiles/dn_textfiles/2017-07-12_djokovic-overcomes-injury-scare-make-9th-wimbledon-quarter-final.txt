Djokovic overcomes injury scare to make 9th Wimbledon quarter-final

LONDON: Three-time champion Novak Djokovic overcame an injury scare to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the ninth time on Tuesday with a 6-2, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 win over France’s Adrian Mannarino.
The 30-year-old Djokovic needed treatment on his right shoulder after the fifth game of the third set and a medical timeout at 4-3 to treat the same problem. He had already summoned the doctor after just three games of the opening set. AFP
