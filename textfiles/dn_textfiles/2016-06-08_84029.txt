NCM against Ravi to be taken up in Parliament today

The Vote of No-Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake will be taken up in Parliament today.
The debate on the motion will be held from 2pm to 6.30pm. The vote is scheduled at 6.30pm.
The NCM was submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by the Joint Opposition on March 24. It carries the signatures of 37 Joint Opposition MPs.
The no-faith motion stated the Minister had misled the House with inaccurate information on the economy and the finance of the country. The motion has held the minister responsible for the current economic crisis in the country.
All government members have been informed to attend the sittings today.
The JVP during its Central Committee meeting held on Sunday decided to vote in favour of the motion. It is learnt the TNA is most likely to either abstain or vote against the motion.
