Case against Ravi postponed to November 5

Additional Colombo Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage yesterday postponed the magisterial inquiry into the alleged incident in which MP Ravi Karunanayake is said to have given false evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate into the Treasury Bond issue. The next hearing was fixed for November 5.
The Additional Magistrate made this order as Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake was absent yesterday. Criminal Investigations Department officials submitted a further report in court.
Earlier, Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had decided to issue an order permitting the CID to evaluate several documents pertaining to Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited (GTL) owned by former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
On a previous occasion, the Chief Magistrate said that there was no legality to name MP Ravi Karunanayake as a suspect at that juncture since investigations against him had not been concluded.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General’s Department and President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando appeared on behalf of Global Transportation and Logistics.
The Chief Magistrate ordered the GTL to hand over the relevant documents before October 29.
