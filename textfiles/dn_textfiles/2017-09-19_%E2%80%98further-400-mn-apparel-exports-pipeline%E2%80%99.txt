‘Further $400 mn from apparel exports in the pipeline’

Sri Lanka is not hiding its optimism for its apparels in the post GSP Plus era; especially a further $400 Mn revenues from exports are now in the pipeline for the sector.
“We have received the GSP Plus, and apparel exports are projected to increase,” said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen recently in Colombo.
“Business-to-Business exhibitions such as this play an important role since a range of textile products enhanced with the latest technology are made available for Sri Lankan industries. Global manufacturers and suppliers are making them available directly to our Industry in Sri Lanka at this event,” he said.
Minister Bathiudeen expressed these sentiments addressing the launch event of the 9th Colombo International Yarn & Fabric Show 2017 – Fall Edition along with its concurrent exhibitions International Home Textile Sri Lanka Expo 2017 and 2nd Sri Lanka International Air Freight, Shipping & Logistics Expo 2017, at Sri Lanka Exhibition and Conventions Centre, Colombo.
Minister Bathiudeen was joined by his top officials and Group CEO of CEMS-Global USA & Asia Pacific S. S. Sarwar. This business to business exhibition hosts exhibitors from Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Sri Lanka. “Promotional and networking events of our apparel industry are therefore now more important than ever since it establishes our brand identity globally. We have regained the GSP Plus that we lost in 2010 and as a result our exports including apparel exports are projected to increase,” he said.
