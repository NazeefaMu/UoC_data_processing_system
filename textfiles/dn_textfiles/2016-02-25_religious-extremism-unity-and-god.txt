Religious extremism, unity and God

The truths, expressed in the present writer’s ethnic harmony texts, comprises an honest orientation. That is to unite and unify all Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and other communities of this wonderful land. All Lankans aspire to expedite transcendence and specially to succeed economic prosperity, for the attainment of which, the community harmony is a sine qua non. The exacerbation of the religious extremism of handful of fundamentalists, of whatsoever religion, is a wall, an impediment, a barrier, a hurdle, a wall, coming in the way, willed by the people. Hence, a discernible degree of the causation of clarity in the confused minds of Lankans, represents, not only a requirement, but an inevitable imperative. In inscribing these frank hermeneutical texts, the writer wishes to base himself on the rights, granted by the Supreme Law of Sri Lanka - The constitution, in its Chapter: 3, Article: 14, Para: 1 a.
Part 1 of this text was carried in Daily News on February 11, 2016.
Therein, it was emphatically stressed that only a very limited handful of fundamentalism are engaged in extremism and the majority of all communities in the globe, has no direct involvement in it. the writer discussed, the fruitfulness of the application of the aspect of human-being, the need to learn couple of lessons from Muslims, including the increase of the number of community heads, the imperative of occupying the trading fields with best lucrative profits, the Muslim feminine attire, it’s useful and prudent design and also the Suadi-arabization of Sri Lanka with its black colour, the Muslim methodicality in their communal organization, the futility of man-made labels, the extremism of fundamentalism and their limited member numbers, the happiness as purpose of life , powers gifted to humans by God, danger of blind belief, God, the God-willed community unity and the ease of unity with Buddhists.
Today, the intention of the writer is to elaborate several striking components of the submitted thematic context, which will help the readers, to learn, to pose couple of logical questions, when extremists endeavour to indoctrinate them, with the doctrines of hate, in the name of their Gods, to elevate themselves (readers), to the sublimation of a better qualitative mental clarity, to seed them in a magnifying psychic talent, not to be trapped in blind belief, foolishly believing in what others say, but, to cultivate in them, the power of introspective insightfulness, to make use of the vigour of intelligence, freedom of thought, freedom of choice, gifted by God. The textual reference is not to individuals personally, but to psychologies, which lead youth to the contamination of destruction.
Incomparable parable
The writer is pleased to be courageous to begin his socio-religious analysis, being abused by extremists of fundamentalism, with a small, yet very powerful parable, pertaining to the dispensation of the Wisdom of Buddha. Thus, during the time of the Buddha, there was a man born blind. He never believed in the existence of sun, moon, stars, ocean etc. Many people tried to convince him, but, failed. Then, his friends heard that the Buddha visited their village and thought to take him to the Buddha to explain him about the truth of the presence of above objects, since, Buddha had a reputation for omniscience. The blind man was taken to the Buddha and he was asked to explain the man about sun, moon etc. The Buddha said, “I am not crazy to explain him about those matters. But, I see you have a problem and it should be resolved. Kindly take him immediately to an eye surgeon and cure his eyes”. The friends, finally found a doctor who cured man’s eyes, with which cure, the problem of the friends disappeared. But, the man wanted to thank the Buddha, since, it was thanks to His advice he was taken to a doctor. After four months of hard endeavours, the Buddha was found and he thanked him. But, the Buddha said, “No, no, I do not deserve your thanks and commendations. It is somebody else whom you must be thankful to”. The man was surprised in to shock. “Who is he?”, asked in wonder. The Buddha compassionately said, “It is you yourself, not anybody else”. “O my God, why me?”, Buddha said, “You got your eyes back, because, you refused to blindly believe in what others say. You used your intelligence, brain and discretion. That’s why you got your eyes back”. This is a powerful advice of compassionate the Buddha to the generation of universal youth, whom the handful of extremists are crazy of deceiving in to blind belief.
Creation
The majority of the world believes that it was God, who created the world, life and man. A rational thought and an intelligent analysis of all accounts of creation, would show, that God never created multi-racial beings, labeled as Americans, Russians, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims or Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Islamists nor did God create any cast. God created only human beings. Therefore, man has every right to be unique and be united in to the beautiful singularity of the oneness of God. God treasures many examples for man everyday to understand this simple truth and for him to live in it. If we look at the vastness of the unending blue sky, in a pitch black night, what can be seen is the majesty of moon with cascading down silver rays, thousands of twinkling stars, floating clouds and most important, the enigmatic unity of all that resplendent diversity. Yet, people do not use their brains. Many of them kick out the unity of divinity and espouse the dividing diversity of extremism. This is very pathetic indeed.
Labelism
Then, how a man becomes a Sinhalese? Is it by printing the label “Sinhala” on his identity card? Can a human-being be born in to a so-called Tamil family and be a Tamil? When one becomes a Muslim? Is it when the label “Muslim” is printed on his passport or by printing a book of religious instruction, which writes that such and such a community belongs to Muslimity? Did the Buddha advise his followers to become Buddhists? Was the concept “Christian”, the final spiritual objective of Jesus Christ? Did Allah create only Muslims? When extremists come to teach their segregation doctrines, the youth of all communities, must pose these questions to them.
These questions, the extremists scream around and superficially, seeming to be stupid, yet, if insightfully glanced at, in introspection and with circumspection, contains an immense depth, pregnant with the potentiality to absolute intellectual growth. God created no labels. It is not only an insult, but also a sin, to declare that God crated Americans, Russians, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims and to befool spiritually uninstructed innocent people, in to the ignorance of labelism. Labels are needed as linguistico-communicative social tools. That is its limit, beyond which it contains no substance.
But, it is extremists, who are crazy of substantiating unsubstantiated labels. Why? It gives them power to divide, and then dominate people and thereafter possess enormous wealth.
Impertinence of the Buddha
Now, the Buddha has to be dropped from the creation account debate. He taught that the beginning of the world cannot be comprehended and it is useless to talk about it, since, the talk of the beginning, is not conducive to the doctrine of dispassion, renunciation, giving up, to stopping, meditation and deliverance. God has done, what had to be done and now it is left for man to crush defilements and win the purity of mind, with the already available power faculties of intelligence, intellection, contemplation, concentration, freedom of choice and cessation.
The Buddha begins, after the creation, having no recourse to the antecedent and pre years of creation. It is other religions, which resort to creation theory proclaiming that God created the world and life. Hence, the Buddha is out from the debate.
Illogicality A
If the text is to begin in the actual chronological order of the emergence of religions, the most ancient among them, Hinduism elucidates that the great Brahma created the world and life. Now those, who follow that doctrine, have become Hindus. Then, the Son of God, with His immaculate birth, in the absence of a human father and being conceived by the Holy Spirit, yet, born as the son of man, Jesus Christ, declared that the world and life was created by another God, JHWH, Jehewah, creating His own community of followers. They don’t believe in a Brahman. The contradiction begins. Here, there are two religious communities. One follows Hinduism, without believing in Jesus Christ. The second believes in Jesus and the God Trinity while does not accept that the world was created by the Hindu Brahman. Despite all that, both communities proclaim that their own God created the world and life.
The third God appeared in the sixth century CE. That was God Allah of the Muslim community. Their religious Teacher too proclaimed that the world and life was created by God Allah. Again, the Muslim religious community rejects other two Gods, Brahman and Jesus and the Christian God Trinity, as the creators of the world and life and continues to believe in Allah in absolute reverence. They stagger even further asserting that Jesus Christ was one of the Prophets of Allah.
Illogicality B
Now, it can be seen here, that three Gods, one human wisdom Teacher and multiplicity of communities have come to be in two contexts, to be more precise, religious and social. Religiously as Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and Islamists and socially, Americans, Russians, Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslim etc. The three Gods and Buddha seem not perturbed at all, whether which community belonged to which nationality or to which religion. Nevertheless, the extremists worry. The general public too is not disturbed.
Besides, in heaven, Gods don’t seem to be fighting for the divine hegemony. They are in absolute peace and unity. Now, it is the beauty of the unity of the divinity, which descends down to humanity and powers the latter, to be unified in to oneness. Nonetheless, the fundamentalists are perturbed. They propagate division, which contradicts the divine commandment of unity. Naturally, they are doomed to Gods curse.
Gods are Almighty with all-pervasiveness, Omni-presence and omniscience. Were they not pleased, they were and are powerful enough to appear across the sky and threaten the ignorant humans that “Look my silly children, I am your true God. Other Gods are false. They are manmade. Obey my Commandments from today itself and onwards or be ready to be flamed in the hell of burning sulphur.”
I am sure, if one of those Gods would do so, everybody, the writer is included, would cry out in meek obedience and prostrate on the floor shouting “Lord is great. Lord is Almighty, Hosanna in the highest”. But, Gods are not disturbed and troubled at all? Why? Because, The True God knows that there are no Gods, but God and there is no multiplicity of communities as American, Russian, Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim etc, but, only one community-the humans.
The true God commands, “You are one”. The handful of extremists scream, “We are many”.
The true God unites. The fundamentalists divide. In the extremist division is the destruction. In the divine unity is the construction. This is what the youth of the globe must understand.
Illogicality C
Again, Buddhist majority do not believe in any God, as a creator. Their number amounts to billions. The most central factor of the beauty is, that Hindus and Buddhists were living in this world, before the birth of some religions, the Gods of which, are reported to be the creators of life and the world. The position of the Hindus is clear with Great Brahma. Then, if Brahma is to be set aside, was it another unrevealed God, who created Buddhists? Or God created all communities at once, but He did not reveal Himself to Buddhists and waited for so long, for some other community to arise in order to reveal Himself? In all the revelation texts of some religions, no mention is made about the creation of Hindus, Sinhalese or Buddhists. Nevertheless, Buddhists and Hindus are too large two communities, for, no mention to be retained of them, in any divine revelation. In concordance with truth, this is impossible. Yet, the chronology of the history, factually reveals, that there were Buddhists and Hindus, before the revelations of such religions. If so, the postulate, that the world and life was created by the Gods of certain revealed religions, has to be understood not absolutely, but relatively. Then, the almightiness of the Gods of extremist fundamentalism becomes dubious, instead of being absolute. This is an insult to the majesty of true God. This is what the extremists do. Naturally they are deemed to be punished by True God, with God’s wrath and curse.
The youth of the globe must pose these questions to the handful of extremists of fundamentalism, when they approach them (youth), with their theories of brutality, proposing to chop the fingers and behead the heads of the believers of other religions.
Illogicality D
It can be seen, that, as if, the extremists are trying to help God, by contaminating the minds of youth in to the animality of extremism and by destroying the believers of other religions, exclaiming in it, that the extremists are fulfilling a dutiful commandment of God and for such performance, the extremists’ divine reward will be heaven. Yet, what pragmatically can be seen is not their celestial reward of heaven, but, the suffering hell in this world itself, with their oozing out and shedding pools of blood, pain, death and banishment from the loved land of birth. This is what, the youth of the globe must rightly understand.
There are political leaders as Presidents and Prime Ministers, wealthy people as dollar billionaires, and other general public, living in this world freely, independently and richly as Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. They are born, grow up, employed, earn money, produce children and possess wealth etc. Brahma, Jesus and Allah do not curse them, nor, do they stop them from being so. In fact they are well blessed by God with His Bliss. That is why they are living in the void of blood, pain, death and destruction.
God is Almighty. It is God, who can bestow such comforts and privileges to all communities, Buddhists included. God is not label oriented. His direction of action is life itself and living people is His prerogative. If God wants to punish anyone, God needs no assistance from miserable human extremists and brutal fundamentalists. God can do it on His own. For example, Tsunami with so much power of destruction or famine or drought or anything of that sort, which poor humans cannot control. The powerful, willed wish of God, to unify all communities in general and Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities in particular, in to transcendence of oneness, is not decreed to be violated. In spite of that the transgression is possible with the freedom of voluntary choice God has bestowed. Yet, the God’s curse would follow the defilement of infraction. All Lankans must use their brains, treasured by God, not allowing themselves to be ensnared by blind belief, being promoted by fundamentalist extremists.
Illogicality E
God not only gifted the land of Sri Lanka to Buddhists, who have no faith in any God, but also willed Tamils and Muslims to live in it. It is the powerfully wished will of True God that commands Sinhala Buddhists and Christians, Tamil Hindus and Christians and Islamic Muslims, to live in this beautiful country together in peace, mutual understanding and harmony, consciously helping each other in to happiness and prosperity. It is possible, since it is the majestic wish of true God, Who made man and not of God, whom man made, according to man’s form and shape. That is why, when Muslims came to this land at first, as traders, Sinhala Buddhists made them the citizens of their country, Sri Lanka and gave them their Sinhala-Buddhist daughters in marriage to be their wives.
The harmony was absolute. All must understand this very well. This wonderful oneness of our communities is being attacked by the God-contradicting handful of religious extremists, who try to seed the hatred of racism and religious fanaticism, rooted in the brutal violation of the wished Will of God. God will not allow this. He is Almighty. He is a Master-planner. The LTTE extremism tried to do this. What to say about what they gained from it, God caused them to lose even what they had.
