Discussions on to bolster regulatory capital levels: People’s Bank Group posts  Rs 18 bn profit in 2016

People’s Bank declared an impressive financial performance for the financial year 2016, showcasing a striking upward trajectory in the Group’s performance.
The Group posted a Profit Before Tax of Rs 25.4 bn, an incline of 5.4%. The Group’s also posted a Profit After Tax of Rs 18 bn, inclining from Rs 15.1 bn .
People’s Bank Group Chairman Hemasiri Fernando said the Group’s results exampled the Group’s astute journey within the fast-evolving financial services industry, maintaining an insistent focus on every stakeholder.
“Our results are self-attesting to an unrelenting pursuit to add consistent value for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Needless be said, market circumstances in 2016 were challenging and from a macro-economic stand-point, these included, inflationary pressures and a tightening monetary policy which led to a rise in interest rates and high earnings pressure.”
The total gross income reached all-time record performance at Rs 144.7 bn, a 16.9% growth compared to Rs 123.8 bn at end 2015. Net surpluses were well evident across all aspects of investment operations with revaluation and available for sale reserves posted at Rs 11.9 bn and Rs 0.3 bn respectively.
The Group’s Return on Average Equity was 22.7% compared to last year’s 22%, while the total contribution via taxation, special levies and dividends reflect the integral role the Group plays in national economic development, with its Rs 22.9 bn contribution, once again considerably higher than last year’s Rs 19.5 bn. CEO and General Manager Vasantha Kumar says, “It’s been one of continuous positive improvement across several aspects of business operations both quantitative and qualitative.
It was a year that witnessed two LKR 1 Tn feats in a single year - the first for any Bank, a gross income generating capability cross the LKR 140 billion mark, a loan book composition further improved and a gross non-performing loan ratio reaching a ten year low - the latter evidencing a further improved risk management framework and collection & recovery process.”
This is well evidenced in the ten year low Gross NPL ratio of 1.9% (which in 2015 was 2.4%) highlighting the hallmark consistency that People’s Bank has continued to espouse and also a total asset base of Rs 1.4 Tn, which is an 11.6% growth over Rs 1.3 Tn at end 2015.
In analysing the Group’s Capital Adequacy Ratio of 13% with a Tier I ratio or 11.1% and the Bank’s CAR of 12.1% and 9.8% respectively, Fernando clarifies that, “In terms of near-term goals, bolstering our regulatory capital levels remains a priority and a work in process.
Ongoing discussions with the Public Enterprise Development Ministry and the recent cabinet approval received to amend the People’s Bank act are viewed very positively in this connection.”
