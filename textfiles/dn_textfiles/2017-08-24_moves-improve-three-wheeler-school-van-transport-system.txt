Moves to improve three-wheeler, school van transport system

The government has taken a policy decision to improve the three-wheeler and school van transport system in the country.
According to the Department of Motor Traffic, there are over 1.1 million three-wheelers and 30,000 school vans currently operating in the country.
A Committee of Officials appointed by the Cabinet to look into improvements of the above services has submitted proposals to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
Firstly, they ask that the subject be placed under the provincial government as part of the provincial transport system. Secondly, they recommend that a National Technical Committee be established to obtain technical assistance in formulating regulations and minimum standards for the relevant industries and to encourage the use of safe taxis instead of three-wheelers as a long term policy of the government when transporting children to school.
The recommendations were approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday.
