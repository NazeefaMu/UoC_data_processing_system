DFCC Annual Report wins 'Gold'

DFCC Bank PLC bagged the Gold award in the Financial Institution Category, at this year's Annual Report Awards organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants Sri Lanka.
This competition is considered the most prestigious accolade for Annual Reporting in the country, and has helped enhance the standards in financial reporting in line with global standards. This year, 144 organisations vied for the coveted honours, setting a new record in the history of the competition.
DFCC adopted a revolutionary approach to its Annual Report to minimise the usage of paper and to make the Annual Report user-friendly in the hands of shareholders. It balances the need to communicate effectively through concise, relevant information while at the same time, providing comprehensive compliance related disclosures.
The Annual Report was presented in three primary formats, which included a concise report in print, a comprehensive report for a universal audience online and a condensed 'annual snapshot' that communicates across a broad spectrum of current and potential stakeholders.
Executive Vice President/Company Secretary Anomie Withana said: "We are delighted that our Annual Report has been recognised this year as well. This is testimony that we are committed to delivering value to our stakeholders by presenting corporate and financial information in the most transparent manner while maintaining the highest standards.
"We have had very favourable responses from our shareholders in connection with this Annual Report, and we would like to thank our Annual Report partner, Smart Media (Pvt) Ltd, for helping us to express our vision creatively."
