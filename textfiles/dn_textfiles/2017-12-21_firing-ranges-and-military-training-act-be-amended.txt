Firing Ranges and Military Training Act to be amended

 
The Firing Ranges and Military Training Act No 24 of 1951 is to be amended to allow the training of firearms and explosives to security personnel employed in private security agencies, state banks, government institutions, semi-governmental institutions and to sea marshals deployed for protection of international merchant vessels.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Defence noted in the cabinet paper submitted above, that at present the Firing Ranges and Military Training Act No 24 of 1951 had no provisions to allow the use of firing ranges or firing training under the supervision of tri services or civil security department for Sri Lankan security personnel employed by private security agencies, state banks, government institutions, non-government institutions and sea marshals on international vessels.
