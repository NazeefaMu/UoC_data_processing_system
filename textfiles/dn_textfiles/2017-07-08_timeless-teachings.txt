Timeless teachings

The Buddha the supreme, Thathagatha the Perfect One the universal teacher the great Master, the fountain of love and compassion blessed the humanity with the absolute truth for the solace of the living, their wellbeing and their ultimate goal of eternal emancipation. The enlightenment of the Buddha achieved with great hardship led to the emergence of Dhamma the doctrine the sublime truth he discovered with this overwhelming wisdom. He decided to proclaim it to the world it was offered in the greater interest of the mankind for the benefit of generations to come.
He, in turn, expected them to give his doctrine the foremost place, protect and foster the Buddha’s teachings that later spread peacefully across the face of Asia. His faithful followers did preserve the age old spirituality the universal law of existence which he and we call Dhamma. The great Master wanted it to be disseminated in lightning speed to the entire globe which we are witnessing at the moment.
Having attained Buddhahood he set on foot to Benares, the capital of Kasi Kingdom with a determined mind to deliver the truth to the five ascetics, his former companions. Though the five ascetics were reluctant to welcome the Buddha, they just could not give into their wishes. Their persistent efforts failed. As the sacred one approached their relationship was enriched at first sight due to their realisation that he is now an outstanding human being with full of love and compassion unparalleled and full of human values having realised the noble truth.
Their devoted efforts culminated in understanding the sermons delivered by the great Master. His vision and Philosophy and innermost feelings saw the light of the day as Buddha Dhamma to the entire universe. He was the top-most being the wisdom and insight who performed miraculous feats alight and walk immediately after birth and various marvellous events came to their minds. They were reminded of the vital role played to forbid evil to attain the ultimate goal of liberation.
The Buddha delivered the first sermon and Ven. Kondanna attained the eye of Dhamma due to his meritorious deed in his previous births and became the first disciple. The others listened with faith and they too became Arahants and finally with the Dhamma Chakka Pavathna Sutta honoured by the Devas Brahmas and mother earth he sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma to achieve liberation from all samsaric ills.
All these took place at Isipatana Migadaya on Esala full moon day. His words, his desana are timeless and immortal. “He who follows the Dhamma and lives with a tranquil mind. The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble one (The Buddha) The Dhammapada.
