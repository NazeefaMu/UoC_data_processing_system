In the shadow of time

From the 1950s up to 1980s, the photographic studio shone. It was the habit of parents to get a studio sitting of their children on special occasions like birthdays, Holy Communion, school victory events. As a family, they walk into a studio with their relatives to pose for group photographs. Wedding photographs were for Christians after the church mass, while Buddhists made it following the Poruwa to secure memories. The photographs, toned in black and white, could be kept for several decades.
But now it is quite different.
By the time the Poruwa ceremony is over like the hot cakes just taken off the oven, the studio located near the Poruwa. Video too has entered the scene. With all this, the vintage photographic studios idle around and the photographers have lost the money spin in the field. Sadly the coloured pictures taken spontaneously cannot be kept for several decades. The colours of a photograph or the video clip just get damaged.
Then it comes to stenographers. What is shorthand, the 21st-century teenagers would ask. Stenos are no more. The taping devices and computers have already encroached into this field.
But at parliament and courts, still, the stenographers are recognised but behind the screen. A secretary or a personal assistant is not wanted as the boss himself operates the computer.
 
 
The traditional reel is also affected by the modern techniques. If not for a salient story, people just feel it is a wastage of time sitting at a cinema studio for two to three hours.
For oriental dances, cha-cha-cha, jive, waltzes, there are no academies. People look forward to freestyle steps. These dances depict some disciplined culture. Where singing is concerned, the lyrics in the 1950s had some value to the nation. The modern era has introduced lyric-writing with no meaning at all. The tunes with rap and other methods have harmed the original singing.
In time to come, the postman will not be required especially in developing and developed countries. The modern techniques have introduced wonders; within seconds one could contact anyone in any continent.
The radios will come to a standstill. The artists will have to perform in concerts and shows. People will prefer more sophisticated media.
It was such a custom when a bride would leave home. The lion flag was hoisted to show everyone that a wedding is around the corner. The raban players, the lighting of crackers, and all that has been buried. Today the families with the bride go to hotels, booking rooms, one to the bridegroom and one for the bride’s crowd. At the auspicious time, bride leaves a hotel room seeing the groom by the side.
What beauty it was then. The excitement at homes is nowhere now. The parade of cars accompanying the bride and groom is nowhere in sight. This escalates family unity and the strength of the family. Now nobody knows anybody.
In funeral houses too it is quite different. Some are in the habit of wearing coloured dresses to rejoice that the deceased has entered heaven. Mourning colours black and white is not visible. Also, it is the vogue behind which they hide their feelings and do not cry. They just hold a hanky to the nose silently and weep. The vogue is that.
The toddy-tappers are hard to find as much as the goviralas with the mammoty on their shoulders. The buffaloes are not to be sighted, the machines have taken their place. The world has vastly developed the paddy field owner’s child too would like to be a desk officer with a computer in front rather than taking the risks. Children would prefer carrying a computer to a mammoty.
The seamstresses have faded away. Sewing does not count. The teenagers order their style through the Internet. The old ladies used to knead jerseys and do needlework. The modern personalities have grown old and they are not aware or seen these knitting and needlework, which you found gonna the days beautiful baby kits in wool and lovely frocks with stitched birds/animals/fairies/butterflies. Most of all the people would prefer to wear shorts and jeans rather than butterfly type hand stitched dresses. This sewing too embraces the family together. The sewing machine is now out of sight. A dowry for a girl to be married was another qualification during the bygone days.
But they admire the modern dress with straps and short kits. The olden-day brides wear full white and fully covered dresses. Today, the bride is a bride but if the dead people arise who were born in 1920s 1930s will see the whole planetarium at a wedding house as one could see a multicoloured bride half-naked.
With regard to the book trade, there is a dark cloud in front about to encroach. The modern child does not collect books to make their own library but prefers to get connected to the internet.
The Sinhala is spoken in an English accent and the English is spoken with the slangs that no one can understand. But nowadays youngsters admire the talks while the elders in 60s and 70s frown.
What turns in this 21st century? Where is the modern child heading for? By the end of the 21st Century, an adult in 80s would shiver and collapse seeing the mighty changes of their offspring.
