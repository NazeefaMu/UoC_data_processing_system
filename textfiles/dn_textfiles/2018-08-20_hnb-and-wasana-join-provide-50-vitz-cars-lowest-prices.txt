HNB AND WASANA JOIN TO PROVIDE 50 VITZ CARS AT LOWEST PRICES

Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, which claims ownership to the largest automobile showroom in Sri Lanka, has decided to distribute 50 Toyota Vitz F motor vehicles belonging to the 2015 and 2016 models, to customers during the month of August at a price even lower than the import price.
As this offer is only valid until the 31st of August, the company invites customers to enjoy this benefit before it’s too late by visiting the main Wasana Trading Lanka showroom located at Welisara, Ragama or through the other branches located in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Madampe and Matara.
Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited provides this offer by joining hands with the Hatton National Bank. Accordingly, during this period of time, by promptly obtaining a lease facility at the lowest installments and lowest interest rates through HNB Leasing, customers are given the opportunity to acquire a valuable Vitz motor vehicle on that same day. Another feature of significance in this program is that permit owners are able to purchase a Vitz motor vehicle by handing over their permit to Wasana Trading Lanka.
“With the recent increase of tax by the government on vehicles that possess an engine capacity less than 1000cc, the prices of Wagon-R’s and other vehicles in that category increased by 4-5 lakhs. Since the taxes on Vitz motor vehicles, that possess an engine capacity of 1000cc, were not increased, it has produced a high demand for such models in the automobile market. Due to this demand, the purchase price of Vitz motor vehicles in Japan has also risen by roughly 2 lakhs. Because of this reason, prior to an increase in price in the motor vehicles in the automobile market in this country, we have decided to give our customers another valuable benefit by giving away 50 Vitz motor vehicles from our stocks at a very affordable price.” said Mr. Indika Sampath Merenchige, managing director of Wasana Trading (Pvt.) Ltd.
While customers can modify with additional equipment to these motor vehicles as they please, the unique support services of “Wasana Care” that is affiliated with Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, are also acquired by these vehicles. With over 25 years of experience in the automobile industry, gaining the unbroken trust of customers by providing them with high standard and the highest quality vehicles, Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited takes the leading position in motor vehicle dealership in Sri Lanka today by providing all the necessary facilities for the purchase of motor vehicles under one roof.
