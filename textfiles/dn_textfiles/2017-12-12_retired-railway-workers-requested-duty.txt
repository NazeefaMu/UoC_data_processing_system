Retired railway workers requested for duty

Railway Additional General Manager Vijaya Samarasinghe yesterday requested retired engine drivers, railway guards, stationmasters and controllers to report for duty with immediate effect.
Retired workers who are willing to come back should report to Additional General Manager (Operations).
Samarasinghe also ordered stationmasters, engine drivers and railway controllers working on contract basis to report for duty immediately as railway service has been declared as an essential service by the government.
