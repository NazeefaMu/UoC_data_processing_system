‘No more Bushes, please’, say Iraqis

IRAQ: A constant flow of sweet tea and tobacco fuels the clusters of patrons inside the Iraqi capital's historic Shahbandar cafe. They jostle for space like the faded pictures of old Baghdad that clutter the walls. But customers don't come here for the refreshments. They come for the conversation.
It has been a gathering place for Baghdad's intelligentsia for almost a century. Writers, poets, lawyers and doctors pack the wooden pews every Friday. Debate encompasses poetry and art, but politics is also standard fare, and not only Iraq's own.
As the US nomination races heat up, candidates have sparred over their past positions on intervention in Iraq and their plans to tackle Islamic State. If the American air campaign continues, the next person to sit in the White House will become the fifth consecutive US president to bomb Iraq.
Here, among the bubbling water pipes at Shahbandar, there is an acute awareness that the new president will also play a role in shaping their lives – from more than 9000 kilometres away.
Hashim al-Bayati, a 62-year-old civil engineer who frequents the cafe most weeks, is relieved it looks unlikely to be another Bush, with Jeb Bush finishing fourth in New Hampshire.
“We are fed up with the Bush family, come on. No more Bushes, please,” he said. He recalled George H.W. Bush's “betrayal” when he urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam Hussein after the Gulf War in 1991 but then did not support them. The death toll reached the tens of thousands.
“Unfortunately they cheated us,” Mr Bayati said, adding George W. Bush was even more damaging in his handling of the fallout from the 2003 invasion. He says he has little faith that any president will improve things for Iraq.
“They have the problem as Iraq, the same faces coming again and again, the same families, Bushes and Clintons,” he said. “They exported a copy of this system to us.”
As with other customers here, mention of Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich or others candidates draws a blank stare.
And what of Trump? “He's a funny character, I don't know how the American people can accept this kind of person. It's unfortunate.”
Shahbandar sits on Baghdad's famed bookselling street, Mutanabbi. There's an old Arab saying: Cairo writes, Beirut publishes, and Baghdad reads, and nowhere in the Iraqi capital is testament to that more than Mutanabbi, named after a 10th century poet.
On Fridays, stalls cram the streets, while some traders lay out their wares on the sidewalks. Copies of Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices mingle with anthologies of Khalil Gibran poetry, encyclopaedias and Arabic translations of Dan Brown novels.
