Big B's 75th birthday plans

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan says he does not want people to organise any special event for his 75th birthday.
The 74-year-old actor turns a year older on October 11.
"Many threaten and plan a 75th celebration for my birth... May it be known that there shall be no such event, allowed or even acknowledged," Bachchan posted on his blog.
"May it be known that if there is such move by others they must withdraw from it for I shall never acknowledge or endorse such... Be it family or Ef or any other... It is not going to be with any consent..." he wrote.
The 'Pink' star said if his wishes were not respected, he would end up going to "some isolated unknown location which shall never be known by any".
