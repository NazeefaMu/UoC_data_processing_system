Ruling parties in past seventy years ruined economy: Anura Kumara

“The political parties that ruled the country for 70 years failed to ensure the economic stability of the country,” Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at the JVP May Day rally held yesterday at the BRC Grounds in Havelock Town.
The JVP May Day procession commenced from the Campbell Ground with the participation of the JVP leaders and activists.
The JVP leader addressing the gathering said that only a political force led by the JVP can make a strong economy and create a country free from fraud and corruption.
The JVP Leader said the political parties that ruled the country during past 70 years have ensnared the country in a debt trap.
He said the annual income of the treasury is not sufficient to pay the loan installments.
The present rulers failed to produce essential products, rice, sugar, big onion, potatoes and others, he said.
Dissanayake said the present and former rulers failed to control the fall of the Rupee and it can be done only through a proper economic plan with important aims and objectives.
“The poverty rate and the malnutrition of the country is increasing. Around 250,000 families do not have even an inch of land. The gap between rich and poor has been widened,” the JVP Leader pointed out.
The crisis situation of the county signals the urgent need of changing the government. So the general public should unite to form a JVP government to fulfill their objectives, he said.
