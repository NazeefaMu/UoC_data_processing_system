Shape of things to come in cricket

The future of international cricket is being shaped this week at the most significant ICC annual conference in recent times with 150 delegates from the 105 full, associate and affiliate member nations meeting at the Caledonian Astoria hotel in Edinburgh for six days of talks that commenced on Monday.
One of the key topics that will be discussed is the future of the Champions Trophy which has since its inception in 1998 gone through a rather rugged terrain and stands in danger of being scrapped after next summer’s tournament in England.
As part of discussions about the future of the international game, the governing body is discussing cancelling the 2021 Champions Trophy, awarded to India, and abolishing the tournament for good.
The tournament is seen as lacking purpose and a clear identity, especially if the ICC’s proposals for a new 13-team ODI league, culminating in a play-off between the top two nations, are ratified. Alongside the league, the first edition of which is planned for 2019-22, and the World Cup, there is little desire to have a third 50-over tournament.
Three years ago the tournament underwent a mild shock when in the lead-in to the 2013 tournament the ICC announced that the 2013 Champions Trophy would be the last, with its place in the cricketing calendar being taken by a new ICC World Test Championship. However in January 2014 that decision was reversed, with the ICC confirming that the 2017 Champions Trophy tournament would take place and the proposed Test Championship was cancelled.
Whether the Champions Trophy can survive another tremor of that magnitude is very unlikely especially with the shortest form of the game – Twenty20 cricket gaining more ground and becoming quite popular among the younger generation of cricket followers.
Inaugurated as the ICC Knockout Tournament in 1998 and played approximately every two years since, its name was changed to the Champions Trophy in 2002. The number of teams competing has varied over the years. Originally all the ICC’s full members took part, and from 2000 to 2004 associate members were also involved. Since 2009 the tournament has only involved the eight highest-ranked ODI teams as of six months prior to the tournament.
The tournament scheduled to take place in England next summer for the first time will not see the West Indies, winners of 2004 and the reigning World T20 champions. They were edged out in the ODI rankings by Bangladesh and failed to qualify.
England will be hosting the eighth and probably the final tournament for the third time in its history. Bangladesh, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India and South Africa have hosted it once each. The tournament has been won outright twice by Australia (2006 and 2009), and once each by South Africa (1998), New Zealand (2000), West Indies (2004) and India (2013). The 2002 tournament hosted by Sri Lanka saw the host country and India being declared joint champions after two unsuccessful attempts to complete the final had failed due to bad weather.
Among the other key items in a packed agenda are to raise the profile of bilateral 50-over internationals outside of World Cup years beyond 2019 with the creation of a 13-team international league; creation of a two-division Test league system – seven teams in the top tier, five in the bottom – that is hoped would add greater context to the current bilateral tours by feeding into a points system beyond the current rankings.
With the 50-over ICC Champions Trophy possibly phased out after the 2017 tournament there is a possibility that the shortest form’s marquee event T20 would remain a biennial event with tournaments being staged in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
As well as urging greater consideration of how best to implement day-night Test cricket, the cricket committee has recommended the ICC take greater control of the decision review system (drs) with umpire calls on lbw reviews being relaxed – with 25% of the ball needed to be hitting the stumps down from 50% at present – and that incorrectly called no-balls be reversed by the third umpire.
With steps having already been taken to remove the permanent seats of the “Big Three” namely India, England and Australia on the ICC executive committee a further debate will follow regarding the overall model and distribution of funds. The “Big Three” structure of the governing body that was introduced in 2014 saw India, Australia and England take a leading role in running the global game, as well as a greater proportion of the revenues from global events.
It certainly is decision time for cricket as the ICC makes plans for the future of the game with the outcome of events of the Edinburgh meeting being awaited keenly by the world’s cricketing fraternity.
