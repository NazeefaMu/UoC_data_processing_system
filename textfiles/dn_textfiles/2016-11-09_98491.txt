Benedictine athletes finish 2016 season on a high

St Benedict’s College lay claim to be the unofficial number one athletic team for the year 2016 displacing Maris Stella College, Negombo by winning four important titles and finishing close runners up in two other events.
The Benedictines started the year winning the Colombo Zonal Athletic Championship convincingly beating all other leading schools. Next they annexed the Western Province Athletic Championship, the province being the strongest in the country and followed it up by winning the glamour event of the schools athletics calendar - the All Island Schools Relay Carnival at Bogambara, Kandy. They then capped it all with a glorious victory at the
Sir John Tarbet Junior Athletic Championship held at the Mahaweli Embilipitiya Stadium last month where over 7000 athletes from every nook and corner of the country took part, displaying the immense interest and the wealth of talent available in this country, which if properly harnessed could easily make Sri Lanka the best in Asia.
The Benedictines finished close runners-up at the All Island Schools Athletic Meet and the Sir John Tarbet Senior Athletic meet mainly due to injuries to some of their top athletes. However that has to be accepted as injuries are part and parcel of sports. The Bens also won the inaugural Josephian Relay Championship.
The hallmark of the Benedictine success has been their strategy of approaching every event as a Team. Efforts made to instill this idea into the minds of the athletes are bearing fruit with the juniors in particular.
The seniors are taking a little more time to imbibe it fully. However their total domination in the relay events shows that they are moving in the right direction. At the Junior Tarbet meet their victory was entirely a team effort with just one individual gold together with other placings, a strong contribution from relays and substantial amount of points gathered through the merit points earned by the juveniles, namely under 13s and under 12s they managed to chalk up 64 points - 11 points ahead of St. Joseph’s College with Maris Stella College a distance third.
The Benedictine star athlete Sahan Rajapaksa was unfortunately sidelined for most part of the season with a leg injury. He should come back strong and fit in 2017. The emerging stars of 2016 were the all round athlete Avishka Dananjaya Ratnayake, a brilliant hurdler, long jumper and a sprinter, the junior sprint champion Santhus Weerasinghe, who won 2 Golds at an international meet in Russia and, the Gold medal winner of under 15 Discus throw Sasanka Wijesinghe.
The athlete who should be mostly credited for the team’s success is the captain Shiran Angelo Jeganathen, who led by example and being a source of great strength to the indomitable Master in Charge and Junior coach Nuwan Abeywickrema. Team mentor Old Ben Sriyal de Silva, an outstanding past athlete and All Island Schools coloursman made a significant contribution towards bringing St. Benedict’s College to the top in the schools’ athletic scene, working very closely with the sport co-ordinator Rev. Brother Pravin Vaz, coaching and support staff and taking care of the needs of the individual athletes. Rev Brother Director Henry Dissanayake and Benedictines in Sri Lanka and overseas have readily supported and closely followed the progress of the team.
