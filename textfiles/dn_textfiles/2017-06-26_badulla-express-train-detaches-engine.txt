Badulla express train detaches from engine

The engine of the Colombo-Badulla express train got detached from its wagons yesterday shortly after it left the Hatton Railway Station, triggering panic among its passengers.
It had travelled less than 100 metres when the driver sensed the detaching engine and applied the emergency brakes to stop it.
The engine had detached at a flat area. Had it occurred at a slope, a serious accident could have happened, an official said.
The technical officer of the train re-attached the engine to the wagons and brought it back to the Hatton station.
The railway authorities had arranged a separate train to take the passengers to Badulla from Hatton.
