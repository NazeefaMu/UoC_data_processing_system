‘Urban Regeneration Programme for poorest in SL cities’

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the main focus of the concept of sustainable cities should be on serving the poorest segments of society by providing better living and working conditions for them by ensuring affordable housing, healthcare, water, sanitation and electricity.
The Minister said that in partnership with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the government will implement the Urban Regeneration Programme which aims at relocating 50,000 low and lower middle-income households living in slums and shanties in Colombo city into new apartments.
Minister Samaraweera made these remarks at the Third Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors’ Business Roundtable of the AIIB held in Mumbai, India.
The Minister reiterated the government’s commitment to achieving sustainable development in urban areas, while taking various policy measures to uplift the living conditions of the poor.
“We introduced sustainable development strategies that pave the way to achieve our Vision for 2025 that envisages a country enriched with a higher per capita income over US$ 5,000,” he said. “In addition, we initiated a project to reduce vulnerability to landslides, aiming at implementing mitigation measures and thereby minimising damage from landslides.
It is evident that both the frequency of occurrence of disasters and their severity have been increasing in the recent past.”
