Fallen tree sparks four-hour traffic block

A sicklebush tree had recently fallen at the Dambana junction, near the 90-kilometre post on the Mahiyanganaya - Ampara road following heavy rains.
A four-hour traffic congestion had followed the incident as the tree, which had fallen around 6.50 pm, was only removed from the road at 10.55 pm. Heavy rains had also led to floods in several surrounding areas, residents said.
They urged authorities to take immediate action with regard to the issue.
