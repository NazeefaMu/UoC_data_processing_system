Survival of the fittest and the harsh spotlight for our experts

The pendulum swings with perfect gusto as we roll out another all inclusive ‘adrenaline happy' rugby weekend in sports mad Sri.
We are islanders thru and thru ..plenty to say and little to do ..especially with the current Singer schools flagship tournament 2017 - still chugging along despite some locked jaw decisions about 13 teams in the fray? Huge and consequential questions are being waved at the governing team...with very little practical options available; the rugby community waits with abated breath.
Breathing and more oxygen might be the only way to last the current pace, as the points system and bonus matters including the 1st round, are already got our resident experts ..utterly nervous.
Priority no. 1, no that we are officially Sri Lanka Rugby...and not Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, what of schools rugby going forward? ..Ideally we should in following the parents lead, should be Sri Lanka Schools Rugby?
Aloha I hear the faithful exclaim ..what is this ..and in addition to what’s currently confusing all the potential ..'Duckworth & Lewis' types crunching numbers in an effort to rescue the association (if that should be our only option).
Ambitions sit well when plans and new directions for 2017 were announced ..naturally if we first get our house and school bus in order...long before mumbling about the grounds, the medical facilities, management staff, the kit and brand partners, all the official process of identifying the home team..all this before we kit up for warm up.
Now the means and organized set for each team..prep mind for match kickoff,...referee checks, rules update, specifics about the scrum and prop instruction...etc etc...mentally demanding by any standard, anywhere in the world. The pressure whatever your level of rugby, is intense and unless well drilled and able to absorb, it’s pretty intimidating till you get familiar with the warm up and pre game routine ...
Shudders and butterflies at the current stats and figures from the league ...Trinity and Royal, arch rivals even at breathing and anything you can imagine ...are investing big ...both are currently unbeaten and the weeks will add pressure to the mental prep...and reaction time in the middle ..who has the petrol, and will to run it off.....hardest development is to know your own performance level and instinctively, how far you can go past your pain threshold ...basically how far past your point of exhaustion?
The warriors step up and stamp their mark on the game ...these are the players that wear the flag and drive their fans nuts ...as Royal’s skipper Askey what prompted him to drop that famous 3 pointer and bring them home against a marauding Dharmaraja, who were floored by the last min kick and full time ...can’t get closer than that!
Trinity are looking the part early season ..hopes are they maintain this pace and momentum all through...watching their willingness to run is inspiring and means the understanding is good, confidence in their skills on the up and the Raikebula influence making the difference.
Wesley are running on pure pride and ra ra petrol that is giving them impact and good gains this first month ..despite the big drop against Trinity ..bouncing back in style against Thomas' and grabbing the shield, much against the run of play.
Peters probably stunned themselves with an absolute stunner against a shell shocked Patana ..15 points in front after 30mins had the fans screaming but Patana, the defending champions struck back in typical green machine pride ..15 all at half time.
The game needed magic in the 2nd half and despite every effort by the green shirts ..plus mistakes ..gave the Bamba brigade and fly half Siva a memorable and welcome back to top form St Peter’s win ...32:15, on the Saturday just gone.
Royal looked the part and settled early against D S Senanayake and despite some solid tackling from the DS lads, the Reid Avenue storm took it home by 47:7, and coach Malewana with plenty to drill for these debutants in division 1....both in attack and in defence.. I expect them to grow in confidence as experience settles ....and some good hard rugby ahead as the season progresses ...and lots for their friends and family to cheer as they clock in some big yards over the next month.
I rather think it’s quite an open league title race ..with more at stake than people would willingly admit ..Royal, Trinity and Patana looking sharp ...Peters, Joseph’s, Thomas’, Wesley.... also hungrier and lots to prove.....to themselves and their fans.
It’s going to be mighty every weekend ....and lots to breathe in and absorb as you look forward, so best you meditate and ready the brain for performance on a higher level, prepare the mind for massive skills and relentless work rate for pretty much 80mins.
Coaches need to recycle players to save as much of their key players who are pushing dehydration and depletion levels past comfortable for the bench team.. All teams and players must factor in the unforgiving sun and take in plenty of energy for their reserve tanks plus rehydrate max to save their legs.
Playing 80mins at 4.15pm is close to madness than most ..and needs some rational thoughtful medical professionals to explain the fluid and weight loss for these young gladiators ..it also increases risk of impact and odd injuries during the run of play ...so perhaps sensible and much good senses for the stake holders to consider the kick off or play the ‘big uns' under lights?
I would prefer to think higher performance and maximum skills with plenty of petrol in the legs to cause mayhem ...worth a thought certainly ...fair?
The game needs protection of these warriors and high performance to ensure the thousands of fans to cover their growing economy ..it needs some order to maintain the body and performance at its highest level...so far the teams have managed to limp off the pitch and ice bath or pool recover ..but not all have the luxury ..let’s hope sanity prevails and my soap box is heard by a few who matter.
Sri rugby needs to get bigger, better, faster and higher impact performance levels to raise the game beyond expectations.
Big hand to the Sri Womens 7s for grabbing the Borneo 7s Cup and defying the odds in Malaysia at the invitation tournament. Randi Sambu the skipper, Ayesha Perry Perera. the former winger, Tanuja run run Weerakody, Anusha Matate Attanayaka ..enjoying the rewards of professional input over 3 months and hopefully more impact on the Asian circuit starting next month.
Coach Sudath Sampath, our own Serevi junior during our days for Sri ..winning in style and grand to bring some silver home from their first trip.
Bula bula Sri islanders and proud rugby hearts ..cheers.
