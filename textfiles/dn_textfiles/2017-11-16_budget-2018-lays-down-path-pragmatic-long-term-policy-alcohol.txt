Budget 2018 lays down path for  pragmatic long-term policy on alcohol

Following Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s proposal to impose excise tax based on the volume of alcohol and type of liquor, much has been said and discussed over the media on the relief it provides to the price of soft alcohols like beer and wine.
Whilst the majority of commentary over digital and social platforms have tended to welcome this proposal as a step in the right direction, we have also observed a number of politicians and press stating that this measure will bring about ill consequences to public health. It is imperative to consider some practical observations and ground realities during this debate.
For instance, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and some of the lobby groups state that only 6% of Sri Lankans consume illicit alcohol in this country. They state that there are no national level studies on illicit alcohol usage, but then they themselves state that “technically sound sub-national studies” show that illicit, or kassippu, consumption is less than 10% of the population or not more than 6% of total consumption.
However, the Minister and these NGOs and other affiliated offices merely need to consult the 2017 Global Alcohol Report of none other than the World Health Organiszation, which puts the figure at 45% of consumption. If the WHO is not a national level statistic for consideration, they merely need to consult the records of the Sri Lanka Police and the Department of Excise, which gives evidence of raids on Moonshine (kassippu) at the rate of 12 every hour for the past five years. A tall order for a country with only 6% per cent of total consumption. A close inspection of the statistics would also reveal that there has been no reduction in the numbers.
The argument that increasing the price of all alcohol products will reduce consumption holds no water. In that event, the multitude of price increases over the years should have disrupted the existence of the alcohol industry in this country. It persists because there is demand. When Sri Lankan consumers can no longer afford to purchase legitimate products, they then turn to kassippu – which is widely prevalent even in the Western Province.
People are driven toward illicit because of cheap price and easy availability. If the illicit trade is being dealt with by appropriate law enforcement then the WHO need not report 45% volumes in its report this year. There are many examples the world over, which have also been cited by the WHO in its reports, where high prices of legal alcohol products have driven consumers underground. For example, in Australia in 2015, researchers found consumers switching to illicit products including narcotics due to the high price of alcohol, making even substances such as cannabis and ecstasy a more sensible choice. The findings are published and are easily accessible. Is this what we want for Sri Lanka too?
To safeguard against youngsters taking up alcohol consumption at an early age, the government in 2006 introduced legislation to halt the sale of alcohol products to persons below 21 years of age.
At 21 years, Sri Lanka it is believed presents a very late age where a person is legally allowed to purchase an alcohol product and this law is enforced island wide at all legal sales outlets. But who is monitoring its implementation at the illicit liquor dens island wide.
Who is collecting tax from the 45% of consumption of kassippu islandwide. Is there any regulating authority or standard that is monitoring the method of production of kassippu, which retails for low as Rs. 150 a bottle in some parts of the island.
It is well and good to question and stand up against the actions and existence of the legal alcohol trade, but the same should be applied, or much worse, against the kassippu trade for which no one seems to muster the courage.
In many developed markets, 80% of national alcohol consumption is safer softer alcohol products like beer and wine. The per capital consumption of pure alcohol in these countries are much lower than countries like Sri Lanka, and this achieved via an effective process of price, education and distribution that favours softer safer alcohols. There is adequate scientific and market data available globally that corroborate their success. The WHO figures on Sri Lanka’s kassippu problem is corroborated by the Colombo University research findings which put the figure at 49% of total consumption. Thus, beer and wine are the naturally the safer legal alternatives that policy-makers must promote to control the situation, rather than provide an outlet through enhanced spirits consumption.
The proposals laid out in the budget take a long-term view towards developing a safe, sustainable and responsible alcohol culture. Having spent decades at the wrong end of the global alcohol consumption index, this proposal provides the foundation to get it right! It may not serve the interest of anti-alcohol lobbies who promote a state of prohibition, but prohibition can never be a reality and it breeds a far more dangerous culture of criminal activity which would be far more difficult to control as the Americans trialed and failed with in the early 1930s, and as India and Africa did in certain states.
What is proposed is not to make beer or alcohol products freely available in every roadside grocery; what has been proposed is a first step in a systematic process to correct the balance of alcohol consumption in the country towards safer legal products as opposed to illicit. This is a policy and a proposal that we must all support for the sake of the public, health and future generations, and also to safeguard state revenue which is essential to uplift public services all round.
It is our sincere hope, that we could all rise above petty politics and personal agendas to do what is right by the country and its people, to ensure that we will finally graduate from a developing state and take our rightful place on the world stage.
