AIA Sri Lanka’s first AIA Vitality Wellness Day

AIA Sri Lanka’s first ever AIA Vitality Wellness Day was held recently to promote healthy living for employees. In a fun-filled day held at the cafeteria at the AIA Tower, staff checked their BMI and Vitality stats while getting nutrition advice from professionals, ate from the healthy food stalls, played virtual reality games and had discounted smartphones on sale. This first of its kind employee engagement event was intended at encouraging staff to stay healthy and active as they endorse AIA’s purpose of helping people live longer, healthier, better lives.
