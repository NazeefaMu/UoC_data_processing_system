Neither UNP nor SLFP suitable to govern country: JVP

 
 Neither the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) nor the United National Party (UNP) is suitable to govern the country since both parties consist of corrupt politicians, Parliamentarian JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday.
He added that the parties that held May Day rallies at Kirulapone, Galle and at Campbell Park protected the corrupt politicians. Therefore, these parties are not suitable even to remain in politics.
The JVP Leader was addressing the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna May Day Rally at the BRC grounds yesterday.
He said the JVP would not allow for a return of a Mahinda Rajapaksa regime that put the country into a debt trap, deprive the people of democracy and ignite racism again.
He added that the JVP's next struggle is to defeat the SLFP and UNP together.
“The people do not need the “Nadagamas” in Kirulapone and in alle,”Dissanayake said. “Ranil Wickremesinghe before the elections said their party was able to strengthen the economy. But, now they say they are unable to strengthen the same. The government can't run SriLankan Airlines, The CPC is burdened with debts and there are no funds etc,”
He said that not only Ranil Wickremesinghe's economy is facing difficulties but the entire capitalist camp is facing difficulties.
He alleged that for the first time, the country's economy is run without a budget. “We ask as to what this Government's budget is,”Dissanayake questioned.
“The President's rally in Galle is organised by Sajin Vaas Gunawardena” Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. “These Parties would do any mean thing to remain in power.”
He said that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and some others are spreading racism in the North and Rajapaksa and his colleagues spreads the same in the South.But, the youth from Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Mulaitivu etc have joined the JVP rally to unite all the communities to take the country forward.
“Some allege that the JVP has rooms at Temple Trees,”Dissanayake said.
K.D.Lal Kantha said that before January 8, members of this government said that the UNP had the economic experts in the country.“They say they cant give pensions. VAT is being increased from today (02),” Lal Kantha said.
“This government is drafting laws to curtail the rights of the working people. The fertiliser subsidy is being reduced,” he said. He further said that fertiliser prices was increased. The prices of vegetables and fruits will be increased very soon. He added that the UNP government tells the people that it would provide everything by 2020. “Will it run until 2020. No, even by now the image of this government is fading away,” Lal Kantha said. “It wont last until 2020 and we should not allow it to run until 2020”.
Lal Kantha also said that President Maithripala Sirisena while he was the Presidential candidate promised to absorb all the manpower employees into the permanent cardre.
“But, he has not so far been able to do so," he said. “We demand that he absorbs them into the permanent cardre”.
World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary General George Mavrikos, JVP Propaganda Leader Tilvin Silva and Ramalingam Chandrasekar also spoke on the occasion, Vijitha Herath, Bimal Ratnayake, Sunil Handunnetti and Namal Karunaratne were also present.
