His capacity irreplaceable

Seven years from today, April 21, 2009, was a very emotional day for all those involved in the cinema and teledrama industry. Versatile legend of the Sri Lankan arts scene Tissa Abeysekara's funeral was held on this particular day. Another veteran artiste was present at the ceremony on that day. He is someone who is shaken by even the slightest incident but finds solutions to the problems using his vast sea of knowledge and was able to cope with matters despite the many hurdles which fell across his way. He was Abeysekara's closest ally from youth. They both held different opinions about many matters concerning the arts scene at times but this did not affect their friendship.
He who was able to withstand all the problems in life was quite shaken by the departure of his friend. He came to where I and Sudath Rohana were and questioned us on how Abeysekara's death occurred in a very emotional tone. He who had weathered the storm and served the local arts industry in abundance is another veteran and versatile artiste, D B Nihalsinghe. We too have to echo his words today. When I got the news that he has passed away I called Sudath to tell him about it. The first words Sudath uttered were the same spoken by Nihalshinge at Abeysekara's funeral. I too need to ask the same question as I kneel in front of his lifeless body. I will not elaborate on what a great and worthy artiste Dr D B Nihalsinghe is in this article. Seasoned actors Siril Wickramage and Swarna Mallawarachchi who started in 'Sathsamudura' or Suweenitha Weerasinghe and G R Perera who starred in 'Velikathara' know of Nihalsinghe's cinematographic and directorial skills more than me. Nihalsinghe dedicated a majority of his youth to uplift the local cinema industry during his stint at the National Film Corporation. At the end of the 1970s, he chose me to star in his 'Ridi Nimnaya'. This was a turning point in my career. Nihal ayya not only advised me on how to perform my role but he gave many pointers on how to train, use and enhance my acting skills. He had no shortcuts in his teaching. He had no intention of pleasing the viewers, VIPs or any other individual. He did not want to transform an actor like me into a ‘superstar’; rather he wanted to transform me into a 'good actor'. Learning, training, requirement, dedication, the ability to read and understand, behaviour on the sets etc were some of the aspects that went hand in hand with what he expected from a 'good actor'. He explained that if one manages to tackle these aspects, one would inevitably become a superstar. I believe that I have not yet managed to get even close to both. Whenever I encountered him, I learnt something new in life.
Nihalsinghe is an immortal character in our industry. Buddhism and many other religions note that all beings leave this life after a span. We have failed to recognize the value of this human being and too his existence for granted.
He believed that an artiste is second only to God. He valued his profession. He once felt that he was not treated professionally at an awards ceremony. Therefore he wrapped the award he had received at the same awards ceremony during the previous year and returned it to the committee.
He was not opposed to events which uplifted the Sri Lankan tourist industry and foreign investment like having the IIFA Awards in Sri Lanka. However he was greatly upset about the manner in which local artistes were treated at the event and wrote a piece criticizing the matter to one of the Sunday newspapers.
He has done yeoman service to the local film industry. Many others who took up the chairman post at NFC said that they will pick up where Nihalsinghe has left off. However that did not materialize yet. That is not because they did not have the need or lacked the capacity to do so. It is because of all the issue in the industry. It has become like a tangled web. Whenever we try to take steps to solve an issue, we seek his advice. He too had no qualms about advising us. I do not oppose building memorials for him but the greatest merit we do on behalf of him is by trying to untangle the web of issues in our local cinema industry. I hope that everyone in the country will realize how committed he was and how much he had sweated over in uplifting the local arts scene.
