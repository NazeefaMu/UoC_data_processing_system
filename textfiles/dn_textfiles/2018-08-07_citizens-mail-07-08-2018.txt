False promises, false alarm
The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it is reported has warned foreign countries not to accept any asset offered by Sri Lankan government and that when his party comes to power he would take back such assets.
We as voters who have been misled by all political parties, giving false promises at the time of elections now have to face the misdeeds and pay for them. Will the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tell the voters why he sold (not leased) the most valuable asset, ten acres where Army Head Quarters was?
Will he take back that land, if he comes back to power and also the 256 acres of reclaimed sea land in Galle Face to China?
