Point of view 
Equity markets remained largely flat this week, moving within a narrow 20-point range, to close approximately 10 points lower than last week.
Weaker earnings - particularly from blue-chip conglomerate JKH which is perceived as a proxy for the overall economic health of equity markets/corporates - dampened investor sentiment, dragging the Index 25 points lower early in the week following the release of its earnings.
The Index heavy-weight wiped off ~2.82% of its value over the week to close at Rs.138 amid the 23% Y-o-Y decline in its profits for the quarter, dragging the Index lower.
The Index managed to regain some traction mid-week however, as the decline in the key blue-chip’s share price along with expectations for the CBSL to hold monetary policy rates steady helped revive some buying interest.
The ASPI consequently gained a cumulative 33 points over the week, helping pare down the 43 point loss and helping the Index recover from its lowest close in 3-weeks.
Despite the revived buying interest mid-week, local HNI and institutional interest remained weak, accounting for just 13% of the week’s total turnover to remain the lowest participation level so far this year.
Local HNI and institutional participation levels this year have averaged 40% (in line with the historical range of 35-45%) but this week’s levels remains a low for the year.
HNI and institutional buying interest remained concentrated on just four stocks, with mid-caps RIL and NTB accounting for 66% of the week’s crossings and blue-chips JKH and NEST accounting for the remainder.
Foreign investors meanwhile, reverted to net sellers from the Colombo bourse this week, reversing last week’s net buying position of Rs. 23Mn to a net selling position of Rs. 82Mn this week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue looking for cues from the June quarter corporate earnings releases.

Policy rates held steady for third time 
The CBSL held policy rates steady (SDFR-7.25% & SLFR-8.50%) for the third consecutive time this year, citing its goal of stabilising inflation at mid-single digits to aid a high and sustainable growth trajectory for the economy.
The Monetary authority added that recent trends in monetary and credit expansion indicate greater monetary stability that is consistent with the country’s envisaged medium term growth and highlighted that i) short-term interest rates have begun to adjust downwards in response to the surplus liquidity conditions in domestic money markets and, ii) overall monetary expansion decelerated in June 2018 as private sector credit growth has gradually declined towards desired levels and net credit to the government has reduced.
The CBSL also noted that despite the recent uptick (Y-o-Y headline inflation remained at low-single digits during Feb-June 2018 but accelerated in July 2018), inflation is expected to remain at mid-single digits by year-end amid the onset of the harvest by end-Q3’18 and well-contained aggregate demand pressures.
The CBSL also reiterated its expectation (supported by leading indicators) for a gradual pickup in GDP growth from Q2’18 led by expansion in services and industry related activities and supported by improved weather conditions favorably impacting agriculture activities and related industries.
The Bank cautioned however, that although global economic growth is likely to strengthen over 2018 and 2019, risks remain balanced to the downside due to monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, strengthening of the USD, escalating trade tensions and pressure on many emerging market currencies which has led to some of these EM responding to these risks by tightening their monetary policies and allowing their exchange rates to adjust appropriately.
