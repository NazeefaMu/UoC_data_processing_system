NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship 2018:
First schools event for National, Private or International Schools

For 2018, Sri Lanka’s most popular junior golf tournament, sponsored by expert financial planner NDB Wealth, will add a new segment to the tournament with the introduction of schools. Re-branded as the NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship, registrations for the tournament are currently open.
The tournament is scheduled for August 8 at the historic Royal Colombo Golf Course (RCGC) with the inclusion of the first-ever schools event, including pupils of any registered National, Private or International School in Sri Lanka. The format for this tournament is being altered as follows:
There will be a Team Event where schools can field a team of two players below 19 years. A school can field more than one team. Team pairings can be 2 girls, 2 boys or 1 girl and 1 boy where all will play 18 holes. Playing tee markers will be as per the Senior or Junior Individual Events specified below and the winner of the schools team event will have the lowest team aggregate score.
The Individual Event is being narrowed down to Senior and Junior Divisions, which are further broken down into Boys and Girls. This enables participants to compete for the following trophies, certificates and prizes in the Senior Division [over 12 years and below 19 years]: Boys winner, Boys 1st runner-up, Boys 2nd runner-up, Girls winner, Girls 1st runner-up and Girls 2nd runner-up. Junior Division (under 12 years) golfers will fight it out for trophies, certificates and prizes for Boys winner, Boys 1st runner-up, Boys 2nd runner-up, Girls winner, Girls 1st runner-up and Girls 2nd runner-up. Last year’s tournament saw Taniya Minel Balasuriya winning the Gold category (aged 15 to 17 years), with Levon Niyarepola topping the Silver category (aged 12 to 14 years). Nirekh Tejwani and Kvahn Tejwani were the victors in the Bronze (aged 10 to 11 years) and the Copper (aged nine years and below) categories, respectively.
“With a revitalized mission that has added schools to the mix, we hope to propel the sport of Junior golf to greater heights across Sri Lanka.
Now in its 4th year, the re-branded NDB Private Wealth Junior Masters Golf Championship encourages planning, foresight, calculation and competition, which are vital skills seen in both exemplary financial planners, and the best golfers.
We invite all youngsters to participate, and even get their schools involved, and see how they measure up against Sri Lanka’s best junior talent”, said Prabodha Samarasekera, CEO of NDB Wealth.
