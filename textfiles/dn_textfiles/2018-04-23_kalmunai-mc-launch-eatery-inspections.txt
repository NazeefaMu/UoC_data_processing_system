Kalmunai MC to launch eatery inspections

The Kalmunai Municipal Council (MC) had decided to inspect eateries in the municipality with the aim of improving health conditions at shops, hotels, school canteens and restaurants, at a discussion held at the Municipal Council Auditorium, recently.
The discussion was hosted by Kalmunai Municipal Council Mayor A. M. Rakeeb, with the participation of Public Health Inspectors attached to the Kalmunai municipality. Addressing the gathering, Rakeeb said, “The quality of food being sold at markets, shops, hotels, restaurants, vegetables stalls and canteen of schools, are to be inspected.
If they fail to maintain the proper and required conditions, action will be taken against their owners.”
“If any eateries or other business outlets had not registered in the Municipal Council, action will be taken against them as well. Public Health Inspectors will receive additional payments for this programme,” he added.
