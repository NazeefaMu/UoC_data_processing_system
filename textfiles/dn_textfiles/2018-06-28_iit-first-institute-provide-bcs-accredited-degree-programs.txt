IIT first institute to provide BCS accredited degree programs

Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in British higher education in Sri Lanka, has become the first institute in Sri Lanka to provide degree programmes with British Computer Society (BCS) accreditation.
Four programs offered by IIT in collaboration with University of Westminster are accredited by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. They are BSc/BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering, BSc (Hons) in Computer Science, BSc (Hons) in Business Information Systems and MSc Advanced Software Engineering.
Due to this accreditation, graduates who successfully complete any of the 4 degrees will fully meet the educational requirement for Chartered IT Professional (CITP) registration. While they would be obligated to meet relevant professional experience requirements, graduates from these accredited programmes will benefit from an accelerated route to CITP status
The BCS accreditation of degrees is a globally-accepted benchmark of the standard of higher education programmes and their contribution to the IT profession. It provides an indicator of quality to students and employers and also provides independent recognition for the institutions that offer them. IIT was given accreditation after an extensive evaluation process that took several months. The BCS looks at all aspects of a higher education institute in detail, such as faculty, resources, teaching material and coursework and also conducts independent interviews with lecturers and students during their final visit prior to giving the accredited status.
BCS is the Chartered Institute for IT with a mission to enable the information society. The organisation promotes wider social and economic progress through the advancement of information technology science and practice.
Sharing her views on the accreditation, Naomi Krishnarajah – Dean of IIT stated, “We are privileged to have our degree programmes recognised by the British Computer Society. This clearly underscores the high quality of the IT degree programmes that we provide at IIT.”
