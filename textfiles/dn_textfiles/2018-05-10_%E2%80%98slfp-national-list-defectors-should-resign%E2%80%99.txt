‘SLFP National List defectors should resign’

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professional’s Association (SLFPYPA) Executive Member Rajika Kodithuwakku yesterday stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National List MPs who left the government recently and took their seats on the Opposition side in Parliament should resign.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters. He said that the President gave seven out of twelve allocated National List seats to SLFP candidates who lost out in the general election held in August 2015 expecting their collaboration to continue his tasks. SLFP National List MPs who ignored the President should resign from their Parliamentary posts.
Kodituwakku also stressed that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka should resign from the ministerial post since he has no ethical right to hold that position while criticising the President. He was commenting on a statement by Field Marshal Fonseka at the May Day rally of the UNP claiming that they made the wrong person president and the country and the party has to suffer for that today.
“Before making such statements, the Field Marshal should recall the past. President Maithripala Sirisena is the person who granted a full Presidential pardon to Sarath Fonseka and promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal,” he added.
He further said that President Sirisena is the most eligible candidate for the Presidential Election which will be held in 2020.
“President Sirisena has already fulfilled 90 percent of the pledges made to the public during the presidential election campaign,” he added. Kodituwakku said that there is no need to cut the powers vested with the Executive Presidency further or abolish the executive presidency since the mandate was given to slash certain powers and the President has already done that.
SLFPYPA Executive Member Malik Perera was also present at the occasion.
