Special licence for passenger transport drivers

The Department of the Commissioner of Motor Traffic (DMT) has commenced issuing a special licence to drivers transport passengers buses with the intention of safeguarding commuters and pedestrians’ rights.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said it will be compulsory to obtain the special licence for drivers working in passenger transporting vehicles including CTB and private buses, motor coaches as well as staff and school vans in the future.
“The drivers are expected to undergo a 14 day training programme and should pass the compulsory examination following the two day practical test to become eligible for the new licence. The training programme will provide an awareness of first aid, technical know how and ethics and values a driver should processes,” he said.
“Qualified drivers who pass writing and practical tests will be given the special certificate after the payment of Rs. 2,000 to the DMT. In the future, when they renew their licence from the DMT, a special licence under the category of Passenger Transport (PT) will be given to drivers,” de Silva said.
According to statistics, there are around 40,000 passenger transport drivers in the country. Around 500 drivers have already undergone the training programme.
The third stage of the training programme was conducted under the patronage of Minister de Silva yesterday.
Around 100 drivers of passenger transport buses are undergoing the training programme.
The minister addressing a gathering said it is the responsibility of the Transport Ministry to regain the respect lost by passenger transport bus drivers.
