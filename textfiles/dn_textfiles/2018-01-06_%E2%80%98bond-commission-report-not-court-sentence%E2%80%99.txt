‘Bond Commission report not a court sentence’

The Treasury Bond Commission report is not a sentence issued by a court but a compilation of facts founded by the Commission in the investigation, said Education and Highway Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
Minister Kiriella said the COPE report on the same case has been sent to the Attorney General (AG) in 2016, so that this new report which was already forwarded to the AG is nothing new.
He made these observations at a meeting held at the election office of the UNP Local Government election candidate for the Kandy Municipal Council, former Mayor Raja Pushpakumara yesterday (05).
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who received several similar Commission reports, never forwarded them to the Attorney General, Minister Kiriella pointed out. Minister Kiriella added that the final outcome of the Treasury Bond Commission will not affect UNP’s victory in the upcoming Local Government election.
