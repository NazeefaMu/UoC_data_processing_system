Weragampita residents demand throughway

Dr. Hemasiri Abeywickrema Siriwardena Mawatha at the Weragampita bisects along the Matara Beliatta Railway Extension, is blocked due to the new railway line extension.
The surrounding area is densely populated.
“Local engineers designed the railway extension and they should be blamed since they never informed the residents that they would lose their throughway due to the railway line. They say they cannot provide us with an alternative route as there are some irregularities when acquiring land for the railway project. Now they pass the blame onto the Chinese contractor to get out of the situation,” Chandrasena, a resident in the area said.
“My parents gave part of their land to construct Avenue No 1 in Weragampita, Matara. It is known as Dr Hemasiri Abeywickrema Siriwardena Mawatha now,“ Chandrasena said.
“The late Mahanama Samaraweera allocated funds to construct the road. We did not realised that we would lose throughway on completion of the southern railway extension. But that is exactly what has happened. We demand that the railway authorities provide us a throughway, he said.
“Over 70 families use this road to travel to and from the Matara town each day and they have to take a a long route now,” L G Ruwan Prasad, another resident said.
“The road existed before I was born and we did not expect the railway authorities to block it,” he said.
Matara Divisional Secretary Darshana Wickremarachchi said the road was used by the public for almost 70 years. He said the demand for a through way was reasonable and hoped that the railway authorities would give due consideration to the matter.
