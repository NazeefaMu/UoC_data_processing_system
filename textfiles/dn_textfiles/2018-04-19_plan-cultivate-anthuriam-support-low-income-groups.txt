Plan to cultivate Anthuriam to support low income groups

Anthurium will be cultivated in Hambantota through women in lower income group families to export them to foreign countries to earn foreign exchange.
The driving force behind the programme is the planing unit of Matara District Secretariat. Fifty beneficaries have been selected for the programme.
