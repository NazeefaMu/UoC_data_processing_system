Sex abuse scandal biggest crisis ever for FA Chairman

LONDON Tuesday: The sex abuse scandal rocking English football is the greatest crisis current Football Association chairman Greg Clarke can recall, he told Sky News on Tuesday.
Clarke was referring to the serial child molester Barry Bennell, who has been accused by at least 20 footballers of abusing them when he worked for Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and Stoke City across three decades beginning in the 1970’s, and is subject to five separate police investigations.
The FA has also launched its own internal reviewappointing leading lawyer Kate Gallafent, an expert in child protection, to head it up. The FA said the review would find out “what information the FA was aware of at the relevant times around the issues that have been raised in the press, what clubs were aware of, and what action was or should have been taken”.
