Rs. 13,000m spent for improvement of rural infrastructure: Minister Musthapha

Vast development in rural infrastructure has been initiated by the North East Local Services Improvement Project (NELSIP) whichhad been implemented by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. But so far, no publicity had been given to these development projects. Accordingly, we could reestablish the activities of the civil society in the North East areas which had declined due to the 30 year long war.
The main aim has been to improve the services rendered by local Authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, in an accountable and responsive manner. Through these implementations, the keen intention was to clear the mindset of the community.
Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha said so, addressing the gathering at a progress review meeting of the NELSIP which was held recently. This meeting was held at the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and all heads of the Local Authorities in Northern and Eastern provinces attended the meeting. Local Authority heads pointed out that finances of the underprivileged Local Authorities have improved due to the funds allocated by these projects. (NELSIP)
The amount invested in 101 Local Authorities in the North Eastern, North Central, North Western and Uva Provinces was Rs. 13,000 million. 1190 development projects have been completed. This includes rural roads of 852 km, 140 markets and fairs, 14 water supply projects, 74 parks and play grounds and 36 multi-functional buildings.
The projects was funded by the World Bank and the Australian Government. New programmes such as Divisional Audit Committees, Village Planning Committees and Village Development Plans were introduced. These newly introduced programmes would be extended to other Local Authorities too, According to a press release.
