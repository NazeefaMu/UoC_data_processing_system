Drone camera falls on Ruwanweli Mahaseya during Kapruka Pooja

A videographer was arrested by Police after his drone camera fell on the sacred Ruwanweli Mahaseya in Anuradhapura on Saturday evening during a Kapruka Pooja, Police said. The drone camera had reportedly struck the Hathares Kotuwa before crashing at the base of Ruwanweli Seya. It had come down due to a technical fault.
SSP Ravi Peris said the Ruwanweli Seya was not damaged due to the incident.
He said the videographer had not obtained approval to use the drone camera either from the chief incumbent or the management of the Ruwanweli Seya. SSP Peris said that if the drone had fallen on the large crowd gathered it may have caused injury to devotees.
Police recently announced that those operating a drone camera should get prior approval from Police and in case of religious places, the approval of authorities.
It is learned that the videographer had been hired by a group of employees from a government institution, the organisers of the Kapruka pooja on Saturday. The videographer is to be produced in Court.
