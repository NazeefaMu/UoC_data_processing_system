One Direction's Louis Tomlinson's mother dies at 43

 
One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson's mother has died from leukaemia aged 43.
Johannah Deakin passed away on Wednesday (7) at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital.
Earlier this year she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the blood cancer and had been at a hospital in London since May.
She had seven children and worked as a midwife. Her partner Dan said in a statement that "she would always look to put other people before herself ".
Johannah split from her ex-partner, Mark Tomlinson, around the time that Louis was auditioning for The X Factor in 2010 after they'd had four children together.
She had 24-year-old Louis with first husband Troy Austin
Louis kept first step-dad Mark Tomlinson's surname but his mum remarried last year.
Johannah became a grandmother after Louis' former partner Briana Jungwirth gave birth to his first child, Freddie, in January.
The One Direction singer split from the US model before Freddie was born and is now in a new relationship.
The family statement on Johannah continues: "She desired nothing more than for everyone around her to be happy and loving.
"She worked tirelessly on numerous charity campaigns, creating memories for many individuals and their families.
"It wasn't uncommon for Johannah to hear through the media of an individual in need of assistance.
"She would immediately make it her objective to get that person what they often desperately needed, and rarely without success."
The family has asked for privacy and space in the weeks ahead.
The family also thanked University College London Hospital where Johannah had been treated since May and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, where she'd been cared for during her final weeks.
As well as Louis, Johannah leaves behind six other children - Lottie, 18, Felicite, 16, plus two sets of twins, Phoebe and Daisy, 12, and two-year-olds Ernest and Doris.
