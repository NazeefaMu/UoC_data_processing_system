Memories of Bradby Shield

The Bradby Shield encounter popularly called “The Bradby” is the highlight of the school rugby calendar. It is played annually between traditional rivals Royal College and Trinity College. The 2nd leg is on Saturday in Pallekele. Royal and Trinity were among the first schools to take up the sport and continued meeting since they first met in July 1920. From this game it was a yearly encounter, with Trinity College winning the first 21 games. Royal’s first win came in 1941.
In 1945, the principal of Royal College, Edward Lawrence Bradby, put forward the idea of a trophy, to which the principal of Trinity College C.E. Simithraaratchy gave the fullest backing. Royal College principal offered a wooden shield designed and made by Kandyan silversmiths. It is a wooden disk decorated with intricate traditional Kandyan silver works. The agreement was , the shield should be presented to the winning team’s captain soon after the final whistle of the 2nd leg. Today the under 18 game is played for the C.E. Simithraaratchy Cup, which was donated by an old boy called George Hemachandra. Thus the two principals who went all out for the Bradby have two trophies named in their memory.
This year’s first leg of the 74th Bradby played on 21 April saw Royal come up with an excellent overall performance to outplay Trinity by 39 points to 7. This game was also a league game which meant that the Royalists remain unbeaten in the league so far and top their group. The under 18 game also went in favor of Royal.
The first Bradby game was in 1945 when Royal led by C.D.L. Fernando beat Trinity led by Robert Sourjah 3-0 in the first leg in Colombo. However in the game played in Kandy the Trinitians managed to win 6-0 under S.B. Pilapitya and clinched the shield in the inaugural year on the basis of aggregate.
Royal’s first win in the Bradby came in 1948 under the captaincy of Ashroff “Ashey” Cader, Royal with four fresher’s won both legs- 6/3 and 8/6.
From 1952 to 1957 Trinity recorded six consecutive wins. In 1956 it was regarded as the Golden Year of Trinity rugby. They beat Royal in both legs 15-0 and 11-0. Nine members of that Trinity team played for Sri Lanka - Frank David, Rodney Frank, Nimal Maralande, Rajiv de Silva, Sena de Silva, Gamini Weerasinghe, Mike de Alwis, Ken de Joodt and Franklyn Jacobs. The side was coached by Bertie Dias.
In 1958 Royal led by Lorensz Perera who sprang from one wing to the other to collect a Trinity kick to touch and ran 75 yards to score the match winning try regained the Bradby after a lapse of six years.
The return match in 1964 at Nittawela will long be remembered for one of the most remarkable drop goal kicking ever seen in a rugby match in Sri Lanka with Royal’s Lakdasa Dissanayake executing three drop goals and another drop kick to convert a try - over 40 yards out, which enabled Royal to win the Bradby after two years. He contributed 11 points out of Royal’s 14.
In 1971 Fred Pereira’s Royalists recorded the highest score for the series up to that time when they beat Trinity 22 points to 3, only one game was played due to JVP insurgency in the country.
 
The highest sequence of wins in this series is six by Trinity, between 1952 and 1957. Royal won the Shield four years back to back from 2001-2004. Today the tally is Trinity 39 wins, Royal 32 and 2 tied.
