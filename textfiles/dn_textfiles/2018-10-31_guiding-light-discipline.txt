Head Girl of Holy Cross College Gampaha Prashansa Gunawardane believes in being a powerful force for good. She believes in striving for an ideal. Above all, she believes in other people. Perfect Prefects features Gunawardane who is determined to make a change.
Gunawardane points out that younger people ought to be inspired by a role model who faces challenges in life without hunting for ways to get rid of them, who live with integrity, optimism, hope, determination and compassion. And most of all someone who can overcome any challenge, through strength and hope.
“One is Nicholas Vujicic, who’s a Christian Evangelist and a Motivational speaker. He is really a great inspiration. He took all his disabilities as challenges and now he is a great example and a great personality, and he uses his utmost strength to motivate all citizens worldwide. He’s unstoppable and stands strong with faith and confidence,” said Gunawardane
Religious background
Being a student of Holy Cross College from grade one itself, has provided her with the atmosphere to form up her character socially, emotionally and ethically. With the religious background and all holy activities, she was able to build up her spirituality and love towards God.
“With the excellent academic background, I have been able to gain a good quality education, which is a guiding light to become a knowledgeable and an intelligent girl. As my dear Alma Mater provides me with the platform to display my talents and skills of singing, debating, acting, announcing, and public speaking, I have been able to build up a balanced personality as an all-rounder and to add up positive qualities to my character. From grade Eight upwards, as I was elected to hold Primary and Junior Prefectship, I have been able to build up a personality with leadership qualities such as passion, self-confidence, authenticity, assertiveness, optimism, courage, flexibility and adaptability, perseverance and understanding, which was a major reason to be qualified as a Senior Prefect. The school influenced and changed me, to an entirely different character with the enhancement of all positive character traits and especially leadership qualities within me,” explained Gunawardane.
She firmly believes that as we are humans we can change the world. Gunawardane stressed that because we are humans, with intelligence, with feelings and with the ability to proceed according to what we think, we have the possibility of changing the world.
Common aim
“As an individual, we cannot change the entire world, but yes, we can do something. When all individuals of the whole world begin with doing something to change the world we can change the world. My preference is first to become the change that I wish to see in the world. I believe that once, every single person begins to think so, it’s effortless to achieve the common aim of changing the world and making a difference,” said Gunawardane.
Gunawardane is Art’s Stream student following English, Information and Communication Technology and Greek and Roman Civilization. She dreams of working as an Announcer or a TV Presenter, publishing novels.
“My ambition is to become a Lawyer because I really hate injustice and inequality. Therefore my utmost aim is to take the lead with the weapon of justice and to help people who are suffering mainly because of injustice, to use my voice to speak the truth, work on behalf of discriminated people and stand high for what is right,” stated Gunawardane.
Gunawardane is passionate about the matter of eradicating poverty from the world. She is convinced that if every individual helps one needy person and if all governments, social welfare groups and individuals work for it, of course, we can attain the objective of eradicating poverty.
Equal rights
“And along with it, one of my greatest passions is woman empowerment and working for woman rights. I, in fact, the desire to rise up my voice and set off to help each woman to get inspired and motivated and to work for equal rights. Lend a hand to each and every woman to prove the purity and potential of womanhood, prohibit prostitution as a means of earning money for living, voicing up in order to stop rapes and sexually abusing and evade overruling of women. As a female, I want to do my maximum to create a pleasant and free atmosphere to all women who live in fear, loss of hope and isolation. And to motivate all women to raise womanhood up to the high principles and to stand against violence,” elucidated Gunawardane.
Her message to the youth is that first one should build up attitudes that are suitable for a leader. She commented that it’s a must to have a balanced personality, which will definitely bring forth a positive impact on being a great and influential leader.
“Make use of your passions for good, always speak aloud when you have to, it will inspire and fuel up to make a difference in the world. Be unique, be independent, whenever you deal with a team, open yourself to others ideas and viewpoints and understand one another.
Inspiration
A leader must be committed to the welfare of a community. He or she should build up a character that can withstand any challenge or obstacle. Each and every leader must certainly turn out to be an inspiration to all others. All the young people must understand that the outer society is comprised of a diversity of people who are holding different opinions. We must be able to live independently rather than depending on others for everything. Each individual must be able to stand alone with confidence and with a strong attitude, which will be an easy way to survive in a large society. And definitely it’s a must, to respect others ideas and to be helpful and caring, that’ll help to stand long, in a massive and a complicated society,” explained Gunawardane.
She loves reading adventure stories such as Hunger Game series, Lord of the Rings, mystery stories, Harry Potter and a great variety of Classics, such as Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. She enjoys mystery and adventure stories creating a feeling of excitement and tension. She loves to read about fear, danger, war, victory and magic since they bring out amusement.
“When I read the novel Jane Eyre, I was so much inspired by the character of Jane Eyre. She is at the top of my listing of favourite characters. I find her character so extraordinary and unique, because of her character traits and attitudes. She is very much principled, determined and strong-willed, which are important qualities. She was able to forgive the people who wronged her - indeed that’s a major positive quality. She is a person who relies on herself and her own intelligence. Though her life was bitter at first, she displays initiative, resilience in the face of challenges, honesty, depth, clarity and a massive capacity of love and to be loyal. To me Jane Eyre is a perfect role model to follow, as she prevails against everything that is thrown at her from the world,” points out Gunawardane.
Real inspiration
One leader she admires is Barack Obama the Former President of the USA, who is a real inspiration and a great example to many leaders. She points out that in general, he is a good husband to his wife and a caring father to his children. His humble nature is revealed in his personal life.
“He never promised anything beyond the limits of his office nor set himself as a Saint. He offered hope and change to all Americans, which was even a motivation to all people worldwide. Obama’s campaign used the slogan “change we can believe in”. Belief in change is a fundamental, foundational quality of his leadership. He is a person who makes endings into beginnings. He empowered others to speak up about the things impacting their lives. He had the attitude of We, not I. It’s a major attitude that should be within every leader, who works with a team to achieve a common aim together. From his character all leaders find a superior quality which should be developed within all leaders, that is a leader must be a great communicator and of course a great listener, and definitely a great speaker. This passionate character influenced me to learn through his life.
Lastly, I take this as an opportunity to thank my dear beloved parents who are always by me just as my guardian angels and who always motivate me to be unique. A special thanks goes to Rev. Sister Principal, Rev. Sister Vice Principal, all the Rev. sisters and teachers of the staff, for helping me to reach up to this level,” said Gunawardane.
