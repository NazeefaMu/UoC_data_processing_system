Leaf through magic!

When you venture outside your home, stop scrolling through Twitter, and walk through the doors of a library, something magical happens.
It’s so quiet, so peaceful. You can smell the pages of old books. You nestle into a cosy seat, pick a book that takes your fancy, and forget about everything going on outside those walls. A library is the ultimate escape – from the noise and bustle of the outside world, into a place of peace and quiet, into wherever your book takes you.
Oh, and so many of them are absolutely stunning, as they should be, when we’re talking about places that honour knowledge, art, and creative thought.
To pay tribute to the magic of libraries, Italian photographer Massimo Listri has travelled around the world capturing the beautiful pieces where books spend their time.
The resulting book, Temples of Knowledge, is published by Taschen and is now available to order. Metro
