This will be followed by the Sri Sangharaja Perahera to be held for the 71st successive year parading the streets of Kandy.
Patronised by the Malwatte Chapter Maha Nayaka Thera and Central Province Governor, Niluka Ekanayake heads the organizing committee with Sri Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya President L H Harischandra, Secretary Sarath Perera, Treasurer Chapa Weeraratne, Kantha Sangamaya President Kusuma Weeraratne, Chief Minister’s Secretary Tissa Karunaratne and various Buddhist societies and traders of the city, Kandy Municipality, Sri Sangaraja Daham Pasala and Sri Dalada Maligava. This perahera, as usual, will be held under the guidance of the Ven Mahopadyaya Agga Maha Panditha Aluthgama Dhammananda Nayaka Thera and his chief pupil Ven Ketayapatane Piyadassi Nayaka Thera.
Ven Welivita Saranankara Sangharaja Thera was born in the village Welivita near Thumpane in the Kandy District on June 18, 1698. His father was Mudliyar Kulatunga and was given the name Kulatunga Banda. He was ordained at the Suriyagoda Raja Maha Viharaya by the Viharadhipathi Kithsirimevan Rajasurendra Gaumnanse who was also the Viharadhipathi of Poya Malu Viharaya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya.
There were no bhikkhus who had higher ordination during the time and only the novices called ‘Ganinnanses’ were in the viharayas.
It was Rev Jacome Gonsalves, Goan missionary to Sri Lanka, Father of Sinhala Catholic literature of the Catholic Church, who predicted the complete eradication of Buddhist doctrine within two years. As the king Weera Parakrama Narendrasinghe (1707-1739) who ruled the country during the time was in close association with this father and other priests of the church, Saranankara Samanera could not get the help of the king to foster the sasana, but he was successful in getting the help of the king to inaugurate the first pirivena of the present Buddhist revival at Niyamakanda in Udunuwara.
Ven Welivita Saranankara Samanera Thera did not like the ways and manners of the Ganinnanses who were married and kept views and children in viharayas. He organized a separate Bhikku – clan called ‘Silvath Samagama’. The church did not like this Silvath Samagama and was in a murder spree by poisoning many samaneras of this Samagama. A conspiracy by the chief priest of the Christian church to poison the Sangharaja through Kafirs was exposed and was taken by the Dutch Governor who ruled the coastal areas who deported the priest to his homeland. This was narrated in the prose book Mandaram Puwatha.
All aspirations of Venerable Saranankara Thera were fulfilled after King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1782 AC) ascended the throne.
The king could get the help of the Dutch to provide a ship ‘Tharka’ for the emissaries to travel to Siam (Thailand) to bring Bhikkhus for higher ordination.
King Dharmika of Siam sent 21 Bhikkhus, eight novices and three Siamese Ministers by a Siamese ship which landed at the Trincomalee Harbour on Esala Poya Day in 1746 AC. Sri Lankan Ministers returned to Colombo by the Dutch ship. The historic ‘Upasampadawa’ was held at the ‘Visumgrama Seema Malakaya’.
Uposathagaraya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1753, by Venerable Upali Maha Thera of Siam establishing a clan of Bhikkhus called ‘Shiampali Maha Nikaya’ (combination of two words ‘Shiam’ and ‘Upali’ became ‘Shiampali’.)
Ven Aluthgama Dhammananda Thera of Malwatte Maha Viharaya inaugurated the Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya, Kandy on May 15, 1947, at a meeting held at Sri Pushpadana Hall presided over by Ven Rambukwelle Sri Sobitha Maha Nayake Thera of Malwatte Chapter, assisted by G O D College, Kandy and decided to hold an annual perahera to commemorate the Sangharaja, along with some other activists.
The first Sangharaja perahera was held on July 25, 1947, starting from Daluggolla Raja Maha Viharaya, Ampitiya where the remains of ‘Sangharaja’ were cremated and a Chaithya constructed by King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe enshrining the ashes of Sangharaja along with the relics of the Buddha.
The Sangharaja statue was unveiled by Pananwala Basnayake Nilame of Srimath Upulwan Devalaya while a perahera organised by C B Nugawela, Diyawadana Nilame coalesced with this perahera near the Sri Dalada Maligawa and paraded the streets of Kandy to end up at Malwatte Maha Vihara.
