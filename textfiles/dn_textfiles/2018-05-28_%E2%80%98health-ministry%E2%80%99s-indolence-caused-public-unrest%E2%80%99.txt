Influenza outbreak in South
‘Health Ministry’s indolence caused public unrest’

Public unrest had risen throughout the Southern Province owing to the indolence of the Health Ministry and its Epidemiology Unit in handling the rampant influenza virus which first broke out about six weeks ago, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Karapitiya Teaching Hospital (KTH) branch Co-Secretary Dr. Kanchitha Samararathne alleged.
He was addressing a press conference convened in Galle, on Saturday. GMOA Karapitiya Teaching Hospital branch President Dr. Janath Liyanage, Co-Secretary Dr. Manjula Zoysa and General Committee Member Dr. Lahiru Sasanka also participated in the media briefing.
We had a number of consultations with paediatric consultants, paediatric surgeons and respiratory disease consultants over the matter. Majority of them confirmed that the dominant flu epidemic in the South was seasonal influenza
"Seasonal influenza was witnessed at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 in Australia, the UK and USA, which was comparable to the dominant influenza situation in the South. According to our observations, we understand that the current flu disease status and related complications are quite similar to the seasonal influenza that spread in the South during the corresponding previous periods of the year," Dr. Sasanka said.
"As per our scrutiny, the current flue disease cases were first reported from the Mirissa and Weligama areas in the Matara district, which are predominantly tourist regions. Hence, we believe that the virus may have originated from a foreigner hit with flu virus," he added.
At present, a large number of paediatric deaths have been caused due influenza and related aggravated complications and an increased number of influenza-positive patients are being treated at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and other hospitals. We also understand that a large number of persons who are hit by the virus had taken treatment privately, without being admitted to government medical institutions," Dr. Sasanka further said.
"The most serious factor over the issue is that members of our medical staff, including consultants, doctors and nurses, have contacted the virus as well. This imposes a greater impediment to the proper functioning of the treatment of patients. As such, we insist Health authorities to take immediate steps in order to initiate a swift programme to administer medical staff of hospitals who treat patients, with flu vaccinations. It is the only precautionary measure that can be taken to protect the staff form contracting the virus," he said.
The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine can vary. However, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40 to 60 percent among the population during flu seasons, a GMOA Co-secretary said.
"The current silent strategy maintained by Health authorities with regard to the rampant virus, would lead to the intensification of the disease up to a high-risk epidemic status. We urge them to carry out specific programmes to educate the public over the imminent epidemic conditions," he added.
GOMA KTH branch President and Paediatric Consultant Dr. Janath Liyanage, speaking at the media briefing, said influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It infects the nose, throat, and sometimes, the lungs, varying from mild to severe and could even lead to death.
The symptoms of influenza are mainly fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. People who have the flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms usually start suddenly, not gradually, Liyanage added.
The flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land on the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A person might also contract flu by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth or nose, he said.
Hence, flu patients should use a suitable handkerchief or cover their mouths with their arms bent towards their faces. Always make it a point to stay at least two metres away from a sick person in order to avoid coming in contact with the virus, he added.
To avoid contracting the virus, people should avoid sick people and stay home if they are sick. It is also important to wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand wash. Linens, eating utensils and dishes belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without washing thoroughly first. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with water and soap and do not require to be cleaned separately. Further, frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, work and school, especially if someone is ill.
Young children under five years of age (Infants under two years are at high risk), people over 65 years of age, pregnant woman and people with certain chronic health conditions, immune-compromised persons, patients under steroid treatment and medical staff (as they are exposed to the virus in carrying out clinical services for patients), are at high risk of contracting serious flu complications.
"At the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, there are only two Paediatric Intensive Care Units and they are both overcrowded with patients at present. There are only seven Intensive Care Treatment beds in those units. Furthermore, there are only two pediatric Intensive Care consultants who have to work round the clock. Other children's wards are also crowded. Hence, authorities should take immediate measures to rectify the situation. If the matter is left unattended, it would result in more pediatric deaths," he said.
"We suggest authorities to reach out to more paediatric specialists from other hospitals and arrange to transfer surplus child patients to other hospitals in Colombo, Kandy and Anuradhapura, where there are advanced Paediatric Intensive Care facilities, he added.
The GMOA KTH branch had also prepared handouts educating the public over precautionary measures with regard to the widespread influenza virus in the Southern Province.
