Greek forest fires kill over 60

GREECE: Huge forest fires raging across Greece have killed over 60 people and injured more than 100, forcing authorities to seek international assistance.
A state of emergency was declared in parts of Athens as coast guard boats headed out in an attempt to rescue dozens of people trapped on beaches by fire.
A Red Cross official revealed that 26 bodies were found in the yard of a villa in the seaside village of Mati on Tuesday morning.
The death toll previously stood at 24 before the grim discovery.
People have been told to leave their homes across the region as authorities desperately try to bring the situation under control.
Of at least 104 people injured by the blazes, 69 needed hospital treatment and 11 were in a serious condition, officials said.
Fire Service spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said Greece had called on the European Union for assistance with aerial and ground support in helping battle the flames.
“We are doing everything humanly possible to tray and tackle these fires,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in Bosnia as he cut short a visit there and returned to Athens.
“What concerns us is that there are fires occurring simultaneously.”
The first major fire broke out in a pine forest near the seaside settlement of Kineta 30 miles west of Athens between the capital and Corinth.
At least 220 firefighters were on the scene while five water-dropping planes and seven helicopters helped to fight the blaze from the air.
Local authorities said children’s summer camps and a seaside resort for military officers were evacuated, while dozens of homes and cars were reportedly destroyed.
The coast guard was sending five vessels to rescue people trapped on nearby beaches by the flames. - AFP
