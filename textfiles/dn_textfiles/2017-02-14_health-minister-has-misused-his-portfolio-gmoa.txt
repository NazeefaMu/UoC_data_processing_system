Health Minister has misused his portfolio: GMOA

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) informed President Maithripala Sirisena that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has misused his cabinet portfolio. He should tender his resignation for the offence, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said the Health Minister had acted to hide the low quality of the SAITM by not implementing the powers vested on him through the Medical Ordinance in connection with the Technical Report issued on the SAITM by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
He has not informed the courts about the guidelines in connection with the `minimum quality' of medical educations declared by the SLMC. These details are included in five places in the the Court of appeal Judgment, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, since 2006, the Health Minister has been working to prevent the gazette on `minimum quality' getting passed in Parliament. As an MP, he had started his crusade in 2006 to prevent the `minimum quality' for medical education during the time of former Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. The evidence is in 2006 October 3 Hansard. All evidence will be released to the country by the GMOA through Hansard records. The GMOA is waiting for the President to follow his own stand which he expressed in writing during the time he held the Health Minister portfolio, Zoysa said.
