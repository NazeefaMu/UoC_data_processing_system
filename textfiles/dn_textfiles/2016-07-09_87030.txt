[Parliament– (09-06-2016)]

Revised ‘Standing Orders’ to be implemented in August - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced in Parliament that the revised Standing Orders would be distributed among the Party Leaders next week.
He said those would be implemented in August. He said as of the revised Standing Orders, it is compulsory for the relevant subject Ministers, Deputy or State Ministers to remain in the House to reply to the questions asked by MPs.
He made this observation when Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella brought the attention of the Speaker that the relevant subject Minister or Deputy Minister was not present in the chamber to respond to a question by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake had raised a question under Standing Order 23 (2) from the Petroleum Industries Minister. Neither Minister Chandima Weerakkody nor Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage were present in the chamber to respond to it.
Leader of the House Kiriella said that he had not received a reply to the question from the Ministry. “I have only got the question. If the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister is not present, there is no point in raising the question.
This is an insult to the House. Not even the shadow minister is present,” he said.
At this point, Joint Opposition MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said that he could manage the shadow Cabinet Ministry of the Petroleum Industries. Kiriella said if the MP is ready to crossover, the Government could bestow him a ministerial portfolio.
Trial-at-Bar system to be used for fraud and corruption cases - Ajith P Perera
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday in Parliament proposed to reserve three to four High Courts to hear cases of corruption and fraud using the Trial-at-Bar system.
He was participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday. He said the Government was duty bound to come up with some acceptable and fair mechanism to speed up the legal activities with regard to allegations on corruption and fraud.
“Nobody would obstruct to this proposal. However, we have to assure a fair trial. The Law of a Jungle could not be operated,” he said.
Commenting on the shadow Cabinet appointed by the Joint Opposition, the Deputy Minister said the number of Cabinet Ministers that could be appointed after the next General Election would be limited to 30, as of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. “We regret that the JO is unaware of this basic fact. The shadow cabinet consists of 52 members. The list of names amuses us very much, as we are well aware of their past conduct and how they managed their previous portfolios,” he said.
Hybrid Courts concept not possible in Sri Lanka - Dilan
State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said in Parliament that the concept of ‘hybrid courts’ was not possible within Sri Lanka.
He was participating in the debate on the Order under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, Regulations under the Judicature Act and Mediation Board (Amendment) Bill.
“As of my opinion, foreign judges cannot hear court cases in our country. They could aid various commissions and provide technical assistance. The concept of hybrid courts would not be realistic. It cannot be done as of our Constitution,” he said.
Justice Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said the initial proposal of the UNHRC was revised to remove the clause to include foreign judges after negotiations with the Lankan team. He said the clause was then revised as “mechanism with participation of foreign experts.”
“Other than that, there had been no pressure for Sri Lanka in this regard. Various foreign actors may utter various things, but we are not bound to do all what they utter,” the minister explained.
Earlier, taking part in the debate, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake too queried as to whether there was any legal provision for foreign judges to hear court cases within the coutnry.
No threat to judiciary from politicians - Kiriella
Judiciary is not under threat from politicians today, but from educated professionals, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday, participating in the debate on Order Under Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Mediation Board (Amendment) Bill.
“You all might have noticed in newspapers during the last couple of weeks that doctors were staging demonstrations near the Supreme Court. They have even threatened that if the government goes ahead registering graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, they would stage a countrywide strike, which was clearly an insult to the judiciary and also attempting to influence the judicial process.”
“It was not we who started the SAITM, but the previous government. Degrees offered by the SAITM have already been recognized. The SAITM BSc in Medicine was recognized by the previous government. Now the problem is whether SAITM degree holders could be registered in the Medical Council.
The Medical Council did not register the SAITM and the SAITM students went before courts. While the SAITM students are seeking for justice from courts of law, the Medical Council and the doctors threaten to bring the country to a standstill. Is such actions right? Is it not trying to manipulate the court procedure? I call upon the court to take action against this,” he said.
He said the country needed private education as the government lacked resources to provide all those who get through the Advanced Level examination with tertiary education opportunities. “Look at England. All students who get through the A Levels have a university to enter and continue their education. But in our case, around 80 percent of those who pass their A levels, were unable to enter universities. Students with good qualifications from Colombo, Kandy and Galle were also unable to enter universities,” he commented.
Ministry to re-gazette essential food items and maximum prices - Bathiudeen
Industries and Trade Minister Rishad Bathiudeen told Parliament yesterday, that the ministry would take immediate measures to re-gazette essential food items and also hope to publish the maximum prices later after having discussions with the Cost of Living Committee Chairman Malik Samarawickrema and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Minister also said that the present pricing formula of essential food items which was implemented by the Consumer Affairs Authority must be republished and a proper monitoring mechanism be introduced district wise, since an issue has been raised recently with regard to the price of consumer goods as the prices of essential commodities are been significantly different from one district to another.
“This was happening due to transport costs and the number of middle men involved in the supply chain. At present, consumers are of the view that this was happening due to the increase of VAT. Therefore, these concerns should be addressed positively in order to maintain the cost of living in the country, while ensuring the delivery of quality goods at the lowest price,” the Minister said.
He also said that though the VAT applied to certain goods, it did not apply to essential food commodities such as white rice, sugar, dhal, onions, potatoes, red onions, milk powder, wheat flour, dried chillies, green gram, chickpeas, canned fish, sprats, chicken and pharmaceuticals. Especially in Sathosa outlets, we are selling VAT free essential food items as mentioned earlier. Even vegetables and dried fish are sold without the addition of VAT.
“We will also strengthen the market raiding mechanism. Hereafter, action would be taken to telecast the prices of essential food items through the electronic and print media. Consumers could lodge their complaints on the prices of essential food items via Hotline number 1977.” he added.
He further added that the government had decided to subsidize essential food items such as sugar, dhal, big onions, sprats, dried chillies, potatoes, canned fish, milk powder, fresh milk, gas and many more items.
“The Prime Minister has also advised to convene a Cabinet subcommittee to submit a weekly report on essential food items every Tuesday,” he added.
Treasury allocated funds for relevant taxes,imported dates - FM
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke yesterday said in Parliament that there was no need to exempt taxes imposed on imported Dates since the Treasury allocated enough funds to pay the relevant taxes to release the bulk of Dates donated by Muslim countries.
He was responding to a question raised by MP Douglas Devananda as to whether the government Would be able to exempt taxes imposed on Dates presented by Muslim countries to be distributed among local Muslims during the month of Ramazan.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake also said that the taxes on imported Dates were imposed under the Special Commodity Levy Act No. 48 of 2007.
According to that a tax valued, Rs. 60 have to be paid for a kilo of Dates.
“Accordingly, the Treasury has allocated funds to the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Ministry and the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry to pay the total tax of Rs 22 million for a bulk of 27 metric tons of Dates distributed by Muslim countries for the use of this year’s Ramazan period,” the minister said. This was done because it had been the tradition for many years. But this time we formalized it following a request made by the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department.
“We did not want to provide Dates duty free.
We imposed the tax on religious affairs and we paid it more transparently. Any other area which would be a similar significance for any religion, would certainly be looked at. But it was done concerning religious harmony and not with any other intention,” the Minister said.
He further added that any imports arriving would not be tolerated. It has to be done only during Ramazan period only.
