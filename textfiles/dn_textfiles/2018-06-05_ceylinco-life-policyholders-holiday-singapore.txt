Ceylinco Life policyholders on holiday to Singapore

Fun, adventure and new experiences were the highlights of the itinerary when nearly 50 policyholders of Ceylinco Life and their families were treated to an all-expenses-paid holiday in Singapore recently.
The group consisting of nearly 200 people was taken on a tour around the city state and also visited popular attractions.
The group was accompanied by popular actress and television personality Sanjeewani Weerasinghe, one of the Brand Ambassadors for the Ceylinco Life Family Savari program.
This was the second batch of winners to go on ‘savari’ in the 11th edition of the life insurance leader’s Family Savari programme. Earlier in May, nearly 4,000 members of policyholder families spent a day at the Leisure World theme park. A holiday to China awaits another 10 policyholders and their families, while five grand prize winning policyholder families are to visit Rome in June.
This annual promotion is intended to increase penetration of life insurance and to reward policyholders for keeping their policies active and is the largest customer promotion in Sri Lanka’s insurance industry.
In all, Family Savari 11 will benefit 4,260 people from 1,065 policyholder families, an increase of 2,000 over the 2,260 rewarded annually at previous Family Savari promotions. Since its inception, nearly 24,000 people have won overseas holidays or an excursion to the Leisure World theme park under this programme.
The Ceylinco Life Family Savari promotion has as its Brand Ambassadors the Sri Lankan actors Sriyantha Mendis, Sanjeewani Weerasinghe and Roshan and Kushlani Ranawana who participate in the Savari outings and overseas tours.
The market leader in Sri Lanka’s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
