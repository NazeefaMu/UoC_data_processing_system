Uniqueness of  RUEFULNESS

Ruefulness, by Namal Kumara will be free and open to the public from December 21 to the 27 2018 at Art Space Sri Lanka.
Namal Kumara is an emerging artist who, following his graduation in 2016 from the University of Visual and Performing Arts, has entered the local art scene with a strong following from collectors. A young artist whose medium and style sets him apart from other young artist in that his style is unique and consistent, he was selected to participate in the Imago Mundi Publication by the Benetton Foundation in 2016. His work is a part of numerous local and international contemporary collections and he continues to participate in group shows locally.
In explaining this series of work on canvas the artist states, ‘Humanity abuses itself through ambition and ego, this causes a confusion and contradiction in the way we choose to live our lives. The play of the object against the shadow creates a unique story once combined; I have used this as my narrative. My works incorporate a human figure with open hands pointing upwards to symbolise how humans are punished by their minds. There are no shadows behind these forms, rather the shadow forms the image of the bull in motion; a symbol of the unrest and aggression. I use reds, yellows, blues, greys, purples and geometrical shapes construct this imagery and portray the ruefulness that has inspired by work.’
