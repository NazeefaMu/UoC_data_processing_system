Kelaniya University ‘77 Science batch celebrates 40th anniversary

Between Oct 21 and 22, the alumni of the Kelaniya University’s ‘77 Science batch celebrated their 40th anniversary of the commencement of their undergraduate studies at Pegasus Reef, Wattala. It was followed by a visit to their Alma Mater on Sunday, which covered all the memorable places to relive their sweet memories and to have lunch with the Deputy Vice Chancellor and the Dean of the Science Faculty.
About 100 of alumni and their family members joined to celebrate this event. They have come together from various corners of the world such as Canada, USA, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to meet with their batchmates. The gathering was full of fun events which had emotional and sentimental relationships to their university life back in 1977. At present, these alumni serve humanity as University Dons, Scientists, IT Specialists, Environmentalists, Science and Math Teachers and in the areas of public administration, management, financial and entrepreneurial sectors.
At the batch reunion, it was decided to perform some charitable events in the future as their Batch Social Responsibility (BSR). Donating a dialysis machine, supporting needy students financially, providing scholarships and conducting educational seminars in the areas with limited access to resources, were some of the BSR activities discussed. Considering the necessity to establish a formal body to engage in the suggested BSR activities effectively, the Association of University of Kelaniya ’77 Science Batch was established at this reunion. An action committee to work on the BSR activities and to coordinate BSR work effectively was also formed by electing representatives from each country where the batch mates are residing.
