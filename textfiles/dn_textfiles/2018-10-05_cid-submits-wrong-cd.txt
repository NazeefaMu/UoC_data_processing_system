False evidence case  against Ravi K
CID submits wrong CD

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had submitted a Compact Disc (CD) which contained an application of a university student, before the Colombo Magistrate instead of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate into the Treasury bond issue on August 20, 2016, observed Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
He made this observation when the hearing on the B-report filed against MP Ravi Karunanayake for allegedly providing false evidence before the same Presidential Commission was taken up before the Court. Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing on behalf of the CID thereafter submitted the Presidential Commission report before the Court.
On an earlier hearing date, the Magistrate ordered the CID to submit a CD including the section of the report of the Presidential Commission to prove the accuracy of their charge against Ravi Karunanayake and hence the CID submitted a CD.
Thereafter, the Colombo Chief Magistrate observed that the CID had submitted a wrong CD before the Court. The Magistrate fixed the inquiry for October 8.
