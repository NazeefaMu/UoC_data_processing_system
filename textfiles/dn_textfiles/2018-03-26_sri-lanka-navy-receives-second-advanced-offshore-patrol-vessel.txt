Sri Lanka Navy receives second Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel

The second Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel (AOPV) constructed at the Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) for the mission requirements of the Sri Lanka Navy, was officially handed over in India, last Friday.
The vessel was formally handed over to Sri Lanka Navy Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Neil Rosayro by the Sri Lankan High Commissioner for India, Chithrangani Vagiswara and Chairman and Managing Director of the GSL, Rear Admiral (Rtd) Sheker Mithal.
The construction work of this AOPV began at the GSL in 2014. The state-of-the-art vessel is capable of conducting patrols, policing, reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) and pollution control missions in Sri Lanka’s maritime zones.
