Cooperative money misused by interim committee: CTSU

A sum of Rs.2,000 million deposited in a State Bank by the Education Employees’ Cooperative, Thrift & Credit Society Ltd., has been misused by the Interim Committee appointed by former Cooperatives and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando, the Ceylon Teachers Service Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said.
The financial statement for the year 2012 submitted at the Annual General Meeting of the EDCS on October 29, had revealed that the fraudulent transaction had taken place in the EDCS in 2012. I doubt whether we would be able to present the financial statements for the coming years due to lack of financial reports,” Jayasinghe added. However, we have decided to take legal action against the interim committee for the misuse of society funds.
He added that the interim committee has fraudulently spent the money on purchasing land, illegal recruitment, opening district offices and other activities.
