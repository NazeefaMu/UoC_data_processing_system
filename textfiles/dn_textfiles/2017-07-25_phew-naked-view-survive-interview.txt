Phew! Naked view to survive an interview!

The difficulty with job interviews is that so much advice is published on how to survive them - if you’re the interviewee that is. Even seasoned interviewees occasionally get butterflies. Being nervous weighs you down, makes the interview seem interminable and makes you look uptight. More importantly, it prevents you from being who you are.
Although being nervous is not something you can easily control, you can learn to mask it. I was offered some tips in this regard from a job-hopping uncle who actually created a record of sorts in the pursuit of professions. Uncle Roger, later known as ‘Dodger,’ secured more than 30 jobs in an astoundingly successful and chequered career. As a rolling stone he adroitly leapfrogged all opposing contenders with the panache of an athlete of Olympian magnitude.
mental image
I was a callow youth at the time when Roger advised me that I could clip the wings of the butterflies and reinforce my sense of superiority with a little imagination. The advice he advocated was simple yet bizarre. He insisted that I should picture my interviewers without clothes. Uncle Roger conveying a peculiarly deadpan expression propounded his theory thus: “All it takes is a little imagination, my boy. You simply have to conjure a mental image of the persons holding your future in their hands in their birthday suits. I emphasize nude, as starkers under their clothes, do you understand?”
I nodded in reluctant agreement while he went on to clarify the importance of visualizing the big-shot inquisitors in their natural state: “And if you feel the interview is going nowhere, or the employers are rude or trying to be patronizing just give them hell. Kick them up their … well you-know-where … and get the hell out of there. It’s the image, dear boy, or rather the satisfaction of stripping them of that image of all-powerful control in your mind that counts most. And when I say projecting them in the raw, I mean the ultra form of unconcealed raw that has come to be commonly accepted as ‘buck naked.’ Get it?” he barked.
I nodded again in acquiescence. After all he had been the undisputed champion of all roving job-seekers and a darn successful one at that. And in similarity to Julius Caesar’s immortal ‘Veni, Vidi, Vici’ (I came, I saw, I conquered) Roger’s line with a slight amendment should have read: “I came. I worked. I vanished”.
corpulent bullies
Having tried to practice the maestro’s technique, I must say quite honestly, that I am not quite sure this advice actually works to your advantage all the time. What I mean is it works sometimes, such as when I was alone in the ring with a quartet of grossly corpulent bullies with slack jaws and even slacker blancmanging bellies and bottoms. They were all confrontational and offensive. I had already decided I was not going to work for this gang of goons at any cost.
Roger’s theory was rather simple really. All you had to do was permit your vision to do a complete unabbreviated full undress-rehearsal on all high-flying interrogators.
The only problem I had at that interview was not being able to stifle my mirth and laughing out loud at my own perceptive vision of the shapeless slobs in the buff while pointing my finger at their pathetic flaccid endowments. After all, it was my rascal Uncle Roger’s technique, of viewing the world of corporate frivolity unclothed in all its undisguised threadbare magnificence or rather threadbare insignificance.
But it is a whole different kettle of fish when you face a panel comprising solely women. I was a successful managing editor then and I imagined I had developed a persona of calm, focused authority. That was until I attended an interview at a top-selling women’s publication in Hong Kong for a job as a humour columnist. I strode briskly into the board room to find I was alone in the ring with a quartet of sophisticated and vivacious career women.
itchy forefinger
The enchanting interviewers all stood up and shook my hand. I restrained my itchy forefinger from its accustomed palm tickling fixation. One of them, a buxom beauty thrusting a dainty hand said: “Hello, I’m Talula”, and went on to introduce her colleagues. Talula resembled a delectable gelatine dessert. She even moved like a delicious jelly with a grace and expressiveness that was accentuated by her ample curves. My mind waxed poetic as she sashayed back to her chair. “Talula does the hula. Alleluia!” I thought to myself. She outshone them all this exotic jolly jelly, with the equally exciting exotic name.
I eased myself into a chair opposite. The entire bevy resembled huntresses having spotted their prey. I tried to calm my nerves by thinking of them as naked prey, but only for a moment. I knew I was on pretty precarious ground, treading on decidedly feminine preserves. I tried to expunge any thoughts of Uncle Roger’s undraping techniques from my mind’s eye. In this case I was doing so with extreme difficulty.
They asked about how I would rise to a challenge. Only a quarter of my thoughts had actually been on the conversation.
I came out of my sensuous reverie and said: “I beg your pardon?” One of them smiled benignly and repeated: “How would you rise to a challenge with a suicidal deadline?” I answered honestly: “In more ways than one. Mainly by an upsurge of inspiration. And that’s the naked truth.”
They had the grace to blush and cross their pretty legs as if in choreographed accord. That gave me the chance to retract my own relaxed, outstretched posture and cross my extremities as well.
They seemed perceptive as well, the entire shebang of this corporate covey and appeared to be reading my mind. They looked at one another smiling slyly. This was Talula’s cue. She grinned mischievously and said: “Just one more question. It may sound unconventional but besides your column you will also have to undertake some speaking assignments on our behalf.
The question is to test your presence of mind. Do you mind?”
“Okay shoot!” I fired back. Blushing slightly Talula posed the million dollar-a-year question: “What part of your body would you hide if you were on the street completely naked?”
I hesitated for a split second before returning fire in a blaze of inspiration: “My face, obviously, so no one would know it’s me!” The beautiful bevy clapped their dainty hands in approval.
