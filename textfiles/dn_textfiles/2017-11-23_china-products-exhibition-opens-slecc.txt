China Products Exhibition opens at SLECC

The China Products Exhibition was inaugurated by chief guest Sonali Wijeratne (Director General of Commerce, Department of Commerce, Sri Lanka) along with guest of honour Yang Sau Yuan (Economic Counsellor of China from the Embassy of China) at SLECC today. The exhibition will run till November 24.
Sonali Wijeratne mentioned that the China Products Exhibition this year is a marked indication of long-term trade and economic relations between the two nations. “This event has become the biggest platform in Sri Lanka for Sri Lankan and Chinese entrepreneurs to interact with each other creating many opportunities for economic development in future.”
She also mentioned that this event will be a major contributor to accomplish the goal of developing Sri Lanka’s export arm.
Sri Lanka’s regional and international connectivity, its strength as a regional trade and logistics hub, and its preferential access to large markets makes it a strong choice for setting up new businesses and operations.
This successful exhibition is held for the third time in Sri Lanka, bringing quality Chinese exhibitors from 80+ companies across China to Colombo with a range of cutting-edge, innovative and contemporary products providing an excellent opportunity for Sri Lankan businesses to interact with world-class suppliers.
