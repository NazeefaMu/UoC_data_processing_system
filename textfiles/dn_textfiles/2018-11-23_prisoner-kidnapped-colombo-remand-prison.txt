Prisoner kidnapped from Colombo Remand Prison

A remand prisoner was kidnapped from the Colombo Remand Prison earlier this week, prison officials said.
Although investigations are underway, police have not been able to arrest the suspect or those who kidnapped him from the Colombo Remand Prison, officials said. The prisoner was an inmate of the Kegalle Prison and was brought to the Colombo Remand Prison to be produced before the Kalutara Provincial High Court regarding a heroin case. While he was at the Colombo Remand Prison, two persons posing as Remand officials from the Kalutara Prison met the officials and took him to Kalutara.
Colombo Remand Prison officials later discovered that the two men were not prison officers of the Kalutara Remand Prison. The prisoner who was a suspect in a massive drug trafficking case, had attempted to escape prom the Kalutara Prison last year, offering a bribe to a prison officer, a prison officer of the Kalutara Prison said.
