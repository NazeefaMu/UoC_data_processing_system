Indian board says will hold mini IPL overseas

Mumbai, Friday: India's cricket board is planning a miniature overseas version of the Indian Premier League in September with all the eight teams set to participate, it announced Friday.
The decision to hold a shorter version of the cash-rich league overseas was taken in a IPL governing council meeting chaired by Rajeev Shukla and later ratified by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
The BCCI has been on the lookout for an IPL-like tournament during the September window since scrapping the Champions League T20 last year.
“In the month of September BCCI is willing to host a mini IPL or IPL overseas with all the eight teams participating in a shorter format,” BCCI president Anurag Thakur said after the end of a four-day conclave in the northern hill town of Dharamsala. He said the smaller tournament would last about two weeks.Terming it “mini IPL” or “IPL overseas”, Thakur said the finer details of the tournament were being worked out before a final schedule was announced.
