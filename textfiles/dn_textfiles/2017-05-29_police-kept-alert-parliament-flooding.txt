Police kept alert on Parliament flooding

Parliament Police were kept alert on the water level of the Diyawanna lake and the Navy has been placing sand bags at the entrance to Parliament and adjoining areas, a Parliament Police officer said. He said a disaster management committee of 20 officers headed by IP Balasuriya was appointed to handle any emergency situation.
The water level of Diyawanna did not rise over the past two days as the rains had temporarily ceased. They are on alert as rains are expected today and tomorrow, he said.
Parliament went under water in 1992 and 2010.
