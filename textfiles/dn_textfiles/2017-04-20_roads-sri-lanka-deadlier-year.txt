Roads in Sri Lanka deadlier by the year

Statistics reveal 3,003 road deaths last year - A road death every three hours:
Statistics compiled by the Police reveal that our roads are becoming deadlier by the year. Last year road deaths reached a startling total of 3,003, when compared to 2,816 deaths in the previous year. The year 2014 reported a death toll of 2,440. During the last decade or so there has been a tremendous increase in mobility and motorisation in the country. This scenario has also brought about a rapid influx of unsafe modes of travel on to our roads along with heavy pedestrian movements. Consequently we pay the price for our steadily increasing mobility, for not everyone who sets out on these daily trips return home again or safely.
For every person who dies, several thousands are injured and some with permanent injuries for life. The socio economic cost to the nation according to sources from the Moratuwa University is approximately in the range of Rs.25 billion. It is therefore imperative that the State gives a very high priority for safer roads by introducing a comprehensive traffic & transport policy to reduce the risks of road accidents drastically, or else we will be moving towards a fearful future on our highways and byways with road congestion also costing the country a whopping Rs. 30 to 35 billion.
The invention of the motor car initially referred to by many in the 1890’s as a ‘Horseless Carriage’ changed the pattern of road travel dramatically. The dangers faced by road travellers in the years gone by were from external sources like attacks by predatory beasts or bandits en-route on a journey. The road user had to be constantly vigilant scanning the surrounding trees and hills and be prepared or anticipate attacks from beasts or bandits who could attack or way lay them en-route. This situation has radically and dramatically changed with the modern means of road travel. Today the greatest danger to life and limb of a road user is posed or created by the road users themselves or by the road features itself. Today the mortal danger on roads is by motor vehicles rushing at speed in opposite and in the same direction to get to their destination and in the melee we find pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists desperately moving their way through with varying success and sometimes with tragic consequences. Compared to road deaths in the pre 1970’s, the risk of road deaths on our roads has presently trebled. There is a dire need for road authorities and the State to bring about an overall improvement to the network of roads with added safety features and minimising conflicts among users, and this to be backed-up with greater road discipline and tougher law enforcement.
Since lack of safety features on our road network is to a greater extent attributed to a man-made engineering outcome, then there is nothing intrinsically inevitable about it. The road authorities, planners and engineers need to redesign and re-structure the road system to reduce the probability of risks in accidents drastically by eliminating or minimising some of the existing conflicts on roads. Can we reach this beautiful vision, at what costs and will it succeed? Perhaps we should move away from a traditional road safety approach and adopt more dynamic innovative policies and strategies with state intervention to target 50 percent lesser fatalities and 40 percent fewer hospital admissions.
It is imperative at least at this late stage for the state and relevant road authorities to step in and introduce a much safer road traffic system by implementing a new policy vision for a systematic reduction of road hazards and conflicts on our roads.
To a great extent these fearful consequences also could be attributed to the phenomenal increase in the number and variety of motor vehicles of each and every description moving on our roads. The existing road scenario has made our road network to be congested and unsafe. This is the inevitable result of rapid urbanisation, enhanced vehicle ownership for business and personal travel with increased incomes and opportunities, shift from safer modes of travel perhaps more due to inadequacies in public transport and the availability of a variety of speedier modes of travel have all complicated and compounded to the hazardous road scene.
Another foremost underlying factor is the awful lack of road discipline and respect for road rules and consideration for others.
This to a considerable extent could be attributed to the absence of a systematic law enforcement policy at national and regional level backed by high-tech traffic management solutions. Effective law enforcement strategies had been made ineffective in recent years to an extent with the available man power of the traffic police being fully utilised to regulate traffic at intersections and at critical locations in areas to meet peak hour conflicts and demands. This has hindered and hampered the primary duty of law enforcement and the prosecution of offenders. More dynamic enforcement strategies should be the order of the day with the police engaging unmarked police vehicles and plain clothes police observers at critical locations to apprehend errant drivers. Such measurers should be backed by Hi-Tech Enforcement solutions and linked to deterrent penalties.
Class of road users killed Motor cyclists - most vulnerable:
Riders of motor cycles and pillion riders comprise the largest segment killed in road deaths. Similar trends are observed in the Asian Pacific region as well. Last year motor cyclists accounted for 1,157 deaths, which is approximately 38 percent of road deaths in the country. This trend of motor cyclists remaining at high altitude in fatalities had been the norm in the last decade or so for obvious reasons. Firstly, the motor cycle category forms the largest fleet of registered vehicles in the country (3,699,630). Their growing popularity is probably due to its affordability, glamour and elegance of the machine. Motor cyclists will continue to be vulnerable since the machine provides no body protection in a collision and is often exposed to serious body or head injury in a crash. Another inherent danger is that motor cyclists are generally not conspicuous both by day and night to other users of the road. Use of headlights or wearing reflective jackets by day could enhance their safety to an extent.
Motor cyclists are faced with other inherent dangers such as wearing sub-standard crash helmets, not wearing them securely and using helmets which are beyond the usage period. Inadequacies in training and testing standards for their competency are also factors to reckon with. Their turning and overtaking manoeuvres are most unpredictable, incomprehensible and unconventional, thus placing other users at great risk. It is timely that leading insurers, dealers of motor cycles and companies employing staff riding motor cycles conduct re-training classes as a corporate responsibility.
The next vulnerable category of road users are pedestrians with 877 deaths. In 2015 the death toll was 803 and the year before 728 were victims of road fatalities. Since the 1950’s to 2005 pedestrians remained the most vulnerable category in road fatalities. Whilst pedestrian road behaviour remains very much the same, the rapid usage of motorcycles and mopeds in the last decade has lowered them in the risk category.
Three wheelers form the next dangerous category causing 405 deaths. A year before, their involvement in road deaths remained at 378 in 328 fatalities and in the year 2014 they accounted for 274 deaths. Since this category now form a large segment of motorised vehicle fleet (1,115987). A greater emphasis to curb their road behaviour should receive top priority by those responsible for enforcement and regulating them. Their road behaviour is most incomprehensible. Authorities should introduce and enforce rigid regulations to curb their ‘happy go lucky’ and risky driving manoeuvres which endangers all road users besides those travelling in them. Safety aspects of three wheelers should also receive the attention of the authorities, a specific colour code for three wheelers should also be looked at. Similar laws prevailing in New Delhi on trishaws including a ban on hailing for trishaws should be enforced in Colombo and in other capital cities. Picking passengers should be confined to trishaw stands only or to a pick up destination of the passenger. A proper dress code to drivers of trishaws is also considered most appropriate and timely to upgrade their status.
In the Western province you are more at risk
The Western Province leads in road deaths with 804 deaths and could be classified as the most vulnerable province for road travel. This is inevitable since this region has the highest population being the hub of commercial activity, as well as having the largest vehicle fleet of every description circulating on a daily basis. Furthermore, most of the A Class road traverse through this region take a heavy load of commuter and commercial traffic. The Nugegoda Police Division recorded the highest number killed with 146 deaths, Gampaha Division recorded 139 and Kelaniya Division 137 deaths.
North Western Province which covers the Police Divisions of Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya, Nikaweratiya, Puttalam and Chilaw altogether recorded 488 road deaths. This region has a large fleet of commercial vehicles, motor cycles and three wheelers compared to other regions. Besides, most through traffic to other provinces traverse through the roads in this province, hence this could be a contributory factor. Roads in this region needs special focus of the police and the road authorities by way of enhanced enforcement measures and a more comprehensive road engineering improvements and modifications to enhance safety.
The Southern Province recorded 421 deaths while most of them were reported on the A 2 Road. This province also has a sizeable number of motor cycles, three wheelers and commercial vehicles which has a bearing on high fatality rate in the region. There is a greater need for law enforcement strategies to be directed on this A 2 road with traffic to and from Kataragama, Yala and resort areas forming a heavy volume of traffic.
Weekends, drive with care
Last decade or so signifies a high rate of fatalities during weekends. These fatalities had occurred on our main trunk roads which carries mixed traffic. The increasing trend on weekends perhaps due to increased travel demand for special events or festivals, leisure travel to holiday destinations and rapid urbanization promoting business opportunities. Fridays has recorded the highest death toll with 448 killed, Saturday the next highest with 425 killed and Sundays reporting the 3rd highest with 420 killed. The death rate on other days of the week reveals no significant difference to weekends.
Factors that could be commonly attributed to such fatalities are excessive speeding, overtaking in haste, driver fatigue, driving under the influence of alcohol, blatant disregard for the rights of other road users, over estimating one’s skills/abilities and scant respect for road rules. To minimise fatalities need more and more targeted enforcement strategies by the police on stretches deemed as vulnerable, road widening and reducing speed limits.
This enormous threat to life and limb on our roads needs to be given a very high priority in the Political agenda of the government as well as successive governments. All socially concerned professionals of all disciplines must take cognizance of the deteriorating state of safety and security on our roads which has reached epic proportions. The issue also needs to become part of the civil rights discourse in the country and together galvanize the government in to action. Our vision in road safety should be that no longer we would want to handover a road traffic system which is extremely hazardous and risky to our next generation.
For this we need to move away from traditional methods of dealing with road safety and adopt innovative measures in road engineering to minimise existing road dangers and conflicts. There is an absolute need to promote a better driving culture among road users. For this a more dynamic approach to law enforcement in a uniform manner island-wide is absolutely vital, backed by Hi-tech enforcement strategies structured with deterrent penalties irrespective of who breaks the law.
