SC notices Lanka E News Editor

 
The Supreme Court noticed Lanka E News Editor Sandaruwan Sandheera to appear before Court on March 3, a short while ago.
Deputy Mayor of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council Madura Vithanage filed fourteen Contempt of Court actions in the Supreme Court against Senadheera.
Vithanage complained that there had been a series of articles published on 'Lankaenews' and on its social media, defaming judges and castigating their character.
The complainant stated that the content of the said articles had "insulted, defamed, and ridiculed" judges whose names are referred to therein, and were a direct and indirect intimidation on judges as well as the judiciary as a whole.
