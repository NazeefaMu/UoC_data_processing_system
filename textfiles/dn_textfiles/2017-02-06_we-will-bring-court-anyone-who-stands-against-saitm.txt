We will bring to Court anyone who stands against SAITM

SAITM Parents Union Secretary Anura Wanigasekera categorically stated yesterday, that they would bring to Court anyone trying to stop the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe from carrying out a medical faculty and awarding of medical degrees.
“The Court has held that the institute is empowered to award medical degrees (MBBS) and there was no obstacle to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC),” he said.
“We will take legal action against any person or groups that dare to stand in the way of the judgement of the Court,” he said.
SAITM had yet to register at the SLMC. Meanwhile the office bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association have maintained that they are studying the 42 page judgement given by the Court of Appeal as concerns the SAITM issue.
Wanigasekera said, “the SLMC could see to the registration of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) and there could be no obstacle for it to do the same with SAITM.”
