Price reversed lottery tickets back on sale

The price reversed lottery tickets will be back in the market from today, the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) Chairman Romesh Jayawardane said.
There was speculation that the tickets issued by both the National Lotteries Board (NLB) and the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) be increased by Rs.10.
The decision was met with resistance by the all Ceylon Lottery Dealers Association (ACLDA).
The decision was later reverted by a Presidential order.
The Rs.20 lottery ticket will now be back in the market and the DLB is planning to get the lottery sale back to normal within the next month, Chairman Jayawardane said.
Asked on the loss incurred by the DLB due to the decision to change the lottery ticket price,
ACLDA President Krishantha Marambe said, they are now working with the DLB to bring the lottery sale back to normal.
Marabe requested the lottery dealers island wide to lengthen the time period that their lottery sales points are open.
He further said, their target is to make lottery sales one of the main contributor to the Inland Revenue.
ACLDA President Marabe also said the DLB has agreed to pay special attention to the welfare of the lottery dealers islandwide.
