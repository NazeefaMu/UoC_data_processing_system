Prized click

To coincide with the world photography day The State Festival of Photography 2018 and the award ceremony was staged for the third consecutive year at the Nelum Pokuna on August 19 with the distinguished participation of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The festival was held from August 19 to 21 at the Nelum Pokuna.
The President Sirisena in his message has said the art of photography could make a significant impact on the society that cannot be achieved even through protests or demonstrations.
Cultural Affairs Director Anusha Gokula Fernando who has spearheaded the endeavour of staging an award ceremony to recognize Sri Lankan photographers made the welcome address. She said the objective of this exercise is to introduce local photo artistes to the international arena and thereby heighten the level of this expressive art.
She said this time around the judging panel had to shortlist from 3537 submissions to select the cream of photographers to be felicitated.
State Advisory Council of Photography Chairman, senior photographer Berty Gunasekera said this year’s theme of the festival has been, ‘Ecological impact of human activities’.
“We could categorize photographers into two divisions. One is reporting any incident as we see and the second is a creation that expresses its qualitative value using the photographical language”, he said.
A gamut of versatile and amateur photographers was felicitated and their works were recognized at the event.
Photo academy to be set up
Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs, Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha speaking at the occasion assured a photo academy will be commissioned soon to train budding photographers the true essence of the art.
“In 1685 Johann Zahn introduced a portable camera for the first time. Ever since then the art of photography has evolved and it eventually shed light on cinematography. Celluloid technology of the cinema industry was then taken over by digital technology. However the origin of all these is, still-photography”, said the minister.
“A motionless photograph could express an idea that could shed light on transformation of society. I wish the courage and strength for all our photographers to develop their professional skills to great levels, at this occasion”, he said.
The State Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Mohan Lal Grero too graced the occasion.
Lifetime felicitation award to a veteran
In recognition of his unmatchable service to the art of photography and to the nation the Lifetime felicitation award was bestowed on Henry Rajakaruna at the event. The award was presented by the President Maithripala Sirisena.
Henry Rajakaruna has learned photography as a child from the veteran Wilson Hegoda.
He has won his first international award when schooling. Ever since then Rajakaruna has represented many international events to win an array of awards and accolades to bring glory to his motherland. This legendary photographer now at the age of 77 still engages in photography.
