PARLIAMENT

Recording COPE telephone calls breached MPs’ privilege: Kiriella
“Telephone calls of the parliamentarians in the COPE committee that investigated the bond issue have been recorded by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and it was a breach of MPs’ privilege, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said in Parliament.
Raising a privilege issue Minister Kiriella requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon a party leaders’ meeting to discuss the issue and get all the other parties responsible including parliamentarians whose names were mentioned, inquire into the issue and take steps as he deemed appropriate.
The Speaker said he would summon a meeting.
Moving the motion, Minister Kiriella said a forensic report prepared by the CID was placed before the Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond Issue on November 16. The report includes details of telephone calls of 28 members. He said that according to the report, five members had received calls from Arjun Aloysius.
“If Arjun Aloysius had contacted the five to make changes to the COPE report in favour of him, he had failed,” Minister Kiriella said. “The COPE made a unanimous recommendation signed by the five members too that action must be taken against all wrongdoers,” the Minister said.
The Minister pointed out that it must be remembered that the Commission’s mandate is to investigate and report. “It is not a Court of Law and no one was found guilty of any offence. There is no finding against these MPs,” Minister Kiriella said.
“This brings us to the question who instructed to record telephone calls, especially of these parliamentarians and for what purpose. This is clearly a breach of privilege of the MPs,” Minister Kiriella said.
He said communications between parliamentarians and constituents are privileged and there were instances where administrative action was taken to preserve the rights of the constituents communicating with MPs. “The telephone was identified as one of the means that constituents communicate with MPs,” the Minister said.
“In these circumstances, considering that the Commission has not come to any conclusion, it is highly improper that this information have been published,” Minister Kiriella said. “Therefore, it is our view that before the CID or even the Attorney General’s Department seek information about telephone calls of MPs, they must obtain the Speaker’s permission. Neither of these department have done this,” the Minister said.
He said that notwithstanding this, confidential information was put out for public consumption. He added that the media is now in a frenzy giving all sorts of twists and interpretations to this information.
“I call upon you to holds a party leader’s meeting to discuss this matter,” Minister Kiriella said.
Joint Opposition Member Gamini Lokuge queried whether the investigations were held against the former Finance Minister who publicly accepted that he took money and that his wife received flats from Aloysius.
Joint Opposition Member Udaya Gammanpila said Minister Kiriella misled the House. He said several members of the COPE had put footnotes in the report in favour of Arjun Aloysius.
UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana suggested that the details of all the members and the President be taken for investigation.
New Acts soon in Parliament to protect domestic businesses: Malik
The Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures Act, and the Safeguard Measures Act will be presented to Parliament soon to protect the domestic business from unfair competition while improving the investment climate for domestic and foreign investors, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up for debate.
The Minister said the bills were ready and they could be presented, debated and passed in December this year or January next year.
Commencing the speech, Minister Samarawickrama thanked Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera for introducing an outward oriented economy.
“Sri Lanka have benefited from an open economy from the time of the kings. We feel sorry at times when we deviate from that policy,” the Minister said.
“It was reversed during 1970 to 1977 and during the previous regime. But the government has focused to make the economy more open and make it an attractive place for more business. When I heard the new economic reforms and opening up of the economy, I was excited and encouraged to become an entrepreneur. Same kind of spirit would be kindled in the youth having heard the directions of the proposals in the budget 2018,” the Minister said.
He said the government has shifted its focus from a growth model heavily dependent on the public infrastructure spending to the growth driven by private enterprises, exports and foreign direct investments. The number of jobs created by the government infrastructure projects is insufficient because the debt burden is very high. We need the private sector including small, micro and medium enterprises to drive this economy. We must create the best possible environment for them to thrive. Our domestic market is too small. We have to trade with the world, export and welcome the world to our shores.
“Our ministry has taken many steps to strengthen this aspect through a series of initiatives and programmes focusing on exports, Foreign Direct Investments, trade agreements and bilateral economic corporations,” Minister Samarawickrama said.
“The New trade policy was approved by the Cabinet in July 2017 to stimulate growth and create jobs by improving ability of firms to export and compete for domestic market through a modern simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. The NTP we launched addresses for key elements: competitiveness through domestic policy reforms, market access and trade facilitation, macro-economic balance policy and institutional coherence, and helping the adjustment of enterprises and workers,” he said.
The Minister said the most significant trade policy that they were undertaking was negotiating bilateral partnership agreements.
“The FTA with India is deepened and it is broaden to include services investment technology and training. We have to recognise that India is expected to be the fastest growing economy in the world in the coming years with a middle class consumer base that will be 10 to 15 times of our domestic market.
“Six rounds of negotiation on the Economic and Technology Corporation Agreement (ETCA) were completed and the seventh will be held in December.
Our main objective of the ETCA with India is to resolve the implementation issues of the existing FTA,” the Minister said.
“Sri Lanka is negotiating the removal of quotas of goods such as garments, pepper and vanaspathi. An important new measure is to establish a mechanism to redress all grievances and problems that Sri Lankan exporters face,” he said.
He said the China-Sri Lanka FTA will generate nearly USD 700 million in trade. The apparel sector loan is set to gain USD 400 million in the new trade. “We are nearing the FTA with Singapore. It will be signed in January. We focus on encouraging Singaporeans to invest in Sri Lanka,” the Minister said.
“The GSP+ was restored and it opened a market for 6,000 items. Sri Lanka ratifies the WTO trade facilitation agreement early this year. Its main component is effective national coordination,” Minister Samarawickrama said.
“The National Trade Facilitation Committee was set up to implement the Sri Lanka’s TFA commitments. A single electronic window is established to facilitate trade and it will operate in the Customs Department shortly. All these measures will improve the investment climate for domestic and local investors,” the Minister said.
“A One Stop Shop mechanism is set up to address the regulatory inefficiencies and inter-agency coordination.
The BOI has revised its targets in its new corporate plan for 2017 to 2020. A single window investment appraisal committee was established to facilitate granting approvals within the shortest possible time,” the Minister said.
“The Logistic and Industrial Zone in Hambantota initially would attract an investment of USD 1.12 billion and another USD 500 million during next few years. Several industrial zones will be developed in Mawathagama, Bingiriya and Weligama. The New Inland Revenue Act provides a predictability on the incentives for new investment. With the technical assistant of the World Bank, we developed a road map for climate reforms for investments. It will be launched July this year,” the Minister said.
Prisoners under PTA
Sampanthan asks for special meeting
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday requested the Justice Minister to schedule a special meeting with all the relevant officials to discuss the matter of prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The Opposition Leader made the request in Parliament yesterday participating in the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up for debate.
“I discussed the matter several times with the President and the Prime Minister and found that their positions quite reasonable. We now have a new Justice Minister. We are looking forward to resolve the matter reasonably with her. The former minister did not take adequate actions. I earnestly request the new minister to convey a meeting with the Attorney General, Law and Order Ministry Officials and other relevant persons to discuss this matter. We will try to work out some arrangement,” Sampanthan said while bringing the attention of the House to a number of demonstrations taking place in the North in the past few months over the prisoners detained under the PTA.
He said these Tamil prisoners committed crimes for “political reasons”, not for personal benefit. “Political decisions were made in the past to pardon and release prisoners who committed political crimes in 1971, 1987-89 and so on. Why cannot you do the same here?” he questioned the Government.
He said the Government itself concedes that detaining prisoners under the PTA as an ‘obnoxious’ law. “The PTA is very different from the normal law. The manner of arrest, investigations, extracting confessions, prosecutions are entirely on confessions and the nature of the evidence are all different,” he said.
“The President pardoned the person who attempted to assassinate him because the accused was politically motivated. He was granted pardon, then why others who had committed less serious crimes cannot be pardoned?” he asked.
“I know persons who are attempting to create communal tensions by raising such issues to prevent the right thing being done. The Government should not drag its feet from doing what is right,” he said.
AG’s Dept. will have more judges, officers: Thalatha
Measures were taken to recruit more judges and officers to the Attorney General’s Department and we will increase the number of courts as well, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The Minister was participating in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 as the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up in Parliament yesterday for debate.
Minister Athukorale said a committee was appointed regarding the changes to the Civil Procedure Code and Cabinet approval for it was expected. “The salary increment for the AG’s Department officials is required because an increment was not effected for them over the past 10 years. Now we have received approval from the President and the Prime Minister in this regard and we expect to implement the proposals by January 2018,” she said.
Responding to an issue raised by JVP MP Wijitha Herath that appointing of High Court judges was not completed, Athukorale said the country has 75 High Court Judges. “The normal procedure is to appoint 74 but only 73 were appointed and another will be appointed shortly,” she said.
“The matters with regard to the Supreme Court and the Appeals Court are carried out in accordance with the Constitution,” she said.
The Justice Minister said varied opinions were expressed on delays of court cases. “The AG’s Department is doing a great deal of work. When the opposition levels allegations against the AG’s Department, they forget that the AG’s Department was under the former President earlier. Now our government has taken measures to recruit more officers,” the Minister said.
“Some are alleging that the AG was brought to Sirikotha. On October 7, a paper was submitted proposing that three courts be established to hear corruption cases.
The opposition should stop slinging mud at us saying that the AG was brought to Sirikotha. Now the AG’s Department is functioning independently,” Minister Athukorale said.
Hakeem promises relief for Uma Oya affected
Three projects were initiated to provide water for the people affected by the Uma Oya Development Project, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
Responding to a query posed by MP Chaminda Wijesiri during the round of questions for oral answers in Parliament yesterday, Hakeem said his ministry intended to fulfil the water requirement of 110,000 people.
He said 110,000 people from 55 Grama Niladhari divisions affected by the Uma Oya Project would receive water from the Dayabara Ella Project and three projects were being implemented at a cost of Rs. 352 million.
“It can provide 1,350 water supply connections. The Hali Ella Project is very productive and every project has specific aims. We will implement a separate project in the Demodara area as well,” Hakeem said. The Minister said 750 water supply connections would be provided through the Makulu Ella Project and the Weheragalatenna Project could provide 300.
Also the Kurundugolla Project was initiated for the purpose, he said.
JVP urges to take up Bonds scam first in new courts
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday called on the Government to take up the Treasury Bonds case first in the newly established special court to fast track the hearing of large scale corruption and fraud cases.
The MP was speaking at the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry were taken up for debate.
The MP commended the move to set up three special Trial-at-bars to hear fraud and corruption cases and challenged the Government to take up the Bonds scam first and set an example of good governance.
“The Government needs not wait for the report of the Presidential Commission inquiring the Bonds issue, the special COPE report was sufficient to initiate legal action against those involved,” he said. The MP said it would take another three years if the Government took the normal procedure to punish the culprits of the Bonds scam and then, the justice would not be met.
Rs. 10,000 allowance for former MPs
A Rs. 10,000 allowance was added to former Parliamentarians’ pensions from October, a Senior Parliament Official told the Daily News yesterday.
He said it costs the government an additional Rs. 26.2 million monthly to provide the allowance to 262 former MPs and about 220 widows of deceased MPs.
Parliamentarians are entitled to the pension after they completed five-year term in Parliament. The official said former MPs were entitled to have a pension of one third of their basic salary. “The minimum pension for a former MP who completed five years’ in Parliament is Rs. 18,095 and it would be Rs. 36,190 for a former MP who completed 15 years,” he said.
He said Rs. 10,000 allowance was given as per a Cabinet decision. “Several former MPs had presented their grievances to the Speaker that their pension was too little. The Speaker had communicated their request to the Government and the Cabinet decided to grant them an allowance,” he explained.
“MPs’ salary usually increases in par with the High Court judges’.” This time, the increment was not given. Therefore, former MPs’ pension did not change,” he said.
Objections to Gammanpila’s statement
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale, Development Strategies and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe and MP Nalin Bandara opposed Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Gammanpila when he was blaming the AG in Parliament yesterday during the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry were taken up for debate.
According to Gammanpila, yesterday destroyed the respect of the AG’s post.
“Media reports indicated that when the Prime Minister went before the Bond Commission yesterday, he was questioned by the AG. According to paragraph 12(1) of the Constitution, everyone is equal before the law. Then, why was the Prime Minister given special privileges? The person who cross-examined the PM at the Bond Commission inquiry, was a person who received special treatment by the Prime Minister,” he said.
Minister Thalatha Athukorale responded that the AG had taken on the questioning of the Prime Minister on a written request made by the Bond Commission.
Gammanpila said Additional Solicitor General Dappula Livera cross-examined so far. “He is known to expose even the most hardened liars. “Rogues and crooks are afraid of him,” he said.
He pointed out that today there is no proper mechanism to appoint even judges, not to mention the AG.
Gammanpila said the crime rate has risen because people have lost faith in the judiciary.
“The AG post is very important as it holds the authority of the executive and the judiciary. This post is second only to the post of the Chief Justice.
‘COPE says no fraud in Treasury bonds issuance’
Development Strategies and International Trade Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe in Parliament yesterday argued that the COPE in nowhere in its report stated that there had been a fraud in the Treasury bonds issuance.
In a heated exchange of words with Joint Opposition MP D. V. Chanaka over the phone calls of COPE members with Perpetual Treasuries former Director Arjun Aloysius, the Deputy Minister said Aloysius has had 800 calls to MP Namal Rajapaksa.
The Deputy Minister made this comment when MP Chanaka accused Senasinghe of having 62 calls to Aloysius while being at the COPE meetings. “Aloysius was not charged yet. Then what prohibits us from contacting him for clarification? The COPE cannot charge any private party. It does not have such a mandate. Its purview is limited to probe public servants. The COPE cannot punish anybody,” Senasinghe said. MP Chanaka said Senasinghe was trying to cover up Aloysius because of the Deputy Minister’s close association with Aloysius.
