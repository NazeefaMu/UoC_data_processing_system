Uphill road to becoming an actuary

An aptitude for math and statistics and a bent for problem solving is what it takes to become an actuary, says Milanthi Sarukkali, Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, USA.
That's putting it mildly, for there's just some half-a-dozen actuaries who hold fellowships in Sri Lanka, the discipline being that exacting. In fact, the world over, actuaries, although much in demand, are a limited number.
"It takes six or seven years on average to become an actuary. There are about 15 exams and modules to pass to obtain a fellowship," says Sarukkali, explaining why so few opt to become actuaries. "All you need is a background in math, but it takes a lot of time and effort to make the grade." She also said that although not a prerequisite, most students embark on actuarial studies after a first degree.
So, who is an actuary? An actuary is a risk manager who quantifies the risk in financial transactions, risk being any situation where there a possibility of loss or gain, a situation of uncertainty. An actuary also proposes measures to mitigate risk or specifies how much a firm would be compensated for taking on the risk.
Traditionally, actuaries worked in the insurance business, Sarukkali says, hastening to add emphatically that they are not insurance professionals. Now actuaries are branching out into non-traditional sectors such as banking and finance. They can however, work in any field, as for example, in manufacturing, for every business involves risk, which needs to be assessed.
At an insurance firm, an actuary would look at risk from the macro level, whereas an underwriter would look at the risk involved for every individual policy.
Functions of an actuary
In assessing risk, apart from using quantitative techniques, an actuary would also look at external factors such as the political climate, the business environment, marketing, the regulatory environment and so on. In the case of health insurance, for instance, the health of the population, preventive measures such as vaccination and the state of the healthcare system would be considered.
Actuaries also design and price insurance products by considering what losses should be compensated for and the return required by the insurance firm for taking on that risk. Similarly, actuaries also design and price other financial products such as annuities and loans.
Every insurance firm has a requirement from the regulator to have its liability to policyholders assessed by an actuary who quantifies the amount the firm would have to pay out in claims and incur in expenses in the future on account of the policies it has underwritten. The actuary advises the firm on how much funds it needs to set aside to meet claims and, additionally, how much capital it needs to maintain in an extraordinary situation such as a number of unexpected claims occurring together.
For a bank, an actuary would, for example, advise on how to make provision for credit losses. The International Financial Regulations Standards (IFRS) 9 will come into effect on January 1, 2018, setting out the new rules of accounting that banks must adhere to in order to make provision for credit losses. IFRS 17 which will come into effect in 2021 will completely change the way insurance companies report liability and recognize revenue and profits.
What does it take?
"It takes a combination of quantitative techniques, business knowledge and soft skills to be an actuary," says Sarukkali, who now heads her own firm, Spark Actuarial and Risk Consultants in Colombo. Unassuming herself, it was nevertheless patently clear that the discipline was for a chosen few, on account of its rigour - the road to a fellowship being an uphill and arduous one.
Armed with a BSc in Physical Science from the University of Colombo and an MSc in Industrial Mathematics from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, she enrolled for a PhD in Mathematics with a concentration in actuarial science (her research was in this field) at the University of Connecticut, USA. By this time, she had taken six of the exams of the Society of Actuaries, USA.
She continued her actuarial exams and modules while studying for her PhD and working at ING Financial Services in Connecticut, the better part of which time she "had no life", as she ruefully admits. Modules are taken online and are business cases which mirror problems in the real world. "An actuary has to be creative, because there is no set answer to a problem," Sarukkali says, adding that completing eight modules could take up to two years. To complete a module, a final report has to be submitted where financial, technical and other business factors have been taken into account.
Just before receiving an associateship or a fellowship, an actuary has to participate in a mandatory one-day seminar by the Society of Actuaries on the code of conduct that it expects its members to follow. Apart from the US Society of Actuaries, the UK has its Institute of Actuaries, while closer home is the Institute of Actuaries, India, which follows the UK syllabus.
Returning home
Returning to Sri Lanka in 2015, she worked for sometime at Allianz Insurance Lanka as its Chief Actuary/Chief Risk Officer. Preferring to venture out on her own, she took on several consultancy projects, which when they proved too much to handle on her own, made her set up Spark.
Sarukkali has a staff of seven in Colombo who are studying for their associateships, while three others holding fellowships work from overseas. Most of her clients are based in the USA. One objective in embarking on Spark was to expand the profession in Sri Lanka by providing her staff with the opportunity of global exposure. She works in insurance, banking and finance, enough exposure for her young protégés to perhaps opt to remain in the island.
"The salary scales in Sri Lanka are not even close to those abroad," Sarukkali says. "An entry-level position in USA commands more than a senior position here."
Nevertheless, the sky's the limit for opportunity, if not remuneration and perks, as regulators become more stringent on minimum holding requirements to prevent a debacle such as the world experienced in 2008.
