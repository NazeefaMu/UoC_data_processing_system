Clarification

Army Brigadier (Director Media) Roshan Seneviratne responding to a news item on Page 5 in January 3 Daily News issue captioned ‘16 army personnel suspended for inappropriate behaviour' stated that the said news item is inaccurate.
In his letter to the editor dated January 3 2017, he says no army personnel, including the ‘officer in charge of Horowpathana Army Camp (sic) were suspended from service for inappropriate behaviour after the said incident during a musical show.
He, however, said that all army personnel of the said camp were transferred and new troops from the same regiment were posted within a few hours and therefore, the news item is factually inaccurate.
