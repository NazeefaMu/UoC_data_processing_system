4rever’s refreshing endeavour!

Beauty care brand 4rever came forward this season with a CSR programme that benefited thousands of pilgrims who ascend Sri Padaya. The objective of this project is to allow pilgrims to refresh themselves on their way to the summit of the sacred shrine. In that regard, 30 shower cubicles have been installed; 15 for men and 15 for women with the patronage of 4rever.
This bathing facility at Seethagangula served to add to the Sri Pada experience as, since time immemorial, people have stopped to refresh themselves at the said location during their ascent. The cubicles offer pilgrims safe and clean water for the purpose of bathing and changing facilities that are built to provide and protect privacy.
The water is drawn from an unpolluted source, upstream of Seethagangula. The bathing booth was installed accordingly to spare pilgrims of the hassle of having to go in search of clean water outlets that is not polluted with plastic or broken glass scattered everywhere. The booths facilitate a safe shower in every conceivable sense for the old and young pilgrims alike. It also minimized the impact on the natural beauty of the immediate vicinity by regularly cleaning the area under the constant monitoring of local authorities. The programme was conducted during the total duration of the pilgrimage season, which spreaded for six months, Uduvap Poya to Vesak poya.
The bathing facility provides free 4rever Hibiscus -Conditioning & Lunuwila-Anti-dandruff- shampoo samples to all pilgrims. The environs closer to the bathing booth were also fully illuminated at night for the benefit & safety of the pilgrims.
Commenting on the project, 4rever Skin Naturals founder & chairperson, Chandani Bandara said,“As a company that is close to nature and is benefitting from it, I think of conserving the same as a part of our duty and responsibility. We consider it a blessing and a privilege to be able to be of service in some way, the little way we can, to the thousands of pilgrims ascending Sri Padaya.”
