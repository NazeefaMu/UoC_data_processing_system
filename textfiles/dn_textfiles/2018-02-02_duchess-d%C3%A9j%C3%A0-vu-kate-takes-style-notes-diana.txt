Duchess déjà vu !  Kate takes style notes from Diana

Kate dons a custom Catherine Walker houndstooth coat that looks VERY similar to one Diana wore at Sandringham - hours after she wore the princess’ earrings to dinner
The Duchess of Cambridge made a serious style statement when she stepped out a houndstooth coat for her second day of engagements in Stockholm.
The red-and-white coat, custom-made by royal favourite Catherine Walker, is another bold choice for Kate, 36, who has so-far eschewed her typically safer styles in favour of standout looks for the high-profile Scandinavian tour.
It is also a subtle nod to William’s mother, Princess Diana, who wore a strikingly similar look to Sandringham nearly three decades ago.
The coat marks the second time in less than 24 hours that Kate has paid tribute to her late mother-in-law with her outfit. Last night she arrived for a black tie dinner wearing a pearl bracelet and a pair of pearl earrings that belonged to the princess.
Diana turned heads in her houndstooth jacket by luxury fashion house Moschino as she joined senior royals for Princess Eugenie’s Christening in December 1990.
She layered her jacket over a high-neck black blouse and paired it with a black and white skirt in the same houndstooth pattern. The ensemble was finished with low black and red pumps and a red wide-brimmed hat trimmed with a black satin ribbon.
One style expert notes that why the looks are very alike, Princess Diana’s styling of the print is more daring than the Duchess’, who teamed her coat with a quilted maroon bag and fringed leather pumps from Italian label Tod’s.
Hannah Eichler, Senior Brand Stylist at Oasis, explained: ‘From polkadots to red coats and floaty pastel gowns, Kate Middleton’s wardrobe choices have long drawn inspiration from Princess Diana.
‘Her latest outing in Norway has proved The Duchess Of Cambridge’s looks continue to be synced with her late mother in law in the sartorial department.
‘Choosing a punchy red houndstooth coat which she teamed with matchy matchy burgundy accessories, it appears The Duchess isn’t the only one who was a fan of the iconic print – Princess Diana sported a similar look back in 1990.
‘Whilst Princess Diana might have opted for more fashion forward styling by mixing colours instead of going tonal like Kate, it certainly proves that real style never goes out of fashion. From 1990 to 2018, houndstooth prints are a fashion mainstay.’
Two days ago Kate donned a pair of Princess Diana’s pearl earrings as she joined Prince William and Swedish royals for a dinner at the home of the British Ambassador in Stockholm.
The simplicity of her jewels perfectly her £1,945 saffron yellow gown. To show off the pearls, which Diana wore to a Paris state banquet in 1988, Kate wore her brunette tied back in a low chignon. She also wore a slender pearl bracelet beloved of Diana.
On the second day of their high-profile visit to Sweden, William and Kate, who is six months pregnant with the couple’s third child, were given a riotous reception at Matteusskolan school.
While dozens of pupils waved hand-drawn flags and bunches of flowers, one lucky youngster managed to get a high-five from the Duchess as she greeted the crowds.
Outside the couple spent about ten minutes shaking hands with the schoolchildren, with William repeatedly telling them ‘you’ve got cold hands’ and complimenting them on the flags they were waving.
