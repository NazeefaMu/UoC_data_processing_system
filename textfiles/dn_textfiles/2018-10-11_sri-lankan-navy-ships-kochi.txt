Sri Lankan Navy ships in Kochi

Two Sri Lankan Navy ships, SLNS Sagara and Suranimala, commanded by Captain N.M.J.D. Nissanka and Captain M.H.C.J. Silva are visiting Kochi, India.
The Commanding Officers called on India’s Rear Admiral R.J. Nadkarni, Chief of Staff of the Southern Naval Command, and discussed issues of cooperation between the two Navies, especially those pertaining to training. They also interacted with other flag officers in station.
During the visit, the Sri Lankan Navy personnel visited Indian Navy training facilities such as the Navigation and Direction School, Anti-Submarine Warfare School, Signal School, Water Survival Training Facility, Damage Control Training Facility, INS Dronacharya, and the School of Naval Oceanography and Meteorology. A friendly football match was also conducted between both personnel.
“India’s bilateral relations with Sri Lanka are rooted in historical, social and cultural ties and extensive people-to-people contact. In the past two decades, with regular exchanges of visits as well as increased trade and investment, India’s relations with Sri Lanka have evolved into a comprehensive partnership.
“Being immediate maritime neighbours, the two nations and navies also share a common vision in promoting maritime cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region, as is evident through the SLN’s regular participation in the MILAN series of biennial meets and Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS).
“The scope of training cooperation between the two navies is extensive. Last month also witnessed the latest edition of SLINEX (Sri Lanka India Naval exercise) – a bilateral exercise involving ships of both navies,” said an Indian Navy press release.
The Sri Lankan ships will depart for Colombo on October 11.
