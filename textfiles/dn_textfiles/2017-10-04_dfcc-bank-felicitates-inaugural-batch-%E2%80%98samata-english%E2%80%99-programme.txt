DFCC Bank felicitates inaugural batch from the ‘Samata English’ programme

Pursuing its commitment to uplifting the standards of education in the country, DFCC Bank counts education as a key pillar in its corporate social responsibility initiatives.
In fact, DFCC Bank has actively supported education over the years through various initiatives. In keeping with this, the Bank conducted an English Education programme, 'Samata English' as a pilot project in the Gampaha and Kalutara areas, targeting youth between the ages of 16-22, earlier this year.
The main objective of the “Samata English” project was to teach Spoken English and equip youth with the basic English knowledge required to enter into the workforce. DFCC Bank tied up with Winner International, an institution specialising in teaching spoken English to youth for this purpose. Considering the satisfactory outcome of the project, the Bank now plans to extend it to other areas across the country in the near future.
A Graduation ceremony was held recently to recognise the achievers of this programme at the DFCC Bank Auditorium, which was well attended by students, parents, senior management and staff volunteers.
Commenting on the inaugural 'Samata English' programme, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said, “DFCC has continually strived to empower the youth of the country, through building skills, capacity and general knowledge. Realising that the gap in spoken English skills were hindering job prospects for youth, we embarked on this educational project under our 'Know and Grow' initiative to impart spoken English skills to youth so as to enhance their employability and to fulfil their professional aspirations.”
The Spoken English course was carried out at DFCC's Gampaha and Kalutara branches from April to August 2017, witnessing the participation of approximately 45 youth. The students sat for an initial assessment prior to starting the course and a final assessment upon completion. The impact of the project was evident as 70% students who sat for the final assessment after benefitting from the Spoken English course scored over 60 marks.
DFCC Bank adopts a holistic approach to its CSR activities in line with the Bank's brand values, strengths and processes where the main pillars include Education, Entrepreneurship, Environment and Emergency Relief. The Bank continuously strives to create sustainable value for all stakeholders and provide its valued customers with a comprehensive range of innovative financial solutions. DFCC Bank has received a rating of AA- from Fitch Ratings Lanka.
