Turkey’s 2016 coup, a warning to all democracies - Ambassador

What happened in Turkey should be a warning to all democracies in the world Turkey’s Ambassador Tunca Özçuhadar said referring to the coup attempt that Turkey witnessed on July 15 2016.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Turkish Embassy in Colombo, the Ambassador said it was a modern example of the Trojan Horse scenario.
He noted that the only difference between what happened in Ancient Troy and modern turkey was that the attackers were not foreign; they were brainwashed citizens of Turkey.
“Even though they managed to sneak into the Turkish system, the brave people of Turkey fought back and thwarted the attempt. It was the citizens who defended the democracy with their bare hands against the guns and canons. It showed how important is the secularism for a democratic country. Turkey has definitely maintained its secular system”, he said.
When asked whether any other country was involved in the coup attempt, the Ambassador said the leader of the terrorist organization lives in USA since 1999 and despite several requests from the Turkish government to the US government to expedite that person, up to now there is no development.
“Several bureaucrats and military personnel who were part of the coup attempt escaped abroad, mainly to the European countries and most of them had received refugee status. And that create all sorts of questions in our minds”, he said.
