Drug dealers’ progenies sent to Children’s Home

Three children belonging to a woman who was imprisoned for a drug-related offence were handed over to Ruhunu Children’s Home at Kithulampitiya, Galle, on the Galle Additional Magistrate’s order.
The eldest of the three children is a five-year-old girl, while the other two are boys of ages three and two.
The father of the children is a drug addict and dealer as well. Hence, the children were under the care of a person who claimed to be a relative of children. The individual, who is a resident of Mahamodara, Galle, had brought the children to his place, to which the villagers objected and informed the Police.
Galle Police initiated investigations, took the children into custody and submitted a report before Galle Additional Magistrate Court.
