Parents opt to keep children away from school

Parents in the Tissamaharama area urge the authorities to close schools for two weeks, following the spread of the influenza virus.
The parents of the children attending Yatalatissa Primary School in Tissamaharama have requested its principal to close down classes from Grade 1 to Grade 4 for two weeks. The principal has not heeded their request. The parents say they will not send their children to the school in the upcoming weeks.
Debarawawa Base Hospital Chief Medical Officer Prabhath Liyanwarachi stated that 18 patients had received treatment for influenza at the hospital, and several children suspected to have the virus are receiving treatment in the children’s ward.
“We provide the necessary medication to all patients and take steps to transfer influenza patients to the Hambantota General Hospital for further treatment. We need the help of the general public to control the the disease,” he said.
