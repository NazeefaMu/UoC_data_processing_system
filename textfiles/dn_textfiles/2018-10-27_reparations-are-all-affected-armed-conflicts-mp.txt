Reparations are for all affected in armed conflicts - MP

UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said the Office for Reparations Bill was presented seeking compensation for all survivors and victims of the kin in several armed uprisings in the country and not for the ex-LTTE combatants or any other particular political group.
Addressing a media briefing held at the UNP headquarters Sirikotha yesterday, Rahman said the Office for Reparations can provide a strong message of care to conflict affected populations living in all parts of the country due to the several conflicts that have taken place during the country’s post-independent history.These include the recent anti-Muslim riots and the two JVP insurrections that took place in 1971 and again in 1988-89 in which much violence was perpetrated on innocent people.
"We have had a long history of conflict not only in the north, but also in the south. People had disappeared during the conflict and it is also necessary to find out what happened to them and give reparations to the affected people, he said.
He said the law is clear and reparations are not given on the basis of the victims’ ethnic or religious background, or belonging to any particular political group. Several persons including those of the joint opposition are attempting to create a public opinion that the government is all out to appease the LTTE. It is not true.We have to focus on the human perspective and not so much on the political viewpoint. All Sri Lankans are equal under the law and this Act clearly stipulates that reparations could be awarded to the “aggrieved persons” who are victims of during the 30 year long war and 1971,1988/89 periods as well.
“The LLRC proposed that justice be meted out to those who were affected by the war during the former regime. But, it was not implemented. "The disappearances not only in the North but also in the South have been reported. Reparations have to be made, Steps should be taken to provide relief to the victimized parties,"he added.
The Bill provides for the provision of individual and collective reparations for aggrieved persons who have suffered violations of human rights or humanitarian law.
We have enough experience on how the Rajapaksa government made reparations to former LTTE leaders. One of the former LTTE leaders Karuna Amman who was master mind behind Sri Dalada Maligawa bomb blast and Aranthalawa Bhikku massacre appointed as a Cabinet Minister as well as Vice President of SLFP during the former rergime.
Our main aim is to establish four pillars of transitional justice including truth, reconciliation, and accountability for past abuses arising from the war and Office of missing persons has already been set up as part of this target,” he added.
We never opposed when former President took measures to release over 12,000 ex-LTTE combatants for the rehabilitation.They must reintegrate into civil society to address the reconciliation. That is why former President J.R.Jayawardene released those who were in jail during the 1971 insurgency and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga released those detained during the1988/1989 insurgency.
DIG’s conversation elicited information
UNP MP Mujibur Rahman said yesterday an investigation will reveal the real facts based on the conversation between TID DIG Nalaka Silva and informant Namal Kumara shortly.
DIG Nalaka Silva cannot speak like a DIG to obtain real facts from the informant.If he speaks with him as a DIG in his official capacity, he may not receive the information that he wants.
If someone wants information from an informer, he or she has to act according to needs of the informer.
However, real information will be reveled in the future through the investigations, he said.
