There are no abductions under good governance: Ganesan

Under the present good governance there are no abductions, no disappearances, no murders and we are enjoying the benefits of bringing this regime in to power, said National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan.
He said so after distributing materials to the families of missing persons in the Batticaloa District during the mobile service conducted at Onthachchimadam Sri Vinayagar Maha Vidyalaya in the Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattu Secretarial Division, organized by Institute for National Languages Education and Training, on Sunday (3).
He further said, “If any politicians say that there is no war, I will not agree. We are finding solutions to problems; this is the fact. We are gifting books to the children of missing persons, and we are doing this because we are concerned about them. We are also trying to solve the language barriers in obtaining copies and translations of documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificates and death certificates.”
“The Batticaloa District has suffered from the war. Even though the war is no more, the reason for the war are still unsolved. We have a duty to find the whereabouts of the missing persons. In the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, these persons were unaccounted for. Now we bear the burden for these acts. People with various religions and ethnic groups live in Sri Lanka and we are all children belonging to our Mother Lanka,” he added.
Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattu Divisional Secretary Sivapriya Vilvaretnam presided. Batticaloa District TNA Parliamentarians G. Sirinesan, S. Viyalendran and officials from the Ministry were also present.
