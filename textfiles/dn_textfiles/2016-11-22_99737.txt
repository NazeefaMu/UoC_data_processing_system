OTSC 60 Years Family Night with Gypsies

I was very fortunate to join the Old Thomians’ Swimming Club (OTSC), family show so meticulously put together by a team of experts led by Tusita de Alwis and Rasika, who displayed their consistency of reaching excellence in their field of organizing family entertainment events.
We had the Gypsies in attendance led by the genius Sunil Perera and his brother
Piyal, who need no introduction, when it comes music with an international flavour.
The show started at 7.45 pm, on Sunday the 13th of November at the BMICH Banquet Hall in a tastefully decorated setting with Blue Black and Blue written all over it.
Distinguished guests graced the show, Old Trinitians and Royalists who form the TRT with the Thomians were just one family enjoying a unique night, termed the entertainment as one of its kind. 450 guests were in attendance with Ronnie Lietch a premier entertainer hosting the show, adding so much class and glamour.
Gypsies played all their hit songs of yester year; they emulated western artists to near perfection whilst guests were invited for a scrumptious meal during the first break at 9.30 pm.
What a show, the song, laughter, and most importantly the comrade between the Thomians and their guests recorded volumes of a fantastic evening.
It was great to see two of our Past Presidents namely Sarath Colonne and Sunil Peiris better known as "GDS" at the family night, whilst our present President Dulip Soysa kept the Thomian flag, on a very high pedestal.
OTSC hosts good entertainment all year round. The Club house is a home away from home. 10 years back we celebrated our 50th anniversary, at the same venue in the main hall, but this year it was very special.
The price of a ticket was well worth the entertainment and the comrade. For me personally it was a special night. I was asked to lead in the singing of the College Song.
I had the pleasure of meeting school mates, old friends and my favourite Commander Captain Gaf Fernando, a senior Captain of Air Lanka, and Singapore Airlines, a distinguished Old Thomian, a man of few words and also Old Royalist Snr DIG STF Chief M.R Latiff who were there till 1.30am until the show was over, who stated Tusita and his team did us proud.
