Root’s England roar  back in Ashes thriller

ADELAIDE: Skipper Joe Root led a spirited English fightback to frustrate Australia and raise hopes of a miracle victory in the gripping second Ashes Test in Adelaide on Tuesday.
After three days of Australian dominance Root took up the challenge of a record run chase with a fighting unbeaten half-century as the momentum began to shift towards England, roared on by their bellowing Barmy Army supporters.
In contrast counterpart Steve Smith, who attracted criticism for not enforcing the follow-on despite a 215-run first innings lead in the day/night match, burned two reviews in the space of three balls and put down a tough catch.
At the close of an absorbing fourth day, England were 176 for four with Root unconquered on 67 and nightwatchman Chris Woakes not out five -- 178 runs from victory with six wickets in hand heading into Wednesday's final day.
The highest winning fourth innings at the Adelaide Oval is 315 for six by Australia against England in 1902.
Root had a leg before wicket decision on 32 off Nathan Lyon overturned on review, with the 'Hawk-Eye' tracker plotting that the ball would have gone over the stumps.
Australia lost their second and last review when Dawid Malan survived a lbw shout on three off Josh Hazlewood, with the ball again tracked as going over the stumps, in the 43rd over.
Adding to Smith's anxiety, he also dropped Malan on eight in a sharp one-handed attempted catch at slip off Lyon.
After the chaos of the previous night's session when Australia lost four wickets, England had a much better time under the floodlights.
They only lost the wickets of James Vince and Malan and otherwise scored freely.
Vince was beaten by a pitched-up Mitchell Starc delivery, getting a big nick to Peter Handscomb at slip for 15. Malan put on 78 with Root before he was bowled by Pat Cummins for 29.
