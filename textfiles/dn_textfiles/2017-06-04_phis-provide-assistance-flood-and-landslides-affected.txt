PHIs to provide assistance to the flood and landslides affected

 
President of the Sri Lanka Public Health Inspectors’ (PHI ) Association Upul Rohana said that additional 100 PHI s have been deployed to provide assistance to the flood and landslides affected by now.
Accordingly, the extra PHI s will provide technical knowhow on how to clean the polluted wells and houses and they will look into the needs of supplying sanitary facilities to the camps where flood victims are temporarily housed at present.
Upul Rohana further said that the PHIs s have found that the food provided to certain camps where the flood affected were housed was not fit for human consumption and such cases would lead to spreading illnesses among the people.
