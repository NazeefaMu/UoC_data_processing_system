Need to create competition for special players

Greetings islanders and traditional fans who have stayed loyal to their original clubs and colours... it’s a stretch to expect a new generation of loyalty...as much has changed from those intense, emotional partisan days.
Longden Place the CR cauldron, Havelock Park the Havies walled fortress, Police Park, the blue shirts and the best running surface in town, Army have moved home a few times along Galle Face, and now have their own stadium in Diyagama...Air Force settling for their new manicured pitch at Ratmalana - 80 mins between choppers and aircraft traffic is tougher than you think ...check with Kandy if you harbour doubts. The Navy extends another gladiator arena in Welisera ...inside the naval base and pressure for all visitors.
Finally the CH, my old club and perhaps the most challenging prospect with the cricket square slap bang in the middle ...and need to adapt fairly sharpies...and then of course, Kandy's Nittawela arena of pain, that test mind body, skill and courage, every time we travel up through the rock passage at Kadugannawa.
The season is still young and much has happened to re-examine form, match fitness and strategy for the biggest stables in Sri.....Navy getting past CR, closing them down and strong in the loose plus solid in the set scrums too. A result that has opened the eyes of all the other teams...and given Navy a reputation as a powerful unit. Their big boiler house forwards, really stamping their mark on the day. Good to see a pack dominate play and 15s rugby is all about the pack ...vital for us all in the backs ...is good clean ball to run. Starve the opposition of possession and you cut their oxygen supply.
Games can be decided only on ball protection and running metres....tackle power power, the critical inbuilt terminator effect, the difference between very solid teams and those aspiring to be contenders.
Strong teams will generally be able to weather the worst and still bounce back, the team might need some prep; to adjust...essentially play badly, but still pocket the “W”...plus coaching of course .Kandy’s loss to Air Force was a great reminder of not being presumptuous and expecting players to put their hands up and do the job anyway. The Kandy management are demanding consistency ...let’s see how it translates.
Last week for the Dialog league, pretty much all games, ran to form ...Air Force beat Police, Havelocks outlasted CR, under lights and just limped home 10/6 ...to keep their tournament hopes open.
Navy......ran 50 points past the CH at Welisera and may well get better and stronger as the season turns for the 2nd round.
Player management and professional services seem to be a crying need for the business of playing rugby ...particularly with the national rep players on recovery from surgery etc... the Union need to contract the top flyers and create a system of performance contracts for those elite players, perhaps a two tier contract based on tours and national games?
We need to create competition for those special players who earn their national caps - there must be value to being chosen for your flag and subsequently a system with legal contracts to protect players’ welfare through their time at the top.
Young talent just showing their wings and colours at school level, can safely aspire and push for those tough tour slots ...selections will attract the absolute best for the jersey...and give the national selectors, plenty of choice for those slots, that traditionally cause volumes of discussion prior to the final squad list.
All my playing days ...which extend a few weeks short of 13 seasons for the national jersey, were never in total agreement with those national selectors ...who seemed more like gremlins with big sickles and grim hoods ..?
Selections were always bloody affairs ...knowing your contender and fighting for your slot. Longden Place was that designated venue of pain ...and only years later, did I manage to change that as the chairman of selectors, insisting that my team went down to the grounds and actually interacted with the national squads, shared ideas and generally put all players at ease and encouraged pride and belief for our flag.
The Dialog league is the real tester for endurance, strength, courage and team spirit ...it does tax the mind and body to its max and has a wonderful ability to create weekends of total performance and joy ....!
Defending champions Kandy and coach Sean will be hoping to wipe the Air Force blimp off the Kandy radar ...a step up beating a fit Army side by 34 points, and plenty to do in the weeks ahead.
Air Force on the other side have shocked their fans and handed Police another shock last Friday ...exceptional for the team morale and fabulous for that group of young contenders.
Expectations are enormously high for the remaining first round matches, and I am delighted that many experts and pundits have been shocked and confused with the results so far ...the game needs spice and surprises, it needs a few jolts and impact tackles to wake the media and disbelievers up ....and the Dialog league 1st round has certainly done just that.
Enjoy the weekend clashes as the warriors confront each other in the middle......
Will Kandy’s loss be the only one or will Havelocks craft another famous victory when they clash.
Mouth watering prospects for islanders to absorb and savour.
Cheers fans and followers of this wonderful code from 1 to 93.
