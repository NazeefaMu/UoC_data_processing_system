This will be followed by individual country presentations sighting investment opportunities available within the region with the participation of investment authorities from the South Asian countries.
While the forum aims at opening avenues to boost regional trade, the SAARC Trade Fair to be held from September 7-9 following the investment forum, will feature over 150 exhibition booths including a corporate pavilion, small and medium enterprises (SME) pavilion and business to business meeting space creating an ‘ideal’ platform for regional business cooperation and facilitating trade and business integration.
