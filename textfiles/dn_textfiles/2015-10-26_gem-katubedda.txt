University of Moratuwa
A gem in Katubedda

September 13, 1955 was a red letter day for the country’s higher education. It was also a memorable day for people living in an around Molpe and Katubedde in the Moratuwa electorate. During this period, the Prime Minister of then Ceylon was Sir John Kothalawala who laid the foundation stone for a Technical College at Katubedda, Moratuwa.
The Canadian government donated two projects to the Ceylon government in the early 50s. They were a hospital and a technical college. S. de S. Jayasinghe was the Member of Parliament for Dehiwala - Mt. Lavinia. He was also a minister of the Kothalawala Cabinet.
As there was a technical college at Dehiwala, Jayasinghe requested the Prime Minister that he be given the hospital project.
On the 13th day of 1955 afternoon Sir John arrived to the present Katubedda Campus premises to lay the foundation stone. He laid the foundation stone with the participation of a large gathering.
In 1959, the donor of this project Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and the Prime Minister of Ceylon S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike were scheduled to open the Technical College. However, instead of Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Education Minister W. Dhanayake participated.
In 1957, it was named as the Institute of Practical Technology. Those who could not enter the university in engineering were allowed to follow a four year Diploma Certificate Course.
In 1972, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike on a request by Moratuwa MP and Lanka Sama Samaja Party stalwart and later General Secretary Wimalasiri de Mel, elevated it to a university.
The engineering degree commenced and the JTO course was made NDT. During the last five and a half decades, the University of Moratuwa has produced men of calibre who are scattered all over the world.
