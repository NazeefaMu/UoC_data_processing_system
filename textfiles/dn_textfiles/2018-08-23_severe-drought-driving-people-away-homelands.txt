Severe drought driving people away from homelands

The scarcity of drinking water in several drought-affected villages in the Anuradhapura District is increasing.
Famer families in Mahanikawewa, Oyamaduwa, Siyambalewa, Eliya Oyamaduwa, Maningamuwa, Dahaye Kanuwa, Meda Oyamaduwa etc. in the Maha Wilachchiya DS division are severely hit by the drought. People are reported to be deserting their villages due to the dearth of drinking water.
Maha Wilachchiya Divisional Secretary E. R. Thilakarathana told the Daily News that many residents in his division are migrating to outstations, mainly Colombo and its suburbs seeking employment, as a result of the severe drought.
He said nearly 5,000 drought-stricken families in his division are provided with drinking water through bowsers.
Wilachchiya Gamunu community-based society Chairman M. Wimalaweera said there are nearly 115 families living in the Meda Oyamaduwa village since 1985. Their main income is chena cultivation.
“We are facing a severe drought for about three years consecutively. We don’t have any water to drink. Almost all of our cultivation is damaged. We have not received drought-relief for about two months. There is a large number of kidney patients living in our area. We have no alternative than to sell our milch cows and property where we live for our sustenance,” he said.
It is learnt that nearly 25,000 families in Maha Wilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Kahatagasdigiliya, Thirappane and Nuwaragam Palatha (Central) are suffering from an acute scarcity of drinking water. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that arrangements are made to provide drinking water to them using a fleet of bowsers under the patronage of the Disaster Management Ministry.
