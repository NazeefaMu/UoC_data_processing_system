Ex-Sports Minister unmasks Ranatunga’s hypocrisy

Former Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara took the bull by the horns for the first time like no one has done before to slam former Sri Lanka captain and present Minister Arjuna Ranatunga for his hypocrisy.
Jayasekera said that nobody had run down the country’s cricket than the former World Cup winning captain himself and alleged that he has more evidence to suggest he (Ranatunga) had connections with bookies.
Jayasekera referred to Ranatunga as fitting the age-old Sinhala proverb that says “a prawn with excreta in his brain goes looking for the same bog substance in the head of another prawn”.
He made these remarks at a heavily attended press conference held at the Nippon Hotel in Colombo yesterday.
Jayasekera said Ranatunga who is now accusing ex-Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala of connections with gambling was hand in glove with him in the past.
“I got to know Thilanga Sumathipala only a couple of years ago but Arjuna (Ranatunga) and Thilanga (Sumathipala) were friends from the 1980s. They were good family friends and had night parties at Thilanga’s restaurants during the late 80s,” said Jayasekera.
“They were friends from their school days and Arjuna is the one who helped to bring Thilanga as a vice president to Sri Lanka Cricket for the first time and later he became president and Arjuna was the captain. Was he (Ranatunga) that ignorant not to realise Thilanga’s connection to the betting industry at that time,” asked Jayasekera.
“Arjuna accuses me of eating (destroying) cricket. It was the Ranatunga brothers and family that ate cricket. When Sri Lanka entered the World Cup final in 2011 against India, he (Ranatunga) held a press conference in India and declared that Sri Lanka will not win the final. He (Ranatunga) wants the Sri Lanka team to be in the dumps all the time so he could always be the only World Cup winning captain in the country,” added Jayasekera.
The former Sports Minister further said that when Sumathipala held office at SLC, Ranatunga’s younger brother Prasanna Ranatunga was vice president and Nishantha Ranatunga was an Executive Committee member while elder brother Dhammika Ranatunga was Chief Executive Office.
“The Ranatunga family was all around Thilanga. He now accuses Thilanga of having connections with bookies. It is not about the country but its personal grudges,” said Jayasekera.
“They (Sumathipala) and the Ranatunga family fell out when Thilanga the then SLC president removed Dhammika Ranatunga from the post of CEO and they also fought over the sale of television rights issues. This was the reason why the two parties fell out,” said Jayasekera.
He said that when Ranatunga was captain he had an insurance company called P and A Insurance which handled players’ insurance matters which was a huge conflict of interest.
