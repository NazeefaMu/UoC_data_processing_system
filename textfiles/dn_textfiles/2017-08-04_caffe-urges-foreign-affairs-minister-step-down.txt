CaFFE urges Foreign Affairs Minister to step down

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake should immediately step down, Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said if the government sacrifices democratic reforms made in the past years and protects a minister, it is sacrificing the people's democratic rights.
"The government cannot go for elections because of the `Bond issue' and postponement of due elections. The people did not ask the government to postpone elections," Tennakoon said.
The government should hold elections. Electoral reforms should be made after elections, he said.
"During the previous regime, amid suppression, the people stepped into streets and protested against passing the 18th Amendment in Parliament. But, now, people are silent on postponing elections," Tennakoon said.
