The SLFP, then and now

The Joint Opposition, which is an offshoot of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, is going to great lengths to explain to the public that the reasons for their exit from the blues was due to the party deviating from the policies of the SLFP. The latest Joint Opposition member to add his voice to this chorus is JO firebrand and Ratnapura district MP Ranjith Zoysa. He was quoted by an English daily, saying that the Joint Opposition members have decided to boycott the SLFP Anniversary Convention, scheduled to be held at Campbell Park on September 02. The MP further went onto say that the SLFP had ditched the policies of its founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, adding that, selling national assets was not the policy of the SLFP. Hence their decision to distance themselves from the party.
Other members of the JO are not so much concerned about any policy drift of the SLFP. All they want is for the blues to part ways with the UNP, with whom it is presently in a coalition. These members want the formation of an SLFP government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, not so much the sale of national assets. This latter group representing the JO, no doubt, has come to terms with reality. They know that the open economy which entails free enterprise and public private partnership is today a fait accompli, not least because the SLFP had been following the same system since 1994.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, no doubt, seized on the reality and took the revolutionary step of breaking with the inward thinking, isolationist the policies of the SLFP of the past, to make it attuned to the new order of things. True, during her election campaign, CBK promised to give the open economy a ‘human face’, which gained acceptance with the old guard, who, well knew, that the socialist economy would be a hard sell to the masses, a vast majority of whom still retained bitter memories of queues, shortages, rationing etc. and other hardships the regressive polices placed on them in the 70-77 era.
However, CBK warmed to her task with the zeal of a true convert, even outdoing the UNP in embracing the market economy, warts and all, with all that was vile and obnoxious to the country over which people like Mahinda Rajapaksa staged pada yatras and jana goshas, only to himself embrace the system with equal panache once installed in office as President. The extent of CBK’s shift could be gauged from the fact that she even invited the Shell Company, to which her mother showed the door, when she was Prime Minister in the early sixties, having to contend with only the feeble protests among those of the old guard in the PA coalition, particularly members of the LSSP and CP. The changes effected were of such a magnitude that it prompted Dullas Alahapperuma, an SLFP MP heavily inclined to the Left, to remark in parliament that aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata haravanava (the government is signalling to the Left and turning Right).
It is understandable, though, the conundrum facing SLFP politicians such as Ranjith Zoysa, hailing from the rural outbacks, who are stuck with the populist slogans of the SLFP of the past. They have to appease their supporters with the appropriate rhetoric, nay, play to the gallery. Regrettably, some of the SLFP ministers in the Yahapalanaya government too has caught the disease and are making common cause with the JO, in questioning the ‘sale of national assets’ but kept mum when large chunks of real estate was sold outright in Hambantota, for Shangri La and Port City project, to name a few. These members, obviously, are playing footsie with the Rajapaksas while choosing to remain with the government.
President Sirisena should not hesitate to take to task Ministers and MPs within the government, in the SLFP camp, who talk and act differently on the policy decisions taken collectively. A young member, a deputy minister to boot, from the SLFP, recently, even in parliament, spoke in disparaging terms against the government. This certainly is not on. Perhaps, such members desire the TV mileage they get by such utterances, to keep them in the good books with their voters. In the meantime they could cause much damage to the unity government before they make an exit, as is being speculated.
Be that as it may, the government should make a more concerted effort to counter the anti-government propaganda that is now gathering steam, perhaps with an eye of the impending Local Government elections. It should also give more exposure to its development projects which are going largely unreported, mainly due to the more sensational news currently dominating the political scene. The other day, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera too raised issue with a state media channel over the work being carried out by the government in the rural areas being overlooked, with only ‘voice cuts’ of MPs being aired. This is an area the government should direct its attention to.
