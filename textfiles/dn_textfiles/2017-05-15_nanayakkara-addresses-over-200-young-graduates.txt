Nanayakkara addresses over 200 young graduates

An industry stalwart addressed over 200 young graduates on the future opportunities in the Travel & Tourism Industry at the recently concluded “Sancharaka Udawa” at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall.
Nilmin Nanayakkara, Managing Director, NKAR Travels & Tours (Pvt) Ltd made this presentation to well over 200 university students who have expressed their keenness to join the Travel and Tourism Industry.
The “Sacharaka Udawa” was held for the seventh year in succession and the Chief Organizer of the event was Dirk Grigson supported by a team of members from the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).
It was well evident that during the presentation made by Nanayakkara on the subject “Career Opportunities in the Hospitality Industry in Sri Lanka” the well over 200 young educated university graduates and students did not know the opportunities that existed in the travel industry.
“They truly understood the value of joining the Travel and Tourism Industry after this 45 minute presentation,” said Nanayakkara.
The presentation was based on 3 scenarios: starting from the Global trends and the positive movement to Asia Pacific and the continuous growth of SAARC, simultaneously showing Sri Lanka as having the fastest growth in the SAARC region.
Thereafter he went on to show the comparative strengths and growth of Tourism in Sri Lanka from 2010 to 2015, and with this the audience was highly taken up with the opportunities. From there he very creatively got into the audience to make them feel and showed them the high pedestal on which they could be in by joining the Travel and Tourism Industry. He further carved out the global opportunities for well experienced Tourism personnel in Sri Lanka.
From the applause he received and the response of the students it was very evident that “Sancharaka Udawa” and the presentation Nanayakkara made on “Career Opportunities in the Hospital Industry in Sri Lanka” certainly attracted lots of educated, dynamic university students and graduates and lured them into joining the Travel and Tourism Industry. This will certainly be well looked forward to by the local Destination Management Companies and all Hoteliers.
