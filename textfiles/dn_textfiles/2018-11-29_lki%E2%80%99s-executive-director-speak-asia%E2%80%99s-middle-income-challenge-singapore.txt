Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Executive Director at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), will speak at a public panel discussion entitled ‘The Great Decoupling: China, America and the Risk of a New Asian Economic Cold War’ at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.

The panel discussion organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, will be held on November 30, 2018, and is part of the ‘Asia in the World Economy’ round table. The round table convenes reputed academic experts and other policymakers from both Asia and the West to discuss the role of Asia in the global economy. This year’s theme is “Growth and Inclusion in Asia,” and is expected to cover a range of issues including the ongoing US-China trade war, and the future of global and Asian economic development.
LKI is a think tank that analyses Sri Lanka’s international relations and strategic interests, to provide insights and recommendations that advance justice, peace, prosperity, and sustainability. The Institute reflects the vision of the late Lakshman Kadirgamar by promoting the country’s intellectual profile in foreign policy research and engagement.
