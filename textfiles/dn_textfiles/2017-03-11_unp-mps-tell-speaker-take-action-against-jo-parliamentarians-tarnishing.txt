UNP MPs tell Speaker : Take action against JO Parliamentarians for tarnishing Parliament’s image

 Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna said the UNP Parliamentarians will request the Speaker to take tough action against the Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarians, who tarnish the image of Parliament and disregarding Parliamentary traditions. “No JO members can be allowed to play the fool in the House while disobeying Parliamentary traditions and insulting the dignity of the Speaker.
At this juncture, the UNP backbenchers have decided to request Speaker  Karu Jayasuriya to take action against such JO Parliamentarians who behave with disrespect in the august assembly,” he said.
Rajakaruna was addressing the media at Siri Kotha yesterday.
“As a result of the unruly behaviour of JO members in Parliament, the dignity of the House has been brought into disrepect,” he said.
Speaking on MP Dinesh Gunawardena’s behaviour in Parliament, he said that such bad behavior by one of the most senior Parliamentarians can never be accepted.
“It is fair if he raises his voice on an issue of national importance,other than just talking minor issues which should be solved through discussions with the UPFA General Secretary. Gunawardena, destroyed the dignity of the house while disobeying and challenging to the Speaker. Once a Parliamentarian is named by the Speaker, the particular MP leaves Parliament. That is the general practice,” he said. “The other main partner of these issues is MP Bandula Gunawardena. Rajakaruna claimed that Gunawardena makes statements aiming to mislead people. As an outcome of his falsehoods, he was advised by the Presidential Commission of Treasury Bond scam not to do so again,” Rajakaruna said.
“He is pretending as an economic expert while levelling baseless allegations against the government. But, it is questionable whether he is such an economic expert when considering his past statements such as Rs.2,500 is enough for a family per month,” he added. Speaking on the recent JO media conference at the Parliamentary car park, Rajakaruna said that only a party leader or a minister is offered a committee room. Apart from that, no committee room can be used on their own accord to their whims and fancies.Speaking on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s statement that there are shootings taking place throughtout
the country,Rajakaruna added that he is suffering from a disease, by which one cannot remember his past.
“Even if he cannot remember,anyone can remember the way journalists were treated and the gun culture reigned supreme during his tenure. The entire country was affected by state terrorism,” Rajakaruna added.
