STAX launches digital offering

STAX, the leading management consultancy in Sri Lanka, announced the launch of a new suite of digital solutions geared towards unleashing the full potential of Sri Lankan corporates.
Regardless of whether a start-up or a long-established business, the newly developed offering is aimed at delivering continuous value throughout the digital value chain.
The STAX offering comprises of a comprehensive suite of services aimed at addressing the core digital requirements of Sri Lankan businesses. Their proprietary Digitization Index is an entry-level solution aimed at assisting companies to identify their current digital positioning in relation to their competitors and global industry benchmarks.
This allows these businesses to understand where they currently stand on the digitization spectrum, and take corrective, or in some cases proactive, steps to ensure long term sustainability.
Stax also supports clients in developing end-to-end digital roadmaps which cover every aspect of an organization— from digitalizing customer interactions to optimizing internal operating processes. To ensure value realization, STAX offers implementation support across all its services, ensuring the effective operationalization of strategies.
Stax believes that to remain competitive in today’s world, radical digital reinvention is needed. Simply having an e-commerce platform or digitizing customer interactions is insufficient. Real digital reinvention requires rethinking the business itself.
“These circumstances create unprecedented challenges, but are also capable of yielding organization-defining success for those firms that can analyze trends and understand their meaning; taking agile decisions that will redefine their core value proposition,” Stax Managing Director, Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera said.
Geared towards providing Sri Lankan corporates with the tools necessary to evaluate, launch and grow their digital presence, the Stax approach to digital strategy allows for businesses to analyze key demographics, refine product offerings and accurately gauge consumer behaviour to generate unmatched returns on their digital investments.
“With the types of technological advancements that have been steadily entering the Sri Lankan market over the recent past, most corporates are keenly aware that now is the best time to be making investments into the digital space, and to explore opportunities for future growth.”
“There are already numerous examples of how the changing face of digital is driving economic growth and levelling the competitive playing field, enabling anyone from start-ups to established players to disrupt and compete head-to-head with market leaders through the deployment of a smart digital strategy. Therefore, Stax is confident of a major boom in digital investments over the short to medium term,” Dr. Gunasekera explained.
Founded in Boston almost 25 years ago, Stax has earned a reputation for delivering rich insight-driven consulting solutions that open-up incremental and transformative growth opportunities for clients.
Its clientele spans a diverse range from mid-sized corporates and family businesses to some of the world’s largest investment funds and Fortune 500 companies.
