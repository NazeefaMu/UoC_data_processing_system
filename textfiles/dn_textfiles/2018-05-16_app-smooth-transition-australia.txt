App for smooth transition in Australia

Australian firm Potensure launched the Potensure Mobile App at Mount Lavinia Hotel last week parallel to its Information Day.
Potensure Pty Ltd. is a registered company in Australia, co-founded by two Sri Lankan students, Anuja Fernando and Vishvajith Wijesinghe. The app connects international students with service providers in Australia for essential services like accommodation, airport pickup, part-time jobs, air tickets, banking services, etc. Fernando and Wijesinghe are graduates of Monash University. They established the company last year with the intention of helping international students to have smooth transition to Australian living. Becoming a one-stop shop for all student needs is the goal of the company. Students in need of such services can visit the Potensure Pty Ltd. website www. potensure.com.au and sign up for free student accounts.
