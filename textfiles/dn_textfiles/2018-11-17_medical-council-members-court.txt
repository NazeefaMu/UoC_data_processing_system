Medical Council members in court

The members of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) yesterday appeared before the Court of Appeal to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of Court for their failure to register a student of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe in terms of the Court of Appeal judgment.
The matter was fixed for November 30 and the members of SLMC were advised to appear in Court on next hearing date. The Court of Appeal bench comprised Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara.
Filing a contempt of court action against the SLMC, petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a MBBS graduate of the SAITM, moved court that the members of the SLMC be charged for committing the offences of contempt of court by willfully and contumaciously failing to provisionally register petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance and thereby disobeying the order of Court of Appeal dated January 31, 2017.
The petitioner stated that to date the SLMC and its members have failed, neglected and refused to comply with the judgment of Court of Appeal which was affirmed by the Supreme Court and provisionally register her as a medical practitioner. On September 21, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 regarding a legal issue pertaining to the SAITM and ordered the SLMC to pay Rs.100,000 as legal cost to a petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a student of SAITM in Malabe, for unnecessarily delaying and refusing to register her as a medical practitioner.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera, Shanaka Cooray and Niran Ankatel appeared for the petitioner. President's Counsel Manohara de Silva along with Gamini Marapana PC appeared for the respondents.
