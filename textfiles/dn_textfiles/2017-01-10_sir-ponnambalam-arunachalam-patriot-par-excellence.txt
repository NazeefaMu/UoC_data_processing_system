Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam: Patriot par excellence

A reproduction of the Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Memorial Oration, delivered by Dr. Brendon Gooneratne on January 19, 2009
Ponnambalam Arunachalam was the youngest son of Gate Mudaliyar A. Ponnambalam. He was born on September 14, 1853 to a highly respected and very well-educated, professional family from Manipay.
His eldest brother Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy had a distinguished career as a Proctor and was the Nominated Tamil Member of the Ceylon Legislative Council from 1893.
The next eldest child of the family, his brother, Ponnambalam Ramanathan, an Advocate, succeeded their uncle, Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy, as the Nominated Tamil Representative, serving from 1879 to 1893, and later on from 1921 to 1924.
Ponnambalam Ramanathan was also elected to the Legislature as member for the Northern Province (Northern Division) seat and occupied it from 1924 till his death in 1930. In addition to this appointment, Ramanathan was the island’s Solicitor-General from 1893 to 1906 for a period of 13 years, acted as Attorney-General on several occasions, and retired as a pensionable officer in 1906.
Education
Both the elder brothers of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam were educated at the Colombo Academy (now Royal College), and then at Presidency College, Madras.
Like his older brothers Ponnambalam Arunachalam, had his early education at the Colombo Academy, but, having won the English University Scholarship in 1870, entered Christ College, Cambridge.
He took with him a reputation as a student of exceptional merit, recommended by Sir Walter Sendall, Director of Public Instruction.
Arunachalam was now appointed to the Government Agent’s office in Colombo and then to a series of judicial posts in various parts of the island. This was a policy unofficially adopted by the British Government of the day, which effectively debarred outstanding Ceylonese from taking high office in Government and instead appointed them to various parts of the island in different capacities, such as District Judges, Police Magistrates and Commissioners of Requests.
Another talented person who was given the same runaround was Paul Pieris, later Sir Paul, the scholar and historian.
Sir Paul Pieris put his time in the provinces to good use, by researching and writing excellent books on successive periods of Ceylon’s history, of such distinction that he was later to become the first Asian to receive a Doctor of Letters degree from Cambridge University.
In 1906, Arunachalam was appointed to the Legislative Council. In 1912, Governor Sir Henry McCallum nominated him to the Executive Council, as a personal appointment; and on his retirement from the Public Service in 1913, he was Knighted in recognition of his distinguished service to the country.
Politics
In 1913, a new phase in Arunachalam’s life began: In this year he joined a political movement demanding self-governance for the people of Ceylon. In an historic lecture entitled “Our Political Needs”, given at the insistence of D. R. Wijewardene, Arunachalam crystallized the arguments for self-government.
In 1915, he was elected the first President of the Ceylon Social Service League for uplifting the poorer classes in Ceylon.
In 1917, he founded the Ceylon Reform League, and in 1919, he delivered an address to a Sinhalese conference under the patronage of F. R. Senanayake, for the purpose of organising People’s Associations throughout the Sinhalese districts of the island for political, social and economic improvement. This movement directly gave birth to the ‘Lanka Maha Jana Sabha’.
(I make mention of these activities and of Arunachalam’s continuous association with them, because they illustrate the strong unity that existed at that time amongst the peoples of Ceylon, when Sinhalese and Tamils were united in their approach to social reform, while indicating Arunachalam’s unflagging devotion to the ideal of national unity).
Meanwhile, other matters occupied his mind. He became the first Ceylonese to be elected President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. As President of the ‘Saiva Paripalana Sabai’, he took much interest in Hindu cultural matters. And notably, he was the first person to start agitating for a University for Ceylon.
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam’s contribution to the field of education was that of a pioneer. In his notes to the Director of Public Instruction, he stated that the fundamental defect in the system of elementary education in Ceylon was that English was employed as the medium of instruction. In a real sense, as has been pointed out, he was the father of the concept of Swabasha.
Unfortunately, this idea was worked upon by later politicians who misread it, totally rejecting English, which could have been the link language unifying the different ethnic groups of Ceylon. Since at that time the people of Ceylon were still functioning as a united family, the need for a link language did not assert itself. The paths of history are littered with missed opportunities and sadly, this was one of them.
Another missed opportunity was listed in a book by a Sinhalese journalist published two years ago. I would like to repeat this in verbatim, as published in the book:
“When I was detained in the Magazine Prison after the ‘71 Insurgency, I met five Tamil youth who were arrested for leading a “black flag” campaign protesting the standardisation of education. Among the detainees was Kasiyanadan, who aroused Tamil nationalist sentiments in the younger generation with his poetry. His had a calm and composed disposition and his full beard and lean body made him look like a yogi.
A story he told me, in jail, with deep emotion, shocked my Sinhala psyche to the core. Before 1956, both Sinhala people in the South and Tamil people in the North received telegrams in English. Members of both communities who could not comprehend the language, would need to go in search of someone conversant with the language in order to have the telegram read. The leaders of both communities had come to an agreement to remedy this humiliating situation; they agreed to moot Swabasha or the indigenous language policy.
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam’s contribution to the field of education was that of a pioneer. In his notes to the Director of Public Instruction, he stated that the fundamental defect in the system of elementary education in Ceylon was that English was employed as the medium of instruction. In a real sense, as has been pointed out, he was the father of the concept of Swabasha. Unfortunately, this idea was worked upon by later politicians who misread it, totally rejecting English, which could have been the link language unifying the different ethnic groups of Ceylon. Since at that time the people of Ceylon were still functioning as a united family, the need for a link language did not assert itself. The paths of history are littered with missed opportunities and sadly, this was one of them   
However, when contrary to the agreement, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike implemented the Sinhala Only Policy, the Sinhala people received their telegrams in their native language, but the Tamil people were given no choice but to have their telegrams sent to them in Sinhala, a language which was alien to them. He explained how under this new policy, the Tamil people had to go in search of someone who understood the Sinhala language in order to have their telegrams read. Kasiyanadan asked how something which was judged to be an insult to the Sinhalese people could not be considered an insult to the Tamil people as well.
What is clear is that simple issues, not resolved in the initial stages, were permitted to multiply into complex crises, ending in bloodshed.
Another example of a lack of foresight on the part of the majority is what we still see on the roads everyday. Signboards stating the roads in Colombo and elsewhere are STILL in English and Sinhalese only. Rarely, if ever, do signboards contain the names of roads in Tamil. Why cannot officials who are paid to do this job, rectify this?
Lessons
Thoughtful persons would agree that the lessons of history, if studied with attention, could be used to avoid the mistakes made in the past, so that with foresight, the destinies of nations and peoples could be guided in a proper direction. It is my firm conviction that even at this moment it is not too late to rectify the glaring errors that have divided our society. Goodwill and magnanimity from the majority Sinhalese, reciprocated by other communities, could still heal our wounds and point the way to a saner, safer world in the years to come.
Academia
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has been rightly called the Father of the Ceylon University Movement, as he was responsible for the Ceylon University Association which was formed in January 1906. In his memorandum to the Governor, Sir West Ridgeway, requesting the government to appoint a commission to report on educational progress and needs, Arunachalam appealed to the government to create “a Ceylon University”; or at least to raise Royal College to the status of a University College, which would be of lasting benefit to the people and a fitting monument to His Excellency’s rule in Ceylon. He suggested that Ceylon and Indian history and geography could replace English history and geography on the curriculum of such an institution. “His Excellency on October 15 decided to take no action,” was the negative response he received from the Governor’s Secretary.
Passing
When Professor Marrs, the first Principal of the University College, heard of Arunachalam’s death at Madura on January 9, 1924, while on a pilgrimage worshipping at the Hindu temples in South India, he summoned the students of the University College to the main hall and addressed them in these words:
“Gentlemen, I have asked you to assemble here at this hour as a mark of respect to the memory of one who was in a very real sense the Father of the University project in Ceylon. Little or nothing has been said of that side of his activities, which to those who were in close touch with him was the inspiration of his latter days - the side which concerns you and me as members of an institution so dear to his heart, the Ceylon University College.
I may remind you that Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam presided over the public meeting which was called to consider the question of the establishment of a University in Ceylon on January 19, 1906. From that day to the day of his demise, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has pursued his objective, to use his own words, “without let or restraint,” undeterred by the doubts of men without vision or the delay to which an untried project must, I suppose, always be subjected by conservers of tradition.”
Legacy
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has been honoured by a statue in the Parliament Square in 1930 and by the unveiling of his portraits at Royal College and at the offices of both the Ceylon National Congress and the Ceylon Social Service League. His name graces Arunachalam Hall, the first Hall of Residence to be opened to students at the University of Peradeniya in 1951 and a commemorative one-rupee postage stamp was issued in his memory on March 10, 1977.
His philosophical and religious contributions were collected and published in 1937, with the title ‘Studies and Translations’. Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar in his foreword to this anthology wrote: “The world cannot be sufficiently grateful to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam for having in his philosophical and religious ‘Studies and Translations’ unlocked these treasures of thought and of language to those wholly or partially unacquainted with the wonders of Tamil thought and Tamil poetry.”
Looking back on Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam’s career, we contemplate a life studded with immense contributions, in a range of different fields of endeavour. Sri Lanka has been bereft of statesman-like leaders, who put national interests first, since the demise of D. S. Senanayake and Sir Oliver Goonetileke in the 1950s. We have however not been short of politicians of every hue clamouring to become Members of Parliament and Cabinet, crawling out of the woodwork. Sri Lanka, we must remind ourselves, has the largest Cabinet in the world, over 100 odd Cabinet Ministers and Junior Ministers, living off the fat of the land with massive perks of office and this in one of the poorest countries in the world!
In this light, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam stands out as an outstanding leader of honesty, integrity and achievement and is a beacon to us all. Most of us would have been satisfied by association with one or other of such monumental endeavours. But Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam seems to have been a human dynamo - a true nationalist and patriot of Ceylon.
