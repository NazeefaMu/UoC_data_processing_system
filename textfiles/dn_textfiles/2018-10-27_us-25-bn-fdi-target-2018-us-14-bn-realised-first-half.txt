Ministry refutes baseless allegations:
US$ 2.5 bn FDI target for 2018, US$ 1.4 bn realised in first half

 
The Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry refuted unsubstantiated media reports citing that the Board of Investment had failed to attract or facilitate foreign direct investments to the country.
A communique said these allegations are baseless and inaccurate.
“While Foreign Direct Investment into Sri Lanka had been performing poorly, efforts taken by the BOI has helped turn this around.There has been consistent growth on the cumulative value of investments attracted, both in terms of new projects approved and on-going projects implemented,” the Ministry said in a release.
“It is to be noted that such growth was seen when the government took a deliberate decision to suspend the SDP Act as well as the granting of fiscal incentives by the BOI, until the enactment of the new Inland Revenue Act.”
The realised FDI figure of US$ 1.9 bn for 2017, as stated in the Annual Report of the Central Bank, was the highest FDI received thus far, and this value includes only US$ 292 mn. for the restructuring of Hambantota Port. The targeted FDI value for 2018 is US$ 2.5 bn and at the end of the first half of the year, US$ 1.4 bn was realised.
Commenting on the Export Processing Zones, the Ministry noted that while there are no new export zones, all 16 zones operated by the BOI are in operation, except for the Meerigama EPZ and the Mirijjawila Export Processing Zone that is now being integrated and developed as the Hambantota Industrial Zone.
The Ministry cited that since a substantial number of industrial zones were located outside the BOI Zones since the facilities within the zones were lacking in waste-water treatment plants, solid waste treatment and infrastructure. “In view of above, it was decided to develop three new zones, in Hambantota, Millaniya and Bingiriya and these are being meticulously pursued, albeit delays in land allocation and development of requisite infrastructure by relevant state agencies; i.e. RDA, CEB and the NWS&DB.”
A significant volume of investments are due for 2018, amounting to US$ 32 bn, most of which are in export oriented manufacturing. “Implementing most of these projects are delayed due to issues pertaining to land allocation and various delays in respective line ministries, which are beyond the direct control of the BOI. These projects are diligently pursued by Ministry officials in conjunction with BOI officials and respective line ministries and state agencies.”
The BOI has also identified targeted sectors for attracting FDI and enhance export revenue through an in-depth research study in collaboration with Harvard CID and the World Bank group. In identifying the target sectors, special focus has been placed on export oriented mechanise goods as well as services with a view to enhance foreign exchange earnings and also to diversify Sri Lanka’s export basket.
Investment promotion programmes are being implemented to attract FDI in the export manufacturing sectors of electric and electronic products, food and beverage, ship and boat building, IT and BPO, pharmaceuticals, automobile parts and services.
