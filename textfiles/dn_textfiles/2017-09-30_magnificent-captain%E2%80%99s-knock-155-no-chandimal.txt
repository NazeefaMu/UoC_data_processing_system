Magnificent captain’s knock (155 n.o.) by Chandimal

Sri Lanka 419; Pakistan 64/0 :
ABU DHABI, Friday – Sri Lanka’s Test captain Dinesh Chandimal has made it his habit of producing centuries under duress and yesterday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium he played one of the most important knocks of his career to steer his team towards a competitive total in the first Test against Pakistan.
Chandimal’s innings of 155 not out was the cornerstone on which Sri Lanka built their first innings total of 419 after they were at one stage 61-3 and the ghosts of the recent past of their whitewash against India threatening to raise its head again.
By the close of the second day Pakistan had survived the wiles of wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan to be 64 without loss, with Shan Masood (31) and Sami Aslam (30) both unbeaten.
It is not the first time that Chandimal had produced an innings of great character having done so against Bangladesh where he rallied his team from 70-4 to 338 with an innings of 136, then against Australia last year when he made 132 off 356 balls after Sri Lanka had slipped to 26-5, and that memorable match winning knock of 162 in the second innings against India at Galle in 2015 on an awkward pitch.
Yesterday’s knock was more pleasing because it was Chandimal’s first as captain and also his first against a testing Pakistan bowling attack that had the likes of world class bowlers Mohammad Amir and Yasir Shah and the vastly improved Hasan Ali.
In terms of endurance and skill especially in the oppressive heat, this knock would rank as one of his best so far in his promising career. It was faultless and the only time Pakistan came close to dismissing Chandimal was when he survived an lbw decision at 58 on the first day when he shouldered arms to Mohammad Abbas and successfully reviewed it and when he was bowled off an Abbas no-ball at 154.
In wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella, Chandimal found an able ally and the pair frustrated the Pakistan bowlers in a fifth wicket stand of 134 that laid the foundation for their total.
The pair resumed from the overnight score of 227-4 and batted almost the entire second morning session. Dickwella the aggressor in the partnership completed his half century off 67 balls (6 fours, 1 six) but could not carry on further than 83 – his highest Test score when he played onto a delivery from Hasan Ali much to his disappointment. He hit nine fours and a six in his 117-ball innings.
Like Dimuth Karunaratne on the first day who helped his captain add 100 for the fourth wicket, Dickwella proved his worth at number six. His wicket was the only success for Pakistan as Sri Lanka took lunch at 322-5 with Chandimal going strong on 122, having completed his ninth Test century off 273 balls (11 fours) with an expansive cover drive for four off Amir.
If Pakistan thought they were into the Lankan tail they were sadly mistaken because Dilruwan Perera – no mean cricketer with the bat (he has a highest Test score of 95 on his Test debut against Pakistan at Sharjah in 2014) stuck it out for a useful 33 off 117 balls to help Chandimal help further consolidate the total to 387.
Perera scored his first runs after 32 balls having survived two successful lbw reviews that went against him. He provided debutant Haris Sohail with his maiden Test wicket.
Abbas ensured the Sri Lankan tail didn’t create anymore frustrations to the Pakistan bowlers by capturing three of the last four wickets that left him with the chance of performing the hat-trick if he picks up a wicket with his first ball of the Sri Lankan second innings.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah was made to work hard for his three wickets sending down a marathon 57 overs for 120 runs.
