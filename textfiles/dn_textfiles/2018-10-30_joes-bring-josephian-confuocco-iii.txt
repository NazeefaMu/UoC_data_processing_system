Joes bring Josephian Confuocco III

The versatile St  Joseph’s College Western band staged a grand musical performance titled ‘Josephian Confuocco III’ Band Fiesta at the Sports Complex on October 27 at 5.30 pm. The members of the band comprising of 35 had been rehearsing with a great deal of dedication says the master in charge Jude Dixon Vass. A presentation of such nature took place after a lapse of 10 years. 
All the music arrangements are by T F Greecy, a multi instrumentalist who has been their instructor from last year. 
Music lovers enjoyed a delightful afternoon of music from young talent. Seven school bands got on stage to enthrall the audience. The bands were from St Peter’s college, Royal College, St Benedict’s College, St Paul’s College Milagiriya, St Bridget’s Convent and Holy Family Convent Colombo. 
The event was put together under the guidance of the school Rector Rev Fr Travis Gabriel and the Priest in Charge Rev fr Chanaka Janze.
