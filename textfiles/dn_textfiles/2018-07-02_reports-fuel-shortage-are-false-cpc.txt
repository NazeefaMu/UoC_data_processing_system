Reports of fuel shortage are false: CPC

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) yesterday said reports of an imminent fuel shortage in the country are false.
The CPC in a statement said that enough fuel stocks are available at all the CPC run fuel stations and the public do not need to unnecessarily panic as there is no shortage of fuel. Fuel distribution is done as usual, the statement said.
The CPC said it will pursue legal action against the parties spreading false rumours.
The CPC said the rumours are spread by some political elements with vested interests.
