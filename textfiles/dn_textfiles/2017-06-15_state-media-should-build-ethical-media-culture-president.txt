State media should build ethical media culture: President

State media should take the lead in building an ethical, disciplined and quality media culture in the country, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking after opening a new administrative building complex of the Independent Television Network (ITN) yesterday to mark the 38th anniversary celebrations of the ITN.
The President said the time he contested the Presidential election as the common candidate could be described as the period in which the state media was misused in a most degrading and uncivilised manner in the country’s history. The unfounded allegations levelled at him during the period had not been faced by any other politician or Presidential candidate in the country. Instead of gaining maturity with age, the state media suffered decline two and a half years ago, he said.
Such a lowly media culture should not emerge in the country in the future, the President said.
He said such insults were levelled against him because he was a member of a poor family, who posed a challenge to those who considered them as mighty individuals.
President Sirisena said he did not become President to bring his family members to politics, but to perform his duty and responsibility towards the country and its people by overcoming challenges.
A good political culture could be fostered only through a good media movement. Media heads, managements as well as media persons should dedicate themselves to fulfil duties and responsibilities of an independent and free media.
