Kelaniya Duruthu Perahera on January 28, 29, 30

The Annual Duruthu Perahera (Procession) at the Kelaniya Rajah Maha Viharaya will be held on January 28, 29 and 30. The historic Perahera had its origins in the year 1927 and it began largely to the efforts of the philanthropist, Don Walter Wijewardene, son of Helana Wijewardene Lamathani.
This pageant had evolved over the yeas to become the country’s elaborate and grandest low country event. The Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya is the most sacred temple in the Western Province since Buddha’s sojourn here during his 3rd historic visit to Sri Lanka.
It celebrates the event annually in the “Duruthu Poya” during January by conducting a historic, traditional and cultural pageant, the “Kelani Perahera”. Whilst the Kelani Perahera commemorates the religious significance of Buddha’s visit, it also supports and reviews Sri Lanka’s cultural traditions of drummers, dancers, singers, caparisoned elephants and colourful parades, which have always made this event a night of all nights.
The Perahera will commence with the handing over of the relic casket to Chief Bansayake Nilame, Dhammiak Attgalle, by the Viharahdipathi, Ven. Prof. Kollupitiya Mahinda Sangharakkita Nayake Thera. This time the Perahera is organised under the guidance of the President Dayaka Sabha, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Three Devala Perahera will take place before the main Sacred Relics Perahera. They are that of Lord Vibishana, Lord Vishnu and Lord Katargama. The Basnayake Nilames of the respective Devala Perahera are Lalith Hapangama Jayaraja Chandrasekara and Samantha Perera.
The Perahera will commence at 8.00 p.m. This year, a special efforts is being made to focus on tourists eager to acquaint with the majesty and splendour of Sri Lanka’s cultural facets such as this historic Perahera. There will be a special enclosure for tourists to view the Perahera. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority will support the event.
During the Duruthu Festival, Illumination of the Kelaniya Rajamha Vihara will be sponsored by the Thilakawardene textiles, Kiribathgoda.
