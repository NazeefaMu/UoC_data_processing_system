‘SL, India have long-standing friendship’

Sri Lanka and India have enjoyed a long-standing friendship and it goes back to the era of ancient Sinhala kings. Now certain persons and groups are trying to create an anti-India campaign in Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Sri Lanka received Buddhism, the science of ayurveda, music, artistic traditions and more from India. A country with a developing economy cannot become a developed country on its own. Therefore, Sri Lanka should obtain the support of India, Minister Senaratne said.
He was speaking at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a new water supply scheme in Kalutara. Minister Senaratne said Rs. 32,278 million is to be spent on the proposed water supply scheme which will provide salt-free drinking water for 573,000 people living in 269 grama niladhari divisions.
A total of 32,000 new water connections will be provided under the project. The project will be completed by July 2019.
By 2020, a total of Rs. 15,200 million should be paid. Similar amounts are to be paid for the loans obtained to construct Mattala airport. The present government has built a friendly relationship with India and neighboring countries, he said.
