Recruit principals to fill vacancies - CTU

The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) issuing a press release yesterday urged the government to recruit candidates for the principals' post in accordance to the prevalent vacancies.
The CTU requested the government to make suitable amendments to the gazette notification issued in April this year.
The Education Ministry on April 10 called for applications for principals’ third class service recruitment through the gazette notification number 1910. The gazette notification had only called for 4,431 applications although there are over 6,000 vacancies.
More than 20,000 applicants including 11,822 Sinhala medium candidates and 9,883 Tamil medium candidates would be sitting for the examination due to be held on November 21.
However, the CTU states that Education Ministry Secretary W. M. Bandusena had agreed to the written request made by them to recruit suitable candidates to the principals’ Class III service from the examination without appointing acting principals which is illegal.
