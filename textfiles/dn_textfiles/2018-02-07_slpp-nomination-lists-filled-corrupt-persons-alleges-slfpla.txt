SLPP nomination lists filled with corrupt persons, alleges SLFPLA

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Lawyers Association (SLFPLA) yesterday alleged that the nomination lists of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of G.L. Peiris are filled with corrupt persons.
“It has been identified that various mischievous characters are with the SLPP nomination lists,” SLFPLA Chairman Champani Patmasekara said.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
Patmasekara alleges that the name of a person, who is contesting the Attanagalla Pradeshiya Sabha under the SLPP banner is also on the nomination list of the Janasetha Peramuna. When going through the SLPP nomination lists, it can be found that there are many incidents in this nature.
Former SLFP Deputy Mayor for the Gampaha Municipal Council Ajith Basnayake said that the former mayor, who contests under SLPP banner for the LG poll, has allegedly obtained an allowance of around Rs. 100,000 per month for fuel.
“Another SLPP candidate was caught red-handed while accepting a bribe,” Basnayake said.
