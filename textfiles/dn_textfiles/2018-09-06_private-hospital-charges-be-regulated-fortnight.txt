Private hospital charges to be regulated in fortnight

The prices of 53 services offered by private hospitals will be regulated within the next two weeks, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was speaking at the opening the mental health unit and clinical waste disposal system at the Kegalle General Hospital yesterday.
The prices of various surgeries, laboratory tes and charges related to delivery (childbirth) will be included in the prices to be regulated.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Consultants’ Association will submit their proposals shortly on regulating private hospital charges. A group of private hospital owners are planning to file a case against the move. But the duty towards the people will be done and the prices will be reduced as planned, he said.
