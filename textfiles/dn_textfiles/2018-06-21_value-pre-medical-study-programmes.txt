Creating a Departure Lounge to become World class Medical doctors and Bio Medical Scientists:
The Value of Pre Medical study programmes

Sri Lanka and the surrounding region hasbeen producing world class scientists to the world. Thethousand dollar question for parents and students is; how can we get there and from where? This article concentrates mainly on Medical and Bio Medical Science areas.
Medical programmes typically requires high marks at the Advanced Level examinations. For example in the UK , the top ranking Universities such as the University of Aberdeen requires 03 “A” grade passes in Advanced Levels in the London stream and 02 “A“ and 01 “B“ pass in the Local stream to enter in to the screening process seeking admission to a medical school.Thereafter, they will have to achieve an IELTS score of 7.0 in all bands (no band less than 7) and are required to pass the UKCAT exam .
This allows them to move in to MMI (Multiple Mini Interviews). After successful completion, finally they are allowed to gain entrance to the Medical school. The important point here is that the outcomes of University of Aberdeen Medical School is recognized by the General Medical Council (GMC), UK and the graduates will obtain the provisional registration with the GMC.
This will allow them to apply for internships in all Commonwealth countries opening doors to become an international medical doctor. If the student does not possess an Advanced Levelgradingas mentioned above they could enter in to a Pre Medical Studies programme where the entry qualifications is 03 “C” passes in both forms of ALs.
Upon completion, they would be eligibleto apply for the screening programme to pursue medical education at the University of Aberdeen. In case the students are not selected for medicine they could move in to Bio Medical related studies with a one year exemption of those programmes where professional status and perks are equal or more than the medical doctors. (average salary of a Medical doctor in the UK is between £55,000- £80,000)
With the changing healthcare and biomedical science environment today, young students who are pursuing avenuesto become Bio medical scientistsappear at the forefront. Bio Medial Sciencesalso creates many other pathways to be Geneticists, Human Embryology and developmental Biologist, Immunologist, Pharmacologists, Microbiologists, Molecular biologists, Physiologists and Exercise & Sports scientists.
Biomedical scientists carry out a range of laboratory and scientific tests on tissue samples and fluids to help clinicians diagnose and treat diseases. They also evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. For example, they may work on medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes or AIDS, screen for and monitor a range of diseases or carry out tests for emergency blood transfusions.
Specialties in Biomedical scientists: Usually specialize in one of four areas: infection sciences, blood sciences, cellular sciences or genetics and molecular pathology.
Infection sciences: This includes medical microbiology and virology where identification of micro-organisms causing disease and their antibiotic treatment is studied.There is alsofocus on identification of viruses, associated diseases and monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines.
Blood sciences: This includes Clinical Chemistry, Transfusion sciences Haematology and Immunology. In clinical chemistry, focus is on the analysis of body fluids and toxicology studies whereas transfusion sciencedeterminesdonor/recipient blood compatibility. In haematology, functions related to blood and related diseases are the focus and immunology concentrates on the understanding the immune system and its role in combating disease.
Cellular sciences: the focus in this segment is histopathology and cytology where microscopic examination of diseased tissue samples takes place.
Genetics and molecular pathology: Genetics includes study of genes and hereditary variations in genes and in molecular pathology, study and diagnosis of disease through examination of tissues and fluids at molecular level are performed.
Starting salaries of Bio Medical Scientists in the UK range from £22,128 to £28,746 per annum.With experience and/or specialist knowledge, you can earn a salary of £26,565 to £35,577 per annum. Senior biomedical scientist, could to earn £31,696 to £48,514 and consultant biomedical scientists will earn more than £50,000.
Biotechnologists: Biotechnologists use biological organisms to develop or make products designed to improve health, food and the world around us.
They study the genetic, chemical and physical attributes of cells, tissues and organisms and identify practical uses for this knowledge to aid medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, or environmental advancement to essentially improve the quality of human life.
The work involves manipulating living organisms or their components to design or enhance vaccines, medicines, energy efficiency or food productivity.In the last decade, the growth of biotechnology has been phenomenal. Large biotechnology companies tend to use the term biotechnologist as a job title. Other organisations titles such as laboratory technician, research assistant, genomic technologist, flow technologist or bioprocessing engineer.
Types of biotechnology include;
Environmental - detecting and controlling pollution and contamination in the environment, industrial waste, and agricultural chemicals, creating renewable energy and designing biodegradable materials to reduce humanity’s ecological footprint
Medical and health - using live organisms or biomolecular processes to develop and improve treatments, identify inherited diseases, cure certain disorders, and even lead to organ regeneration
Industrial - using cloning and enzyme production to preserve and enhance the taste in food and drink, and developing enzymes to remove stains from clothing at lower washing temperatures
Agricultural biotechnology - improving animal feed and genetically modifying crops to increase pest resistance and productivity
Biofuels - using organic compounds to reduce the cost of bio-refining reagents and put biofuels on equal footing with fossil fuels, and creating chemicals from renewable biomass to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Marine and aquatic biotechnology - increasing the yields of farmed fish and designing disease-resistant strains of oysters and vaccines against certain viruses that can infect fish.
Sports and exercise scientist : An exercise physiologist will investigate how people respond and adapt to muscular activity and will use their skills and knowledge to improve performance and fitness levels or to help prevent or treat illness.
They will typically provide scientific support to athletes and teams within a single sport or several sports.
This may involve monitoring training through the measurement and assessment of physical functions such as respiration, metabolism and the nervous, pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. They might also be involved in developing fitness-training programmes to make sure athletes adequately prepare for competition.
Salary:
Exercise physiologists employed in the sports sector may earn between £18,000 and £35,000. If you work in high-profile sport science, salaries can exceed £60,000 and may reach up to £100,000.Salaries for qualified exercise physiology lecturers in higher education typically range from £23,952 to £36,162.
