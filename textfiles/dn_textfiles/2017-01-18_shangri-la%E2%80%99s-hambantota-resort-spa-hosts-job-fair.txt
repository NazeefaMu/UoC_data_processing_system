Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort  & Spa  hosts job fair

Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa recently conducted a job fair exclusively for People with Disabilities at the hotel premises.
The main objective of the job fair was to interview candidates who are differently-abled and give them an opportunity to join the Shangri-La family.
Fourteen candidates from the community attended the event and had discussions with the heads of various departments in order to get a clear understanding of the opportunities available in hospitality for those who are differently-abled.
It also gave the hotel’s management the opportunity to find people with a positive attitude who can make a contribution to the hotel and help build a strong and inclusive brand in the country.
Shangri-La actively engages with communities in which it operates in order to enhance the people’s quality of life. One of its CSR policies makes it mandatory for the properties to hire differently-abled colleagues up to 2% of the total staff.
Iain McCormack, General Manager of Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa said, “We believe that giving equal opportunities actively contributes to the development of individuals with disabilities as well as the communities in which we operate. As part of “Embrace”, Shangri-La’s Care for People Project, our resort plays its part as a member of the local community by supporting and giving back to the people, and offering training, employment and sustainable careers in the field of hospitality.”
Shangri-La hotels are five-star deluxe properties featuring extensive luxury facilities and services, and are located in Australia, Canada, mainland China, Fiji, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Qatar, Singapore, Sultanate of Oman, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
