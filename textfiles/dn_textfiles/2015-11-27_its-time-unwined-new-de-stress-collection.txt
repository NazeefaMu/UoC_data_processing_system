It's time to unwined with the new De-Stress Collection

Spa Ceylon the world's leading luxury ayurveda brand launched its all new De- Stress Collection of health and wellbeing products designed to help ease stress and still the mind, promoting natural harmony and chakra balance.
"This high performance range of powerful ayurveda formulae will be the most premium of our brand offering thus far", Spa Ceylon Co-founder and Director Shiwantha Dias said. He added that the range was a result of years of R&D to create the perfect mix of sensory and functional benefits to offer Spa Ceylon's discerning customers the perfect de- stress solution.
This premier range of preparations are infused with precious Frankincense, soothing Sandalwood, refreshing Tangerine and Kaffirlime to promote clarity and fresh organic Aloe Vera to cool & soothe the body system promoting overall health and wellbeing.
The range is enriched with powerful ayurveda herbs and also features the traditional Dashamula formula enriched with potent extracts of 10 medicinal goods.
The leading ingredient in this range is Frankincense, which has been used over the centuries as a divine, purifying and deeply therapeutic natural essence. Frankincense is proven to be deeply calming, pacifying and revitalizing. It has been prescribed in ayurveda for centuries as an anxiety calming tonic.
Frankincense derives its name from the archaic French word "Franc" (meaning pure/sacred) and the Latin word "incense" (meaning smoke). Frankincense essential oil is derived from the resin exuded by the bark of Boswellia frereana/carterii, a small tree that is native to North Africa and Middle East. The oil is then extracted from the resin by the process of steam distillation.
"Spa Ceylon De-stress is designed as a totally De-Stress solution, offering a perfect stress-fix for today's modern fast phased lifestyles. In the product development too we always consider how each product would fit in to our consumers lifestyle and created a comprehensive range of products for the perfect stress-fix everyday and everywhere", Spa Ceylon Co-Creator and Director Shalin Balasuriya added.
The De-Stress Relaxing Body Cleanser is a mild cleansing formula enriched with Aloe Vera & Virgin Coconut Oil. It is a perfect way to wash away the days stress, in the shower. While the De-Stress Harmonizing Essence Mist works efficiently to withdraw work stress. Whilst at study time the De-Stress Harmonizing Roll-on Balm helps to clarify and refresh the senses, while Grapefruit & Bergamot help uplift & revive.
For the perfect after work unwinding experience at home, the De-Stress Calming Body Elixer helps you and your loved ones to relax and sooth your body and mind.
