Sri Lanka’s UN journey

Fifty years on, it is easy to forget that John Lionel Kotelawela was Prime Minister when Sri Lanka (then, Ceylon) negotiated its way into UN membership. He had many endearing qualities but is rarely cited as an expert in foreign policy. Professor S.A. Pakeman has pointed out, however, that Kotelawela “was far more interested in world politics than his two predecessors,” the Senanayakes. (Ceylon, London, 1964). This interest, combined with irritation over the game of “mutual veto” that the superpowers were playing in New York, made him determined to break down the barriers that held the country back from UN membership. To achieve this goal, he conscripted Lake House publisher Esmond Wickremesinghe as a special envoy with the single assignment of securing UN membership for Ceylon.
Wickremesinghe had an innate “feel” for international relations, which was supplemented by almost encyclopaedic knowledge. He was, moreover, charming, polished and relentlessly persuasive. Supported by R.S.S. Gunewardene, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the US, he crafted a “package deal” that could enable a number of countries which had previously been denied the welcome mat to join the UN together. He then did what was considered almost impossible: he negotiated full support for the “package” from both veto-wielding superpowers. He was back in Colombo when Sri Lanka was formally admitted to the UN, and was the first to inform Kotelawela. An elated Prime Minister promptly offered Wickremesinghe a knighthood which the latter equally promptly declined. The knighthood went to Gunewardene, who became Sir Senerat.
Kotelawela was disappointed that his own ministry was not first off the mark to inform him of the country's admission to the UN. “They must be asleep”, he added for good measure. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike would also refer, subsequently, to sleeping habits in Colombo when he addressed the UN, an interesting coincidence.

After more than fifty years in Sri Lanka, the UN continues to make a difference in the lives of the Sri Lankan people who are strongly engaged with the UN in more ways than one. A broad and wide ranging partnership – with the Government, civil society, the broad NGO community, bilateral donors, and international financial institutions – has been developed to address a multitude of challenges, both in long term development, and during times of emergency.
Sri Lanka and the UN system maintain a mutually beneficial and interactive relationship.
On the one hand, as a very active member state of the UN, Sri Lanka helps to formulate and implement the UN’s policies throughout the world. On the other hand, the UN has consistently contributed to the economic, social and cultural progress of Sri Lanka and its people.
Global peace and security
Sri Lanka attended all General Assembly sessions; ran the 1976 GA session; proposed the 1978 Disarmament Session. The assembly, the UN’s main forum for debate, is the only UN body which includes representatives from all member countries. Sri Lanka has always been an active and a dynamic participant at all General Assembly sessions of the UN, over the past six decades.
Sri Lanka was a non-permanent member between 1960-65 of the UN Security Council tasked with ensuring global peace and security.
It has five permanent member nations and Sri Lanka has always maintained a cordial relationship with member nations of the Security Council.
Secretary General of the UN
One of the most important moments of Sri Lanka’s engagement with the UN was Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala’s candidacy for the Secretary-General position alongside Ban ki Moon. Although Ban Ki-moon went on to become the Secretary General of the UN, it was a proud moment for Sri Lanka which maintained a strong engagement with the UN since 1955.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka is the 16th largest troop contributing country to the UN. One thousand Sri Lankan UN troops have served in Haiti, Cote d’Ivoire, Sudan, Western Sahara, Mozambique, Timor-Leste, Liberia. United Nations peacekeeping is a unique and dynamic instrument to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace.
Sri Lanka’s new government, which came to power in January, this year, has strengthened the international community’s faith in the armed forces of the country and that, in return, has consolidated Sri Lanka’s position in this particular area.
Sri Lanka is a signatory to most of the important UN Conventions. Among them are:
*International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (in force March 20, 1982)
*International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in force September 11, 1980)
