Montpellier go top with last-gasp try in Clermont

Paris, Sunday: Montpellier scored a converted try in the dying seconds to win 30-29 away to reigning champions Clermont on Sunday and retake first place in the Top 14.
Montpellier picked up four points to move a point ahead of La Rochelle and Racing 92, who both won on Saturday.
The defeat leaves Clermont 10th in the table after 16 rounds, 11 points away from the playoff places.
It was only Montpellier’s third victory in eight away games in the league.
Montpellier won by a single point right at the death when Nemani Nadolo scored a 79th-minute try which Ruan Pienaar converted. “Clermont gave us a few balls at the end of the game and we strung some playing time together and were able to use Nemani Nadolo,” said Montpellier coach Vern Cotter, who was once in charge of Clermont.
The two heavyweights delivered a duel of great intensity as they traded blows and scores.
“It was a very committed match,” Cotter said.
Montpellier lock Louis Picamoles, dropped by France for the Six Nations, scored two tries in the first 20 minutes, separated by a home try scored by another lock, Paul Jedrasiak. AFP
