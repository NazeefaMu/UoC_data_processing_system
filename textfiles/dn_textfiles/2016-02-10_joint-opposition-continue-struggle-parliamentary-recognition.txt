Joint opposition to continue struggle for Parliamentary recognition

Parliamentarian Dullus Alahapperuma yesterday said that they will continue the struggle until the members of the joint opposition is recognized as an independent group in Parliament on behalf of the public. He was speaking at a press conference held at Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo yesterday.
"We were trying to find a soluition to this issue in a democratic way without creating any dispute with the Parliament,"he said.
Alahapperuma said that a tense situation erupted in Parliament after the House rejected their demand to recognize them as an independent group.
"Appointment of only two members of the joint opposition to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and Committee on Public Accounts is unfair," he said.
