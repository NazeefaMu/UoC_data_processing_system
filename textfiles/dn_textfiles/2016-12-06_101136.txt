Sri Lanka’s first ever all-female percussion band live on stage

‘Thuryaa’, Sri Lanka’s first ever all-female percussion band is set to thrill audiences with their concert ‘Thuryaa Live in Colombo 2016’, their first public performance in Sri Lanka and it will be an unforgettable event for the music lovers in the country. This will be a remarkable experience in the Sri Lankan percussion art scene. This is a revolutionary milestone in the history of Sri Lankan percussion art.
 
“We are the first ever female percussion band in Sri Lanka and this is our first public show. We launched the band in 2015. So far there is no female percussion artist in Sri Lanka who continues performing at a professional level,” said Sithara Maduwanthi, the leader of Thuryaa
Sithara, is the first female student enrolled in Percussion Music Department of the University of Visual and Performing Arts. Percussion music is an art form which is highly dominated by men till Sithara stepped into the scene at the University of Visual and Performing Arts percussion music department.
Although it was quite a challenging task, especially to change the conservative mindsets inside and outside of the University, Sithara had the support and guidance of Sriyan Chandrasekara, Lecturer in Tabla of University of Visual and Performing Arts along with nine other young, enthusiastic, energetic female students who wanted to join and perform alongside her.
“These girls want to become professionals and build a career in the field of percussion. Since the percussion industry is dominated by men, these girls want to break the boundaries and get into the field of percussion,” stated Maduwanthi.

‘Thuryaa’ women’s drums ensemble brought pride to Sri Lanka recently by winning the first place in the best music category and also the first place in the recent 18th Global Female Folk and Dance competition and carnival held in Punjab, India at University of Lovely Professional.
“Percussion requires a lot of energy so that is a challenge we have. This is not an industry for females. That is also a challenge but we are determined to establish ourselves as professional in the percussion industry,” pointed out Maduwanthi
Students of the University of Visual and Performing Arts, the all-female ensemble was formed with these ten talented undergraduate minds. Shaping with the essences of Kandyan, Low country and Sabaragamu traditions of Sri Lankan percussion art, Thuryaa’s ultimate goal is to explore and develop a novel trend in the Sri Lankan percussion art scene.
“Going beyond the conceptual boundaries and challenging the existing trends of the contemporary percussion music, ‘Thuryaa’ is the trailblazer of Sri Lankan percussion music with a much more novel feminine theme ‘Share the rhythm of humanity,” explained Maduwanthi.
The music direction by Sriyan Chandrasekara, Sithara Maduwanthi (Leader), Tharuka Sewwandi, Nadeeka Asuranada, Chamini Anuruddhika, Sanduni Chathurangi, Shalini Yashodha, Hashani Siriwardhana, Chethani Rathnayake, Chathurika Sandaruwani and Oshin Sachini are the members of the band.
‘Thuryaa Live in Colombo 2016’ will be held on December 6 at 7pm at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre.
