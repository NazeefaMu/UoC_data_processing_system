Be booked!  Big Bad Wolf here

The world’s biggest book sale, the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale, is set to give avid readers the book-hunting adventure of a lifetime. The international book sale is set to open its doors in the month of June 2018 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC). The highlight of this event is that the venue will be open 24 hours a day, so book enthusiasts can experience book heaven any time, day or night, until the mega book sale wraps up.
Last year saw record crowds gather to the venue, bringing together people, young and old, to attend this unique event in Sri Lanka. With its wide selection of books and one-of-a-kind discounts, the sale was a huge success during its inaugural visit to Sri Lanka in October of last year. This time around, the sale is coming back earlier than expected, and Sri Lankan readers can rejoice at the news of its return, which promises to be bigger and better than ever.
Bookworms from around the country are guaranteed to leave with unbelievable book bargains from the sale, with discounts between 60% and 80% across a wide range of genres. The sale is set to include over 1.5 million brand new, high-quality English language books covering areas such as literature, architecture, science, young adult, fiction, non-fiction and coffee table books, sourced from renowned publishers around the world.
The aim of the book sale is to make affordable books available for reading enthusiasts, as well as increase readership rates and contribute towards English proficiency amongst Sri Lankan readers.
Hailing from Malaysia, the Big Bad Wolf Book Sale is the brainchild of founders Andrew Yap and Jacqueline Ng, and has had a huge following in Malaysia since 2009. Following its success, the sale has expanded its footprint across the region, and is recognized today as an annual mega event taking place in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and now, Sri Lanka.
