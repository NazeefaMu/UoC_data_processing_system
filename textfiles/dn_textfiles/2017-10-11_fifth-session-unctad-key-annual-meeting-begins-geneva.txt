Fifth Session of UNCTAD key Annual Meeting begins in Geneva

Delivering opening remarks at the Fifth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) key Annual Meeting currently being held in Geneva, Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative and Ambassador to the WTO, R. D. S. Kumararatne highlighted the current financial gap of USD 2.5 Trillion in meeting the sustainable development goals for developing countries and hence the need for the best possible policies at national and international levels that can attract and channel investment to the countries, areas and vulnerable groups that are most in need of such investments.
Ambassador Kumararatne has been unanimously elected to chair the Fifth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) key Annual Meeting “High-level International Investment Agreements Conference on Investment, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Productive Capacity - building and Sustainable Development” devoted to discuss reforms of international investment agreements which is being held in Geneva from October 9 to 11.
Kumararatne further highlighted that the international dimension is, for many countries, a key component as there is a need for foreign investment to complement scarce domestic resources in many countries.
While appreciating the key role played by UNCTAD in taking up the discussions on international investment policies on sustainable development, Kumararatne stated that the high level conference could be another milestone in the global policy debate on investment for sustainable development.This conference was attended by over 200 delegates and experts from all over the world.
Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, Ambassdor Ravinatha Aryasinha, and Executive Director, Research and Policy Advocacy Department of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, Champika Malalgoda, represented Sri Lanka at this meeting.
