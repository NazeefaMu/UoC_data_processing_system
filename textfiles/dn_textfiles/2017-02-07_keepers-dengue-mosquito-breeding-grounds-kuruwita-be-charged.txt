Keepers of dengue mosquito breeding grounds in Kuruwita to be charged

The Kuruwita Machinery and Equipment Centre in Kuruwita had failed to carry out the order given by the regional health officers to clear out dengue mosquito breeding grounds. Therefore, the Sabaragamuwa Chief Minister and the Health Department were to take steps against the institution, sources said.
A team of public health officials led by microbiologist H.A.W.T. Gunewardena had identified mosquito breeding grounds in several public institutions in the Ratnapura and Kuruwita areas during a recent dengue mosquito eradication programme and took steps to take action against those who neglected the orders given by the regional health offices.
