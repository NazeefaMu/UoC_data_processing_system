Have  Flawless Skin!

How to get a glowing skin? How to have flawless skin? These are the questions that most of us ask the skin specialists and dermatologist and which need a satisfying answer. Clear glowing skin is a dream for every person. No one likes pimples, zits, dark spots, baggy eyes or dark circles. There are different skin types and different problems associated with them. Dry skin can get itchy sometimes and needs to be hydrated often to keep it glowing. Oily skin is prone to pimples and has a greasy texture. Some people have normal skin, which is God’s gift, and then
there are people with combination skin who have to face the problems of both dry skin and oily skin. Perfect skin is not too oily or dry but needs to be taken care with regular toning and cleansing. There are various types of facial masks made with natural ingredients which can also help in providing natural glow to the skin.
Nutritious, Fiber Rich Diet:
Everything healthy starts from your diet. Digestive problems result in skin impurities; hence diet is really essential for healthy skin. Taking in the right amount of micro-nutrients and vitamins is great for clear skin. Food for glowing skin should be carefully selected natural protein foods like fish, nuts and white meat, grains like buckwheat, brown rice and quinoa, vegetables like broccoli, tomato and beets are very healthy and good for the skin.
Fiber rich foods
Try to avoid processed and man-made food. Omega3 fatty acids are great to reduce inflammation; this is found in walnuts, salmon and soybeans. Eat plenty of healthy food to keep your skin glowing. More intake of fruits and vegetables will leave you with spotless, clear skin.
Drink Water:
As we know there are many health benefits of drinking water and juices, one of the best is to help your skin to purify the impurities, and glowing skin tips are incomplete without the inclusion of this essential point. Water cleanses the body and eliminates the toxins and waste. It hydrates the body and removes excess oils and dirt. 15% of our skin is made up of water. Drinking at least 2 liters per day gives the skin a bright, noticeable change in less than a week. It rids your skin from dryness and wrinkles. It also boosts the immune system. The importance of juicing for healthy skin also needs no new emphasis.
Avoid the Sun:
The sun is a great source for vitamin D. The morning sun from 7am to 9am is good for the skin. However avoiding the sun after this time is very essential. The UV rays are quite strong and they not only damage the texture of the skin but over exposure to these rays can result in skin cancer. Avoid the sun especially from 10 am to 2 pm as the sun rays can get really harsh, and this is a must for even normal skin care.
Avoiding sun
Try to wear clothing that covers most of your skin and carry an umbrella if possible. Apply sunscreen with SPF above 45 while going outdoors. Soothing natural remedies are the best answer to the question of how to remove sunburn and skin tan.
Skin Hydration:
Hydrating the body from inside and outside is important. Cleanse your face twice every day, washing your face more than this can result in dryness. The natural oils produced by the skin are required to nourish it and provide flawless beauty and skin care. Use cold water to cleanse your face after washing it, as warm water opens the pores which allow bacteria and dirt to enter into them.
Get the Daily Dose of Vitamin C
One of the most important vitamins for healthy and flawless skin is vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid that helps in enhancing the complexion and preventing the appearance of the signs of skin aging. Regular intake of vitamin C improves collagen production, enhances skin brightness, keeps away age spots and pigmentation and enhances the skin’s ability to protect itself from the damage caused by the harsh UV rays of the sun. -Indiafit
