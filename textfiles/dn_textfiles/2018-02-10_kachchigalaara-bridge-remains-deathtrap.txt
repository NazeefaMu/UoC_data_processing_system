Kachchigalaara bridge remains deathtrap

The Kachchigalaara bridge across Angunakolapelessa and Gamaralagama lacks railings. Residents said several people fell from the bridge and died.
Thousands of people use the bridge daily and accidents occur every day along the bridge.
Therefore, residents request authorities to renovate the bridge as soon as possible.
