JVP asks people to oppose govt’s move to sell state ventures

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday stressed that all stalkeholders in the society should oppose the government’s plan to sell state ventures to foreign countries for a song for the sake of its survival.
According to JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the government has planned to sell the Eastern terminal of the Colombo port to a foreign country citing that the government does not have money to purchase cranes for the terminal.
“The government has planned to sell the terminal after making an investment of Rs.10,800 million for its development,” he said.
Dissanayake said the JVP will join with trade unions and the masses to form a broader alliance against the government’s effort to sell these resources to foriegn countries and companies for a song.
“We will launch a massive protest near the Colombo Port with the support of Ports Authority trade unions and other trade unions in the public sector on February 1,” he said.
He said the agreement to be signed with a Chinese company to provide lands in the Hambantota district for the proposed industrial zone has stopped temporarily. “There is no reason why ships come to a port when it is only at the hand of the private sector,” he said.
