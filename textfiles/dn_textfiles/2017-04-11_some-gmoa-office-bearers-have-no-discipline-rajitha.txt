Some GMOA office bearers have no discipline, Rajitha

Some office bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) have no any discipline. They only attempt to topple the government, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He made this observation yesterday at Temple Trees presiding over the Nursing Diploma Certificate Awarding Ceremony for the 2012 A Group. Nurses numbering 1220 obtained their diploma certificates at the ceremony.
The Minister said the trade unions of the Health Ministry like to stage strikes. “They hold strikes and announce the strikes are successful,” Senaratne said.
“They are putting the lives of the people at stake by doing so. They should stage a strike if the discussions were failed. Some office bearers of GMOA do not like discussions,” he said.
The Minister said the strike should not be the main tool that the trade unions have to win their demands.
The government attempt to solve the issues in a humanistic manner, but the trade unions act the other way round, he said.
“With whatever issues they create, this government cannot be toppled,” Minister Senaratne said. “The government should take stern actions against the GMOA. I am always in that view. They have taken free education to become doctors but actions of some doctors cannot be acceptable,” he said.
Minister said the trade unions say they would stage strikes when the Ministry said disciplinary actions against the medical staff. In the past, the strikes were held to protect the free health service, but now such strikes are not being held,” Minister said. “During a discussion with the GMOA, the Health Services Director General had told them that he was working in accordance with the government regulations,” the minister said.
Minister Senaratne said the GMOA in response to Health Services Director General had said they would see to it when they toppled the government after three years.
“We have to change the mentality of some of the office bearers of the GMOA,” Minister Senaratne said.
“The Good Governance Government do not take defeat as the Bandaranaike government did. The government is committed to serve the people. So nobody can topple this government,” he said.
