HUTCH begins  doorstep SIM delivery

HUTCH, Sri Lanka’s fastest growing mobile broadband telecommunications provider has yet again, embarked on another ground breaking feat in terms of offering potential customers a first-of-its-kind convenience based service.
HUTCH has launched the ‘Online SIM Order and Delivery’ service where customers can through a simple registration process online get their Hutch Data SIMs delivered to their doorstep, free of charge.
As consumers today have busy schedules as well as are increasingly managing a lot of their daily requirements via the internet on their smartphones and laptops, HUTCH has implemented a convenient online facility where customers would not need to visit a SIM retailer physically to pick up a new SIM.
As an introductory offer, HUTCH SIMs will be offered with a host of special deals. At the point of delivery, the Data SIM will be instantly activated for the customer for immediate use.
Currently, the Hutch SIM delivery service is being piloted in Colombo and Gampaha and based on feedback and demand, HUTCH will look to expand to other parts of the country shortly.
Commenting on the recent introduction of the online SIM delivery service, HUTCH Sri Lanka CEO, Thirukumar Nadarasa said, “HUTCH has been continuously committed towards offering our customers with affordable yet convenient and relevant mobile solutions.
HUTCH has understood the need for a more convenient process of acquiring a Hutch Data SIM card that fits into people’s increasingly digital lifestyles with minimal hassle. Even with the soft launch of this unique service, we have been encouraged with the immediate interest from new subscribers. We look forward to this convenient channel becoming the preferred method for subscribers to acquire their Hutch data SIM in the future”
