ComBank bags Gold for Best Annual Report in Banking Sector

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon was awarded the Edmund J. Cooray Memorial Trophy for the Best Annual Report among banking institutions, the Gold award for Management Commentary, the Silver award for Corporate Governance Disclosure, the Bronze award for the Best Annual Report overall across all sectors and the Bronze for CSR Reporting at the 2015 Annual Report Awards of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka).
With these five awards, Commercial Bank became the most-awarded Bank of the night, reaffirming the Bank's commitment to transparency and good governance.
Since 2001, Commercial Bank's Annual Report has been adjudged the overall best in Sri Lanka nine times and this edition of the awards takes the number of occasions the Bank has won the award for the best Annual Report in the banking sector to 12.
"The Annual Report is the easily the most important document that any public listed company produces, but its significance is particularly high in the financial services sector, where accurate and comprehensive disclosures are vital," Commercial Bank's Managing Director and CEO Jegan Durairatnam said.
"We believe that as the largest private bank in the country, it is our responsibility to be a benchmark for financial reporting.
Our 12th Gold Award in the Banking Sector and winning the Gold Award for Management Commentary, which is a pivotal award for a financial institution, is a fitting recognition of the efforts of the team that compiled the annual report, and is an endorsement of the bank's continuing commitment to transparency."
The CASL awards reflect effectiveness in communication of financial and non-financial information to stakeholders and strict compliance with legislative requirements and accepted accounting best practices.
In evaluating reports for the awards, CA Sri Lanka looks at the organization's ability to effectively communicate organizational objectives, highlights, performance, personnel and management to an intended audience.
