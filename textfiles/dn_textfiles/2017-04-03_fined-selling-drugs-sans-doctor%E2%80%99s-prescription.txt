Fined for selling drugs sans doctor’s prescription

An owner and a salesgirl of a pharmacy in Ambagamuwa, Gampola who pleaded guilty to selling drugs without a doctor’s prescription and employing an unqualified pharmacist to dispense drugs at the pharmacy were fined Rs. 30,000 each by the Gampola Magistrate Chandanie Meegoda on March 31.
The magistrate ordered the owner to publish notices about the judgement made by court against him in three national newspapers in Sinhala, Tamil and English and report it to court on July 21.
A team of food and drugs inspectors led by R.P.W. Rajapaksa conducted the raid on the pharmacy and prosecuted on the directions of Kandy District Health Service Director Sarath Weerabandara.
