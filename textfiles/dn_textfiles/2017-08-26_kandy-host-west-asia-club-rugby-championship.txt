A lot of rugby is expected from CPRFU at provincial level
The CPRFU makes excuses of having no proper grounds, ground fee at Nittawela is sky high and also no place to have meetings. Today they do nothing but distribute a few balls which they get from the SLRFU, and watch tournaments conducted by other associations. At its peak in 2002 under the presidency of late Maurice Perera and Iswan Omar as secretary the CPRFU was very active and included top clubs like Kandy SC, Dimbulla C & AC, Dickoya Maskeliya CC, Peradeniya University, Old Trinitians SC and Kandy Youth SC all of whom have at one time or another competed in the SLRFU ‘A’ division competition. At the time Dr. Sarath Kapuwatte was the president of the Nittawela club, that the earned a name through rugby and gave a big hand. Today his influence is missed. The CPRFU also embarked in forming ‘B’ division clubs, which included Katugastota RFC, Polgolla RFC, Mawilmada RFC, Matale RFC, Nuwara Eliya RFC and Pilimatalawa RFC and by 2008 had 18 clubs playing in the up-country rugby league. Where are these clubs today?
