Lion Tambwe equals Super Rugby record, Crusaders go top

BUENOS AIRES: Golden Lions' Madosh Tambwe scored a record-equalling four tries in a Super Rugby match Saturday and Canterbury Crusaders reclaimed top spot in the New Zealand conference.
Democratic Republic of Congo-born Tambwe matched 15 other players since 1996 with Australian Joe Roff first to score four tries in a game.
The 20-year-old winger took just 54 seconds to open the scoring in a 52-31 rout of Western Stormers in Johannesburg during round 8.
He completed his hat-trick within 13 minutes and added a fourth try 12 minutes into the second half of the South African derby.
On a profitable day for wingers, George Bridge and Manasa Mataele scored two each for defending champions Crusaders in a 40-14 triumph over the Argentine Jaguares in Buenos Aires.
In other matches, Australian sides New South Wales Waratahs and ACT Brumbies won convincingly and Waikato Chiefs edged Auckland Blues in a New Zealand derby.
Waratahs hammered the Japanese Sunwolves 50-29 in Tokyo, Brumbies beat compatriots Queensland Reds 45-21 in Canberra and a penalty try earned Chiefs a 21-19 win over Blues in Hamilton.
Tambwe is the second player to score four tries in a match this year after Ben Lam of Wellington Hurricanes.
The Lions winger, who left DR Congo capital Kinshasa at an early age to be educated in Johannesburg, refused to take any credit for his achievement.
“It is entirely due to my teammates that I got those try-scoring opportunities,” said the man-of-the-match award winner. - AFP
