Political, land problems of N&E Provinces should be solved: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a solution should be found to political as well as land problems. While paying attention to political problems and finding solutions to them, we should build up the economy to ensure a high living standard for the people in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The Prime Minister was speaking to the media after a meeting with peoples representatives and state officials in the Jaffna district on May 19.
The Prime Minister said “Today, I had discussions with the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, Provincial Ministers, Provincial council members, Parliamentarians representing the Jaffna district and our Ministers.
The Northern Province is a Province that was devastated by war.Economic activities continued in other districts during the war time. Late President Premadasa opened 200 garment factories in the South during the war time. Galle city was developed during the period of war. But, the economy of the North was completely broken down and devastated for 25 years due to the war.
“Currently, the Northern Province seriously lags behind in terms of economic growth. The rate of economic growth should be above 6 percent if a region was to achieve development. The Northern Province should be development if it is to achieve more than a 6 percent rate of economic growth,” the Prime Minister said.
“Economic development of the Northern Province would also benefit the economy of the South and the Sabaragamuwa Province.
have malefic effects on the Southern Economy too,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said in order to increase the rate of economic growth and make progress, sectors of the economy which had collapsed should be developed by paying special attention to them. This task could not be handled by the government only. The central government, Provincial council and investors should join together in order to achieve these talks. The government had paid special attention towards bringing in investments,” the Premier said.
“Discussions had already been held regarding industrialisation, infrastructure development Housing and development of tourism, agriculture and fisheries,” the PM said.
“We have also decided to work together. We will create an integrated mechanism at the Provincial Council and Central Government level where a committee composing Provincial Council Ministers, Jaffna District Parliamentarians and Central Government Ministers would be appointed,” the Prime Minister said.
