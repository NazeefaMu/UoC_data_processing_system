Genius  make-up tips  no one told  you about

When it comes to make-up, there’s a lot of ways you can make the most of your products! From experimenting with products to make-up techniques, the beauty world is filled with a lot of hacks that you might not be aware of!
 The concealer hack
Applying concealer on just the under-eye circles is so old school. The new way is to apply the concealer in a triangular shape. The base of the triangle should be below your lashline and the point should be on the cheeks. This hack will give your face a lift and make your skin look more youthful.
Revive your mascara
You don’t need to throw away your dried-up mascara unless they are really old! If you want to revive and de-clump the texture, all you need to do is add a few drops of lens solution. This way you can break the dried texture and revive it to use it yet again!
Fix broken products
Nothing breaks your heart more than broken make-up products. If your compact powder, blush and any powder-based product have broken, you can easily fix it. All you need is some rubbing alcohol. Pour a few drops of it on the powder to smooth it out.
Coat lashes with baby powder
If you want to get voluminous lashes, try the powder hack. Use a lash brush to apply baby powder and then apply mascara, this way you will notice instant volume.
Make eye pencil a gel liner
You can make any eye pencil to work like a gel liner. All you need to do is heat the tip of the pencil with a blow dryer. This way it will melt a bit and will be smooth like a gel liner.
