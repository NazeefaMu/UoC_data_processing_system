Protest against SAITM, privatisation of free education to be launched

A protest campaign would be launched on May 9, with the support of all political parties, trade unions, professionals’ unions, students’ unions, etc., against SAITM and privatisation of free higher education, Media Spokesman of the State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals’ Association (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, he said that the newly appointed Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe should immediately find out who purposely delayed the construction of the State Medical Faculty of the Eastern University, while having all the required funds, resources, etc.
According to Alwis, the students would come onto the streets again and may be a few of them would die if the Government did not solve the SAITM issue and stop the gradual and well planned process of privatising higher education.
