Blue skies in sight


Decorum befitting a young lady of Methodist College and humility are two characteristics that the Head Girl of Methodist College Diyumalie Goonewardene possesses. Perfect Prefects features this young lady who is at the helm of this institution leading and guiding the girls.
“One of the most important leadership qualities a Head Prefect should possess is to always be calm and be prepared to make decisions in the most unexpected of circumstances in a calm manner. You need to be able to command respect from everybody and work with your teammates while understanding the other people. As a leader, you need to identify what everyone’s unique talents are and be willing to listen to the ideas of other people. Most of all you need to pull yourself together. You need to know what exactly you want,” said Goonewardene.
The Head Prefect is chosen from Grade 13, which is one year before they leave school.
“So all the Grade 12 teachers get together and nominate students from their classes. And then they address the criteria of who has leadership qualities, who can manage their studies and their involvement in schools activities and if they can command respect from students their own age and even girls younger than them. After that a few students are nominated and the teachers and senior students vote and the head prefect is appointed,” stated Goonewardene.
The primary duty of the Head girl is to maintain discipline and have it throughout the time a girl spends at school and from how the girls wear their ties, their ribbons and do their nails and to walking in line.
“We do projects at school that help the girls become rounded and projects that will enhance their personalities before they leave school. We try to also go out of school and do a project to help people outside of school in society. We have 29 people in our committee and I need to make sure that all of them are working and that they grow as girls into fine young ladies and have the opportunity to broaden their perspectives by seeing what is outside. As a school committee we have to do two projects, inside the school and outside the school,” added Goonewardene.
The committee includes Prefects, Games Captain and Head Prefect and the House Captains and Vice Captains are from a year younger than Diyumalie.
“The duty of the committee is to keep the school in order and help out in events. Our primary duty is to inculcate values of proper conduct. I and my fellow Prefects are supposed to be an example to everybody – an example of virtue. Girls are supposed to look up to us. For example, you need to show them what they should aspire to be. They should be able to come to us when they are facing an issue. And as prefects we need to be there for them when they need us without feeling alone,” explained Goonewardene.
One of their programs is to build girls’ self-esteem up and take it to a higher standard.
One of the school activities which is not confirmed yet is helping out with the flood relief or to help people who are affected to learn how to earn their income and motivate them to be independent.
“I used to swim. I am in the Choir and the Senior Christian Movement and as the Head Prefect, I have different responsibilities and sometimes it is hard to balance everything. But sometimes you need to assess your priorities. For me, Head Prefect responsibilities come before my choir commitments but I have to set my limits because I enjoy being in the choir. So I have to manage the time I have,” explained Goonewardene.
The sky is the limit for this young lady.
“I have always wanted to become a pilot abroad. I am doing my London A-Ls now. I want to get into the aviation industry. I have many friends and relations in the field. I did an aviation course of three months provided by my school last year. That fuelled my passion for aviation. The industry has so many different aspects to it. I have always liked to travel. So I would love to be able to be a pilot and learn to travel as well,” shared Goonewardene.
Goonewardene has received a fine education at Methodist.
“At Methodist, I have learnt to be able to identify who I am and I have had so many opportunities to bond with the girls, to get to know other people and help out in so many activities. As School girls at Methodist College, we get to learn and experience so many different things. You get to work as a team. There are so many moral values you learn through school life. I am so glad I am a member of this school having received so much from it,” elucidated Goonewardene.
Goonewardene’s parting words to any girls who wants to take up a position of leadership at Methodist is to be humble.
“Every leader is different. Every leader has her own style. Be who you are. Try to be the best you can in every situation. Don’t show off but be humble and always give God the glory,” said Goonewardene.
Support is something she has had in abundance.

“I have received a lot of support from the Prefect body at Methodist. The girls have been very cooperative making it so easy for me. As a result, I have been able to enjoy my responsibilities as much as they enjoy their responsibilities. They have been so helpful to me in so many ways. They have always had that respect for me even though they are all my age or a little younger to me. My family is pretty supportive. My father and mother were both in school committees. My sister is a swimming champion and I have a younger brother who is always loving. It is a very supportive environment and they help me to relieve my stress and help me enjoy life. Our principal, Hiranya Fernando, has been very supportive throughout the entire process and always is there if I need anything,” elucidated Goonewardene.
Divine Grace more than anything else is what Goonewardene attributes to her success.
“My faith has helped me a lot. I am only here because of God. I believe that my position was given by God. I have faced so many challenges throughout this year, it is stressful being a head prefect. I have overcome all these challenges up to now by the grace of God. I give God all the glory because he has helped me become a humble person,” stressed Goonewardene.
“I think it is very important for a school to have a prefect body because the students are groomed in the right way and it provides opportunities for leadership and develops leadership skills. It helps all to work through their difficulties and gain new experiences. Our school is also known for its discipline and to maintain that discipline you need a prefect body,” summed up Goonewardene.
