Gateway to Southern Expressway,  Seven  Eleven Hotel Kesbewa opens

Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa
The newly opened Seven to Eleven Hotel in Kasbewa, situated in a tranquil, picturesque location just 15 minutes to the Kahathuduwa exit , is an ideal retreat for Southern Expressway passengers, tourists and for corporate, MICE events, and family functions.
The second venture of Asia Holdings Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Seven Eleven Kesbewa will be an asset for tourist travelling especially between the Southern and Central Provinces using the Southern Expressway. The uniqueness of the hotel is its ability to facilitate guests coming from Down South heading to the airport by providing star class cuisine and accommodation. The guest gets the opportunity either to refresh and exit to the airport or stay a night after an exhausting journey in the South at Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa. This nulls the need for them to travel all the way to Colombo which is the normal practice and get tangled in the huge traffic.
Similarly, tourists coming from Central Province locations such as Kandy, Pinnawala or Nuwara Eliya going down South now need not go to Colombo for refreshments and get caught in the Colombo traffic, instead they could enter the Southern Expressway by taking the Kadawatha outer circular expressway entrance and depart from the Kahathuduwa exit for a star class meal and refreshments or an overnight stay at the brand new classy Seven Eleven Hotel and Restaurant Kesbewa.
Tourists after enjoying a morning session elephant demonstration which in Pinnawala concludes at 11 am could reach Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa around 1 pm for lunch and then proceed to their Southern destination which will provide much convenience to them. Moreover for Southern Expressway travelers there is no star class facility in Kottawa or Kahathudawa to refresh themselves. Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa fills this vacuum and is already getting popular as a strategic stopover point for travelers from Nuwara Eliya to down South locations and vice versa, travelers from down South to the Airport, Negombo or any other destination in Sri Lanka.
The Seven Eleven Hotel chain has two more ventures a hotel and restaurant in Thalawathugoda and they also plan to setup their flagship hotel in Hikkaduwa with an investment of not less than Rs 150 million next year said its General Manager Mahesh Kariyawasam . This is to be on par with the government’s goal of attracting four million tourists by 2020, he said.
Seven Eleven, Hotel Kesbewa, consist of 14 deluxe luxury rooms, star class restaurant, pool, rooftop VIP lounge and continental food. Kariyawasam said the specialty of their menu is that it is a mixture of eastern, continental, western and all Asian cuisine.
The hotel is also member of ASMET Sri Lanka. He said that they target tourists foreign and local from all travel agents, direct contacts and booking machines such as booking.com, Agoda.com and Expedia.
Already there has been a very good response from travel agents and guests response has been very good for their personalized service, he said.
