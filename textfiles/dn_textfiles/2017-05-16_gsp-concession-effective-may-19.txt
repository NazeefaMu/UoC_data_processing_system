GSP+ concession effective from May 19

 
GSP+ concession on Sri Lankan exports to the European markets will come into effect from May 19, the European Union Ambassador said today.
With this 66 Sri Lankan trade lines will be exempted from custom duty.
Sri Lanka lost trade facility GSP+ in 2010 after mounting human rights abuses allegation during the end of the war.
The European Union Parliament voted to allow Sri Lanka regain GSP+ concession on April 27.
When the motion to deny granting Sri Lanka GSP+ concession was taken up, 436 voted against, while 119 voted in favour and 22 were absent.
