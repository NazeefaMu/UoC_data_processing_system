The Colombo Port has gained 23rd position among the world’s 30 best ports according to the ‘Alphaliner’ international standardisation program.
Earlier, the Colombo Port occupied the 26th position in 2015 according to this standardisation computed on the basis of container handling operations, said the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in a press release yesterday. In 2016 the Colombo Port increased its container handling by 10.6 percent from 5.2 million containers to 5.7 million containers.
The first place among International Ports has been won by Port Kelang in Malaysia which had gained a 10.8 percent increase in container handling.
