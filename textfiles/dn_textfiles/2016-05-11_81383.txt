Lanka faces stiff opposition from Malaysia’s Fijian imports

All rugby fans in Malaysia will wend their way to Royal Selangor Stadium in Kuala Lumpur to witness in what should turn out to be a closely fought out battle between two evenly matched teams in the Asia Rugby Division one championship where defending champions Sri Lanka will take on vastly improved Malaysian side with a Fijian flavour today. Kick-off will be at 4.30 p.m.
The contest should turn out to be a battle between the respective forwards. With a set of heavy and strong forwards, the Sri Lankan team should have the edge upfront. Also they should see plenty of good ball coming their way through the line outs where players like Soyuru Anthony, Sharo Fernando, Jason Dissanayake and skipper Sudarshana Muthuthantri can zoom over their rivals. The visitors may be able to have their own way in the set pieces, through their hefty Fijian third row forwards.
But the Tuskers team led by that tear-away forward, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, will answer with a mobile back division, who are fit, fast and can mount tremendous pressure on their opponents.
The Lankans will be searching for possession in the loose through their young forwards, who are fast and furious to penetrate the Malaysian defence. The Sri Lanka, back division has the ability of co-ordinating well which could prove awesome with their superior mid-field play through their faster three quarters.
In the absence of Kandy’s play maker and full back Nigel Ratwatte who has undergone a knee operation, ex CR, Navy and Police full back Rizah Mubarak will play in the full back position like he did against Singapore, while CR and FC wing three quarter Kavindu Perera will play alongside Havelock’s skipper cum co-winger Sandun Herath.
With Marija been not available due to a back injury (slip disc), Navy player Chanaka Chandimal will play as fly half while CR’s Bhanuka Nanayakkara is likely to come in his place as fly half in the second half.
Danushka Ranjan who had suffered from an injury has now fully recovered and will partner with CR centre Kanchana Ramanayake. Both players had earlier represented Sri Lanka sevens team hence they are expected to pair off well. Ranjan in fact ended being the most valuable player of the tournament last year when Sri Lanka beat Philippines in the final.
Both teams have players, who could produce individual brilliance, to make this game a most exciting one. But in the end it will be the team that indulges in cohesive rugby that could prove to be the winning factor. Sri Lanka are determined to play their running rugby in the caliber of the Fijian style, that too with sweeping moves to rattle the Malaysian defence.
Last year Sri Lanka turned tables to win this championship in an absorbing contest. It turned out to be a spectacular performance by the Sri Lankan Tuskers where the white shirted team won convincingly against favourites Philippine Volcanoes in the finals to remain unbeaten and win the championship for the first time in their over 100-year history.
Young Jason Dissanayaka, who finally donned the Sri Lankan jersey, is now playing his normal running rugby by opening out many holes in the opponents defence. A hard-running youngster he has the ability to form the overlap from being a forward towards the three quarter line. But in today's tie his opposition team mates with the help of Fijians are sure to mark him.
Sri Lanka national head coach Western Samoan Tevita “Laga” Tulagaese said, “It will be a close fight and I personally think if we (Sri Lanka) minimize the space for those Fijians to run then we will come out on top.
“My heart is telling that Sri Lanka will pull it off even in the last minute; but we really have to get our defences right.
We were bit rusty against the Singapore side in the last match but it’s understandable because the players were after a hectic club season. Don’t worry in the end we will win, cheers to Sri Lanka,” Laga said.
Whoever wins this crucial match, will be one step closer to the championship enabling them to be the ultimate winner.
Sri Lanka (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Nivanka Prasad, Ganuka Dissanayake, Jason Melder, Sharo Fernando, Sudharshana Muthuthantri, Jason Dissanayaka, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weerarathna, Chanaka Chandimal, Kavindu Perera, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Danushka Ranjan, Sandun Herath, Rizah Mubarak (WAI)
