Funeral of constable, daughter

The bodies of Constable Neranjan Wickramaratne of the Presidential Security Division and his 14-year-old daughter Saumani Thihansa Wickramaratne, who drowned in the Giritale tank, were brought to their residence at Dunagaha on Saturday. Wickramratne who was on home leave, had gone on a pilgrimage to Polonnaruwa with his wife, two children and several other relatives, on Friday. That afternoon, they had gone to bathe in the Giritale tank. While bathing, Thihansa had got into difficulty and Wickramaratne had rushed to help her, when both drowned in a sudden rush of water.

Thereafter, he had been assigned to the Presidential Security Division as an electrician. His wife is attached to the Negombo SP’s office.
