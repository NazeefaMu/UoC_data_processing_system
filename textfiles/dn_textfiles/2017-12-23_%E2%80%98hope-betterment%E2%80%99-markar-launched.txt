‘Hope for betterment’ by Markar launched

A book comprising articles written by the former minister and the current chairman of the National Media Center Imthiaz Bakeer Markar titled 'Naduwadu Nalam (Hope for betterment) - experiences of a politician,' was launched on Thursday at the National Library and Documentation Services Center.
Addressing the gathering Markar said, “we should explore similarities between religions and live together as one nation and refrain from looking for differences.”
"We can make this country an example to the rest of the world by living together in peace and harmony, irrespective of religious differences.
There are many similarities between religions. We should start accepting the similarities and stop searching for differences. Similarities are high compared to differences,” he said.
Markar added that the name of the book was his election motto when he contested for the first time in the District Development Council in 1981.
“Since then, I made ‘Hope for betterment’ as the theme of my election campaign. I believed in it and tried my best to implement it during my term as a politician,” he said.
He said one should enter politics with the aim of serving the people.
The event was chaired by the director of the Jamia Naleemiah Educational Institute Dr. M. A. M. Shukri, President Counsel M. A. M. Zuhair, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum N. M. Ameen and the Vidivelli Newspaper Editor M. B. M. Fairooz.
The book was dedicated to the former minister late A. C. S. Hameed, former Western Province Governor late Sayed Ali Maulana, former Islamic Affairs Minister late A. H. M. Azwer, former Principal of Zahira College, Colombo late S. L. M. Shafie Marikkar and former secretary of the Islamic Propaganda Council late A.C.A. Wadud.
