Softlogic enlivens Ja-Ela with Burger King, Softlogic Max

A new dimensional shopping experience came to life in Ja-Ela, when two of the Softlogic Group’s retail operations Burger King and Softlogic Max joined forces in a single-location with a simultaneous opening in this suburban enclave.
Offering the characteristic robust dining choices synonymous with Burger King and the panoramic range of global electronics brands represented by Softlogic Max, the two stores in one building at 150, Negombo Road, Ja-Ela epitomise the breadth of offering and convenience that only Softlogic can deliver to consumers.
The two outlets were opened by Softlogic Group Chairman Ashok Pathirage in the presence of invitees and senior staff from the two retail operations.
The opening of Burger King in Ja-Ela offers residents and passers-through a deliciously diverse menu for brunch, lunch or dinner, featuring world-renowned products like the Whopper Burger King’s signature 100% Flame-Grilled Beef or Chicken Patty with Mayonnaise, Ketchup, Fresh lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions and Pickles all inside a five-inch sesame seed bun.
The restaurant’s extensive offering comprises the complete range of burgers and sides and includes matchless deals on its rice meals.
A spacious Kids Play Area at the new Burger King Ja-ela outlet offers little visitors loads of fun on slides and other play items.
The outlet will be open daily from 10 am to 11 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to midnight on weekends.
Meanwhile, the Softlogic Max showroom at the same location will be open from 9 am to 8 pm seven days of the week, offering shoppers one of the largest possible collections of consumer electronics brands under one roof for products such as TVs, home theatre systems, audio and video systems, refrigerators, washing machines, home appliances, kitchen appliances, built-In appliances, cookers and ovens, hoods and hobs, air conditioners, rice cookers and laptops.
