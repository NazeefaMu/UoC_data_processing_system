President urged to revoke gazette notification

A statement endorsed by 38 civil society organisations and 2, 680 individuals requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to review and revoke the Gazette Notification No. 2011/34 was sent to the President on April 22.
The gazette declares 40,030 hectares of land in Musali DS division in the Mannar District as Mavillu forest reserve under 3A of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.
As a result of the gazette notification, a number of villages in Musali including Karadikkuli, Marichchukatti, Wilaththikulam, Periyamurippu, Mavillu and Weppal will be seriously affected as families risk losing land they have traditionally claimed.
The statement, while reiterating the need for a concerted effort to ensure protection of forests, highlights the contents of the gazette notification and the manner the gazette was drawn up failing to take into account the rights of people from the area and the history of the issue of land claims.
The statement notes that unless corrective action is taken, there could be serious repercussions for the Northern Muslims forcibly expelled by the LTTE in 1990 attempting to resettle and rebuild their lives after the brutal war, and have a knock on effect on post-war reconstruction and relations between ethnic minorities and the State.
It also highlights a wider problem in the State's failure to address occupation of land by state agencies including the military and the Forrest Department in the North and East and calls for action to recognise the rights and claims of multiple war-affected communities.
