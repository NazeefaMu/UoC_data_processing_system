Suspect with stocks of banned herbicide arrested

A large scale racket of selling herbicides in Dambulla is afoot these days, regional farmers say. The herbicides are imported secretly from foreign countries, especially from India, they said.
A packet of herbicide is sold at Rs. 1,500. Dealers visit cultivated lands and sell them. They are also kept at stores of chemicals and sold secretly, they said.
The racket was informed to police many a time, Dambulla Heart Youth Association Chairman Rajith Premasiri said. Dambulla police raided a place along the Matale Road recently and seized over 110 packets of banned herbicide and nabbed a suspect.
Other suspected traders had hidden their stocks when they came to know about the raid, police said.
The suspect was to be produced before the Dambulla Magistrate yesterday.
Dambulla police are investigating.
