Facelift for Kuruwita, Bopathella

The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council (SPC) will develop the area around the Bopathella of Kuruvita as an environment friendly tourist zone, SPC Governor Niluka Ekanayake said.
She was addressing officers of the Provincial Tourism Ministry and the Kuruvita Pradeshiya Shaba recently.
She said the area around the Bopathella will be an eco-friendly tourist attraction and environment friendly zone before long.
A large number of visitors, environment researchers, and nature lovers among others visit Bopath Ella daily. But some tourists pollute the environment engaging in bad habits. Illegal constructions, too, destroy beauty of the surrounding, she said.
The Governor said many illegal constructions along the road to the Bopath fall were identified. These constructions obstruct traffic it addition to polluting environment.
“Some visitors improperly discard non-degradable garbage such as polythene, plastic and empty bottles and beer cans around the Bopathella. These people deliberately commit errors and destroy the environment, the Governor said.
She advised the officials to take measures to protect visitors who accidentally fall into the Ella. The visitors must know the danger in bathing in the fall or risking their lives just to capture a selfie.
The Governor said the illegal constructions will be removed and a car park will be set up and the businesspersons at illegal constructions will be provided with a market place at the proposed car park.
She said a police post will be set up to minimize unruly behaviour of visitors and to save victims.
Secretary to the Governor Herath P. Kularatne, Chief Secretary D.M. Malani and Kuruvita PS Chairman Premaratne Malkekula participated.
