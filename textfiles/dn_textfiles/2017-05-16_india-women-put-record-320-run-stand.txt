India women put on record 320-run stand

India woman cricketer Deepti Sharma on Monday etched her name in the record books as she recorded the highest individual score for India in women’s One-day Internationals. The 19-year-old achieved the milestone during a Women’s Quadrangular Series ODI match against Ireland at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom, South Africa.
She sent the Irish bowling on a leather hunt with a magnificent 188 off 160 balls. Her 160-ball entertaining knock was studded with 27 fours and 2 sixes.
Deepti, who missed out on a double-century by just 12 runs, is also now the youngest (19 years and 264 days) to score 175-plus runs in an ODI innings, for both men and women.
Deepti, along with Poonam Raut, who scored a fine 109 off 116 balls, became the first pair to share a 300-run stand in women’s ODIs adding 320 together. After India won the toss, Deepti and Poonam took India to a mammoth 358/3, their highest in women’s ODIs.
Ireland was dismissed for 109 and India won by 249 runs.
