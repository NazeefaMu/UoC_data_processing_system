Performance without barrier

The East Indian state dance Manipuri gained worldwide recognition. Manipuri originated in the East Indian state of Manipur. The word Manipuri is also often used for Manipuri saris. The excellent Manipuri saris are also manufactured in the Manipur state of India.
In the Manipuri dance the Rasa Lila, dances are deeply linked to devotional worship and were earlier performed in the temples. The dances were performed at the Nat Mandapas in the temples of Manipur.
The Manipuri dance as all other Indian classical dance forms has its roots, in deep devotion, and spiritualism. King Bhagaya Chandra was a famous king who ruled Manipur during the period 1759 to 1798 AD. He was deeply involved in culture and religion.
Traditional art
He excelled in prose, poetry, philosophy, dance, drama, and music. The kings and the queens were very much involved, with the traditional art forms, mainly dance and music.
The common masses were not restrained from seeing the performances. Generally, the dance was common to all; there was no barrier for caste or creed.
The dance was not practised merely for entertainment. But it was deeply in Hindu religion and devotion. After the era of King Bhagaya Chandra, the kings in his lineage gave their support and patronised the dance and other art forms.
Even the development of Thalas in Manipuri dance is still identified with the rule and period of individual kings. The male dancers play an equally important role with female dancers.
Large cymbals
The male Manipuri dancers generally carry a different variety and shapes of drums, when they dance. Sometimes while dancing they carry large cymbals (which are called Kartaal).
The male Manipuri dancers generally wear white dhotis and often wear white turbans. It is a distinct feature of the Manipuri male dancers as compared to male dancers of the other Indian classical dances.They hardly wear any ornaments and not even ankle bells. The Manipuri dance form is entirely different from the other classical state dances of India.
The female dancers wear beautiful, specially designed costumes. Long, stiff embroidered skirts are worn by the female dancers, and round stiff bamboo sticks are kept in place to keep the skirts firm and stiff. The costumes are of an extraordinary pattern as distinguished from the other Indian dance costumes.
The movements of the Manipuri dance are smooth and free flowing, though the thandava and Lassiya aspects could be seen in this traditional dance form. Bengali and Manipuri languages are used in the Manipuri dance.
The poetic verses are derived from Jayadeva, Vidyapathy, and Chandidas and other well-known Manipuri poets.
Comparative study
The Manipuri dance is performed individually or by a group of individuals. It also uses the hastas to some extent but not as in other classical Indian dances. A comparative study of the Manipuri with Bharatha Natyam reveals that the Manipuri like the Bharatha Natyam uses thandava and lassiya together.
In Bharatha Natyam Angika Abinaya, (communication of movements through body limbs such as Anga, Upangas, and Prathiangas), Akariya Abhinaya (usage of dresses costumes and make up), Vaachika Abhinaya (interpretation of the songs through words), and Sathvika Abinaya (expresses the emotions through Abhinaya with involvement, or expresses through the inner feeling) are equally used.
But in the Manipuri, Angika Abhinaya and Akaariya Abhinaya are equally used. But there is little scope for Vaachika Abhinaya (interpretation of the songs through words), and there is no scope at all for Saathvika Abhinayas (expresses the emotions through Abhinaya with involvement, or expresses through the inner feelings). Like the Kathak and Kathakali, male dancers play a major role in the Manipuri. Dolki a special drum is carried by the male dancers while dancing.
Female dance
Female dancers allow the hands to flow freely and gracefully, but the usage of hand gestures are limited. Like the Bharatha Natyam, Manipuri is also based on Hinduism, including Sivaism and Vishnavaism. The Manipuri is a unique and graceful dance form as compared to other Indian classical dance forms.
