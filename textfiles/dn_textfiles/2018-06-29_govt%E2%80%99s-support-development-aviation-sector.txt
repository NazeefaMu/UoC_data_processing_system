Govt’s support for development of aviation sector

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday pledged to provide the government’s fullest support to both local and foreign companies investing in the development of the domestic aviation sector in Sri Lanka.
The Minister was speaking after opening the new helicopter hanger which is equipped with state of the art facilities to facilitate private sector sales and maintenance of helicopters utilizing their air operator certificate in Welisara yesterday.
This is Sri Lanka’s first privately owned fully fledged aerodrome built by the IWS Holdings Group that includes the facilities of landing and parking spaces, line and base maintenance for airbus and Bell helicopters, aircraft on Ground Help Desk (AOG ) support, crew coordination and Air Operators certificate (AOG) 24/7.
The Minister further said it is vital to expand the domestic aviation industry in the country for the benefit of tourists and investors visiting Sri Lanka. It is necessary to construct these types of centers in the country providing line and base maintenance for airbus and Bell helicopters when expanding the domestic aviation sector in Sri Lanka.
During the last few years, domestic flight operations were carried out by the Sri Lanka Air force. But, there are many problems including legal barriers associated with these civil flights operations. Therefore, we are pleased that many private sector companies are coming forward to start and facilitate domestic flights operations in Sri Lanka,” he added.
Development work of the Baticaloa domestic airport is being progressed successfully at present. We hope to create a number of job opportunities for the Baticaloa youth with these developments and construction projects,” he added.
