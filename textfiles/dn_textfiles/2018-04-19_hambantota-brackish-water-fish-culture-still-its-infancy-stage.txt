Hambantota brackish water fish culture still in its infancy stage

As the brackish water fish culture is still in its infancy stage, the entrepreneurs with foresight must think of Hambantota as a potential base to invest in it, a senior fisher folk of Hambantota said.
He said that there is a fair extent of shallow salt water lagoons, estuaries, deep lagoons and tidal mud flats in Hambantota alone. He said that an estimated 6,000 hectares are considered potentially suitable for coastal aqua culture.
The fresh water fish fauna includes around fifty indigenous species and several introduced exotic species such as Chinese carp silver, Big head carp and Tilapia.
The senior folk further says that the consumer response had been a very positive factor that will be most encouraging to those interested in fresh water fish farming.
Meanwhile, under the present regime, top priority is given to aqua culture development. The major areas of development are inland fisheries, fresh water aqua culture and coastal aqua culture, the senior fisher folk said.
Hambantota has four fishing harbours at Tangalle, Hambantiota, Kirinda and Kudawella. Most facilities have been upgraded at these harbours by the previous and the present regimes providing opportunities for the investors.
The Tangalle Regional Fisheries Training Center established in 1973 plays a key role in fishery
development. Courses conducted at the center include Marine engine technical course, Fishing gear technology and Mobile training extension.
Yet another area for investment is the utility of refrigerated and insulated trucks. The fish need transportation from the production area to consumption areas, the senior fisher folk in the district said.
