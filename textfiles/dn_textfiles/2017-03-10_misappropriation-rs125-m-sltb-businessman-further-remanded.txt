Misappropriation of Rs.125 m at SLTB; Businessman further remanded

 
Businessman Nandana Priyantha Perera, a spare parts supplier to Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till March 23 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
Former SLTB Chairman Shashi Welgama who was also arrested in connection with the incident is currently out on bail.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the businessman citing no exceptional circumstances to release him on bail.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Ltd were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud alleged to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs for the SLTB. The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs.40 million and Rs.166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB. The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs.24 million and Rs.101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then chairman of SLTB. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena.
The suspects are charged with offences under the Public Property Act.
