Ensure safety of MPs today - UPFA

UPFA MPs urged the Speaker to ensure the safety of all MPs who attend Parliament today (16) by strengthening security and requested President Maithripala Sirisena to order a thorough investigation into the breach in security inside the Chamber.
State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana was addressing a press conference held at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo yesterday. He said the current Speaker is the most biased Speaker in Sri Lanka’s history.
“Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa acted gentlemanly and respected the President’s executive powers and kept silent when a Prime Minister was appointed while having only 41 seats in Parliament.
Consumer, Cooperative Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister Johnston Fernando said UNP MP Palitha Thevarapperuma wielded a knife and breached security in Parliament. MP Susantha Punchinilame said that it was the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who ended the war and gave life to the people.
“The Speaker said that he does not mind people getting killed in the Parliament and his voice has now been recorded. The voice cut will be handed over to the CID and to any institution in the world to examine and confirm,”.
Attorney Premnath C. Dolawatta said that the conduct of the Speaker is totally illegal. Millions are spent for Parliament proceedings.
“If the President’s gazette notification came to effect from November 9, who takes the responsibility for the funds wasted in holding Parliament proceedings”, he questioned.
