Pay increase for Australian female cricketers

 
Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday (April 5) announced significant pay rise for the leading women cricketers in the country, many of who were part of the team that finished as runners-up in the recently concluded 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20 in India.
The female cricketers will now be able to earn in excess of $100,000 a year, making them the best paid of any women's team sport in Australia, after CA announced the decision to almost double its commitment to Australia's elite female cricketers from $2.36 million to $4.23 million.
The maximum retainers for the team is set to rise from $49,000 to $65,000, and when combined with increased maximum retainers for the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) of $15,000, the base rate for Australia's best female players will amount to $80,000. The match payments and tour fees will ensure earnings in excess of six figures.
Minimum retainers have more than doubled, from $19,000 to $40,000, for the Southern Stars and $3,000 to $7,000 for those featuring in WBBL. And with an increase in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) payments - from $7000 to $11,000 - Australia's best domestic female cricketers will be earning $26,000 a season.
In addition to increased pay packages, CA, in consultation with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) is also providing elite female players with improved travel and accommodation benefits, an updated pregnancy policy, restrictions on weekday hours of domestic team training to support players who are either working or studying and also, reduced commercial restrictions for WNCL and WBBL players.
Above all, the ACA has also committed $500,000, over a period of two years, to cover private health insurance costs for the female stars.
James Sutherland, CEO of CA, said the female cricketers were some of the most successful sportswomen in the country and deserved to be rewarded accordingly. "Cricket is a sport for all Australians and Cricket Australia will continue to invest heavily in the women's game in the coming years," Sutherland said.
"We are determined to make cricket the sport of choice for women in Australia. We have worked constructively with the Australian Cricketers' Association to reach this point and will continue to do so in our ongoing efforts to improve wages and workplace conditions for all elite female cricketers."
CA's National Women's Selection Panel also announced its list of contracted players for the 2016-17 season, which includes World T20 stars like Meg Lanning, Ellyse Perry, Alyssa Healy and Alex Blackwell amongst others. - TOI
