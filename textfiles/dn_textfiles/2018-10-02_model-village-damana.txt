Model village in Damana

Under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, the yahapalana government is committed to providing shelter for all by 2025 through a historical housing development programme, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
Out of a total of six million families in Sri Lanka, 2.5 million families, which is 41 percent of the total number of families, have various housing issues and the present government is dedicated to providing shelter for all the families in Sri Lanka by 2025, the Minister said. He was speaking at the vesting of the 124th model village, ‘Bisowedigama’ in Jayanthipura, Damana, Ampara, in the public recently.
Minister Premadasa charged that the previous regime was very inefficient and wasted public funds on unfruitful projects without even fulfilling the basic needs of the public.
We are planning to establish 2,500 model villages by end 2019. The construction of 1,275 model villages has already begun and we have only 488 more to start. A project to establish 5,000 model villages will also be implemented on January 1, 2020. After that, another project to establish 10,000 model villages covering all the districts of the country will be established, the Minister said
Bisowedigama model village was established under the Community Participatory Housing Development Programme implemented by the National Housing Development Authority under the purview of the Housing and Construction Ministry.
This model village consists of 23 housing units and has been provided with drinking water, electricity, and an internal road system. The investment in these villages is Rs.24.3 million.
