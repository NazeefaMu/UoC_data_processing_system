From the fantastic to the realistic

Title:Channels Volume 23: Journal of the English Cooperative of Sri Lanka
Author:Edited by Gnana Moonesinghe
The Journal of the English Cooperative of Sri Lanka is now on its 23rd issue, and celebrates this milestone with a thrilling anthology mixing short stories, poetry, and essays. As always, this volume too encourages, to quote Gnana Moonesinghe, the editor, "individual writers who enjoy writing, be they novices or experienced writers..." As a writer whose first ever published work appeared in Channels almost two decades ago, it is with immense pleasure that I read this volume, rejoicing in the fact that the journal 'continues to fill the lacunae in the limited space available for writers to publish their creative writing.'
The fiction in Volume 23 ranges far and wide. The anthology opens with Sunila Nanayakkara telling us of the plight of poverty-stricken rural women (End of the Spell,) Samya Senaratne focuses on child abuse (Child's Play) while Kamini Liyanage provides a bleak, heartbreaking portrayal of life after retirement (The Grey Multitude.) Titus de Silva's tale of misunderstanding between lovers (Yes Dear,) and Haseena Iraz's dilemma with the squirrel besotted by the flowers in her garden (The Fiend)are laden with humor while attempting to communicate a deeper message beyond the surface hilarity. Hana Mohamed spins a surreal tale centering around New York city (The Recruit).
Elsewhere, the disabled, (He Published no Book, Rohini Gamage)a single parent (Always, In Always, Venessa Andrea Nugara), an estranged marriage (Kismet, Romola de Mel) run the gamut from the experimental to the fantastic to the deeply realistic.
There are more traditional contributions,too, particularly in the essay category. Vijita Fernando expertly delineates some of the highlights of being a woman and a writer in Sri Lanka. I'm sure all of us who have been touched by their generosity, kindness and enlightening advice will agree with her when she writes; " Creative writing in Sri Lankan women have been greatly encouraged by a number of women who are themselves writers and whose ideas and criticism have influenced many of us writers. Among those the names of Lakshmi de Silva, Yasmine Gooneratne, Neloufer de Mel, Manique Gunasekera, Ranjini Obeysekere come to mind".
Nanda Pethiyagoda-Wanasundera admirably portrays five Sri Lankan women writers "born and bred in Ceylon/Sri Lanka" whose work and personalities, she says, have impacted on her to a great degree; They are Dr. Lakshmi de Silva, Vijita Fernando, Jean Arsanayagam, Madhubashini Ratnayake, and Manuka Wijesignhe. She explains, "Each is different from the other, but a deep sense of Sri Lankaness and pride in being women are discernible in their work and in them."
The two essays are detailed, clearand readable pieces, and their presence next to stories about the grief of losing a pet,(Time to Call it a Day, K.K.S Perera, Morty, Nelani Goonawardena) invigorate both sides of the essay/fiction divide.
The section on poetry provokes readers to new experiences of elucidating opacity, analyzing complexity, and discovering, in the magic of these creations, meanings for themselves. The poems are: Smoked Fruit, Kamini Liyanage, A Monkey's Point of View, Denis De Rosayro, Insanity: A Flair or a Flow, Upeksha Bandara, A Sigiri Damsel Needs Help, Dishani Senaratne, Conflict, Honeida Pakeer, Natami, Sunila Nanayakkara, Judgment, Sanjiva Wijesinha, Chees, M.T.L Ebell, Apology to a Fallen Tree, Punyakante Wijenaike, The Last Crest, A Mortal of a Lesser Kind, A Vine Rediscovered, Sakuntala Sachithanandan, See the Scene at a Colombo Club, Summer Chorus, Nature's Parachutes, Vince (Lochnera) Rosea, Jayanthi Kaththriarachchi, Death of a Renaissance Man, I Once was Blind, Plea to Gara Yaka, Chitra Premaratne Stuiver, and I knew an Escape Route, Basil Fernando. The poems are eloquent, short, clear, and concise.
The structure of the anthology, with fiction, poetry and essay alternating throughout, invites consideration of what journey is taking place in the transition from one to the other-what borderline is crossed in the process, what marks each territory as distinct from the other. With the back and forth, back and forth of this sojourn from the real, to the fake, to the imagined, in this issue of Channels showing us in a remarkably mature and breathtaking style a series of twists and turns in the lives of quite ordinary people - school teachers, poor women, married folks and those courting couples, pensioners, and pet owners,as well as the imagined, Aetos Dios, the Sigiri damsels, the reader receives at all times a glimpse of the varied approaches writers and poets take towards revealing the truth about life, about relationships, about us.
Channels Volume 23 makes for terrific reading for the heart, as well as the soul.
