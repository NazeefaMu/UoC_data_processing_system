Lego Hogwarts Castle is the second biggest Lego set ever

Harry Potter fans have got a lot of saving to do if they’re going to get their hands on what is a truly magical, and gigantic, Lego set.
A few weeks ago, Lego unveiled a new range of Harry Potter sets and figures. They all looked really good, including an impressive Hogwarts Great Hall that recreated the main section of the castle in minifigure scale.
But it turns out that’s child’s play compared to the new set they’ve just announced.
Lego Hogwarts Castle is the second-biggest Lego set ever made, at a staggering 6,020 pieces. That’s still smaller than the Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon but ahead of the 5,923 pieces of the Taj Mahal.
As you can imagine that number of bricks (and having to pay for the Harry Potter licence on top) doesn’t come cheap but if you’ve got a spare £349.99 knocking around then it looks well worth it.
Of course, the ‘real’ Hogwarts Castle is huge, so to ensure you don’t need to buy a new house to display it in everything has been shrunk down to microscale.
That means instead of ordinary minifigures you get 27 non-posable microfigures for characters including Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, and the Dementors.
It’s a trick Lego have used only a few times before, to portray really big vehicles and buildings (the last one was the now retired SHIELD Helicarrier) and as you can see it looks fantastic.
You do still get four regular minifigures anyway, of Hogwarts founders Helga Hufflepuff, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. And on top of that are fantastic beasts such as Aragog the Acromantula and a Hungarian Horntail (aka a dragon).
The castle itself features the Great Hall, Dumbledore’s office, Dolores Umbridge’s classroom, Hagrid’s hut, the Whomping Willow, and a microscale Ford Anglia. The completed castle measures over 22” (58cm) high, 27” (69cm) wide, and 16” (43cm). So, yeah it’s big. It’s also suggested for ‘children’ of 16 years and older, which as usual is secret code for being aimed more at parents than kids.
Hogwarts Castle is set number 71043 will be released from 15th August 2018 on the Lego online store, so you’ve got just enough time to apply for an evening job to pay for it.
