NHDA abandons Ipalogama project, new land sought

Two National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) officials have been interdicted over the destruction of an archaeological site in Ipalogama, Anuradhapura, NHDA Chairman L.S. Palansuriya said.
He said the NHDA Anuradhapura District Manager and a technical officer have been interdicted over the incident as investigations continue.
He said that NHDA takes responsibility over the incident since NHDA officials had failed to act properly and as a result they have been interdicted.
"NHDA immediately conducted an investigation and submitted a report to the Minister in 24 hours. We will take disciplinary action against the officers involved", he said.
Palanasuriya said the NHDA has requested for another land and the housing project will continue.
"We will not stop the housing project. Following the incident, NHDA and the Minister decided not to continue the project on that land. Officials have been instructed to be more careful in such situations", he said.
Palanasuriya noted that the investigations so far has revealed the involvement of another two officers on this matter and added that they will also be interdicted.
Addressing the media yesterday at the NHDA, Colombo, the chairman said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa has appointed an independent committee to investigate the matter. He said that the police is conducting a separate investigation. "Since 2015, NHDA has begun more than 709 housing projects all over the island under the instructions of the Minister, and our target is to complete 2,500 housing projects by end 2019. NHDA is currently working hard to meet the target", he said.
Palanasuriya said that NHDA has no authority over government owned lands and they seek the district office and Divisional Secretariats help to issue appropriate lands to commence the housing projects. Last November, the NHDA Anuradhapura District Manager requested the Ipalogama divisional secretariat to provide a list of 50 families from middle and low income families and a suitable land to commence the housing project.
"We found that the land issued by the divisional secretariat was cleared before the foundation laying ceremony which took place in the beginning of this year. But, the archaeological site adjacent to the land has also been cleared recently using backhoes without the knowledge of NHDA", he said.
He said that since 2015 nearly 50 housing projects commenced in Anuradhapura and they never faced a similar situation before.
