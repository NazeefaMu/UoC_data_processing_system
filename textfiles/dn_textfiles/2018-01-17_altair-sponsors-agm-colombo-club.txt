Altair sponsors AGM of Colombo Club

Altair, Colombo’s most distinctive luxury living marque, was the sponsor of the 146th Annual General Meeting of the Colombo Club, one of the oldest and most exclusive social clubs in Asia. As part of its support to this elegant event, Altair sponsored two Business Class return tickets to Singapore and several other prizes presented to the winners of a raffle draw for members of the club. This was the second consecutive year that Altair was associated with this prestigious organisation as the sponsor of its AGM.
Pictured here are the presentation of the two air tickets by Altair Director Pradeep Moraes and the presentation of the other prizes by Mumtaz Niyasdeen Head of Business Development at Altair.
