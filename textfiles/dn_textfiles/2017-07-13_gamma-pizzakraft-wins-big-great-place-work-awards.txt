Gamma Pizzakraft wins big at Great Place to Work Awards

Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka, the sole franchisee for Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Delifrance in Sri Lanka acquires more additions to its collection of awards and nominations.
The company was awarded, for the fourth time in a short span of impressive years, the title of ‘one of the top 25 best companies to work for in Sri Lanka for the year 2017’.
In addition, it won the Gold Award for ‘Best in Large Sized Enterprise’ for the second consecutive time along with an award for ‘Excellence in People Initiatives’, at an event held recently at The Cinnamon Grand Hotel Colombo.
The Great Place to Work  Institute in conjunction with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and LMD compiles an annual list of ‘Great Places to Work in Sri Lanka’.
The candidates are chosen by the US based The Great Place to Work  Institute which conducts a study ranging over 75 companies across 15 industries, to catalogue a list of 25 organizations who have endeavoured towards providing the best work environments for their staff. 
Kaushal Mendis, Director of Human Resources and Administration said “A company without a motivated and satisfied workforce is a bungling and forsaken shell of what it could be. Therefore, I firmly believe that ensuring the satisfaction and happiness of a workforce is key to running a successful business entity. Consequently, we persistently employ many young people.”
CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka, Yasa Nadaraja went on to say “I am thrilled, honoured and proud at the prospect of our company being placed yet again among the ‘top 25 greatest places to work’ in the country.”
Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka sees good teamwork as a vital and a necessary part of operations. Accordingly, their strategy involves implementing incentives and reward systems for teams as opposed to individuals.
