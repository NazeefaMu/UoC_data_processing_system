Smile from afar

As the most consummate of beings living on mother earth, we have been and owed with a conscience, lingering memories and a heart that beats when out brain tells us the meaning of gratitude and the occasions when we should show our ‘thanks’ or gratitude.
Gratitude will lose its lustre should we abandon and forsake the persons who brought us to this world. Our beloved parents. Unfortunately, many a parent has been left on pavements and close to places of religious worship to be cared for by our feline and canine friends Yes’ our friends of the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder too have expressed their gratitude in no mean measure.
Lion’s paw
A few happenings from history and in the 20th Century. Androcles was a Roman Citizen. He had seen a lion in agony, whilst the former was in the forest. The lion’s paw had been injured by a spike. Swollen, pus dozing. Androcles had bravely and with lots, empathy removed the spike.
Days go by Androcleles is a simple citizen who is brought to the Coliseum to fifth with a lion for the thrill of the Roman citizens and the Emperor. The lion approaches its prey. Suddenly the lion bows to Androcles licks his face and backs away. It was the lion that Androcles had cared for in the forest. The emperor had freed the lion and Androcles. An immortal moment in history showing that gratitude is also amidst the denizens. Then again, King Dutugemunu’s elephant ‘Kadol’ had kept a pebble in its mouth to remember an injustice done to him by one of the very strong warriors. Later, this warrior had shoved the elephant away from a bucketful of “Lodiya” or molten lead was thrown from a battlement during a battle. A grateful elephant had spat out the pebble. Gratitude once again.
Years back a 14-year-old boy had seen a water monitor by a salvinia infested pond near their home. Amidst shouts from his clerics, the boy had walked up to the animal.
On the throes of death
An empty salmon tin had got stuck in its mouth. Head and eyes were swollen. Seemed to be in great pain. On the throes of death.
Then this boy had very gently removed the tin, caressed its head. After a few minutes, it had slithered back into the pond.
Next morning this young person had walked up to the pond. Others had followed. They had seen a ripple and this grateful four-legged reptile had come up to its saviour and had kept on gazing at him for a few minutes. The boy had been in tears. So had all. Believe it or not, this water monitor which had reduced the poultry in this house had never hurt their poultry, kittens and puppies, thereafter.
A dog had fallen into a pond near the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. The usual 4.30 am first bus passengers were gazing at the struggling bloated canine moving in the pond. It’s final stages. Then one of the onlookers had handed over his office bag to his regular morning bus passenger friends and unheeding the advice of all, about the ferocity of a dying animal, had lifted it, placed it on the pavement, massaged its stomach patted it. It had spurted out lots of water. All had boarded the 4.30 but to Colombo. The following morning the fairytale.
All had been amazed to see the rescued dog run up to its saviour, whined wagged its tail. It had been with the hero till he boarded the bus, next our doggie had also boarded the bus. A wonderful set of empathetic humans had brought him down. This had been a regular happening. Our gentle Buddha must have smiled from His abode in the Shrine Room of the Rajamaha Viharaya.
Evolutionary ladder
They were all acts of gratitude shown by our friends of the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder to man the most consummate.
Man’s intelligence makes him show his gratitude in accordance with the favour received. We pray to our celestial teachers in times of need. We make vows. “If you help me, I will do this for You” policy. A bribe I think that we should pray to them in times of reed. When our prayers have been answered we should show our Gratitude.
