Strive for positivity

Head Girl of St. Paul’s Girls School, Milagiriya Kethani Hettiarachchi has a pragmatic approach to life. Perfect Prefects features Hettiarachchi who thinks hard before committing herself to anything and believes in loving oneself.
Thinking hard and as hard as possible has brought her positive results. Too often we have seen the young come to grief because they simply do not think hard. Thinking hard is behind most situations in life. Thinking is the main idea here.
“One problem I see is that the youth are getting distracted, even getting into drugs. They need to focus on their studies when they are students. They need to appreciate what their parents are doing for them. They have a duty towards their parents. Before committing yourself to something you need to think deep and hard. If you do something and if you do it well then you can succeed. I also feel that you should love yourself and be true to yourself. Do not live to please anyone. Control your life and don’t give others a reason to control your life. Our generation can make a difference in this world,” said Hettiarachchi.
Beyond control
Hettiarachchi has both feet on the ground and is level-headed. Tomorrow will bring its own troubles she says.
“My secret to success as a Head Girl is that I live in the present and I do not trouble my head about things beyond my control or things that may occur in the future. I will deal with the problems when and if it happens. If I can bring happiness to my parents then I am satisfied. I have no huge targets in my life, I am content and I will do things step by step and not think too deeply about anything,” stated Hettiarachchi.
There is an old biblical saying – Remove the log in your eye before trying to take a speck out of your brother’s eye.
“In the societies we live in, there is so much recrimination going around without any positivity at all. There is so much arguing and quarrelling between people. I think first of all we must focus on our own characters and be the change we want to see in this world and work for the improvement of our country. If you can develop your character without constantly finding fault with others, I think that would be in the best interests of everyone. That would make a far better society,” pointed out Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi is never alone. She has a huge support system. She never feels abandoned, always having help. Her Principal, parents and friends are there for her. With their guidance, they are the wind beneath her wings.
Role model
“In my life, I must say that my biggest role model is my loving mother and at school, my biggest role model is my Principal. My parents are there for me whenever I need to talk to them. So I feel no such great pressure. At the morning assemblies, our Principal provides wonderful guidance and advice. She inspires us by talking about the lives of great and noble leaders like Nelson Mandela and encourages us to read up on them and learn from them. We are fortunate to be led by a person such as our principal, who truly cares about us and who gives our well-being top priority. She is one of the most committed people I know. I am very proud to be a student at St. Paul’s Milagiriya, it is a school that provides its students with a holistic education and a school that has nurtured students, enabling them to achieve many milestones. The students are educated and have excelled in many spheres such as the academic sphere,” added Hettiarachchi.
Obama and the Queen of England have a certain charisma that endears them to so many.
“I admire Barack Obama a lot because he had to face a lot of criticism from many people but I think he achieved something significant. I also admire the Queen of England because she is able to get along with anyone,” said Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi would like to be remembered as someone who touched the lives of those who she came into contact with.
“It would be nice if I could be remembered as someone who did something positive and leave behind something because my badge is not forever. If I can see a tear in my parents’ eyes when people speak good of me, then I feel that I have done well. I would like to be known as a person who had good qualities,” explained Hettiarachchi.
Horrific stories
Hettiarachchi feels that it is sad that there is so much mindless violence in society.
“Today we see many horrific stories on the news. We see so many tragedies. It is a constant repetition of tragedy every day. It has come to a point where it is unwatchable with stories of rape and murder. We cannot be proud of what we see on TV. Because during my younger days the news was all about the Civil War. So there is not much of a difference but it is something that needs to be addressed. We need to see a positive difference in society. We need to strive towards that,” said Hettiarachchi.
However, in the midst of all this sadness, there are times of great joy and pride.
“When we won the World Cup in 1996, our Sri Lankan Cricketers made me very proud and to this day I remember that. I remember the euphoria very well and the passion that went with it. I also love music because it is a global language and who doesn’t love music? It is appreciated by people in all cultures, all backgrounds and all walks of life and music unites us all,” explained Hettiarachchi.
