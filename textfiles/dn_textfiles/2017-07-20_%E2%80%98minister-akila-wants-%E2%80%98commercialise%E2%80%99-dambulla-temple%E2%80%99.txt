‘Minister Akila wants to ‘commercialise’ Dambulla Temple’

The Movement to Protect historical Dambulla Cave Temple yesterday said Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has not given up his attempt to ‘commercialise’ Dambulla Historical Cave Temple.
Addressing a press conference in Dambulla, Movement Chief Organiser Upali Ranjith said the minister wants to convert this historical place of worship into a money spinning commercial entity.
“This will lead to a rift within the Maha Sangha,” he said.
Ranjith added that this temple was offered to the Maha Sangha by King Walagambaha for the well-being of the Buddha Sasana.
He added that nobody obstructed the construction activities at the historical cave temple. Ranjith said the Archaeological Department has to take the responsibility of any damages to the artefacts and archaeological items at the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya.
He also said the movement was established to protect the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya and other Buddhist heritage sites in Dambulla.
