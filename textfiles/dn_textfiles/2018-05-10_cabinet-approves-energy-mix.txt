CABINET APPROVES ENERGY MIX

The Cabinet yesterday approved a policy paper on the Sri Lanka energy generation, bringing an end to the hotly contested Sri Lanka’s energy generation mix.
Officials said this will pave way for a swift approval of the impending Longterm Generation Plan.
Reliable sources at the Ceylon Electricity Board told the Daily News that the Cabinet had approved a policy paper detailing that Sri Lanka’s power generation be a mix of thermal, Liquefied Natural Gas and heavy hydro’s.
“The policy calls for 30 percent of the generation to be thermal, another 30 percent which can be LNG, 25 percent to be heavy hydro and the remaining 15 percent to be fuel based (by products),” sources told the Daily News. “The Cabinet has no jurisdiction to approve the Longterm Generation Plan put forward by the CEB. It is up to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.”
Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers’ Union who had been engaged in a work-to-rule campaign, said it is now up to the PUCSL to act fast on the Long Term Generation Plan since the Cabinet has already signified their approval of Sri Lanka’s Energy Policy.
Unionist member Athula Wanniarachchi said the meeting at PUCSL which saw the participation of the CEB General Manager and the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary ended inconclusively. “We will strike until the generation plan put forward by the CEB is approved.”
