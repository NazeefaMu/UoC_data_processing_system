FCID seeks AG’s advice on Karuna Amman

 
The FCID informed Court today that they have sought Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action to be taken against former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman. 
Karuna Amman is alleged to have misused a bulletproof, armed vehicle belonging to the Presidential Secretariat, worth Rs.90 million.
The FCID allege the suspect had purposefully ignored his duty to hand over the vehicle belonging to the Presidential Secretariat, after losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The suspect was arrested on November 2016, under the Public Property Act.
He is currently out on bail. Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara in the meanwhile, decided to relax bail conditions imposed on the former Deputy Minister and permit him to appear before the CID every last Sunday of the month instead of every Sunday.
