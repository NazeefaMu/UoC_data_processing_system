Uva Chief Minister  to last PC term

Uva Province Chairman A.M. Buddhadasa said Chief Minister Chamara Sampath will be in the post until the term of the Provincial Council ends on September 8.
Responding to a question raised by United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) provincial councillor Kudabandara Medawela, Chairman Buddhadasa said the present Chief Minister will be in the post until the council term ends.
UPFA councillor Vimal Galagamaarachchi said there will not be a power shift since the UPFA has obtained over 70,000 majority votes at the last Provincial Council election.
