CameraLK to launch Sony a7R III

One of the largest independent retailers of photographic and digital equipment in Sri Lanka, CameraLK, would launch the Sony aa7R III camera to the Sri Lankan market on Tuesday (16), during a ceremony at the Galle Face Hotel.
According to CameraLK Founder and Manging Director Anushka Gunasinghe, the Sony aa7R III is a full-frame, mirror-less camera. The Sony aa7R III is a successor to the aa7R II that was launched in 2015. The sensor used in the Sony aa7R III is a 42.2 MP BSI CMOS sensor, with front-end LST. Guanasinghe said his company was always trying to introduce the latest technology to the Sri Lankan market, and the launch of Sony aa7R III is an effort in this direction.
Gunasinghe added that his company started off as a small home business in 2010.
In fact, the company, according to him, started with chess clubs. Gunasinghe, who dropped out of his higher studies early from an IT education institution, started several chess clubs for youngsters due to his love for the game.
Photography, according to Gunasinghe, was his hobby, as several members of his family were interested in the subject.
Later, Gunasinghe used his chess clubs not only to teach youngsters the game, but also teach them about cameras and photography.
Today, Gunasinghe said his company has evolved to meet customer demands head-on and has been recognized in the local industry, as a source for the best and newest products.
CameraLK is one of the first companies to establish an equipment rental service, which doubles as an entity that provides customers with product experience and pre-purchase.
