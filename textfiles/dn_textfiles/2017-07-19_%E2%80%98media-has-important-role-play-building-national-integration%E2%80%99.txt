‘Media has important role to play in building national integration’

The media has an important and strategic role to play in building national integration and peace building, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said.
He was addressing a workshop for journalists organised by the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena recently.
Three sensitization workshops were organised in the Colombo, Kandy, and Kurunegala Districts to advocate reconciliation friendly media to journalists by the Ministry and over 150 journalists discussed the Role of Media in conflict transformation, reconciliation, and peace building at the workshops. The Ministry under the direction of President Maithiripala Sirisena has developed a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) and reconciliation friendly media has been identified as an important initiative.
The discussions by the journalists highlighted that based on the international experiences in Kenya the media spread hate messages which created atrocities and led to genocides in early 1990s. Subsequently, the Kenyan government established a team to monitor hate-speeches on social media. Such conflict Barometers with number of high-intensity conflicts helped track the progress on peace building which helps journalists to report on the peace status of the country.
The media influences on shaping perceptions, condition behaviour and impacts the minds, attitudes, emotions of readers and community at large. The journalists at the discussion pointed out that the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity be respected while fair and non-discriminatory reporting is a prime responsibility of them. Journalists are “truth tellers” but the media has a moral responsibility to promote reconciliation. Discipline in reporting on conflict related issues were considered as important by many professionals. The workshop discussed that conflict sensitive journalism focuses on democratic, pluralistic and just society. The peace journalism is where editors and reporters make choices about what to report and how to report - to create opportunities to value non-violent responses to conflict. The discussions highlighted that Peace Journalism is seen as a special mode of socially responsible journalism which contributes to peaceful settlement of conflicts. Journalists can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The role of Journalists as a neutral disseminator be objective, impartial, integrity, ensure fairness, and balance in reporting. Journalists openly discussed that their professionalism gets eroded due to personal emotions, interest, prejudices, audience preference, lack of ethics, concern for being overly market oriented or economic oriented, influenced by negativism or influenced by elite groups or one-sidedness or socially irresponsiveness and failure to look at diverse perspective. The Journalists concluded the careful presentation of facts, reliable and varied sources, expert’s opinions, supporting documents, accurate quotations and fair representation of major view points are vital for a balanced journalism. The media helps to create political setting, policy setting and public opinion which help to bridge gap between perpetrators of conflict and victims.
The sensitization workshop concluded that the journalist's professional responsibility of independence, objectivity, impartiality and truth telling and fairness are fundamental while the social responsibility and public interest demands peace journalism and reconciliation friendly media that focuses on journalists being a part of the solution to the problem and help build sustainable peace, harmony and national integration and reconciliation, V. Sivagnanasothy, said.
