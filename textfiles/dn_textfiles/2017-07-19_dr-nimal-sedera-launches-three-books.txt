Dr Nimal Sedera launches three books

The launch of Dr Nimal Sedera’s three books was held in Kandy recently amidst a large gathering at the E L Senanayake library under the patronage of Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Eakanayake. Uhulana Derana Amma, Gihigedara Kahavanu and Thewatte Rajjuruvo were the three books launched at the event.
Gihigedara Kahavanu was reviewed by the Vidyayathana Pirivena Chief Prelate. The book Uhulanana Derana Amma was discussed by Professor Indra Keerthi Siriweera who said that it was a unique life story of Dr Nimal Sedera’s living mother Udulawathie Sedera. Dr Edwin Ariyadasa, reviewing the book Thewatte Rajjuruwo, said that there is no other novel of this nature in the Sinhala literature that has been written on the history of the tea plantation of the nation of Sri Lanka.
The event has several features of entertainment and at the end the chanting of seth pirith blessing the country.
The Chief Minister commended the arrangements of the event and said that this event is an example to others. ”I am so much inspired that I too would like to sing,” he said singing a portion of a song.
