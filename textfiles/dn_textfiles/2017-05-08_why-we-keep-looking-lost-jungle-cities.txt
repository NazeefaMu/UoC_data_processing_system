Why we keep looking for lost jungle cities

Dry, desolate landscapes tend to preserve any evidence of human passage—they cling to artifacts like precious memories. A Tyrolean glacier hugged the 5,300-year-old iceman to its breast. The desert helped the ancient Egyptians launch their earthly vessels into eternity. More recently, Antarctica has joined in. The frozen continent recently coughed up a 104-year-old biscuit left by an expedition of Ernest Shackleton’s—in pristine, “perfectly nutritious” state.
The jungle, though, does not take naturally to cultural preservation. The obscuring overgrowth never stops; the landscape digests all. Excavating a 5-year-old site, let alone a 500-year-old one, can be like sifting through a well-advanced compost pile in search of something edible. And yet, we try—especially when inspired by a figure as captivating as Colonel Percy Fawcett.
Fawcett was an intrepid British explorer who disappeared in the Brazilian Amazon in 1925, presumably killed by Indians. He’s the subject of a new biopic, The Lost City of Z, an adaptation of David Grann’s 2009 book of the same name. The Amazon’s greatest cover-up, Fawcett believed, was an utterly forgotten civilization named Z. He aimed, in his quasi-invincible, slightly nutty way, to find it.

Plenty of “Fawcett freaks” have emerged in recent decades, taking the explorer’s mad quest as a starting point for their own, and archivists and other gatekeepers have learned to be wary of them. Grann knew all about the Fawcett bug; he just didn’t expect to catch it. Having recently torn through The Lost City of Z and James Gray’s new film, I’m feeling a bit exposed to the contagion myself.
Fawcett was both a product of his moment—a twilight era for old-school explorers, but a new day of technological possibilities—and a rebel against it. The film paints his iconoclasm in rather broad strokes. Yes, he was more open-minded about indigenous Amazonians than many of his contemporaries, but as Grann points out, his racial attitudes were a tangle of conflicting inputs. He absorbed the “diffusionist” thinking of the era, which glamorized the exotic whereabouts of the lost tribes of Israel and not, say, the intricacies of indigenous cosmology. Fawcett divided Amazon Indians into three “kinds,” two of which he did not consider very interesting. Those capable of building Z he placed in the third group. They were of “civilized origin” and (surprise, surprise) fairer skinned than the others.
It’s easy to bash colonial explorers, and it’s undeniable that their high-profile displays of stamina and courage—what the Victorians called “bottom”—served a racist imperialism. Even so, there’s something transfixing about Fawcett, who “ventured into uncharted realms with little more than a machete, a compass, and an almost divine sense of purpose,” marvels Grann, and benefited from an uncanny resistance to tropical disease. His fortitude, documented by an admiring press, challenged late-imperial anxieties that British men were getting soft.
It’s also pretty clear he had a nasty side—he was quick to abandon anyone who slowed him down in the jungle—but the filmmakers play up his virtues. He approached hostile tribes with his hands in the air, sometimes singing or playing music, a technique that became the stuff of legend. He made his men commit never to use their firearms against Indians. While his peers at the Royal Geographical Society judged these radical departures to be suicidal, the methods served his purposes well, and he seems in retrospect to have helped establish some healthy norms for the emerging field of anthropology.
Fawcett’s geographic pursuits overlapped with his interest in the spiritualism that gained traction in Britain during his young adulthood. He attended séances and contributed to a journal called The Occult Review.
