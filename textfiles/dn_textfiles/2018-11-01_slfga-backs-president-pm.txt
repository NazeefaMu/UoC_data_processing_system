SLFGA backs President, PM

The Sri Lanka Freedom Graduates Association (SLFGA) pledges full support to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, media secretary of the SLFGA Piyal Darshana Guruge said yesterday.
He said they will make sure that all unemployed graduates will be given government job opportunities without taking party politics into consideration. The SLFGA will stand as one team under the blessings of both the President and the Prime Minister.
Guruge said they met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday and the President explained to them the recent political developments and the reasons that led him to take these decisions. Guruge said the new political development is for the betterment of the country. “We are planning to work with all our old friends and all factions as one. We will support both the President and the Prime Minister at the next general election.”
“We continuously reported to President Sirisena and the former Prime Minister about the discrepancies in the recent graduate recruitments. Most of these recruitments were politically biased. Though we reported this, nothing happened. Now with these developments, we will be able to provide government employment opportunities to all the unemployed graduates without favouring any party.”
