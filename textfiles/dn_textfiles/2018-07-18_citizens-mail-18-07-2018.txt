Response to Dr. Asoka Thenuwara
Life and suffering in another realm
Dr. Asoka Thenuwara has commented on my recent letter and says that the solace to either form of suffering does not lie in the external world. But my contention now after reading all the letters on this subject is that the main cause and source of man’s suffering is the man himself. Three-fourths of man’s suffering is ‘man-made’. Therefore if the man is controlled man’s suffering will come down drastically.
Causes for man’s sufferings like a disease, poverty, bad luck, cancer, failures cannot be controlled and there is no alternative but to live with it. This part of suffering can be due to Karma.
In the Middle East crimes like murder, assault, theft, are not heard of due to severe punishments and strict enforcement of the law. If the same thing is done in Sri Lanka all sorts of crimes and offences can be eradicated. Man’s suffering is caused by jealousy, negligence, injustice, robbery, theft, murder, dishonesty etc. committed by the man himself.
In good faith, Dr. Asoka Thenuwara recommends ‘Universal Consciousness’ as a means of understanding life which can be achieved through deep meditation. He advises me to find the Heaven within me. This means Heaven is intangible and mere imaginary, a state of mind.
No one in the whole world knows where heaven is located whether between Mars and Saturn although we have been talking about it daily over 2000 years. Only one out of a thousand will have the freedom and peace of mind like Dr. Thenuwara to meditate to that extent as most of us are burdened with day-to-day problems.
It is always better to prevent it before happening instead of waiting until it happens to accommodate it through Universal Consciousness, which is hard to achieve.
Sri Lanka is a country where the day starts with the preaching of Bana and closing with one murder, one rape and a classic robbery. Religion alone cannot control man. Adequate punishment should be imposed.
Killing a man is as simple as cutting down a tree. A man is killed for simple reasons like jealousy, non-payment of loan, robbery, revenge, political grudges, personal hatred etc due to the inadequacy of punishment. What is more practical is to control the man which should be done by law enforcing authorities.
