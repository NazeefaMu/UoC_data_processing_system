Bridge damaged due to garbage slides

Residents of lower Ambalawa village belonging to nine families have lost access to their village since the bridge across Ginihinna Ela has been completely damaged due to constant landslides from the Ambuluwawa garbage mountain caused by heavy rains on October 28 and 29.
The residents had built the bridge at a cost of Rs. 500,000 using voluntary labour to gain easy access to their homes. People including schoolchildren in the village now have to wade through Ginihinna Ela to attend to their daily chores.
