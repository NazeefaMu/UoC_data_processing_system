‘Stern disciplinary action against UNP members voting for NCM’

The UNP will take stern disciplinary measures against the UNP members who will vote with the No Confidence Motion (NCM) that would be moved by the Joint Opposition against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the whole government on April 4, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said.
He made this observation during a press conference held at the UNP Party headquarters 'Siri Kotha.
He said the UNP Working Committee has reached decision to defeat the NCM, so those who acted against the decision would have to face disciplinary action.
The State Minister further said that so far it is not reported that the SLFP and the UPFA had reached such a decision.
