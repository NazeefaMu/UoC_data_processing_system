Calibrated connection

Prove me wrong if you wish, but I believe one of the first seeds of feminism which has today morphed into the #MeToo Movement were planted in Edith Wharton’s 1920 novel – ‘The Age of Innocence.’ The book also happens to be the first novel written by a woman to win the Pulitzer Prize.
The story unfolds through the eyes of Newland Archer, a young lawyer belonging to the upper circles of 1870’s New York. He is engaged to be married to shy, lovely, cloistered May Weldon. He believes he loves May as much as a man can and that it is not an arranged marriage when in truth it is a calibrated connection between two of the oldest and wealthiest families in New York.
When the narrative begins, the upper crust of the city is at the theatre where the actress sings in keeping with the hypocrisy of the audience,
“M’ama!” and not “he loves me,” since an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences.”
In the middle of this performance arrives May’s newly returned cousin from Europe, Countess Ellen Volenska scandalously separated from her European husband, a Polish count. Archer observes how the gentlemen who are discreetly watching the ladies through the eye-glasses raise their eyebrows and turn their lips down when they see her. In traditional New York it is not the custom for a woman to flee from her husband or be seen in public so soon after her fall from grace, smiling and looking so normal as if she had done nothing that’s out of place.
In Ellen, we see the makings of the radical, independent New Woman who challenges social conventions. It is true that Edith Wharton wrote The Age of Innocence in the third person, and that her focus was Archer – and that what we see of Ellen is entirely through his perhaps not altogether reliable perception of her. The picture, therefore, might not be entirely accurate but it is enough to make us realize that Ellen is exotic, and immensely brave - brave enough to leave her unfaithful husband and return home to her grandmother in search of freedom and ‘everything that’s good.’ She is not worried or scared of conventions and would have gone through a divorce in spite of all the horrors attached to it if Archer had not persuaded her to do otherwise. She is surprised that the members of her family rise up as one to denounce her intention to divorce the count. Nobody denies that the count has treated her badly but, as Newland explains, “Our legislation favors divorce, but our customs don’t.” Especially if you are a woman the publicity could be horrible. For in this Gilded Age, people are allowed to behave abominably as long as they don’t allow it to become public knowledge. Ellen consents not to file for divorce for her families sake, but cries in agony over their hypocrisy: “The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!”
She loves art immensely and loves to be with artists and is Archer’s intellectual equal but tries hard to toe the line and be like everyone else in New York. However, as Archer observes, like the yellow roses he sends her there is something too rich, too strong, in her fiery beauty. She is too free spirited, spontaneous and kind and so, she would always be different. At the party given in her honour by the Van der Luydens, Countess Volenska is seen conversing with the Duke. Then she leaves him and walks across the room to sit next to Archer. She does not seem to care that in traditional New York it was not the custom for a woman to leave the side of one gentleman to seek the company of another. She is honest in her remarks and tells Archer the Duke is the most boring man she has ever met, and she is honest in her feelings – she generously throws her own coat over her maid when she sends Nastashiya out onto the cold winter evening on an errand. An act Archer observes any other lady in his circle would have considered as improper.
It is natural then that Archer who might be an avatar of the HeForShe movement finds himself falling deeply in love with Ellen. Archer believes “Women ought to be free - as free as we are.” He dismisses rumours about Ellen’s past considering the fact that most of the men he knows, including himself cannot boast of immaculate behaviour, either. He is broadminded enough to see “the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyed and pitied.” And does not agree with “The belief that when “such things happened” it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always criminal of the woman.”
Archer wishes, at first to break off the engagement with May, but is persuaded by circumstances of his own making as well as Ellen’s insistence to return to his betrothed and marry May. After his marriage he hopes to liberate May and open up the world of art and literature to her perhaps with the secret hope of turning her into another Ellen but realizes with dismay that “There’s no point in liberating someone who doesn’t realize she is not free.”
When he realizes he can no longer survive as May’s husband in the predictable, often hypocritical rituals of society, and finds himself increasingly drawn to the kind of life that accepts spontaneity and acts on feelings without regard to form, a world to which Ellen has the key, he makes up his mind to go to her. But the tribe moves in, rallying around the seemingly guileless May and successfully schemes to get Ellen away from his life.
And so, Newland Archer gives up his dreams of a life of freedom with Ellen Volenska, chooses to be trapped by duty: He becomes “the man who married one woman because another one told him to,”
remains a faithful husband and a good father to his three children. It is ironic that by the time Archer’s son, Ted is old enough to be married the strict conventional codes that imprisoned him have melted away in the same way snow on the sidewalks of New York, melts in spring. Ted is marrying a girl whose father was a scoundrel and a cast-off but no one cares anymore about family history or keeping an immaculate family line.
By the time the book ends The Age of Innocence seems to have come to an end. Albeit temporarily.
For as long as we remain victims of civilization and are homesick for the unexplored there will always be Ellen Volenskas and Newland Archers in our midst.
