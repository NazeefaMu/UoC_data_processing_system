Impact of UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka

Continued from yesterday
It is trite law that a sovereign State has complete control over its territory and population as well as control of movement across its borders as long as other Sovereign States grant formal recognition to that State.
However, the international polity consisting of other sovereign States and the UN as a whole could, and obviously should, intervene where gross violations including loss of human lives are being caused by unlawful or excessive domestic State action. This unfortunately has too often proved to be a proclaimed objective of totally unjustifiable intervention and inroads into the sovereignty of a State.
Evidence on which UN High Commissioner bases findings
The Report of the UN High Commissioner states that it should be read in conjunction with the oral update on June 29, 2016, the comprehensive report of the High Commissioner and the detailed findings of the OCHR investigation.
This Report (A/CHRC/30/CRP2) which runs into 261 pages contains 32 pages of findings and 16 paragraphs of conclusions and recommendations. It is not practical to deal with the finding in this presentation and I do not attempt to do so. Perhaps paragraph 169 which sets out the recommendations would of relevance.
It is relevant to note that the OCHR ‘investigation’ is subject to reservations contained within the report, such as in [par 5] “…It is important at the outset to stress that the OISL conducted a human rights investigation, not a criminal investigation. The time frame covered by the investigation, the extent of the violations, the large amount of available information, as well as the constraints to the investigation, including lack of access to Sri Lanka and witness protection concerns posed enormous challenges.”
This reservation is expressed again in par 153 quoting lack of adequate time as one of the reasons. Whatever the reason, evidence of an issue of such significance to a Member State needs to have been subjected to close and careful evaluation.
Recommendations
The recommendations include requests of an advisory nature for implementation by the GOSL and can roughly be divided into protection of the community from violations by investigation and punishment of transgressions and the restoration of civilian normalcy and reformation of the justice system.
There can be no doubt that investigation, trial and punishment according to due processes of law for offences of causing enforced disappearances, extra judicial executions, sexual violence, and recruitment of children into armed conflict is the duty of any civilized government and calling upon the GOSL in specific terms to perform this duty is unhelpfully obnoxious.
However, taking the recommendation in proper spirit, the GOSL should ensure the preservation of evidence, protection of witnesses, judges, prosecutors, investigators and ancillary staff, listing of persons in detention and the criminalization of war crimes and genocide.
The GOSL is also called upon to release the reports of the Commissions of Inquiry and Military Courts of Inquiry. It is not clear whether the laws in operation permit the publication of all the proceedings of a Military Court.
A further step recommended is the establishment of a comprehensive transitional justice policy for addressing the human rights violations of the past 30 years and preventing their recurrence. The term 'Transitional Justice' has the unfortunate connotation of emerging from a dictatorial regime or the reparation for war crimes.
No doubt a credible investigation into the violations of human rights during the preceding thirty years can and should be undertaken.
The GOSL has mechanisms evolved over the past, such as Criminal Justice Commissions [with powers of imprisonment] and Presidential Commissions of Inquiry to examine evidence for reliability and where there is prima facie evidence of criminal offences to place such material for trial and punishment. The Commissions had the power to instruct investigations, seconding trained investigators to carry out their investigative functions under the supervision of the Commissions. The Commissions could, and did, employ Special Prosecutors who along with Counsel from the Attorney General’s Department examined witnesses and made legal submissions. Persons who were considered to be ‘interest’ to an allegation, could and did retain Counsel who cross-examined witnesses and made submissions in defence of their clients.
In the circumstances, the recommendation to establish an ad hoc hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, with a specific mandate appears unwarranted. There obviously cannot be any objection to Counsel being permitted to ‘watch the interests’ any party or to participate as observers to the Court proceedings.
What is meant by an ad hoc hybrid court
The UN High Commissioner contemplated a “special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors and investigators, with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and prosecuting body, defence office, witnesses and victims’ protection programme.
Such Courts have functioned to try Nazi War Criminals, [The Nuremberg trials] and evolved to try offences such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as the Special Panel in Dili, Siera Leone and Cambodia. The Courts were occasioned by particular situations caused by singular political and historical situations.
The High Commissioner has not chosen to disclose why such an ad hoc hybrid court was required. Nor has the High Commissioner chosen to indicate the level of seniority or expertise of the international judges, prosecutors or investigators. It is noteworthy that a large number of Sri Lankan Judges have served on International panels and have done so with acknowledged distinction.
Some of the recommendations cover an area of human reparation, such as the development of a national reparations policy in consultation with victims and their families, considering the specific needs of each victims, including women and children and finance appropriately from the state budget and to strengthen programmes of psychosocial support for all victims of the conflict.
Thirdly, an area of determining the whereabouts of missing persons is to be achieved by a comprehensive mapping of all pending criminal investigations, habeas corpus, and fundamental rights petitions and all of the cases submitted to the Disappearance Investigation Unit and the Missing Persons Unit by the Zonal and All-Island Commissions and the current status of over 11,000 individuals known to be linked to the LTTE and reported to have been registered and rehabilitated.
It is requested that where necessary, to amend legislation to ensure that those who have received death certificates for the missing are not prevented from pursuing judicial cases to determine what happened to their loved ones;
Fourthly, recognizing the right to know the results of all cases related to serious human rights violations, as well as the findings of all Commissions of Inquiries where they have identified specific cases, and refer these cases to the special court upon its establishment;
Under this category, the GOSL is called upon to initiate prosecutions in all cases in which the Presidential Commission to Investigate Complaints Regarding Missing Persons has identified perpetrators and prima facie evidence and to review all cases of detainees held under the PTA and either release them or immediately bring them to trial. The GOSL is also requested to review the cases of those convicted under the PTA and serving long sentences, particularly where convictions were based on confessions extracted under torture;
On the political front, the GOSL is requested to provide durable solutions for old and new displaced populations through land restitution, resettlement and livelihood support, and to the military for civilian activities. Prioritize the return of private land which has been occupied by the military and end military involvement in civilian activities;
The GOSL is requested to reform the judicial system by strengthening the Human Rights Commission’s independence and its capacity to refer cases to the courts, and to seek a review of the Supreme Court decision in the Singarasa case to affirm the applicability of international human rights treaties in domestic law and reinstate the competence of the UN Human Rights Committee to consider individual complaints;
The Resolution has exceeded its mandate when it calls upon a Sovereign Member to ratify an International Convention [in this case the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances or the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]
It also appears that the UNHRC has exceeded its mandate when it calls upon the GOSL to ensure that the Constitutional Council is fully operational as soon as possible, so that it can appoint qualified new members of the utmost independence and integrity to key institutions such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka;
The GOSL is requested to issue clear, public and unequivocal instructions to all branches of the military and security forces that torture, rape, sexual violence and other human rights violations are prohibited and that those responsible, either directly or as commander or superior, will be investigated and punished. This is a helpful recommendation. Subject to due process, anyone suspected of being involved in such acts should be immediately suspended until an effective investigation has been completed.
Order and end to all surveillance, harassment and reprisals against civil society actors, human rights defenders and journalists, and to prepare an overall plan for security sector reform to ensure the civilian nature, independence and professionalism of the law and order forces, and reducing the role of the military in internal security matters;
Clarify the roles and chain of command for all branches of the security forces, including the different intelligence services, the CID and the TID.
Develop a fully-fledged vetting process respecting due process to remove from office military and security force personnel and any other public official where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they were involved in human rights violations;
Ensure that no member of the Sri Lankan security forces is sent on a UN peacekeeping without vetting to establish that the individual, including commanders, have not in any way been involved in human rights violations or criminal acts. Any allegations of abuses by Sri Lankan peacekeepers while on peacekeeping duties must be fully investigated by the authorities;
Take immediate steps to identify and disarm groups affiliated with political parties and sever their linkages with security forces, intelligence services and other Government authorities;
The recommendation to invite the OHCHR to establish a full-fledged country presence to monitor the human rights situation, advise on implementation of the High Commissioner’s recommendations and of all HRC resolutions, and provide technical assistance; and to ensure full cooperation with the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and to Invite the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial killings and torture, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and other relevant Special Rapporteurs is clearly a matter for the GOSL to determine at its discretion.
What does the UN expect the GOSL to do?
Prepare the foundation for a just and equitable society in which the entire population can enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the sphere of civil and political rights.
The achievement of this objective involves the identification of grievances both, real and perceived with a view to making reparation and avoiding future conflict. The first step would be:
1. To call for statements from persons guaranteed protection or permitted to testify through video link from undisclosed locations.
2. Have the information checked by experienced investigators, adopting such technical investigative tools or procedures approved by law.
3. To place the material before experienced prosecutors who could assess their credibility at the level of satisfaction prima facie.
4. Frame charges against those who appear responsible for criminally punishable human rights violations.
5. Place the material before a panel of persons who have the capacity under the relevant laws in Sri Lanka to exercise judicial power, for trial according to due process and punishment, if found guilty.
The second step would be to restore normalcy in the day to day civilian life with gradual demilitarising and withdrawal of the armed forces. Obviously, a step to be taken with the concern for the protection of the society from unlawful violence.
While these processes are on-going measures to ameliorate the trauma undergone during the conflict and to provide closure for families of missing persons would prevent the festering of unresolved grievances that constitute the feed bed for unlawful violence.
