Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort hosts globally celebrated golf architect

Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa recently welcomed Rodney Wright, the globally celebrated golf architect who designed the 18-hole course. Wright visited the resort to share his expertise with the resort team, review the golf course and celebrate the accreditation of the course as it has recently been USGA (United States Golf Association) Course Rated and Slope Rated.
Rodney Wright is a firm believer in integrating the culture and environment of the surrounding area into a golf course. His goal is to design a course that people walk away from, but remember every hole. With more than 40 years of experience designing award winning golf courses worldwide, he takes pride in creating unique and memorable golf courses.
Rodney Wright commented: “My inspiration in Hambantota came from the unique settings of this former coconut plantation which gave us the opportunity to create a sense of place on the golf course and work with the coconut plantation grid to create a golf course which has a unique and distinctive character. This is one of the most unique golf courses I have designed; it has a great variety of golf holes, it is a place that you can come to have a fun round of golf, and enjoy the day in scenic settings.”
The beautifully-landscaped par-70 golf course at Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa offers three zones, each with its own unique character.
The course development was approached from an eco-perspective, due to the resort’s dedication to biodiversity and habitat protection. The structure has revitalised an abandoned sapphire mine, restored vegetation, re-introduced birdlife and uses Paspalum grass for its salt-tolerant turf, which is resilient in the tropical climate and allows for the highest standards of course conditioning.
The golf membership at Shangri-La’s Hambantota Golf Resort & Spa provides all the amenities you would expect from a world-class golf club, with different categories of membership to suit golfers’ preferences and special benefits at the resort.
Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts currently operates over 100 hotels with a room inventory of over 41,000. Shangri-La hotels are five-star deluxe properties featuring extensive luxury facilities and services.
