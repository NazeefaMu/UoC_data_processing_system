Flooding at pumping stations could cause water scarcity

A shortage of water supply is a possibility due to water pumping stations being affected by floods, it was reported.
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board Area Engineer M. K. Lesti said the Wakwella water pumping station is currently at a risk of being affected by the rising water level.
“If the water level rises by two feet, we will have to deactivate and remove the electronic panels in the supply control system,” Lesti added. “We cannot allow these panels to be damaged by water. If they are damaged, water supply will be disrupted for a very long time,” he said. “All areas from Ahangama to Hikkaduwa will not receive water for the next two to three days if we are to shut down the panels and remove the water pumps,” Galle Area Engineer Lesti pointed out. The current volume of stored water at Wakwella is about 20,000 cubic metres, which would be sufficient only for about three hours, he added.
“However, we will keep supplying water to hospitals. If the water level goes down, we will be able to supply water without interruption,” Lesti also said.
