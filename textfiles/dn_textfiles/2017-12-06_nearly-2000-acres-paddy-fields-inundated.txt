Inclement weather in Ampara
Nearly 2,000 acres of paddy fields inundated

Nearly 2,000 acres of paddy fields out of 30,000 acres under the Akkaraipattu irrigation region including the Akkaraipattu, Weerayadi, and Illukkuchenai irrigation divisions, have been inundated due to heavy rains experienced in the Ampara district, Akkaraipattu Irrigation Engineer-In-charge T. Mayooran said.
To drain off the excessive water due to heavy rains and floods in the Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, and Alayadivembu divisions, Mayooran has prompted action near the ‘Thillai Aru’ near the Akkaraipattu, Naripiddy, and Konawatta bridges.
The ‘Thillai Aru’ in the bounty channel separates the Akkaraipattu and Alayadivembu village and the Addalaichenai village. The channel carries the entire excessive water from paddy fields to the sea at Sinna Muhathuwaram. The water hyacinth and pistia aquatic plants have been removed by machinery at each block at these junctures. Akkaraipattu Municipal Commissioner A. L. M. Azmi, Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretary A. M. Abdul Latheef, Alayadivembu Divisional Secretary V. Jegatheesan, Addalaichenai Divisional Secretary T. J. Athisayaraj, Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary M. I. M. Fais, and Akkaraipattu Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary A. M. Habeebur Rahman, local politicians, and farmer organisations officials have come forward to assist in this programme.
