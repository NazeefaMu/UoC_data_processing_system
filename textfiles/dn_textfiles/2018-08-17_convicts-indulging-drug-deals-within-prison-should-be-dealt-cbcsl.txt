Convicts indulging in drug deals within prison should be dealt with: CBCSL

The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka (CBCSL), making a statement with regard to the issue of the death penalty on Tuesday, said the recent incidents of those convicted continuing to indulge in drug dealing from within the prescient of prisons, should be prevented at all costs.
The Bishops Conference called for the urgent attention of all sections of society including family members, education institutions, religious leaders and politicians to take preventive and curative measures and design the effective rehabilitation of victims with a supportive social system.
The statement:
"We the Members of the Catholic Bishop's Conference in Sri Lanka wish to make the following statement with regard to the issue of the death penalty. The supreme Pontiff Holy Father Francis has approved a new revision of number 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. We wish to reiterate the following teachings given by the Universal Shepherd on this matter.
“Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following fair trial was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.”
“Today however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the State. Lastly, more effective systems have been developed which ensure the due protection of citizens but at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption.” Consequently, the Church teaches in the light of the Gospel that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide.”
Pope Francis calls drugs "a new from of slavery, a new wound in our society, a venom that corrodes, corrupts and kills and this evil must be fought; must be expelled. It must be told no.” Therefore, we earnestly call for the urgent attention of family, education system, institutions, religious leaders, politicians and support of the civil society, International organizations, NGOs and INGOs and finally the Legislative, Judiciary and the Executive to take preventative and curative measures and design effective rehabilitation of victims with a supportive social system.
The recent incidents of those convicted continuing to indulge in drug dealing from within the precincts of Prisons themselves, should be prevented at all costs. Stringent security measures are to be taken in this regard.
