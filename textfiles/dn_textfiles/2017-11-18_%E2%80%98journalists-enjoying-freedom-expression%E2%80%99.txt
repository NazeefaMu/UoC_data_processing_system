‘Journalists enjoying freedom of expression’

Journalists are enjoying the freedom of expression under the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime. Earlier, white vans would make them disappear if they wrote against or criticized the regime.
They also have the right to criticize the government without hesitation because they will not be taken to task as a result of criticizing the government, said Fisheries State Minister Dilip Vedarachchi.
The State Minister was addressing journalists of the Hambantota district at the rural bank auditorium in Tangalle.
He said journalists in the district are in the low income group. He said, yet, they are towers of strength and beacons of hope for the country.
They render a service without expecting benefits from society.
He requested the Board of Management of the Hambantota Journalists Association to make him aware of any shortcomings or problems faced by journalists. He said he will award Rs. 100,000 from his DCB funds for the progress of the association.
The State Minister said there was a separate media committee at Temple Trees in the past to manage media activities. However, there is no such thing today.
