England beat Ireland to win 1st ODI

BRISTOL, Friday – England made quick work of beating Ireland by seven wickets to win the first one-day international at Bristol on Friday and so go 1-0 up in the two-match series.
Adil Rashid took five for 27, the second-best ODI figures by any England spinner, as Ireland collapsed to 126 all out in 33 overs.
Alex Hales (55) and England Test captain Joe Root (49 not out), then saw England to 127 for three in 20 overs.
The result meant just 53 of the day’s scheduled 100 overs were bowled in what was Ireland’s first international match against England in England.
This series concludes at Lord’s on Sunday.
 
Scores: Ireland 126 in 33 overs (E. Joyce 23, P. Stirling 20, A. Balbirnie 30, A Rashid 5/27, J Root 2/9)
England 127-3 in 20 overs (A. Hales 55, J. Root 49 n.o., P Chase 3/44).
