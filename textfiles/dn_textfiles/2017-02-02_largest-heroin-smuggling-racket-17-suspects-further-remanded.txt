Largest heroin smuggling racket; 17 suspects further remanded

Seventeen suspects, including 14 foreigners allegedly involved in the largest heroin smuggling operation in the country, were yesterday further remanded until February 15 by the Colombo Fort Acting Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate was informed by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) that they are yet to receive the analytical report from the Colombo University regarding the mobile phones recovered from the suspects’ possession.
The vessel in which the heroin was transported is currently docked at the Dikkowita Harbor and a Legal officer appearing from the Navy had requested permission to repair the vessel during the last hearing on January 18, 2017.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne had granted permission to repair the vessel.
The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) seized 110 kilos of heroin on March 30, 2016 when the drugs were brought to Sri Lanka through the Southern seas.
PNB officials launched the special operation in the Southern seas with the assistance of the Navy Intelligence Unit.
