HHCO ready to capture global market with Hawk helmets

HHCO Industries,Sri Lanka's leading helmet manufacturing company has obtained the SLS Standards mark and now are looking to export to the region.

Founded 18 years ago as a joint venture and then branded as Hawk helmets the company was renamed HHCO recently.
Company Managing Director Chinthana Sujeeva Ganegoda said they have been maintaining high quality standards and this is the reason they were awarded the SLS 517 certification recently.
Ganegoda said officials from the Sri Lanka Standards Institute (SLSI) visited them on several occasions and were satisfied with their performance which was more than the local standards. He said they maintain the stipulated thickness of the helmet and also cater to not local but to international standards. “This is why we were able to get orders from Pakistan for export.” He said the HHCO helmets are definitely about the standards not only of Pakistani but also for region and India and Bangladesh.
Today he said that they are clueless as to how the standard for children's helmets are being set. “There is no proper guidance and hence we don't manufacture it. But this is a very big lapse as there is no quality set to measure children's helmets putting their lives in danger.”
He also said that the decision by the government to ban full face helmets puts the rider in a bigger risk during an accident. “We also did manufacture full face helmets according to international standards and due to the ban we are unable to sell them which has made us lose several millions of rupees. Had the government warned us three months before of a ban we would have stopped production.”
He said though the there is a ban on the import of helmets.Chinese helmets still invade the market.“They are around 30% less than locally manufactured ones but their quality is not up to the specified standard.”
He said they had invested around Rs. 70 million so far and employ over 100 staff. “Our production has over 95% local value addition.”
