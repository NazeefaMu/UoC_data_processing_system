Serendib Flour Mills delivers first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits

Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) recently delivered its first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits and is set to offer this efficient and environmentally-friendly storage option to other customers as well.
Having consulted with Control Union Environmental Services in 2016, SFML embarked on a long-term carbon footprint reduction programme, as part of its commitment to embrace sustainable and eco-friendly practices at every juncture of its operation. The introduction of the tanker silo operation has given rise to an array of environmental, logistical, commercial, as well as health and hygiene benefits, and it serves as a prime example of the sustainable approach that SFML strives to incorporate into its overall business strategy.
The tanker silo is an innovative storage system that enables customers that buy flour in bulk to drastically reduce their logistical expenses, labour costs, energy consumption, reduction of landfill use and their overall impact on the environment.
The storage option is significantly more hygienic and allows bakeries and factories to store a minimum of 20 tonnes of flour onsite.
This eliminates the need to constantly transport large volumes of flour between the milling facility and customer factories, thereby cutting down additional transport costs, labour and fuel consumption.
Moreover, the fact that the flour stored in the tanker silo is subjected to zero human contact makes it is a much more hygienic and safer alternative.
While the tanker silo storage option promotes environmental sustainability and helps businesses to significantly reduce their impact on the planet, it also reaps an array of commercial and business benefits.
Kalinga Wijesekera, Head of Marketing and Communications, Serendib Flour Mills (Pvt) Ltd, said: “We are pleased to have delivered our very first tanker silo to Diana Biscuits, this collaboration has further strengthened our business partnership, and we look forward to providing more of our customers with this innovative transport and storage option.

The tanker silo not only enables customers to save a great deal of money and energy, it also offers a more hygienic approach to storage and production.”
Prasanna De Silva, CEO, Diana Trading Company (Pvt) Ltd,said: “We are delighted to be the first customer to benefit from Serendib Flour Mills’ ground-breaking storage solution and we believe that this investment will enable us to drastically cut down operational costs, save time and resources, and run a highly efficient operation.”
SFML has developed a wide range of wheat flour products that cater to diverse dietary preferences and needs, and are available in a variety of volumes and packaging formats.
The company’s flagship brand, 7 Star Flour has become a household name that is a much-loved staple in homes across the island.
