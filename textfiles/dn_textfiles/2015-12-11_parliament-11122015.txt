[Parliament]-11.12.2015

Demonstrations by a few politically motivated TUs won't scare Govt - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said in Parliament that a government of the people would not be afraid by the demonstrations of a few politically motivated trade unions.
He questioned whether this is a political struggle or a trade union struggle? Only the people can change this government. Do not make the people destitute even though you are in the political wilderness?
The Prime Minister was joining the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2016 for the seventh allotted day under the financial heads of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine.
"We have drafted laws to pave the way for a private sector salary hike. This will be presented to Parliament in January. The process has been delayed and we express regrets over it. We have provided a number of relief measures through this budget.
He said that the government increased the salaries of the public sector, and private sector salaries would also be increased in January. "We are increasing the salaries of estate workers. We increased the pension payments by Rs 1,000, Samurdhi allowance, brought down the prices of gas, milk powder, flour, sugar, kerosene and other essential items. We increased the Mahapola Bursary by Rs 1,000, wrote off 50 percent of loans taken by farmers, gave Rs 20,000 allowance to pregnant mothers, gave a fixed price of Rs.50 a kilo for paddy, Rs. 80 per kilo of potato, provided a fertilizer subsidy to tea and rubber, pruned down the expenditure heads of presidency, introduced a special baking system for war heroes and an insurance scheme for fishermen. We brought down the fuel prices. We did all these within a year. People enjoyed these relief measures and they would not launch struggles against the government. Are these strikes staged against bringing down the fuel prices or against increasing the pensions or Samurdhi allowances?
"Various Bank unions met me today and held several rounds of discussions. They have a reasonable fear that their revenue will go down with the reduction of leasing business. I have promised not to do so".
"What are these trade union leaders are shouting against? What are their demands? Do they need to increase the prices of essential goods of which the prices we brought down? They reject this budget and call us to go back to the previous situation. We cannot do so just because the unionists call for that. People have given a mandate to us. They gave a mandate to President Maithripala Sirisena.
"Now the unionists talk of a Rs 10,000 allowance and demand it be included in the basic salary. We gave an allowance of Rs 10,000. If we add this to the basic salaries there would be another wave of strikes and union actions demanding rectification of salary scales.
"We are ready for talks. There is no means of strikes. Where were these strikers when Roshan Chanaka was shot dead? Where were they when people were shot dead at Rathupaswala? Where were they when
journalists were assaulted? What is your problem? Do not you like the presidency of President Sirisena?
"It is our objective to bring about a minimum salary on the basis of cost of living. The current minimum salary is not sufficient for the cost of living. People have lot of expenses. They have to send their children to tuitions and medical expenses are high. All these are needed. Ask for them, they are reasonable demands. Some shout that no CEPA. There is no CEPA. How could we abolish something non existing.
"Now we are moving fast to develop this country. Do these trade unions against developing the country. Are you against building 500,000 new houses? Are you against creating one million new jobs? Are you against building a megapolis?
"Doctors said that chronic kidney disease was a result of using some fertilizers and pointed out that they be controlled. Their opinion was that by controlling the chemical fertilizer we could control the spread of disease. So we took actions needed. Now these agitators demand for chemical fertilizers again. Am I a doctor to go against other doctors' opinion?
"If you are dreaming of changing the government by staging protests, you are mistaken. You take the time and space of media to show off and get publicity for non-existing dissent. These agitators have no public support. Your actions would only cause inconvenience to people. The government would not suffer anything. Only people could change the government not few unions of bankrupt opposition could do so," he said.
Programme to provide pension to entire working community
Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said in Parliament yesterday that the government will formulate a programme to provide a pension to the entire working community in Sri Lanka. He was joining the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2016 for the seventh allotted day under the financial heads of the Ministry of Labour and Trade Unions Relations. Today, only 44percent of the working population receive a pension which leaves out 56 percent of the working population with a pension.
"We want to ensure that all of the working people receive pension. The previous regime tried take 10 percent of the profits of the EPF by forcefully to them. We will systematic the EPF enabling contributors receive more benefits. The Opposition is trying to deceive people propagating false facts on the CEPA agreement with India. "Our government will never sign the CEPA agreement under any circumstance".
"We appreciate the Health Ministry's move of launching an ambulance service with a doctor as a result of donations from India".
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara:- said this government has not done anything concrete to ensure the welfare of the working class. It is enacting laws which are inimical to the working class day by day and we condemn that. It is almost one year since the government pledged to give Rs.2,500 to the private sector workers. "We wonder why this has been delayed. All the working people have rejected this budget and accordingly, we will be organizing a massive protest on December 19 to express our objections to the budget. The government could not formulate a Labour Act for years.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe:- former Minister G.L Peiris once said that they would not permit us to pass any new labour laws in this Parliament. That is why it was delayed. But, it is in the process now.
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara:-The Prime Minister should not speak untruths in this chamber. The government has failed to stop the man power crisis. This budget has taken the side of employers instead of protecting employees.
