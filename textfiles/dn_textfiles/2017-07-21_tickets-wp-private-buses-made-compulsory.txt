Tickets on WP private buses made compulsory

Western Province Passenger Transport Authority yesterday said issuance of a ticket to all passengers travelling in private buses was made compulsory.
According to Authority Chairman Thusitha Kularathna, the conductors should make sure that they give balance money to the passengers when they pay money for tickets.
Those who are abstaining from issuing tickets to passengers and giving them back their balance money will be severely dealt with, Kularathna said.
He said the passengers can inform such incidents to the authority’s main office in Battramulla or offices at bus stands at Bastian Mawatha, Homagama, and Borella or inform on 011 5559595.
