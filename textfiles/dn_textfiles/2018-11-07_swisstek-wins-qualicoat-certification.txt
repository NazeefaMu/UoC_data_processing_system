Swisstek wins QUALICOAT certification

Demonstrating its commitment to product excellence once again, Swisstek Aluminium Limited was recently awarded the QUALICOAT certification for its aluminium products.
Swisstek Aluminium is the first and only aluminium manufacturer in Sri Lanka to receive this certification, which was awarded after its powder coated aluminium products passed several rigorous, standardised tests, involving carefully selected product-based criteria.
QUALICOAT is the ultimate international certification of product quality and is the aspiration of all manufacturers in the aluminium industry. However, very few even globally manufacture to the stringent specification set in order to receive this certification. This certification ensures that this product has been manufactured to globally validated criteria encompassing strength, durability and product lifespan.
“Swisstek is proud to be the only Sri Lankan organisation to receive this certification and this is testament to our unwavering commitment to provide the Sri Lankan consumer with the highest quality product,” said Mahendra Jayasekera, Managing Director, Swisstek Aluminium Limited.
