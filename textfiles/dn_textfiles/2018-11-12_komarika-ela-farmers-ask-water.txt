Komarika Ela farmers ask for water

The Komarika Ela Amuna farmer community has not received water for their cultivation since many places of the Komarika Canal have sunk and were damaged.
The community was to be provided with water on October 20 but the issue of the Komarika Canal delayed the supply.
Farmers of the area urge the Irrigation Department to repair the canal as soon as possible and supply water for their livelihoods. Even though they received rain water now, it is not enough to carry out cultivation unabated, they said.
Irrigation Department sources said the canal will be repaired very soon and the water supply will commence thereafter.
Komarika Ela is under the Kandaketiya Regional Engineering Office and the canal supplies water for over 1,420 acres of paddy fields.
