Railway strike called off

The lightning strike launched by the Railway Locomotive Engine Drivers Union and the Railway Guards Union at midnight on Tuesday was called off last afternoon after discussions between the railway trade unions and the Railway General Manager.
Locomotive Engine Drivers Union Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the strike was launched regarding several demands on the non delivery of promises made by the Ministerial Sub Committee during the last railway strike and also about the shortcomings in the brake system of Chinese locomotives.
The other key demand is the failure to extend the service period of retired Railway Engine drivers working on contract basis.
The strike was called off after the Railway General Manager was agreed to extend the contract period of retired engine drivers.
Although,it was agreed during the last Ministerial Sub Committee not to punish those who participate in the last strike. This has not been done and it was one of the reasons for the strike.
Railway Guards Trade Union Chairman Janaka Fernando said there was a dispute between the railway guards and station masters on the handling of goods and luggae and this was also resolved through the discussions.
Meanwhile, it was revealed that Railway General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama did not know anything about the strike.
A Railway Control Room spokesman said seven office and express trains did not operate as a result of the strike.
