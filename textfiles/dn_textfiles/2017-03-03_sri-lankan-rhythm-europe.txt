Sri Lankan rhythm in Europe

This singer wanted to compose a different kind of song. He received many invitations from Sri Lankan artistes in Europe. As Miron Sri is based in Europe, he did not get an opportunity to receive those invitations. In the meanwhile one of his friends informs him about Ajith Kumarathanthri’s visit to Italy. Miron Sri invited him to his residence in Rome. In Rome, they discussed how to produce a new song. A trust is gradually built between the two singers.
“Ajith Kumarathanthri went to Sri Lanka and sent me the melody and lyrics. The song is named as Anagathe Mata Inna Behe Tava. We did rehearsals for three months. Then only have we come to Sri Lanka,” said Miron Sri.
The song is now telecast on FM channels drawing a good response from audiences. The visual essay will be released this month. Miron Sri intends to finish his second song before returning to Europe.
Miron Sri is among the top five winners of the International Superstar in Germany held in 2016. He enters the top five following a strong competition with a host of reputed countries. Miron Sri accredits his win to proper rehearsals done over the months.
He has already received a number of invitations to many concerts in Sri Lanka. For instance, he recently hosted a concert with Nelu Adhikari, Namal Udugama and Dayan Vitharana. He intends to visit Sri Lanka, his motherland, in future as well in order to present more songs.
