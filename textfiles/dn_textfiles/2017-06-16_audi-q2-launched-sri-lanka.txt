Audi Q2 launched in Sri Lanka

The German luxury car brand Audi introduced the newest and smallest addition of its sports utility vehicles, the all new Audi Q2 SUV in Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Armed with innovative technology and a new impressive style, the Colombo Audi Showroom is offering the Q2 at a special introductory price to Lankan customers.
Powerful, dynamic and radiating an undeniable presence, the Audi Q2 is a progressive combo that features sleek lines, a high level of functionality and the ability to handle any type of terrain.
Ideal for both off-road adventure and everyday driving in the big city, the SUV is sharp, edgy and sporty with a low roofline and high windows.
Its beautiful design is especially evident when its low roof descends to merge with the C-pillars with colour offset blades, thereby accentuating the sportiness of the Q2. Conveniently seating five people, the interior of the Audi Q2 is spacious and comfortable, following the same angular lines of the exterior.
The driver’s seat is positioned in a similar fashion to a sports vehicle, with the ‘all-round visibility’ typical of a SUV. The luggage compartment has a 405 litre cargo capacity that can be increased to 1,050 litres (by folding the rear seat) to accommodate larger storage needs.

Outfitted with innovative technology and designed with a lightweight, well sprung body to make it capable of greater thrust, Audi Q2 is highly fuel efficient with a turbo charged engine and newly developed seven-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission that lets you change gears at lightning speed. It also has ‘progressive steering’.
Speaking at the unveiling of the Audi Q2, Rajieve Fernando, Director Audi Sri Lanka said, since the Q2 is bellow the 1,000 CC engine capacity it falls under a advantagious tax structure and he expressed optimism of selling 100 units during the calendar year.Already 8 units has been sold, he said.
“The Audi Q2 is sporty, youthful, stylish and impossible to categorize. It’s an all-rounder.
It has a well-designed exterior and interior; a powerful, efficient engine; ample boot space and leg room and is ideal for everyday driving and recreational purposes. It can even be described as a state of the art fashion statement that facilitates the active lifestyles of working professionals and family-men.
It’s currently being offered at a special introductory price for customers who want an urban vehicle with character and wish to experience German automotive luxury,” Fernando added.
