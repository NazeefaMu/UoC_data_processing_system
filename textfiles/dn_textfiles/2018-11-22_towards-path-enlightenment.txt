IATBU 5th International Conference here on Nov. 27:
Towards the path of enlightenment

Sri Lanka is a country renowned around the globe as a land that reveres Theravada Buddhism since over 2500 years.
IATBU stimulates and formulates all efforts to build on the great  Theravada heritage to promote the Buddha Sasana by ensuring that the  brightest and best of each new generation will gain a profound  understanding of the Buddha's Dhamma and will be motivated to apply that  understanding fully in every area of their lives and work
It can be unarguably believed that Theravada Buddhism changed the course of the country for the better after it was endowed to our island by King Dharmashoka from India through his son Arahat Mahinda, who is venerated as the second Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Buddhism today is one of the most worshipped religions in the world and Theravada Buddhist scholars are a main stronghold that attempts to preserve its place in the world.
IATBU stands for International Association of Theravada Buddhist Universities and it is a globally implemented community that works for the enhancement of Buddhist education.
IATBU has become an international network that coordinates the higher educational institutes. It is an inclusive global network that unites people, knowledge, skills of every higher education institution with a specific mission to educate students to understand and practice the Buddha's Dhamma as presented in the Pali Canon.
IATBU stimulates and formulates all efforts to build on the great Theravada heritage to promote the Buddha-Sasana by ensuring that the brightest and best of each new generation will gain a profound understanding of the Buddha's Dhamma and will be motivated to apply that understanding fully in every area of their lives and work.
The prestigious IATBU holds an international conference every two years with the cooperation of the Theravada Buddhist countries in order to enhance the academic ties and knowledge between the countries. The opportunity to conduct an international conference of IATBU is a magnificent opportunity received by a Buddhist country and the selection itself manifests the confidence the Buddhist community has kept on the particular country and the prestigious universities. The Executive Committee of IATBU gathered at Goy Jakarta Indonesia, honoured Sri Lanka by presenting the prestigious opportunity to Sri Lanka.
