Kenyan runners dominate Colombo Marathon

Kenyan runners dominated the 16th LSR Colombo Marathon conducted by Lanka Sportsreizen and sponsored by SriLankan Airlines from Colombo to Negombo yesterday by winning the first three places in the men’s race.
The women’s marathon was also won by a Kenyan runner but Sri Lanka Navy’s Lakmini Anuradha Bogahawatta managed to break the Kenyan stranglehold by finishing second. Third place in the race went to Kenya.
Joseph Kariuki, an undergraduate of Kenyatta University brought himself a lovely birthday present when he won the men’s race. Kairuki who turned 30 yesterday won the men's event in a time of 2h.25m.32secs. Amos Myens also from Kenya finished second in a time of 2h.25m.45secs. Their compatriot Joseph Mavangi Nagari ended third in a time of 2h.26m.59secs. Fourth place went to Sri Lanka Army's Engineering Regiment 25-year-old Dilan Sandaruwan in a time of 2h.28m.48sec.
In the women's marathon Margarat Wanguin Juguna continued Kenya's dominance in the marathon by winning the event in a time of 2h.53m.47secs. Sri Lanka Navy's Lakmini Anuradha Bogahawatta finished second in a time of 2h.56m.4secs while Kenya's Susan Kosgei was third in 3h.2m.22secs. In fourth place was Sri Lanka's Velu Krishanthi who clocked 3h.4m.32secs.
A total of 7,500 competitors from Sri Lanka and 252 runners from overseas took part in the marathon which began from near the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, Colombo. The race was flagged off by former Sri Lanka marathon runner R.A. Wimalasena Perera who took part in the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games.
The winners of the 10 kilometre race which ended at Wattala were given their awards by bronze medallist at the 2016 Rio Paralympic Indika Priyantha Herath.
The winner Joseph Kariuki won the Myanmar Marathon early this year and then finished eighth in the Malaysian Marathon.
Sri Lanka Army's Artillery Regiment Kumar Samugeshwaran won the half marathon taking part in the National Marathon for the first time. He had earlier finished third in the marathon event at the Defence Services Sports Festival.

Passion for bananas costs Kenyan Amos the race
Kenya's Amos Myens passion for bananas apparently cost him the men’s full marathon race at the 16th LSR Colombo Marathon run from Colombo to Negombo yesterday.
Amos was leading the race when he stopped to pluck some bananas hanging from a bunch of a nearby shop and consumed it while running the race. But that was not what really made him loose the race.
Amos instead of following the scheduled route followed the course car that took a different route and eventually lost valuable time. He realised his mistake too late and although he got back on track he had to be content with second place.
Amos was very upset by his blunder and was lucky to escape with a warning for his 'banana act'. The race was won by fellow-Kenyan Joseph Kariuki.
