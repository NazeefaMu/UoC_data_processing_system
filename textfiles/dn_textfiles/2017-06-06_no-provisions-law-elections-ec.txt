No provisions in the law for by-elections: EC

Currently, there are no laws to hold by-elections when an incumbent politician dies, resigns or becomes ineligible to continue in office, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
He was addressing the “National Voters Day 2017” event held at the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo yesterday. It was organized by the Election Commission in collaboration with the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES) Sri Lanka.
“There are several measures taken to strengthen the electoral system, but nowhere do I see initiatives to provide for by- elections. I have no idea whether there are any proposals to include this in the proposed new Constitution”, he said.
Deshapriya further said the significance of celebrating National Voters day is to encourage more young voters to take part in the political process. He stressed the importance of youth participation in the electoral process.
Deshapriya said in India there was a request to include ‘None Of The Above” (NOTA) in the ballet papers to show their dislike for the candidates. The public didn’t want to cancel their votes but to express their displeasure. The Indian supreme court agreed to include NOTA in the ballot papers.
He said the topic is being discussed and added that he neither encourages nor discourages it. “One of the frequent questions from the youth is why we don’t have it here in Sri Lanka. But it has to come through the public and parliament. It has to be legally accepted “, he said.
He said that responsible voting should be encouraged among public especially the youth. He pointed out that there is less representation of youth in parliament and also added that youth are not much interested in getting involved in political activities.
Deshapriya pointed out that it is very important to elect the most suitable and talented candidates. IFES Chief of Party Beverly Hagerdon was also present.
