Navy briefs govt officers on flood early warning system

Key government officers of the Ratnapura District were briefed on flood early warning and relief systems at a workshop conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy, at the auditorium of Ratnapura District Secretariat, on March 8.
The workshop, conducted by the Navy’s Geo Information System, dwelt on the role of the Sri Lanka Navy in combination with other local institutions, in the event of floods, and the establishing of an early warning and relief system.
The district’s government officers were introduced to the system using GPS and Google Earth. The workshop was conducted by Naval Commander (IT) Nadeera Kulapathi under the supervision of Deputy Chief of Staff and Director General Operations Rear Admiral Piyal de Silva, at the request of the Ratnapura District Secretary.
The workshop was attended by a large number of officers from government and volunteer organisations, including Naval Information Technology Director Commodore Priyantha Edirisinghe, Ratnapura District Secretary, all divisional secretaries, assistant divisional secretaries, Disaster Management Centre officers, Eighth Gemunuheva Regiment Commanding Officer, Ratnapura SSP, Irrigation Engineer, Road Development Authority and Ceylon Electricity Board officers and the Public Health Inspector.
The workshop was based on information collected by the Sri Lanka Navy on its role as well as the relief system during the floods in the Ratnapura district in May 2017.
