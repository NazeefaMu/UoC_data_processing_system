Aviation fuel standards good, passes test - CPC

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) yesterday, asked the public not to be swayed by false rumours over low quality aviation fuel and assured that it maintained the highest standards in supplying aviation fuel.
“In the last couple of days, there had been an unexpected demand in aviation fuel, causing uncertainty whether we could maintain secure fuel stocks.
The issue was discussed at the Stock Assessment meeting on November 28 and accordingly, it was decided that we would purchase 14,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel from the Lanka OIC company to maintain adequate stocks”, the CPC said in a media release.
They further explained that a ship carrying additional stocks arrived at the Colombo Port on December 10.
The first sample testing of the fuel revealed that it was not up to standard. It was believed that rust from the ship might have contaminated the fuel sample.
Thereafter, in keeping with CPC procedure, a second sample was tested on December 17 with the involvement of an independent observer. The second sample passed the test. By that time, the rust had settled in the ship. Thus the fuel which met all standards is currently being unloaded into the country.
“The CPC would like to stress that the fuel received thus is of the highest of standards and that as a company it was responsible to supply aviation fuel which meets all necessary standards.”
Rumours are being spread to cause unrest in the country, we request the public not believe such false information, said the CPC.
