They deserved the win – Pubudu Dassanayake: Nepal XI defeat MCC in Lord’s debut

 
Nepal inscribed another noteworthy entry in their cricketing history by winning on their first visit to Lord's on Tuesday in front of several thousand delighted fans.
On a sweltering day in north London, a Nepal XI defeated MCC by 41 runs after which the Nepal captain, Paras Khadka, led his players around the outfield to pay tribute to their typically exuberant supporters.
Having chosen to bat first, Nepal's every run was cheered to the rafters by a crowd of around 5000 that spread itself out across the Mound, Tavern, Edrich and Allen stands. Boundaries and wickets brought even greater outbursts of adulation and chants of "Ne-pal! Ne-pal! Ne-pal!" echoed around the old ground as Sompal Kami and Basant Regmi cleaned up the tail to dismiss MCC for 176 in pursuit of 218 in 50 overs.
The fixture was arranged as part of celebrations to mark the 200-year-old relationship between Britain and Nepal, with proceeds from the match going towards rebuilding work in Nepal after last year's earthquake.
MCC were captained by former Middlesex and Somerset allrounder Keith Dutch and included former Queensland batsman Clinton Perren and South Africa-born fast bowler Chad Barrett, who made his only first-class appearance for Northamptonshire two years ago.
Former Sri Lanka wicket-keeper Pubudu Dassanayake, who stepped down as Nepal coach last year after being involved in some of their greatest moments of recent times, joined the celebrations in the dressing room afterwards. Dassanayake has been back working with the side recently as a consultant, arranged by the ICC, and his pride in their achievement was obvious.
"These boys, the amount of work they put in, they deserve this, to come and play a game here," Dassanayake said. "They make a lot of sacrifices and fight always."
