Soil dumped in reservoir

The excess soil when reconstructing Maskeliya - Nallathanni Road is being dumped into the Maussakelle reservoir reducing its water capacity.
The road is being widened near Mohini Ella and loads of excess soil is being dumped into the reservoir illegally.
The project is implemented by the Road Development Authority’s Norwood Provincial Engineering Office.
Some of the soil is directly unloaded into the reservoir while the rest on the reservoir bank is gradually washed into the tank with rainwater.
In addition, the pilgrims arriving in the area are facing difficulties when travelling through the road. The dumping of soil has a direct impact on the reduction of water in the reservoir. The reservoir provides water to Laxapana, New Laxapana, Polpitiya and Canyon solar power stations. The sediments of the reservoir had never been removed since its construction and this illegal act would initiate it.
