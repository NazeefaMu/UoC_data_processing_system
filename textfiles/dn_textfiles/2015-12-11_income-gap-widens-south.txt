Income gap widens in South

The difference between earnings of the poorest and the richest of the Southern province is wide, said Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva.
He said the poorest 20 percent earns 5.2 percent of the province's overall income while the richest 20 percent accounts for 50.8 percent. Accelerating the phase of economic progress aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of both low and middle income earners of the province is the main focus.
He was delivering the budget speech presenting the Financial Statement and draft Appropriation Bill for 2016 at the council meeting held on Tuesday. Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda presided over.
It was the second Financial Statement of the seventh Southern Provincial Council and 12th consecutive Budget presented by the Chief Minister in his capacity as the Provincial Finance Minister.
"Along with economic development, we hope to ensure an enhanced health, education, housing atmosphere throughout the region and better living standards for the public. We have understood the need for developing infrastructure facilities such as transport and an advanced network of highways to link urban areas and rural regions. New income generating plans and approaches would be introduced to the working class. The economic strategy will provide equal opportunities for all with emphasis on the people with special needs," the Chief Minister said.
He said, "the total estimated expenditure for 2016 would be Rs. 32,368.7 million against which concurrent expenditure and capital expenditure would be Rs. 26,959.9 and Rs. 5,408.8 respectively. The council hoped to receive a grant of Rs. 7,705.1 million, including the income earned from the Nation Building Tax and Stamp duties from the central government."
"In comparison to the expenses for 2015, there is a marked increase of 24.6 percent amounting to Rs. 5,327.4 million. It is consequent to the substantial increase in salaries of public servants," Silva said.
