More coconut seedlings for low-income families

Another 100 coconut seedlings were distributed among low-income families in Kurumbasetty of the Thelippilai Divisional Secretariat division, recently.
This project is a concept initiated by Jaffna Security Force Commander Major General Darshana Hettiarrachchi.
The seedlings were distributed among 100 families in collaboration with Dharma Vijaya Foundation.
Over 7,400 coconut seedlings had been distributed among the people in the Jaffna peninsula since the beginning of the year.
A large gathering of military personnel and civilians participated in the ceremony at Kurumbasetty.
