‘Indian fishermen’s poaching reduced due to Navy operations’

As the 3rd round of ministerial-level bilateral talks between India and Sri Lanka concluded over the weekend, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah is confident that the Navy has put a stop to Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters.
“In the last few months, arrests have dropped,” said the Commander, speaking to the Daily News, yesterday.
His proof is the vastly decreased number of boats being apprehended by the Navy. Between July to August, the Navy apprehended 24 boats but from August to date, they have only caught eight.
“The numbers are proof that we don’t have Indian fishermen coming into our waters,” said the Navy Commander.
He explained that in the last two months, since being appointed as the Commander of the Navy, he had changed the deployment pattern in the North, increasing their presence operations in the North by tenfold.
“We have taken assets used in other areas and concentrated them on the border. The type of vessels used has also changed from Fast Attack Crafts (FACs) to Fast Gun Boats (FGBs), which are bigger and tougher platforms, actually designed for this type of tasks,” said Vice Admiral Sinniah.
“Our operations are transparent and visible right now, unlike being clandestine earlier. The latter method was wrong. You can be clandestine when fighting a war but it is not necessary afterwards. We are on the Sri Lankan International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). So when guarding the IMBL, you need to be seen. This is what has made the big difference in the Indian fishermen not coming into our waters,” he added.
The Navy has also changed their concept from ‘Arrest and Harass’ to ‘Warn and Deter’.
“We are helping Indian fishermen maintain their position in Indian waters, so that they don’t have to stray into Sri Lankan waters. When they do stray, we take them out and send them back to India, because these fishermen need help and because India is not capable of giving it to them, we are giving it to them,” said the Navy Commander.
Bilateral talks between India and Sri Lanka have continued for many years with no visible outcome being reached due to the belief that the poachers cannot be stopped. However, Vice Admiral Sinniah dismissed such claims to assert that it could be stopped with the right level of commitment.
“When people told us that we cannot fight the LTTE, and that it will go on forever, everyone believed it,” he noted.
Since the change in naval tactics, Tamil Nadu fishermen have ventured into the shores of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, inciting protests from area fishermen. Vice Admiral Sinniah believed that this change was due to them being prevented from entering Lankan waters.
“They have nowhere to go now. So they are trespassing into Andhra and Kerala. It is direct proof that our operation has been 100 percent successful,” said the Navy Commander.
