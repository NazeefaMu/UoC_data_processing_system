Vilachchiya farmers ask for paddy seeds

Vilachchiya Farmers’ Associations members requested the Agriculture Department to provide paddy seeds during this rainy season.
They said they receive enough rainwater for the Maha season cultivation. But they can not find paddy seeds since their cultivation has not been successful for many seasons.
Association President R. S. M. Ekanayake said they cultivated around 3,100 acres in Vilachchiya. Ekanayake requested the authorities to provide them with an incentive.
