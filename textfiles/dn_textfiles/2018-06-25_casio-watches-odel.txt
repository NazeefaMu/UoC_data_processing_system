Casio watches from Odel

Odel recently announced the addition of Casio watches to its extensive collection of original branded watches. Odel is now an authorized retailer for Casio, and will provide a host of after-sales services via its partnership with Blink International, the authorised service partner for Casio watches in Sri Lanka.
Casio watches are masterfully crafted works of superior design and quality. Odel will also stock other Casio watches from collections including G-shock, Baby-G, Protrek, Edifice, Enticer and Youth. In particular, it will stock the G-Shock Premium MTG and GPW series with features such as automatic time setting and GPS services. Odel’s status as an authorized Casio retailer will allow it to provide a comprehensive range of after-sales services by working directly with the authorized Casio Service Center in Sri Lanka which has direct monitoring by Casio Japan. Blink International is fully equipped with the latest technology to handle any Casio watch repair within 72 hours or less, inclusive of the high-end MTG series.
Blink International Director Muhammed Mansoor noted, “The partnership with Odel is a great way to expand our reach, and better way to cater to the middle-income segment of the local watch market. Odel provides a great retail space and shopping experience, which makes it an excellent place to make an informed decision when buying a watch. We look forward to catering to watch enthusiasts in Sri Lanka with this partnership.”
