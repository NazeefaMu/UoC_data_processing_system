‘Indirect tax needs slicing to 60%’

Over 80% of Sri Lanka’s tax revenue is collected via indirect taxes and this should be brought down to 60% soon, said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne.
Speaking at the implementing a state-of-the-art online payment platform by LankaClear for Customs payments in partnership with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka the Minister also said that it was sad to note that person’s earning Rs. 20, 000 to 200, 000 pay equal amounts of taxes of those who earn Rs two million and this too should change.
The Minister said that the three key tax collecting institutions are Inland Revenue, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department and they account to 85% of government revenue. “The other 300 plus state institutions only account to 15% of the government revenue,” Wickramaratne said.
Commenting on the LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP) he said that it is a great tool to take Sri Lanka closure to a cashless society. “We also observe that online and cashless transitions are on the rise and over Rs. 1.7 trillion transactions were done via SLIPS system. “In addition there was ATM transaction done to the tune of Rs. 244 billion last year.”
The Finance State Minister said that the entire country should move towards a cashless society and the government will also automate all state institutions in three years and steps were taken in this regard.
Governor Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, said that this is a red letter day for Customs department which was set up 200 years ago in 1809 which makes it one of the oldest, Customs administrations in the world. “This is also an import mile stone in Sri Lanka’s crusade towards moving to a digital economy.”
W. S. I. Silva Superintendent of Sri Lanka Customs stated that this was one of our key initiatives and fulfills a long awaited requirement of all our traders. “Sri Lanka Customs have strived to improve efficiency in all our processes to provide an enhanced service to importers/exporters and general public and reaching this milestone was yet another positive step in this direction. We perform over Rs. 2 billion transactions a day and this platform would help them to provide a more efficient service.”“Prior to launching this revolutionary platform, only the importers, exporters who maintained their bank accounts at the two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank, were able to make direct Customs payments online while other importers, exporters had to go through a tedious process,” explained Anil Amarasuriya Chairman LankaClear.
“The new system would totally eliminate the previous inefficient payment process that resulted in unnecessary delays and impacted the businesses of the importers, exporters.”
This initiative was taken as a result of Sri Lanka Customs requesting the support of the Central Bank to facilitate the importers/exporters to make online Customs payments on a real-time basis from any bank in the country.
The customers can now directly connect to their respective bank via any channel connected to CEFTS (Internet, Mobile, ATM or Over the Counter) to make the required payment to Customs. Further, these payments will be credited on a real-time and 24 X 7 basis using CEFTS to the designated SL Custom’s bank accounts at Bank of Ceylon or Peoples Bank. LankaClear system provides SL Customs with the required payment confirmation details on a real-time basis while the relevant reports and other information to be provided had also been agreed upon mutually for reconciliation purposes.
The settlement of the payment between the two state banks and other commercial banks would be via Central banks Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and will be under the direct regulation and supervision of the Central Bank. LankaClear payment systems are Payment Card Industry – Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Version 3.2 and ISO 27001:2013 certified to ensure the highest level of security compliance. T
hese standards are internationally recognized and widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to ensure the security of payment transactions.
The initial system went live with the participation of Bank of Ceylon, Sampath bank and Commercial Bank while the seven other banks who have already been certified with the new system would also go live shortly.
