Judge declines to take Bench over LG polls FR

Supreme Court Judge Priyantha Jayawardena yesterday declined to sit on the Bench citing personal reasons regarding the Fundamental Rights petition filed by 18 former Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen representing Galle and Matara Districts’ local government authorities which sought an order directing the Elections Commission to take steps to hold elections for 18 local government authorities as required by law.
The petition was taken up before a two-Judge-bench comprising Justice Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera.
However, Justice Jayawardena said he was unable to hear the case, at which point the petition was fixed for argument on July 28.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by 18 former Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen representing Galle and Matara Districts’ local government authorities.
The petitioners had cited the Elections Commission, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister and 22 others as respondents.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appeared for the Attorney General and
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioners.
The petitioners sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been infringed by the failure or refusal of the Elections Commissioner to take steps to hold elections for the Weligama Urban Council and Dikwella, Thawalama, Neluwa, Weligama, Thihagoda, Kirinda, Kotapola, Mulatiyana, Devinuwara, Kamburupitiya, Athuraliya, Pasgoda, Malimbada, Akuressa, Hakmana, Matara and Pitabeddara Pradeshiya Sabhas as required by law.
The public representatives representing the Joint Opposition were present in Court when the petition was filed.
