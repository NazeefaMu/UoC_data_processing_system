‘What’s your fit?’

Hameedia has dedicated the weekends until September 30 to extend their fashion expertise to their loyal customers at Majestic City Mall Lobby, World Trade Centre, Crescat Boulevard, Kandy City Centre and K-Zone Ja-Ela. This indeed would be a wonderful opportunity to meet Hameedia fashion consultants and discuss your concerns, clarify your doubts and receive the expert opinion in determining the next welcome change in your wardrobe. This first ever ‘What’s your fit?’ campaign, is sure to cater to all your style needs, helping you make your own individual fashion statements.
Commenting on the campaign, Hameedia, Managing Director, Fouzul Hameed said in a press release, “Finding the perfect fit is the most important aspect when you buy a shirt, it’s a style statement rather than size segregation. Our campaign aims to educate all fashion conscious gentlemen around the country on how the same person can choose different fits customized based on their style preference and personality. I would like to invite all gentlemen around our country to walk in to any of our campaign locations until September 30 and explore the world of next generation fashion and rediscover their style statement all over again.”
The campaign would also be expanded to other strategic locations on multiple dates as follows: World Trade Centre on August 25, Majestic City on August 26 and on September 2, 9 and 16, Kandy City Centre (KCC) on September 3, 10, 17 and 23, at Crescat Boulevard on September 29 and 30 and at K-Zone Ja-Ela on September 9 and 16. Each location is set to have hosts and consultants educating the customers on different fits available and how these could be successfully adopted to meet their individual fashion ethos. All locations will also feature raffle draws, games and photo booths to make ‘What’s Your Fit?’ campaign a truly unique experience for their customers.
