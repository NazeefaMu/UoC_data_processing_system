Drugs used to treat H1N1 available: Rajitha Senaratne

 
Health Ministry statement said today that `Oseltamivir' (Tamiflu), the drug use to treat Influenza A(H1N1) patients is freely available countrywide and there is no shortage in this drug. 
The statement said  that the demand for the drug increased by 15 percent due to the rapid spread of the disease during the past few weeks but the drug was available without any shortage.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has given instructions to use the drug only for diagnosed patients in order to prevent misuse of the drug.
Meanwhile addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoya said that there is a severe shortage of the drug in the country at the moment. 
Both Influenza A (H1N1) patients and hospital staffs treating them face various difficulties due to this drug shortage which shows the ineffectiveness of the Health Minister, he added.
