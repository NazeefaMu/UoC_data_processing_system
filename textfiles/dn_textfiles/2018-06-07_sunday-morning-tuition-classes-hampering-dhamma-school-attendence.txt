Sunday morning tuition classes hampering Dhamma school attendence

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Deputy Minister of Home Affairs J. A. Alawathuwala said that many school children do not attend Sunday Dhamma schools on Sundays since private tuition classes are held at a stretch from early morning to late evenings on Sundays.
He was speaking at a meeting of a Dhamma school teachers held at We Uda Raja Maha Viharaya, Mawathagama, Kurunegala yesterday.
“Although the former NWP-PC Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had declared a law instructing and banning all private tuition masters within the NWP not to conduct private tuition classes on Sunday mornings, as students miss their dhamma school lessons that help them to be morally disciplined future citizens, the law is not in effect now and not followed here in the Kurunegala District, Hence, those who violate that rule purposely underestimating the laws should be legally punished, as most of the students are now living and behaving impolitely far away from their religions and noble human morals.
If this situation is not seriously addressed appropriately, the evils among the youth would grow and it will become a social tragedy in the near future.
All citizens are legally bound to respect the law and hence, the NWP-PC must implement immediately, the law of prohibiting private tuition classes in the morning hours on Sundays”, Deputy Minister J. C. Alawathuwala said.
