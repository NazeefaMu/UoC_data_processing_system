Sangakkara bids adieu to Frank Sinatra’s ‘My Way’

Farewells are usually sad affairs and emotional and Kumar Sangakkara being the great cricketing legend he is, was no exception to it. After three successful seasons with Surrey County the elegant left-hander bid adieu to cricket bringing to an end a glorious first-class career and the parting with Surrey was not without emotion.
To show their appreciation to a great servant of the game the club put together a memorable video to the meaningful lyrics written by Paul Anka and sung by that great singer of his generation Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra - the song “My Way” where video clippings of the repertoire of Sangakkara’s strokes for Surrey during those years were played throughout the song. But what was most poignant is the way each player of the team described Sangakkara in one word.
The words used were: Unique, Legendary, Prolific, Gentleman, Majestic, Astounding, Humble, Inspirational, The Greatest, Role Model, Gracious, Master and King.
Sangakkara left a legacy behind Surrey scoring 5269 runs at an average of 64.27 and 19 first-class centuries.
The lyrics of that legendary song are quite in tune to the achievements of Sangakkara:
My Way by Frank Sinatra
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way.
Sangakkara is the latest of a long line of Sri Lankan cricketers who displayed their skills on the English cricket fields starting from Dr CH Gunasekara, the first Sri Lankan to play for an English county in the 1930s and the only Sri Lankan so far to appear in a championship winning side Middlesex.
In the pre-Test era it was the likes of cricketers like Dr Gunasekara, Laddie Outschoorn, Gamini Goonesena, Dan Piachaud, Stanley Jayasinghe, Clive Inman and Gehan Mendis that kept the country’s flag flying high with their deeds on the English cricket fields. In the post Test era there have been many cricketers from Sri Lanka to grace the fields of English county cricket, the most notable of them before the advent of Sangakkara was Aravinda de Silva who played one season for Kent in 1995, a year before Sri Lanka won the World Cup.
What that one season did to De Silva was to reignite his appetite for runs and make him a better player converting him into a consistent performer on the international stage. It was not that he had not performed at international level before but the one season with Kent tightened his defence and disciplined him to the extent that he was a totally different player altogether. We don’t have to reiterate De Silva’s contribution to the national team from there onwards – the highlight no doubt was the two outstanding knocks he played in the semi-final against India and in the final against Australia for Sri Lanka to win the World Cup in 1996. But the impact De Silva made in the one season with Kent is described vividly here:
Henry Blofeld in the ‘Independent’:
“Aravinda de Silva is one of the few batsmen in the history of the game whose batting technique has been touched by the divine hand. He has scored more than six thousand Test runs and has distributed his favours just about equally against the attacks he has encountered.
“Kent supporters will need no reminding of his talents, for he delighted them at the lovely St Lawrence ground almost as much as another left-hander, the legendary Frank Woolley, did all those years ago. The hundred De Silva made for Kent against Lancashire in the Benson and Hedges Cup final at Lord's in 1995 was one of the best ever played even on that ground.
Mark Nicholas in the ‘Telegraph’:
“Aravinda is a marvellous, instinctive batsman, by nature an entertainer who sees his job to taunt, tease and challenge bowlers and force error from their frustration. There are elements of Javed Miandad to his play in the compact set-up, the short back-lift and the ability to manoeuvre the ball into hitherto unseen spaces.
“He played a season for Kent in 1995 and they loved him in the hop county. A charming fellow, wrapped in layers of thermals and woollens until July when, once or twice, he peeled off the long-sleever and promised to withdraw his hands from his pockets. “In the evenings, when the Kent players would knock on his door to take him for dinner, he would be in front of the mirror, miming the off-drive, head still, elbow high, bat straight - utterly a man of cricket.”
Aravinda and Sanga have left a legacy behind them in English county cricket for other budding Sri Lankan cricketers to emulate. How many of the present generation can match their deeds?
