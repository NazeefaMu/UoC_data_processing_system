Olympic champ McLeod vows to do Shanghai hurdle hero Liu proud

Shanghai, Friday: World and Olympic hurdles champion Omar McLeod wants to put on a blistering display in Shanghai on Saturday in homage to the Chinese city's athletics hero Liu Xiang.
Liu is retired but the Shanghai native remains a Chinese sports icon because his 2004 Olympic hurdles gold medal was the country's first in men's track and field.
Liu, now 34, was also a 2007 world champion, though his brilliant career petered out because of persistent injury and he retired in 2015. But Chinese spectators may see shades of Liu in McLeod during Saturday's Diamond League meeting -- the affable Jamaican certainly hopes so.
McLeod, who is chasing a third successive 110m victory in Shanghai, said on Friday: "They show a good appreciation for hurdles here and I want to go out there and show my appreciation for their appreciation of hurdles.
"Liu Xiang was one of the reasons why I got into running in the streets and race and hurdle.
"He was just an inspiration and I've heard that I hurdle just like him, so I draw a lot from him," said the 24-year-old McLeod, touted as a viable successor to Usain Bolt as the pre-eminent Jamaican athletics star. AFP
