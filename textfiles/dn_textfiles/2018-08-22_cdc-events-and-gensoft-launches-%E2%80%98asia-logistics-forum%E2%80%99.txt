CDC Events and Gensoft launches ‘Asia Logistics Forum’

‘Asia Logistics Forum 2018’ organized by CDC Events & Travels together with Gensoft will be held on September 4 and 5 at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. This conference is expected to attract at least 200 participants worldwide.
The significance of the conference is to bring Logistics industry stakeholders in the South Asian region together to enhance their knowledge and further improve the Logistics Industry. This Forum is designed to create a two-way information flow that provides individual meetings, special technical and networking sessions in a professional Conference environment.
Businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of logistics, since it is a crucial factor in the delivery process that gets goods from the warehouse to the customers’ door. It means that customers are no longer willing to wait long periods of time for goods they order. Standard shipping times are decreasing, and this means companies need to invest in new technology to speed up the last stage of the delivery process or risk losing out to competitors.
Asia Logistics Forum 2018 brings together key decision makers and policy influencers to help delegates plan the changes needed to maintain supply chain efficiency as Sri Lanka poises itself to be a global logistics hub. The Asia Logistics Forum aims to bring together industry stakeholders in the import, export distribution and supply chain management sectors to gain knowledge and exchange ideas on how logistics will evolve in the future.
This one-of-a-kind conference will enable participants to understand how innovation and technology are changing the logistics landscape; that would soon make the leap from being futuristic to being commonplace on our roads, or in the skies.
Innovation is fast becoming an important factor on how logistics companies operate and providing a platform for stakeholders to learn new ways to do business becomes ever more important,” explained Nilanka Peiris, Managing Director - Gensoft (Pvt) Ltd.
He revealed further, “the new trend is to fine tune industry best practices by bringing in technology to assist in the process. Asia Logistics Forum is also working on a number of exciting opportunities that will unlock long term partnerships within its participants.”
Imran Hassan, Managing Director of CDC Events commented, “Logistics clusters are vitally important to the growth of commerce and trade and Asia Logistics Forum 2018 represents an ideal opportunity for effective networking between the leaders of global shipping and the sharing of best practice between the clusters.”
He added, “CDC Events looks forward to be working with logistics providers and help them create a maritime destination that is welcoming to all businesses and people from all over the world, and the realization of this vision.”.
