Action and excitement in ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’

‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi) is a 2017 American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson. It is the second film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, following ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ (2015). The film is produced by Lucasfilm and will be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.
It stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, and Gwendoline Christie in returning roles, with Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro joining the cast. Fisher died in December 2016, making The Last Jedi her final film role.
‘Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi’ is the widely anticipated next installment in the Star Wars saga. The film picks up immediately after ‘Episode VII: The Force Awakens’, after Force-sensitive scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) finally tracks down powerful Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to train and help the Resistance defeat the First Order. Many of the heroes and villains return, including escaped Storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), dark warrior Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa, as the Force Awakens join the galactic legends in an epic adventure that unlocks age-old mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.
If ‘The Last Jedi’ is anything like ‘The Force Awakens or Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’, you can not only expect lots of Action, but also great role models and an exciting adventure that teenagers and adults alike will love..
