Speaker, President can find solution to political crisis - Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and President Maithripala Sirisena can find a solution to the present political crisis in the country through discussions, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said. Hence, Rajapakshe urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to participate in a round of discussions with the President to resolve the matter.
Dr. Rajapakshe expressed confidence that such a discussion will end the present crisis in a short period of time. Dr. Rajapakshe also said that he made the same request to President Maithripala Sirisena as well.
Dr.Rajapakshe made these observations in Parliament yesterday while participating in the session despite the UPFA’s claim that they are boycotting the Parliament sessions.
Dr. Rajapakshe who positioned himself in the ruling party’s side rose to speak as the UNF moved the motion prohibiting Secretary to the Prime Minister from approving any expenditure drawn from the funds of the Republic.
“What we are in is a Constitutional deadlock, where the Executive and the Legislature are not in agreement. The responsibility of Parliament is to put aside political disagreements and to work towards the stability of the country. Those who have the majority in Parliament should be able to form a government,” Dr. Rajapakshe said.
Dr. Rajapakshe said that as a Parliamentarian he is ready to make any sacrifice to solve the prevailing crisis in the country. He pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is very much qualified to find a solution together with President Maithripala Sirisena.
“From November 14 to 16, there was a tense situation in the House. People were disappointed in the way in which the MPs acted within this Chamber. People do not have a proper awareness of the crisis situation that we are in. The President and the Legislature should find a solution to this. Judiciary does not have a say in finding a proper solution to this issue. By using the judiciary to solve this issue will only demean the powers of the Legislature. Darkness is on the horizon for our country. It wouldn’t be long when the younger generation of this country totally reject this political system. There is no use in conducting postmortems as to who did what. I agree with the fact that the fraction that holds the majority in the House should be allowed to form a government,” Dr. Rajapakshe said.
“In 2015, we cannot forget that President Maithripala Sirisena took a revolutionary decision on behalf of this country. Many Presidents promised to cut down their Executive Powers but they did not practice it. But, President Sirisena did. He allowed many Executive Powers to be taken out. I believe that the Speaker and the President will be able to come to an understanding via discussions that will allow us to restore political balance in the country. I believe it will take only one or two days to get this matter solved,” Dr. Rajapakshe also said.
In response to Dr. Rajapakshe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he has no issue in speaking with the President and assured that he will take every measure to secure democracy in the country.
