A rock solid, unbeaten century by middle order batsman, Malith Fernando (121 not out in 110 balls, inclusive of 02 sixes and 15 fours) guided Commercial Credit & Finance ‘B’ to a resounding 89 runs win over Standard Chartered Bank in the final of the 6th Prestige Automobile sponsored, ‘BMW/Hyundai’ Trophy, MCA ‘C’ division 50 –Over League Tournament 2017, concluded at the MCA Grounds on Saturday. Malith Fernando walked in when Commercial Credit was 84 for 3 in 17 overs, anchored the batting and remained unbeaten till the end of innings - 300 for 7 in 50 Overs.
Fernando’s path to reach the 300 mark : 45 runs for the 05 th wicket in 44 balls with Janaka Dayananda (22) ; 55 runs for the 7th wicket in 72 balls with his captain, Praneeth Wijesena (24) and unbeaten 89 runs for the 08 th wicket in 48 balls with Damith Mendis (27 not out) Bankers catching and ground fielding left much to be desired, as Commercial Credit scored at will, 100 runs coming in the last 10 overs.
For Standard Charted the 300 mark for not easy to get but was not impossible as all 11 were batsman. It was just a case of putting your head down and building partnerships, as Malith Fernando did for Commercial Credit.
The bankers top order, the 02 centurions, Charith Satharasinghe and Aruna Henrickson, Bhanuka Adeesha, skipper, Selvyn Jamion and Shakthi Siriratne were in good nick, but all 05 of them failed to get off the blocks leaving Standard Chartered completely stranded at 79 for 5 in 17 overs.
As the board read 100 for 7 in 21 overs, no 8 batsman, Hiran Rajapaksa (56 in 50 balls with a six and 09 fours) and no 9 batsman , Raveen Perumal (33 not out in 82 balls with 03 fours) made the top order batsman look very foolish, as they collared the Commercial Credit’s attack easily with a face saving 70 runs stand for the 8th wicket in 80 balls.
Rajapaksa and Perumal’s valiant effort only proved a point, as SCB fell by the way side, all out for 211 in 46.5 overs.
It was easy pickings for the Match Referee, KH Nandasena to name the Man of the Match - Malith Fernando from Commercial Credit & Finance ‘B’.
The other three special awards, based on performances up to the semi finals went to Best Bowler Sachin Bandara from Commercial Credit ‘B’ (17 wickets for 170 runs) , Best Batsman / Trishan Rodrigo from People’s Leasing Finance (302 runs including a century) and Man of the Series / Aruna Henrickson from Standard Chartered (290 runs with 1 century and 02 half centuries and 12 wickets)
