Government initiates Mobile Eye Hospital

 
A mobile eye hospital, created under the direction and guidance of former Director General of Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala, will commence serving the public soon.
One million Sri Lankans have to undergo cataract surgeries in the next five years, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the funds for this project were collected by holding musical shows, bicycle races and other such events.
Many local private companies and NGOs have also donated to this project.
The mobile eye hospital is consists of modern high-tech medical equipment and many other facilities to conduct eye surgeries.
The mobile eye hospital will be used to perform cataract surgeries in rural hospitals under ‘Vision 2020’ programme spearheaded by Dr. Mahipala.
The programme has already conducted over 100,000 cataract surgeries free of charge for needy Sri Lankans and has distributed over 300,000 free spectacles among needy schoolchildren, the sources said.
About one million Sri Lankans suffer from eye problems. The blindness (blind in both eyes) of Sri Lankans is registered 1.7 percent.
The main reason for the blindness in Sri Lankans is cataract issues, the sources added.
