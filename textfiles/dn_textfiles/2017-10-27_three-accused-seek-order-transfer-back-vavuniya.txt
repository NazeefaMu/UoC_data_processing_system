Three accused seek order to transfer back to Vavuniya

The three accused who had been held in Anuradhapura prison over alleged offences committed under the Prevention of Terrorist Act (PTA) yesterday filed a petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order to transfer their cases back to the Vavuniya High Court.
Three petitioners Rasathurai Thiruvarui, M. Sulakshan and Ganeshan Darshan had filed this petition naming the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) and the Attorney General as respondents.
The three petitioners stated that the indictments have been filed against them under Section 291 (a) PTA.
They stated that they do not have any relatives or friends in Anuradhapura. They further stated that they speak only Tamil language and it will be hard for them and their family members to retain a lawyer of their choice to the Anuradhapura High Court. They said owing to these reasons they believe that they will be denied a fair trial in the Anuradhapura High Court.
