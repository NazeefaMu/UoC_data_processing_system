Tick Tock, It’s Pimms o’ Clock at the GFH

The first ever crate of Pimms to arrive in Sri Lanka from the British Empire was shipped to the Galle Face Hotel. To celebrate this historical moment, the hotel re-launched this quintessential British drink with a vibrant and energetic event amidst guests, well wishers, and friends in the media.
Guests sipped on their Pimms beverages as they enjoyed lawn games and indulged in a light-hearted evening full of fun and whimsy. Pimms is the signature drink of the Galle Face Hotel, since the refreshing tart drink is perfect for those warm, balmy evenings on our tropical island.
“This light drink is a treat for the warm Sri Lankan climate. Galle Face Hotel’s connection with Pimms dates back to the colonial times and Pimms o’ clock aims to revive the history and fun behind this light, summery drink.” said Mr. Robert Hauck, General Manager – Galle Face Hotel.
