Big Screen iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, at Dialog

Sri Lanka’s only network to support 4G VoLTE capabilities for Apple iPhones, Dialog Axiata PLC, announced the launch of the all new range of iPhones, the big screen iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and the phone that is brilliant in every way, the iPhone XR.
The iPhone XS and XS Max pack 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch OLED screens, respectively, while the XR features a 6.1in LCD ‘Liquid Retina’ screen, accommodating Apple’s Face ID tech, acclaimed as the ‘most secure’ facial authentication in a smartphone.
Advanced Face ID lets you securely unlock iPhone and log in to apps with just a glance. The A12 Bionic chip with next-generation Neural Engine uses real-time machine learning to transform the way you experience photos, gaming, augmented reality, and more.
A breakthrough 12MP camera takes your portraits to the next level with Portrait mode, Portrait Lighting, enhanced bokeh, and all-new Depth Control. The iPhones are splash, water, and dust resistant and are iOS 12—the most advanced mobile operating system, with powerful new tools that make the iPhone more personal. The iPhones come in a range of colours such as gold, space gray, silver and white. Customers can now purchase the all new digital eSIM enabled iPhone XS, XS Max and XR on monthly instalment plans at 0% interest, available with selected credit cards.
A customer is entitled to receive a phone cover, screen protector and discount voucher for selected BOSE products at the point of purchase at selected Customer Care Centres islandwide, on www.dialog.lk and wOw.lk
