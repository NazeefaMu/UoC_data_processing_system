Haemophilia drug storage
Child patients receive refrigerators

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently handed over refrigerators to 73 children suffering from haemophilia, to store their drugs, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, children suffering from haemophilia need to use drugs regularly, and the drugs require refrigeration in order to ensure the safety and quality of them. But most of the parents of the children cannot afford to buy refrigerators for this purpose.
NDB Bank and Rotary International funded the project, spending Rs. 1.5 million. Minister Senaratne commended the institutions which came forward to make the project a reality, he said.
Rotary International Governor Ven. Dr. Bandagiriye Somawansha Thera, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Hemophilia Society President G. B. Godamunna and Rotary International Member Pubudu De Zoysa were present during the ceremony, he added.
