‘Previous regime neglected Puttalam area’

"A single rupee was not allocated by the Urban Development Ministry to the Puttalam division during the previous regime, but the ministry under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe allocated enough funds to develop the area," North Western Provincial Councillor S.H.M. Niyas said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony held to commence rehabilitation work on the Canal Road in the Puttalam town on September 16.
The ceremony was presided by SLMC Youth Organiser for Puttalam 4th division M.A.M.Askin. North Western Provincial Councillor S.H.M.Niyas participated in the ceremony as its Chief Guest.
Niyas said many development works were inaugurated and several others were going on in many parts of the Puttalam division. He said Urban Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem provided fund for them to mark the 17th commemoration of the SLMC founder, M. H. M. Ashraff. "We commenced many development schemes under the theme 'A Lonely tree in a thick forest'. Our national leader was very much insulted during the previous regime. We were treated as prisoners. Though our leader was a minister, many Muslim leaders who were supportive to the former President, prevented our leader from allocating a single rupee for development," he said. "But today the situation has changed. President Maithripala Sirisena received many votes from North East and Eastern part of Sri Lanka in the Presidential election with the support of our leader. Therefore, our leader is respected in Parliament," Niyas said. "We have declared this week for development work. Those who insulted our leader, admire him today for his service," he said.
