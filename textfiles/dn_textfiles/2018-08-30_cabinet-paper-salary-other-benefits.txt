Cabinet paper on salary, other benefits

A Cabinet paper to give stability to the private bus sector by granting fixed salary, EPF, ETF and gratuity for its drivers and conductors will be submitted shortly, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday, during a press briefing at the SLFP headquarters.
“Even though the recent private bus strike was unsuccessful, we have not forgotten the grievances of the operators,” the Minister said. “We need to protect the private bus industry, while addressing the needs of its operators.”
