Rs. 6 b saved by reducing drug prices

 
The Health Ministry was able to save Rs. six billion by reducing prices of 48 drugs, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Dr. Senaratne said officials of 22 drug manufacturing companies have already signed agreements with the ministry to set up drug manufacturing factories in Sri Lanka while 10 will commence production by 2018. It is expected to produce the entire drug requirement  of the country in Sri Lanka by 2019, the minister said during a tour to inspect the construction of several drug manufacturing companies in Horana.
Dr. Senaratne said Sri Lanka can save a lot by manufacturing drugs within the country while the additional production can be sold to foreign countries.
It is planned to promote Sri Lanka as the drug manufacturing hub in South Asia, he said.
Dr. Senaratne inspected the construction activities of Navesta in Millewa and Stregen in Horana.
