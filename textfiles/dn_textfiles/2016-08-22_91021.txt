Millennium Housing Developers invests Rs. 2 billion for two apartments

 
Sri Lanka's leading mega township developer Millennium Housing Developers Plc (MHD) has invested over Rs. 2 billion this year to build the two apartment complexes, Heights at Nawala Road, Colombo 05 and The Heights at Edmonton Road, Colombo 5.
Nawaloka Group Group Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa said that they are targeting the mid range customers and this is the key for their success.
The Heights at Nawala Road Colombov 5 builds on the success of MHD’s extremely successful inaugural high-rise project The Heights at Edmonton Road, Colombo 5 that was sold out in three weeks after launch.
While MHD is well known for township development, the entry of Nawaloka group as majority shareholder and lead contractor is widely seen as a contributory factor in boosting market confidence and demand for MHD high-rise developments.
The Heights at Nawala Road Colombo 5 sees the unveiling of a landmark building incorporating modern living style and energy saving design.
‘It comprises 14 storeys housing 64 intelligently designed units, which maximise space utilisation to deliver superior living spaces of style, elegance and attractive value. More importantly, it is located by the side of the Narahenpita-Nawala main road, promising higher rate of appreciation,’ Marketing Director Mevan Serasinhe said.
He said that Diaspora who wants to retire in Sri Lanka are their main buyers along with expatriates and Sri Lankans.
Six layouts and several exclusive interior designs add individuality and character to the apartments, which include four very unique penthouses – each of them enjoying a panoramic view of Colombo city and outskirts.
Rooftop entertainment area is complete with swimming pool, plush seating and walk path, gym and sitting out areas. A unique Solar PV Net metering system takes the load off residents for powering common areas and amenities.

A home library promises hours of tranquil mental enrichment to residents. Bed rooms and living areas of each apartment are air conditioned for ultimate comfort and are fitted with high quality imported material.
Parking slot for each unit and extra parking for visitors, 24 hour controlled security and standby generators, rain water harvesting system, solar panels for power generation; coin operated automatic laundry service, drivers units within parking area make for luxurious living without sacrificing practicality. Millennium Housing Developers CEO Sisira Weerabahu pointed out that the high rise projects are managed through MC Urban Developers Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of MHD.
