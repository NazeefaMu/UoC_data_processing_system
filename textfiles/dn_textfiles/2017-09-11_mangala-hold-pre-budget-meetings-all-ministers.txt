Mangala to hold pre-budget meetings with all Ministers

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has decided to hold preparatory meetings with Ministers in charge of all Ministries individually before formulating the 2018 budget.
These meetings would be crucial to incorporate ministry level proposals in the 2018 budget to ensure the success of the socio–economic and welfare programme envisaged by the government.
“The people oriented proposals made by the Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister’s office and all Ministers would be considered in depth at the discussion held by Minister Samaraweera with all Ministers. Discussions with Treasury and high officials of Ministers are already underway as a precursor to the meetings with Ministers,” Director General of the Budget K.D.S. Ruwanchandra said.
The Government’s ‘Vision 2025’ programme aimed at transforming the country into a developed nation was unveiled by the President and the Prime Minister in Colombo recently. The 2018 budget would be introduced with the aim of achieving its objectives with the 2018-2020 mid-term economic vision in view.
