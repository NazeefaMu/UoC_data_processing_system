Liquor shops to be  closed during Avurudu

The government had decided to close down all registered liquor shops countrywide for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year Festival (Avurudu), from April 13 to 14. All Assistant Excise Commissioners and District Excise Superintendents had been instructed on the matter.
The said move was forwarded in order to minimise road accidents and crime during the festive season due to liquor consumption, Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake said, while addressing a meeting for Kurunegala Grama Niladharies which was held on Wednesday (11), at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre in Kurunegala.
