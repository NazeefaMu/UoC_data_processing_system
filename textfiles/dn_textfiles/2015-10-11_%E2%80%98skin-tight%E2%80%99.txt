‘Skin-Tight’

If flawless skin is everybody’s dream, wide and ‘large pores’ are surely the worst nightmare! Fortunately there are certain remedies that can help reduce the size of your pores and make your skin look healthy and flawless. Hasini Gunasekera talks to T n’C on how to get rid of enlarged pores and maintain healthy skin.
Q: Can the size of open pores on your skin be permanently tightened through natural remedies?
A: Open or large pores on the skin are a concern for many and can also contribute to problems like acne and blackheads, especially for people with oily skin.
Two effective natural remedies for tightening open pores are;
Ice
Ice works as a simple and effective home remedy to help shrink large pores due to its skin tightening effect. It is often used to minimize enlarged pores before applying makeup. It will also stimulate circulation and promote healthier skin.
Wrap a few ice cubes in a clean cloth and hold it on your skin for 15 to 30 seconds. Do this a few times daily. You can reduce the frequency of use when you see improvement.
Alternatively, you can simply wash your face with ice cold water once daily.
Egg Whites
Egg whites are also widely used to shrink enlarged pores because they tone and tighten the skin. Egg white masks are also great for drawing excess oil out of greasy skin.
Simply whisk an egg white and spread it evenly on your face. Allow it to dry completely, and then rinse it off.

Benefits
Undergoing a laser skin procedure can benefit the youthfulness and beauty of your skin. A laser peel can be performed to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, acne scarring, age spots, birthmarks, and blotchy patches on the skin. It can also improve the skin’s overall texture which can become rough and coarse as a result of accumulated sun damage. Deep laser skin rejuvenations can stimulate the production of new collagen in the lower dermis.
Risks
Laser skin procedures are generally safe when performed by a board-certified dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon. A patient should, however, keep in mind that laser skin complications such as infection or abnormal healing, though infrequent, do occur. Patients who are prone to scarring after a minor injury should not undergo laser skin treatments because of the risk of cosmetic damage.
Hyper pigmentation or permanent darkening of the skin is a prominent risk for darker skinned individuals seeking to undergo the procedure.
You should discuss your medical history at length with your dermatologist before undergoing laser skin treatments. Drug allergies, medical conditions, especially connective tissue and immune disorders, previous surgeries, medications you’re currently taking, and any prior skin treatments can cause complications.
