‘Nearest School is the Best School’ project hampered by certain lethargic officials:Akila

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam claimed that the ‘Nearest School is the Best School’ project (Langama Paasala Hondama Paasala) of the Educatiobn Ministry has been hampered due to the lethargic attitude and behavior of certain education officials at the provincial level and of the provincial politicians.
The Minister said that several officials of the Provincial Education Departments and the Provincial Education Ministries and the provincial level politicians do not properly render their Bservice and the contribution towards the Nearest School if the Best School project.
Under the project 7,000 schools have been selected to develop as the best schools aiming to minimize the highest demand for certain privileged schools.
However, as a result of the weak and lethargic conduct of both the education officials and the provincial politicians, a significant number of school development projects have not been started yet even though necessary funds have already been allocated.
The minister added that both the state officials and the politicians are equally duty bound to render their maximum contribution to the state projects, which are carried out for the betterment of people and the country.
“They should give their contribution for these projects to be carried out efficiently and effectively,” he said.
