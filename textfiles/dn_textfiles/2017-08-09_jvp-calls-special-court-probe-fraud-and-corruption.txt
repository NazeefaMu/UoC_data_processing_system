JVP calls for special Court to probe fraud and corruption

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday stressed the necessity of establishing a special court to expedite the cases on fraud and corruption charges.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, JVP Propaganda Secretary MP Vijitha Herath said appointing the Presidential Commission to investigate any crime or corruption is not enough to ensure good governance. There should be a mechanism to take legal action against those found to be responsible for such cases without delay.
Establishing a special Court for this purpose was an election pledge of President Maithripala Sirisena and his Yahapalana government, he added.
Commenting on a recent statement by Minister Rajitha Senaratne which claimed that Minister Ravi Karunanayake’s alleged connection to the Bond issue is like a ‘bulb of onion’ when compared to the fraud and corruption occurred during the Rajapaksa regime, MP Vijitha Herath said this statement proves that Minister Senarathne had stolen public money being a member of Rajapaksa Regime. He added that Rajitha had leased the Modara Fisheries Harbour to a company for a monthly rental of Rs.125,000 for 25 years without Cabinet approval when he was the Fisheries Minister of Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government.
He further said there is an attempt to sweep the Bond issue under the carpet with Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigning from his ministerial post. “But we won’t let it happen since we have a similar experience where Tilak Marapana resigned from his ministerial portfolio in order to prevent any investigation on Avant Garde case.”
He said that Minister Karunanayake is not the only person who is responsible for the Bond scam and it is necessary to identify all other culprits behind it and take necessary legal action against them without considering their position.
Addressing the occasion, JVP Kalutara District MP Nalinda Jayatissa said all culprits behind the Central Bank Bond scam could be easily identified by checking the call history of United National Party members who were in the COPE committee and being referred to as the ‘Footnote gang’.
