Budget 2018: ushers in new era

We are well on the way to establishing Sri Lanka as an Indian Ocean hub for trade, investment and for global talent. Exports increase our growth, our prosperity and our profits. They benefit us all in our island nation and they work hand in hand with the strategy we are focusing on as a government to build a strong economy. Our global competitiveness, our resilience and our credibility are rising. We are passionate about building a robust and successful Sri Lankan economy and look forward to a bright future.
Sri Lanka has truly come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa – who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was in a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety. Sometimes we forget how far we have progressed as a nation. Our country has enormous potential and we have strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and we are assured that under our Government Sri Lanka’s international reputation is restored and strong.
Access to investment
Our government is working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans. So far we have created more than 400,000 jobs and helped over 200,000 families secure a home. This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and build a stronger economy for a better future of all Sri Lankans.
We have a proven record, a clear vision and the determination and strong leadership to build a better Sri Lanka for the future. In order to do so, the economy is central to everything we do.
Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools, hospitals, jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
The Government’s Budget promoted enterprise and prized development and trade. A prime objective of this is to assist the business community by offering them credit under more flexible terms as we set up a special Bank for Development Finance to assist the business community. We will strip away unnecessary bureaucracy and hurdles to receiving investment and make the process easier. This will mean access to credit for entrepreneurs at non punitive and affordable rates. Giving young people access to investment and creating wealth and jobs.
Rajapaksa regime
We are able to do this because we have effectively managed our nation’s debt. In the near future the Rs three trillion debt we inherited from the Rajapaksa regime will be settled. Then we will be an even stronger position to give a helping hand to business, to entrepreneurs and to our future. Investing billions to ensure our people get education, skills training and can find jobs.
So we are making sure investment reaches the right people and expanding schemes to help Sri Lankan business and entrepreneurs making sure those who deserve backing and support receive it.
Last week saw a Budget to build a stronger economy. It was a Budget for enterprise. Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.
