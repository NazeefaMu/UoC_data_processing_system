Kurunegala records 1,112 dengue patients

About 1,112 dengue patients had been detected from different parts of the Kurunegala district during the past four months and the Ministry of Health had confirmed the said figures.
Kurunegala District Health Services Director Dr. Champa J. Aluthweera told the media that a majority of dengue patients had been detected from the Ridigama MOH division, while many government office premises had been found to host mosquito-breeding grounds during recent inspection programmes.
“Errant government authorities would be legally punished with immediate effect and two mosquito-control weeks are to be initiated during the next two months covering both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP), under the guidance of NWP Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake,” Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake said yesterday, when he was contacted by the Daily News.
