'Joint Male Lanka promotion need of the day'

 Veteran travel agent, Ravi Jasingha who had been promoting both Sri Lanka and Maldives for the past three decades from Italy said that today a joint Male Lanka promotion would be more successful.
The two neighboring countries having good political and economic ties for over 100 years and now a joint tourism marketing campaign would be more effective rather than both countries doing it alone.
“The two countries are separated by just 50 minutes of flying time and there are nearly 20 flights per day between the two destinations.” He said that from a point of view of a traveler he or she would get more value for money if the sandy white calm beaches of the Maldives are offered to them for few nights and then the rich bio diversity and culture and adventure of Sri Lanka offered to them later. The best package that can be offered is to fly to Maldives and then fly out from Colombo. He said that a veteran hotelier Paddy Withana is now heading Sri Lanka Tourism and this is a great asset to the industry.
“He can see the industry as well as the government prospective and this is great. He said that he had been promoting Universal Resorts in the Maldives and the response they get from the Maldivian government is very encouraging. ss
