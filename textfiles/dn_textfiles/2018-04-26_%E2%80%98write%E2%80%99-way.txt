The ‘write’ way

He does not quite fit the image of the “typical author” . He is neither the gray haired, bearded professor nor the middle aged motivation speaker turned wordsmith. You may think that all published writers have spent many years honing their craft but believe it or not, Thanuwana Serasinghe experienced publishing success when he was four years old.
The Sri Lankan boy who resides in Victoria, Seychelles has gone down in history as the youngest author ever to publish a book. He beat the Guinness record set by Adauto Kovalski Da Silva of Brazil for publishing a book at the age of five years and 302 days. Thanuwana had been four years and 356 days old when he had achieved this feat. His book titled ‘Junk Food’ is based on a story of a boy’s who moves away from his habit of eating chocolates and sweets to become a healthy eater. The book, a Sooriya Publication was launched at the Sri Lanka High Commission in Seychelles on November 24, 2017. Copies of his book were presented to Seychelles Vice President Vincent Meritone and Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Seychelles Tikiri Herath Gunathilake.
Writing a book at such a young age is not the only remarkable thing about this lad. He was able to write alphabets of seven different languages: English, Sinhala, Russian, Greek, Hiragana (Japanese), Katakana, Arabic even before he started kindergarten.

Thanuwana had been an avid reader and has had a thirst for knowledge from his tender years. He started scribbling all over the house when he was about one and half years. No wall, flooring, furniture or pantry cupboard was spared from this toddler who went wild whenever he got his hands on a pen, pencil or marker. His parents Thusitha and Apsara Serasinghe who are strong believers in letting children express themselves freely, did not try to stop him. The tiny tot soon learnt the English alphabet all by himself. Since he showed signs of being eager to learn phonics they let him watch some educational videos on YouTube. By two and half years Thanuwana was penning the Russian alphabet. He had gone through alphabet videos in the ‘recommended’ section in YouTube and had learnt to master them on his own. By three years he was able to read books that are usually recommended for an eight year old.
“My class teacher in grade one, Ms Mary, noted my flair for writing and motivated me to write stories. ‘Junk Food’ is a result of this endeavour . My brother, Archana, and I wrote stories during that period. He wrote stories based on the ‘Angry Birds’ while I chose to write a tale about junk food because we were learning about healthy food at school then. I wanted to spread the message that junk food is bad for your health,” Thanuwana explained.
Writing the book has not been a difficult task for the youngster but it has taken his parents some time to locate the right publisher. The family is grateful to Athula Jayakody of Sooriya Publishers and Yojani Upananda who did the enchanting illustrations for the book.
He has gotten lots of positive and encouraging feedback from everyone who had read the book. He recently received ‘The Shining World Leadership Award’. The award was presented to him for “his outstanding ability to inspire and touch the hearts of all by lovingly caring for the health and well-being of other children’’.
He notes that becoming the youngest author to publish a book has never been in his or his parents’ mind when he had started this venture. The fact that his work made him a Guinness World record holder has simply blown him away.
“It felt amazing when I was handed over the certificate. I truly felt like a genius!” he added with a smile.
Unfurling his ideas about his ability to pick up diverse languages Thanuwana said that most of the letters are similar to English.
“However the sounds are different. When I was little I liked to write different letters a lot because I saw pictures in them. They look funny. For example, ‘Taa’ in Arabic looks like a smiley face. ‘Thaa’ looks like he has his nose on his forehead. Hiragana letters look like ninjas,” he elaborated.
Thanuwana is a fan of the ‘Beast Quest’ children’s fantasy/adventure series. His favourite author is American writer Dr Seuss because he puts rhymes to good use in his work.
Thanuwana’s father is a Director of Information Technology in Marriott Hotels group and his mother is an educator in the ICT field. His brother is nine years old and is a wizard at math. He has got a High Distinction in Australian Mathematic competition. Thanuwana’s parents have moved to Seychelles in 2003 because they got employment opportunities at the Ministry of Education in Seychelles.
Besides writing Thanuwana is also into painting. He is also enthusiastic about doing mathematics. His ambition is to become a teacher.
“I love teaching. I want to fly to Russia and Japan for further studies before returning to Sri Lanka to teach,” said the six year old who is a grade two student of International School Seychelles.
Recalling memories about Thanuwana’s talents his parents said that they had not pushed him to take up anything. He had simply followed his heart and his interests have varied overtime.
“He is eager to learn maths, about other countries and computer programming. All he wanted was a violin for his sixth birthday. Now he wants to learn how to play it and wants to become a great pianist as well. The only thing which has not changed over the time is his goal of becoming a teacher in the future,” they disclosed.
Another memory which lingers in their mind was when they had seen a news report of a hurricane on TV while they were dining at a restaurant. They could not hear what the news presenter was saying so wondered aloud where it was. Then Thanuwana informed them that the hurricane was in Texas and pointed out the Texas flag in the background on the screen.
“The knowledge that today’s youngsters have in various fields is surprising. We believe that children should have access to the Internet and the latest technology though they need to be monitored closely,” they opined.
The most memorable moment in Thanuwana’s life is his recent trip to Singapore with his family. He hopes to continue with his passion of writing but says that these days some other matters take his time. However thoughts for a new book are already in his mind and he says that the theme would most likely be about health or the human body.
