Plan to provide a doctor per 5,000 people

A plan has been devised to provide a doctor for every 5,000 Sri Lankans. The main objective of this plan is to protect the healthy population from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and other diseases, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said there are around 750 small state hospitals and state owned rural health centres countrywide, but one community physician is available for a large number of people. He cannot deliver a good service because of the large number of people he has to serve.
According to Dr. Bandara, in addition to the community physician, it is expected to appoint another medical officer, a health promotions officer, etc to health centres to offer one doctor per 5,000 persons. A network of laboratories will also be set up connecting the health centres to carry out screening blood tests for healthy persons.
