Mathodam marvel of yore

There are so many legends about Mathodam. Some interpret it as a big port. It is said that there were ancient settlements in Mathota. Some say that the word ‘Mathota’ is derived from a Sinhala word. According to them, the ancient king Mahathuvoda worshipped at that place, therefore, it came to be known as Mathodam. Most people refer to this place as Manthai. In ancient Tamil Sanga literature, Kurunthokai mentions Manthai as Mathodam. Whatever it is, Mathodam was considered as a big seaport. During the South Indian kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandya periods, Lanka was under the rule of King Vijaya.
During that time India and Sri Lanka had very close trade ties. Historical evidence proves that aborigines of Sri Lanka had trade links worldwide through the ancient Mathodam harbour. In the 6th century AD, the first Lankan king married a Pandya princess and she first landed at this port Mathodam. Even so much historical evidence clearly reveals that numerous trade activities took place between the countries such as Greece, China, Rome and Arabia.
Hence it is understood that Greeks, Chinese, Romans and were involved in the active trade activities at Mathodam port. In other words, it was said that once this place flourished as an international trade centre. Mathota was also called Mantotam, or by the name Maha Thota. The great Saiva Saints Thirugnasampanther and Sunderamoorthy Nayanar also sang beautiful Saiva hymns (Thevarams) on Mathodam. There is evidence to the effect that famed Arunakiri Nathar worshipped this temple in the 15th century AD and composed beautiful songs on Thiruketheeswaram.
Even Mahavamsa and Rajavali, also mentioned about Mathodam. Another historical fact propagates that the second wife of Lankan king Vijaya, the Pandya princess along with her associates landed at Mathoda. According to historical evidence, the Pandya soldiers landed at Mhathertham.
Historical evidence reveals that during the rule of Ellalan of Tamil land he was involved in a confrontation with King Thudakaimunu of Lanka and the Ellalan’s battalion landed at Mathodam with 3, 000 troops from India. According to W S Poku, a historian, Arabians landed at Mathodam with a view to do trade, in the North West of Thiruketheeswaram. There is a particular variety of tree named ‘Perku’ seen at this site. These trees could not be seen anywhere else in the country. According to W.S. Poku, this particular tree was cultivated by Arabian traders to feed camels.
Even so, many alien coins especially Romanian coins, Dutch coins and some of the ancient Jaffna coins were also found at Mathodam. All these clearly indicate that Thiruketheeswaram was once was flourishing as one of the most important commercial centres of the world.
Further, it was said that during the Great Chola King Rajaraja Cholan named this temple as Rajaraja-Iswaram because it was a magnificent temple which stood majestically and decorated with beautiful Dravidian architecture and sculptures. According to historical evidence, Rajaraja Cholan’s son Rajendra Cholan in A.D.1028 captured Lanka and named the temple as Rajaraja-Iswaram. It further states that during that period the extent of the area was nearly ten miles. But today the original Thiruketheeswaram temple area could be found near the present Thiruketheeswaram in ruins.
It is interesting to mention that near the Thiruchenthur temple in India a seaport area called Kulasekara Padanam existed. At that port Kulasekara Padanam import and export business took place. It was said that the location of Mathodam seaport was just opposite this ancient port. Saint Sundar at one place in his famed Thiruketheeswaram Thirupathikam said ‘Vangammalikenra Kadal Mathodam’ and again in another hymn, he says ‘Vaiyammalikenrakadal Mahthoda Nannakar’.
Even during the 3rd century B.C, commodity exchange trade took place at Mathoda port. In the 5th century BC, evidence reveals that Mahthodam became one of the world famous seaports. So many nationalities were involved in the trading businesses at Mathodam. Romans, Egyptians, Greeks, Chinese, Arabians and Tamils were involved in the commodity exchange trade business. Precious stones, conch, ivory, tortoise shells, elephants, monkeys and peacocks were exported from Mathoda port. Expensive utensils such as clay pots, sandalwood, silk, wool, black pepper and horses were imported from other countries.
The marine trade activities started declining in the 6thcentury A.D, due to the introduction of currency. The barter system declined gradually. However, marine trade took place until the 12th century AD. At the end of the 13th century AD, the sea trade activities declined slowly. However, the decline of marine trade activities did not affect the influx of pilgrims to the Thiruketheeswaram temple. Due to the fall in sea trade, the overall economy was affected. Even the ancient seaport Mathodam lost all its glory and the century-old prosperity and popularity.
In 1545 A.D. the sea engulfed certain portions of the Mathodam city. Despite such problems poojas at Thiruketheeswaram temple took place daily till 1585. Then the Portuguese invaded the temple and looted all the valuables including the idols, golden ornaments and sculptures.
When the local people came to know that the Portuguese were planning to loot the temple, they removed the valuables including the Sri Sounthari Aman statute and smuggled them to Anuradhapura. On their way to Anuradhapura, while crossing the Madu Matha temple they installed the Sri Sounthari Amman idol and built a small temple there. Till today daily poojas are performed to the Sri Sounthari Aman idol. It is believed that Amman Vikeramam (idol) is the Amman idol of Thiruketheeswaram.
The Portuguese not only looted the valuables but also destroyed the temple including the parapet wall and the majestic Rajakopuram. They took away the granite and built the Mannarharbour. With the passage of time, the whole temple was covered with sand. Later the entire area was gradually covered with thick jungle.
Mathodam and Thiruketheeswaram faced a vast destruction in the 16th century A.D. Till the 19th century A.D. Sri Lankan Saiva devotees and the entire Saiva world didn’t hear anything much about the Thiruketheeswaram and its glories.
