Hawa Eliya students given redress

The toilets at the Hawa Eliya Sri Vajiragnana Vidyalaya in Nuwara Eliya have been in a deplorable condition for many months, Nuwara Eliya District PHI Gamini Perera said.
He said the students underwent severe health threats since they have no other option but to use the toilets during the school hours.
Principal Leslie Jayasena said the toilets were flooded since the drains were blocked in heavy rains. The drainage system was cleaned using a backhoe recently and the toilets are now clean and ready for students’ use.
