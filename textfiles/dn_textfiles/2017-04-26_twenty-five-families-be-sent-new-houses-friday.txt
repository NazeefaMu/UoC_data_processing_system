Twenty five families to be sent to new houses by Friday

Twenty five families displaced in the Meethotamulla tragedy will be resettled this Friday at the houses made after converting the former Government paddy store at Wellampitiya into a residential facility.
Sri Lanka Navy Captain and Director Operations Kapila Ubesekera said 168 officers provided a yeoman service to the project proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“The officers work day and night without any extra pay on the directives of Civil Defence Director General Chandrarathna Pallegama.
This spirit has enabled us to provide shelter to the first 25 families now in the Terence Vidyalaya. The school has to be given back to commence classes.
The balance will be moved to the paddy store. Altogether 75 families would be settled here,” Captain Ubesekera said.
He said the people living at the paddy store will have the basic facilities. “We have also taken steps to repair 50 ventilators to minimise the unusual heat prevailing at present,” he said.
Captain Ubesekera said each family will have a 300 square metre space. The funds to cover expenses will be borne by the Civil Defence Department with the assistance the Divi Neguma, LECO, National Water Board and CMC among others.
Kolonnawa Urban Council former Chairman Ravindra Udayakantha said he appreciate the steps taken by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to provide facilities to victims.
Udayakantha said he was able to save 40 people whose houses had signs of collapse with multiple cracks on the walls, about two weeks ago with the assistance of the people .
He thanked CMC Commissioner V. K. Anura for taking appropriate action on his (V.K. Anura’s) request to move eight families living close to the garbage site .
“They would have been among the buried if not for the people and officers,” he said.
