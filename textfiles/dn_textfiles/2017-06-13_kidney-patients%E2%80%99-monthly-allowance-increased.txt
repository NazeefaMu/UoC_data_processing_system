Kidney patients’ monthly allowance increased

The government has increased the monthly allowance granted to kidney patients at present. Accordingly, each patient would receive Rs. 5,000 per month. They received only Rs. 3,000 earlier.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed authorities to increase this allowance with immediate effect, said former Divisional Secretary for Bingiriya W. E. Jayathilaka.
