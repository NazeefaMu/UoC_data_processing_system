High-tech ambulances with Austrian loans

Sri Lanka will soon have a modern ambulance service, similar to that which exists in Europe, with the help of loans obtained from Austria, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after accepting 20 ambulances with high-tech equipment from Austria recently, Minister Senaratne said that this is the first batch of ambulances obtained under an Austrian loan scheme. The price of one ambulance is Rs. 18 million. Under the first phase of the project, 100 Benz ambulances will be obtained and another 100 will be obtained under the second phase.
The Minister said a Cabinet paper will be submitted to import another 200 ambulances.
The government has already ordered 250 ambulances and they will be distributed among state hospitals soon.
The government plans to provide an emergency treatment unit (ETU), two wards and an ambulance for each primary health care unit in the country.
Minister Senaratne said the Austrian government does not charge interest on the loans granted for the ambulances.
Annually around 25,000 Lankans die from accidents. Most of the accident victims die due to the delay in transporting them to a hospital, he said.
