A letter to Sports Editor : The Royal-Trinity Bradby fiasco – an eye witness’ view

 This describes the summary of chain of events at Kandy on 15th May soon after the Bradby, which most of the anti-Royalists don’t want to know and don’t want to reveal as a result of jealousy.
No one is condoning the violence. There’s a lot than most people are not aware of:
1. Both team captains did shake hands on stage and openly discussed and agreed that Nikhila would raise the shield on the podium. Rahul agreed, but was pushed by the TCK principal at the last minute to get on stage.
2. The fact that most spectators don’t know is that the shield is NOT shared if it ends in a draw. 30 seconds into the brawl both teams were escorted back to the dressing rooms while the drunk Old Boys fought it out. Both teams only retaliated to punches thrown by spectators which was ridiculous.
3. The teams made up and enjoyed the Bradby dinner together. The Trinity team lined up to welcome the Royal College team which was pretty awesome!
There’s a lot the masses don’t know simply because judgements are made based on a 30 seconds video clip. In fact two past captains and current Royal College Rugby Advisory committee members Rajiv Malalasekera and Zulki Hamid were repeatedly asking the Trinity principal as to why he was being so stubborn and ‘not following the rules’.
The situation could have been avoided if the Trinity organizing committee was around and was aware of how to handle this situation. Trinity principal should understand traditions and respect past captains a bit more.
Again, no one is justifying violence but both teams were forced into this situation but made up soon after like true champions. None of the media outfits have put that info out there because good news never gets enough attention.
The only fact remaining is that the organizing committees and school administration should take full responsibility and ensure it never happens again.
