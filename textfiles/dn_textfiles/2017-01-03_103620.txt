We need to commit more for country’s progress’  - Army Commander

Protection of the territorial integrity of the country, commitment to support the ‘Year of Poverty Alleviation’ programme of the President, allegiance to the continued commitment and dedication for the country's prosperity, determination to maintain the highest degree of discipline at all levels and to reach the best of professional standards should be among the prioritised concerns in the Army for the year 2017, Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva said.
He was speaking to a cross section of the officers and other rankers at the Army Headquarters to mark the first working day in the New Year yesterday.
The Army Commander hoisted the National Flag while Chief of Staff Major General Channa Goonetilleke raised the Army flag to be in line with military formalities. The Army Chief emphasizsd the importance of strict compliance with guidelines and instructions, being issued from the Army Headquarters to peripheral formations since all are responsible for the correct expenditure of public funds.
He also reminded the attendees to perform their duties to the best of their capabilities for the best interest of the public who are footing the cost of the salaries of the army personnel. “We are a different organisation dedicated for the protection of the country at all times and our services of multi-faceted nature are most sought, for which we can be proud of,” the Commander pointed out.
An all rank tea table afterwards culminated the first leg of the day's agenda where the Commander took time off to freely move and speak to the attendees for the customary tea table.
The Commander in his formal message on the dawn of the New Year 2017 emphasised the need for the Army to render their service with utmost dedication, commitment and loyalty to the nation while promoting mutuality, oneness and unity.
