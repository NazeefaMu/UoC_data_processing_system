S. African legend Joost van der Westhuizen dead at 45

Johannesburg: South African legend Joost van der Westhuizen died on Monday aged 45 after a long battle with motor neurone disease, triggering a wave of tributes to one of rugby’s greatest.
The former scrum-half, Springboks captain and 1995 World Cup winner was diagnosed with the condition in 2011 and his declining health had been closely followed by anguished fans around the world.
“It is with great sadness that we confirm the passing of Joost. He passed away in his home surrounded by his loved ones. He will be sorely missed,” the J9 Foundation, which was set up in his name, said on its Facebook page.
As his condition worsened in recent days, South African President Jacob Zuma described van der Westhuizen as “one of the best rugby players that the country has ever produced”.
The rugby world was quick to express its condolences, with Irish great Brian O’Driscoll tweeting: “RIP Joost van der Westhuizen. An incredible player and fighter to the end.”
“Joost will be remembered as one of the greatest Springboks -- not only of his generation, but of all time,” said Mark Alexander, president of SA Rugby.
“As a player, he lifted the Rugby World Cup, Tri-Nations and Currie Cup while establishing himself as one of the best scrum-halves world rugby has ever seen.
“He also became an inspiration and hero to many fellow sufferers of this terrible disease.
“We all marvelled at his bravery, his fortitude and his uncomplaining acceptance of this terrible burden.” AFP
