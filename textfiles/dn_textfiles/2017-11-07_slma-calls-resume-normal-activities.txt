SLMA calls to resume normal activities

The Sri Lankan Medical Association (SLMA), yesterday, called on all stakeholders in the current “turmoil in medical education and the health sector” to play their role in ensuring a swift resumption to normal activities.
In a statement released in response to the government’s decision to abolish the SAITM, signed by SLMA President Chandrika Wijayaratne, SLMA made the following demands.
The SLMA called on medical students of state faculties to immediately return to their academic activities, and requested parents’ help in ensuring that they return to such activities.
The SLMA called on the academic staff of all state medical faculties and their trade unions “to create, ensure, and sustain an environment in which students can commence and continue with their interrupted academic activities without any further delay,” and on the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure that all staff of medical faculties perform their duties.
The SLMA also called on medical doctors to maintain the highest standards of professionalism when providing healthcare services. The SLMA requested the government to ensure that all agreements reached with relevant stakeholders be carried out without compromise.
The SLMA’s statement also reiterates its position of concern regarding the limited powers possessed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), insisting that “there is an urgent need to enact legislation to make the SLMC an independent authority with adequate powers to protect the public from unqualified or substandard medical practitioners.”
