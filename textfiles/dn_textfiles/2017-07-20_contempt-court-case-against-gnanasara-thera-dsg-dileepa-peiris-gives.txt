Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera: DSG Dileepa Peiris gives evidence

Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris yesterday, identified Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera in the Court of Appeal as the person who was involved in the alleged offensive behaviour at the Homagama Magistrate’s Court on January 25 last year.
DSG Dileepa Peiris gave evidence regarding the contempt of court action filed against Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court. When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, DSG Peiris informed that in the evening of January 25, 2016, he got to know through a policemen at the court premises that Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address the Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
Meanwhile, former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate informed Court that he firmly determined to take legal action against the monk since the offence took place in his presence.
He further said he had never experienced such an offensive behavior by a person in his 12 years judicial career. Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made these remarks in response to a query made by President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva.
Meanwhile, Magistrate Range Dissanayake yesterday, concluded his evidence and DSG Peiris will further testify on the next date of inquiry.
“Gnanasara Thera began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings.
He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept ‘White Man’s Law’ (suddage neethiya) and requested for the release of remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings, but he continued to do so,” the Magistrate said.
