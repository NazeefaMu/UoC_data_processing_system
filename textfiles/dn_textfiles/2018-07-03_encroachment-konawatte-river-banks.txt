Encroachment on Konawatte River banks

Land on either side of the Konawatte river running across the village of Addalaichenai has been encroached upon.
The Land Commissioner of the Eastern Province has put up notice to the effect that the land encroached upon is crown land and encroachment is illegal.
The members of the public have been informed to report such encroachment to the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretary T.J. Athisayaraj. Konawatte River has also become an environmental hazard as garbage and dirty water from nearby hotels and houses seem to be directed to the river.
Residents urge authorities to look into the matter immediately as dengue is raising its head again in the area.
