Building an architect!

The Architecture program of the University of Moratuwa is based on the conviction that nurturing of future architects must coincide with local building needs and aspirations, thus promoting necessary cultural dialogues and reflections, and facilitating professional development in critical directions. ArchWorld speaks to Head Department of Architecture Archt. Dr. U.G.D. Weerasinghe on the need to create professionals who could shoulder the national needs with sensitivity to local environment, professional context and social necessities while being exposed to the changing international discourses, developments and concerns.
Architecture Faculty is one of the five faculties at Moratuwa University. There are four departments in the Faculty of Architecture: the Departments of Architecture, Building Economics, Town and Country Planning and Integrated Design.

Recent Courses
“In the Architecture department we are conducting a five year Bachelor of Architecture honors degree (B.Arch.) course. The Architecture program had started around 50 years ago. Recently we started a Bachelor in Landscape Architecture Course which is of four years duration. The Department conducts Masters programs in Urban Design, Interior Design and Architectural Conservation of Monuments and Sites. For B.Arch. the annual intake is 60 and for Landscape Architecture it is 50. In the Bachelor of Architecture program we are increasing the intake gradually. In about three years’ time it will reach 80,” said Weerasinghe.
To enter these undergraduate courses the students have to pass the Advanced Level examination and then pass an aptitude test conducted by the University. About 3000 – 3500 students sit the aptitude test. The final selection is made by the UGC where the other criteria also comes in. The demand for Architecture course is very high.

“The Departments’ academic vision, as documented by the Department, is based on five major positions of architectural inquiry: social craft, environmental response, material practice, human element and intellectual pursuit. The five major positions, as documented and summarized are as follows:
Architecture as a social craft
Firstly, we instill in our students the need to assess architecture as a social craft, thus framing the function of architecture as a social and inclusive art, and acknowledging the architect’s inexorable role as a responsible practitioner, thinker and member of the society at large.
Secondly, we expand our students’ sense of responsibility towards recognizing architecture as an environmental response, through a strong research and theoretical content that examines how buildings perform in relation to specific climatic, topographic and typological conditions.
Thirdly, we emphasize on the role of architecture as a material practice, imparting our students with the necessary skills and competency in determining tectonic systems, solutions and advancements, and capacity to understand how design ideas are attuned to meet building performance challenges.
Fourthly, we are committed to produce graduates who understand architecture as a process that acknowledges – and involves - the human element. Being respectful towards social needs, understanding peculiarities of the building users, and acknowledging building as a social process that involves a team of building actors and decision makers in its making, etc.
Intellectual pursuit
Finally, we encourage students to view architecture as an intellectual pursuit, which not only concerns design narration, philosophy and aesthetics, but also include their ability to systematize, determine and communicate the technicalities of negotiating the art and science of an architectural approach,” explained Weerasinghe

Based on the five positions mentioned above, each semester is organized under a specific theme of investigation formulated for the academic semesters of the: Environment, Craft, Space, Technology, Context, Building Process, Society, Place, and Profession.
In the architecture program the main component is design.
“Understanding the needs of the client is an essential factor the students are trained to respond to. But that is only one facet. They acquire skills to respond to the context of a design project; the physical, social, economic and environmental context, keeping in mind the economic factors, and income level of the client while ensuring sustainability and technological competence of the design solutions as well. In a nutshell those are the things we teach them to be sensitive to. Further, most of the design projects attempt to resolve real life issues, where the students go out to the field and meet clients, relevant organizations and collect data. They respond to real life issues.” said Archt. Dr. U.G.D. Weerasinghe
Then there is a wide range of theory subjects which are supportive and contribute to design, for example, on theory and history of architecture, structural principles, use of materials, response to climate, management and profession, to name a few. All these inputs contribute towards the design projects of the students.

“According to the Department’s academic position, the Level 1 curriculum introduces students to spatial, cultural and compositional ideas, strategies and skills, which form the basis of creating an architectural vision and an architectural response, to interrogate and communicate notions that explore architecture as an environmental response, a social craft and a spatial art.
The specific inquiries in the Level 2 focus on the notions of 'space' and 'technology', triggering student's imagination, curiosity and individuality, while introducing them to the pragmatics of building design and production.
In Level 3, the theoretical spotlight falls onto the inevitable relationship architectural design weaves with its physical context in general, and with the spaces, forms and people of an urban realm in particular. At the conclusion of this phase - in the Level 3 of the academic program - all students take a Major Design Project (MDP) to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquired during the first 3 years of their architectural education. During the second semester of Level 3, students are formally apprenticed in professional practice under a Chartered Architect through a monitored training program.
The Level 4 academic program encourages students to critically evaluate - and respond to - both tangible and intangible objectives, concerns and situations, which determine the role of architectural profession in responding to specific societal and place-centric attributes of building production.
In Level 5, to demonstrate the knowledge they have thus far acquired on architectural design and practice, the students complete a Comprehensive Design Project (CDP) and a Dissertation on a preferred area of study. For the Comprehensive Design Project (CDP), each student selects an actual project. It is a very comprehensive exercise. Meeting with clients and data collections from relevant organizations are carried out by the students. There are of course a diverse range of projects undertaken by students,” elucidated Weerasinghe.
B.Arch. course is recognized by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects.
“We got RIBA recognition more than 30 years ago. Every five years it is re-validated. Every year, the final design project (CDP) is evaluated by a local panel and moderated by an international panel. The final moderation panel is composed of an experienced academic of high repute from the UK who represents RIBA, another examiner from the Asian region and a similarly experienced and reputed Chartered Architect from Sri Lanka. They evaluate the final design project,” informed Weerasinghe.
The students are very much encouraged to work in design studios to develop their designs.
“Design tutoring is one-to-one, where the lecturer instructs and guides each student individually. Being in contact with each student and guiding them in their design projects is a unique and rewarding experience. There is a lot of diversity in way students respond to design issues.
Though strenuous, it is never monotonous and is refreshing. My final message to any student would be, as professionals and beneficiaries of free education, to become useful citizens, and to serve society with honesty and integrity,” shared Weerasinghe.
