Edirisinghe Brothers Hybrid Hub and SLIC to facilitate hybrid vehicle clinics

Edirisinghe Brothers’ Hybrid Hub and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) have come together once more to host more Hybrid Vehicle Clinics similar to the inaugural programme carried out in December 2017 at Racecourse, Colombo 7.
More Hybrid Car Clinics are to take place in other major cities across the island, including one in Colombo within the next six months. The Hybrid Vehicle Clinics will allow vehicle owners opportunities to have a multi-point vehicle health check done by the Hybrid Vehicle Experts free of charge and obtain advice on ‘Hybrid-Grade’ preventive maintenance in addition to Hybrid vehicle operating ‘tips’ to maximize efficiency and avoid unnecessary repairs.
Commenting on the initiative Co-Chief Operating Officer of Edirisinghe Brothers' Hybrid Hub, Sanka Edirisinghe said, “Hybrid vehicles are somewhat different from conventional petrol or diesel powered vehicles in terms of the technology involved and requires a different approach to maintenance. This specialty approach is vital in order to prevent expensive repairs which may occur at a later period.

Vignettes of the event
Hybrid vehicles require technicians and service advisors with in-depth knowledge about the technology behind the vehicle as well as specific training. Hence, we at Hybrid Hub use our dedicated training facilities to follow onsite training combined with online training programmes with our technology partners based in the U.S.A. and Singapore. We consider it an honour to partner with the leading Motor Insurer - Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to initiate programmes such as this to create awareness of Hybrid vehicle maintenance.”
The Hybrid vehicle clinic held in December saw over 50 of SLIC customers and walk-in customers treated to a free health-check and diagnosis of their hybrid vehicles and were educated on the vast technology and vehicle operating best practices tips by Hybrid Hub specialists.
“With the Sri Lankan Hybrid vehicle market growing, SLIC was keen to address many of our customers’ predicament of being unaware of basic maintenance knowledge required for a Hybrid vehicle.
The last Hybrid Vehicle Clinic with Hybrid Hub was well received by our MotorPlus customers and from other Hybrid vehicle owners. Given the positive response and to provide a further opportunity for those who would have missed the clinic in December 2017, multiple clinics will be introduced to include regions such as the Central Province. SLIC being a pioneer in the insurance sector, it was important for us to partner with a like-minded partner with industry expertise - we are indeed privileged to collaborate with Edirisinghe Brothers”, commented a spokesperson from SLIC.
Hybrid vehicles unlike the traditional petrol and diesel vehicles, is a technology centric vehicle that requires preventive maintenance on a periodical basis, to mitigate unnecessary and expensive repairs. Combined experience and market insights by both Hybrid Hub and MotorPlus has helped to identify a considerable shortage in understanding preventive maintenance and service facilities that are specialized for hybrid vehicles.
With the initiation of similar programmes, Hybrid Hub and SLIC hope to generate further awareness and understanding of the inner works of Hybrid vehicles and the need for specialized care.
