Indecent police officers must resign: IGP

“Officers who don’t speak decently, understand people’s problems humanely and act maliciously should resign from their posts as they have no place in the Police Service,” IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
He was addressing the gathering at a social service programme held at the Mallawapitiya Elders’ Home where the Police, Buddhist and religious officers donated a set of equipment for the use of its inmates on November 11.
The IGP said a very peaceful situation prevails today in the country with freedom of speech and association fully restored.
“Even the President and the Prime Minister had become targets of criticism and verbal attacks since the country has unbridled freedom. Those who misappropriated millions of public funds and stacked them in foreign banks during the previous regime now criticise the Government.
He said the Police Service had undergone a major transformation under the guidance of the President, the Prime Minister and the Law and Order Minister. “The crime rate in the country will reduce by 75 percent by the end of this year,” he said.
