Point of View
Markets lost a marginal 9 points over the week with average turnover levels hovering around LKR 0.83bn. Markets see-sawed this week as gains on Wednesday and Thursday (+38.4 points) which is largely due to the new appointments to the cabinet helped pare down losses which caused due to devastating floods and landslides that weighed on sentiment at the start of the week (-42.6 points).
Average turnover levels therefore were dwindling around LKR 0.83bn during the week, 29% lower than last week's average turnover levels of LKR 1.07Bn and 9% lower than the year's average turnover levels (0.91Bn).
Large parcels in Commercial Bank (73% of the total crossings), SAMP (15% of the total crossings), Lion Brewery (9% of the total crossings) however helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover as total crossings accounted for 48% of total market turnover.
Foreign investors too remained on sidelines this week as the total net inflows amounted to LKR 142.75Mn during the week, 89.71% lower than last week's average inflows of LKR 1.39Bn. Similar market momentum is likely to prevail in the week ahead amid some profit taking.
