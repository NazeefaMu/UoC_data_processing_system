A welcome move

As the name implies, the World Wide Web (WWW) is a borderless, limitless web of information available worldwide. The WWW is only around 25-years-old, though the Internet itself goes back to 1969. The WWW has truly revolutionized our lives during the last quarter century, with any information just a mouse click away. Thanks to the power of the Net, we can talk for free to a person on the other side of the world or get a cab to our doorstep in minutes.
But like everything else in life, the Internet comes with a few caveats. The biggest concern is that not everything one can find in the Net is true. The sprawling nature of the Internet means that it is very difficult to monitor and control the massive flow of information that originates from thousands of different physical locations. Geography has no bearing on the Internet – if you have a smartphone or computer, you can reach out to billions of people at once.
Two events that took place more or less a decade ago have had a profound effect on our lives. The establishment of Facebook in 2004 changed forever the way we interact with the Internet. Here was an opportunity to express our thoughts for our friends and associates to see and share. We could upload those vacation pictures to make everyone go green with envy. We could chat and share files. The new term “social media” was coined to encapsulate what all this was about. Facebook was followed by the likes of Twitter (2006), Instagram and communications-oriented apps such as What’s App.
The other major event was the invention of the smartphone. Suddenly, the power of the Internet was in our hands – literally. Facebook has since expanded astronomically to over 2.2 billion active users as handset prices fell rapidly.
Facebook’s biggest problem was that there was nobody to curate its content or verify the accuracy. It soon became the favourite medium for spreading disinformation, hate, outright lies and what later came to be known as “fake news”. These are items that appear to be true but which are manifestly false, targeted at influencing the public and changing public opinion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has admitted that Facebook is working to fix this major problem.
It was well known for some time that several groups based in Sri Lanka and abroad were using Facebook and several other social media platforms to spread animosity among various communities and religious groups. Among them were many Sri Lankans living abroad who have little or no idea of the ground realities back home. This was a dangerous game that could arouse communal and religious passions.
True to these fears, it was found that Facebook et-al had been used as a tool to incite hate among the Sinhala and Muslim communities in Ginthota, Ampara and Digana, the three recent flashpoints of violence. The Government was quick to curtail access to Facebook and certain apps such as What’s App and Viber in order to contain hate messages. By and large, the public, the media and even the Opposition accepted this as a timely decision. Several persons including schoolboys who posted inflammatory material on Facebook have been taken in for questioning.
Contrary to Opposition allegations that the Government was planning to extend the ban on Facebook for political reasons, several ministers have revealed that full access will be allowed by Friday. What’s App and Viber are already online. There is no doubt that extending the blockage any further would have been economically and socially damaging as thousands depend on these platforms for communication and business.
However, a general consensus has emerged that a mechanism should be evolved to monitor Facebook etc. Hence the authorities are mulling a proposal to set up an institution to monitor social media usage with a view to preventing hate speech. No one can find fault with this rational decision, because the freedom of expression should not be used to spread hate against a particular community or religious group.
There are indications that Facebook itself has taken the incidents in Sri Lanka and its role therein seriously. A team from the social media giant will be visiting Sri Lanka this week to discuss this issue with the authorities and take appropriate action from their side. One concern they have expressed is the lack of personnel conversant in Sinhala to identify hate posts. This can no doubt be addressed by having an office in Sri Lanka itself. Incidentally, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, the only Sri Lankan to have held a top position at Facebook recently criticized it saying “we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works”.
Chamath’s words are almost prophetic in the context of Sri Lanka, where extremists on all sides as well as bankrupt politicians have attempted to rekindle ethnic fires. Our future will be very bleak if we allow them to destroy the very bonds of unity that hold our multi-ethnic society together. These sinister attempts must be defeated at all costs.
