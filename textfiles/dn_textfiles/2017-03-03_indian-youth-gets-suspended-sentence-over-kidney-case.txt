Indian youth gets suspended sentence over kidney case

An Indian youth who pleaded guilty to over-staying in Sri Lanka without having a valid visa and escaping from custody was yesterday sentenced to one year imprisonment suspended for five years by the Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
In addition to the suspended imprisonment, the accused was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 100,000.
However, another two Indians who did not plead guilty to the charges were ordered to be further remanded till March 8.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had filed charge sheets written in English against five Indians arrested in investigations into a kidney racket involving Indians and Sri Lankans and two were sentenced to one year suspended imprisonment after pleading guilty to the charges.
The five Indians were charged under section 45(1) (a) of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act for over staying in Sri Lanka without a valid visa. They were further charged under section 219 of the Penal Code for intentionally escaping from the lawful custody of Immigration and Emigration officers while they were being kept at the Mirihana detention camp.
The CCD had filed charge sheets against five accused Theppala Vikky Raja, Raghavendra Uppara, Sai Vamsi Krishna, Sanmugan Sri Navas and Narasimhappa Ramachandra.
Deputy Solicitor General Chetiya Gunasekara with Colombo Crimes Division unit one OIC Inspector Fernando appeared for the prosecution. Five Indians were arrested by police in Mannar after they escaped from the Mirihana detention camp on November 9, 2016. The Court was informed that police were yet to arrest three other accused who fled the detention camp.
The accused were arrested for overstaying their visas while staying in an apartment at Wellawatte on March 3, 2016.
The CCD had informed Court they were able to seize 286 documents and 26 rubber seals from the possession of the eight accused and these documents were sent to India through Interpol.
