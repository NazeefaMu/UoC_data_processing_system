Pretty Polly needs a home

Polly was in an accident that left her weak and unable to stand on her own. She is a beautiful senior pooch, whose chocolate brown fur makes her truly unique.
Polly is ready for her forever home and she would be ideal for someone who will appreciate the immense love she is able to give, and ensure she is given extra attention and care for the rest of her life.
If you would like to take Polly home, please call us on +94 (76) 681 0848.
