Daraz celebrates two years  in Sri Lanka

With a mere 1% of the retail market, online retail is a high potential industry in countries of the South Asian region. Introducing the technology and knowledge to countries such as Sri Lanka has always been a challenge, as a result of varying barriers such as infrastructure, logistics and finance.
Completing two years since its inception in Sri Lanka, Daraz Sri Lanka, Head of Marketing and Traffic Ops Naresh Krishnan speaking at the Seller Summit spoke about how the online retail platform has been revolutionized and the many enabling systems that have been introduced, for sellers and buyers alike.
According to Naresh, the online retail industry has undergone remarkable change over the past two years, with fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), giants beginning to use the platform in large scale.
The trend is a global shift as one sees all major brands investing more on online retail, as they see where the future lies. Sri Lanka too is fast absorbing the tendency where one sees many FMCG, mobile, automobile, health and beauty, and electronic brands increasing their online presence. The wide range of brands accessible on Daraz.lk is evidence enough for this growing trend. “With our success in sales such as Black Friday, we saw a leap in the number of merchants, from well-known brands wanting to join us.
They have realized that online retail allows them to engage with their customers better. This has been a boost for the platform, and as a result we have been constantly trying to empower them more by introducing new systems,” stated Naresh.
Daraz introduced an upscale seller system which enables the sellers to build their own brand. Daraz has developed a Smart Selling system, which breaks away from the traditional listing of a product on the platform under several categories.
The Seller App which will be launched in the near future will enable sellers to monitor their sales in real-time and on the go, providing more selling opportunities.
Apart from focusing on the direct selling facilities, Daraz has also concentrated on enhancing the support service for a seamless process. The company has developed their own logistics arm with its own fleet to ensure timely distribution.
In addition to a warehouse in Kelaniya, Daraz also owns a sorting centre in Armour Street. 11 Daraz hubs in key towns in the island ensure the widespread reach, as the hubs have their own teams including a customer service agent, store manager and logistics wing. “We at Daraz are very ambitious. We are preparing ourselves for the future market while serving at the present. Therefore our goal is not to only increase traffic to the platform and sell, but also ensure that a reliable system is put to place,” commented Naresh.
The Daraz Seller University is an initiative no other platform has created for local merchants.
This includes the Seller Self Sign-up system which enables merchants to sign up digitally without the hassle of manual documentation or personally meeting agents from Daraz.
Naresh further stated, “with our affiliation to Alibaba, we have further developed our technology and know-how, which we are keen to bring to Sri Lanka.We are eager to see these systems falling to place as Daraz Turns 2”.
