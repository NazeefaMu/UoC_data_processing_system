This Year’s Man Booker International Winner has a favorite for next year…

Olga Tokarczuk and I just won the 2018 Man Booker International, which is this year’s largest and most important prize for world literature since the 2018 Nobel Prize was called off due to a scandal. Needless to say, we’re thrilled. But one of the best things about the whole Man Booker adventure has been getting to know the other translators and writers. And I know exactly who is going to win next year.
On my way to London, I devoured Frank Wynne’s witty, moving, pitch-perfect translation of Virginie Despentes’s incredible Vernon Subutex 1, from MacLehose Press (coming out in the US from FSG next fall). Despentes is a filmmaker and noted feminist critic with numerous other novels under her belt, including Apocalypse Baby, Bye Bye Blondie, King Kong Theory and Pretty Things (coming soon), all published by the Feminist Press and translated by Siân Reynolds, Stéphanie Benson and Emma Ramadan, respectively.
I’ve been getting a lot of good news lately. Among the best of it is the fact that Frank Wynne’s translation of the next volume of Virginie Despentes’s Vernon Subutex trilogy is done and will be out in July. I can’t believe I get to read another one! Let alone two more. Emma Ramadan’s translation of Pretty Things is coming out in August, too.
It’s going to be a great summer. Gearing up to that, I’ve briefly interviewed all four of Despentes’s English translators. Although I posed the same questions to all of them, their responses could not have been more different. The one thing they all shared was an abiding love of Despentes’s glorious prose and unassailable courage.
Frank Wynne, who was shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker International Prize for his translation of Vernon Subutex 1, is an Irish-born translator of French and Spanish and journalist who has lived all over the world and written and translated for many publications. Among his other translations from French into English is Michel Houellebecq’s The Elementary Particles, which won translator and author the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002.
Jennifer Croft: Why did you translate Virginie Despentes?
Frank Wynne: I would probably have gnawed off my right arm for the opportunity (I can type with my left!), but I didn’t have to. The moment I was offered the trilogy, I dropped everything else I was doing. Despentes is one of the most fascinating, brilliant and—to use that wonderful American word—ornery writers to emerge in France in the last 20 years. I found her essays in King Kong Theory angry and dazzling, moving and inspiring, and in a world that has become mealy-mouthed and euphemistic, it was refreshing to come upon a voice that makes no attempt to sugarcoat the ugly, painful chaos that is living. The novel Baise-moi (and Despentes’s subsequent film) was like a slap in the face, brutal and visceral, yet profoundly human—as though Kathy Acker had rewritten Thelma and Louise. This was no meek fantasy of empowerment. It was hardly surprising when I read Vernon Subutex to find those same qualities in this baggy picaresque novel that seems like the bastard lovechild of Zola, Lisa Alther and the young Martin Amis.
Moreover, I recognized the characters in the novel, I grew up with the same music, the same cultural references, have watched friends and acquaintances drift as Vernon’s friends do, into bitterness, disappointment, xenophobia and misanthropy. I was in awe of Despentes’s ability to make even the least attractive characters utterly human, where, say, Jonathan Franzen, would probably have depicted them with barely disguised contempt. This was a sprawling fiction that somehow encapsulated the maxim of the (Black) Roman playwright Terence: Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto, “I am human, nothing human is alien to me.”
JC: If you had to choose one essential quality you were determined to preserve and transmit in your translation, what would it be?
FW: The voices. Virginie’s characters leap off the page. The dialogue—and the narrative voice that follows the characters like a steadicam in a movie—crackles and flares in bursts of anger, wit, melancholy, bitterness. It was like trying to catch lightning in a jam jar. Preserving the narrative shifts between the grave, compassionate voice of Xavier’s mother, the bigoted splutterings of Loïc, the machinegun hipster slang of Kiko—this above all was what I was determined to preserve.
JC: What did you change?
FW: Inevitably, the slang. While French and English have rich veins of slang, they are very different in their construction and their connotations. English has no equivalent of verlan, the syllable transposing slang of the banlieue (well, English has pig-Latin, but no one older than 11 would use it), which is richly inventive, and can fold in on itself endlessly (so Arabe becomes beur, becomes rebu and T’es viestso = t’es soviet = t’es russe = t’es sûr?). As a result, I had to be as imaginative and as creative as possible in reworking the slang. I am grateful to Anne Tyler, from whose novel A Spool of Blue Thread I stole the epithet shitwank.
JC: What was the hardest part about the editing process for this book?
FW: Every publisher has a house style, a system of rules that copy-editors and proofreaders are supposed to adhere to when preparing a manuscript for publication. No contractions or slang terms outside dialogue (can’t, shouldn’t, cop, arsehole). And all expect consistent punctuation. Virginie’s writing obeys none of these rules—nor is there any reason why it should. When I submitted the translation, I included a covering note explaining that “while individual chapters are written in the third person, they echo the thoughts and language… this means that the narrative—though third person—is loose, vernacular and very, very slangy. It cannot and should not be adapted to house style—it is not omniscient narration. Despentes’s punctuation is eccentric but clearly considered and deliberate—lists, including those of subordinate clauses—often appear with no commas. These should not be reinserted—any confusion that exists in English is duplicating the same in French. Virginie also uses embedded dialogue—usually passing from reported to direct speech without a sentence break or inverted commas. Again, this is intentional.” -Literary Hub
