The Joe Biden example

For all her Foreign Policy misadventures the US has raised the bar of governance and responsible leadership that the World and those who seek to truly serve the people must learn from. Joe Biden had been in public office for 43 years. He was electedinto the Senate at 29. Served in the Senate for 35years and 8 years as Vice President yet he couldn’t afford to pay for the expensive cancer treatment of his son who was the Attorney General of his State of Delaware. The son was a Iraq war veteran who served in the Army before he became Attorney General. Biden had to offer his house for sale to be able to pay for the medical care of his son, of course the son must have spent himself out before Biden, the father could come in to help pay the bill. Obama had to stop him from selling his house and offered to pay for the medical care from his own personal money.
Unfortunately the son died but not after the father had given all his best. Delaware is very close to Washington and Biden had come to Washington by train from Delaware everyday for work at the Capitol Hill and back home as a Senator. He will join the train back home on January 20th when he ends his tour of duty as the Vice President of United States. Delaware loves Biden for his years of service to the State and the people of United State. They call him the great son of Delaware. The point here is a man served for 35 years as a Senator and eight years as Vice President and no tonnes of money buried inside his compound and bank accounts.
How and where do politicians in US get their contentment that our own here can’t go and find same. Leadership is about service. It is not a place to become billionaires and millionaires. For Biden, nothing but my admiration and respect.
A very good example of a great leader and it is fitting that Obama gave Joe Biden the public recognition he well earned and deserved.
