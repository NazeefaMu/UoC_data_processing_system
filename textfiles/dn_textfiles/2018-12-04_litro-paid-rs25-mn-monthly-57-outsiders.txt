Litro paid Rs.2.5 mn. monthly to 57 outsiders

The Litro Gas Company made a (pre tax) profit of Rs. 18.6 billion during the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa before 2015. Later (after 2015) it started to make a loss of Rs.200 million. This is obvious because it had paid over Rs. 2.5 million monthly for 57 outsiders, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that in one year, the company had paid Rs. 37.5 million for those persons and during the past three and half years the company had paid over one billion rupees to them.
The law should be implemented against both parties who made the payments and for persons who received the money. Unlike the previous Government, this Government will not imprison Buddhist monks for launching death fasts and for campaigning against the Government. The law will be implemented by the relevant institutions.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga said that this Government and politicians do not have time to waste on taking revenge from the Opposition MPs and their supporters like the previous Government did. This Government has to do a lot of work in order to save the country from the disaster created by the previous Government and to relieve the people from numerous burdens such as taxes, the underworld, etc.
