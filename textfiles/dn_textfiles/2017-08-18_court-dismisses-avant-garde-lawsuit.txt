Court dismisses Avant-Garde lawsuit

The Colombo District Court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited claiming Rs. 2.4 billion as damages from the Navy Commander and the Attorney General.
Colombo Additional District Court Judge M.U. Gunawardena made the order pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited challenging the Sri Lanka Navy’s decision to seize M/V Mahanuwara, a floating armoury vessel of Avant Garde found docked at the Galle Harbour in January, 2015.
The plaintiff alleged that the action purportedly taken by defendants caused colossal loss to the plaintiff company.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleka with Senior State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj had filed preliminary objections challenging the maintainability of the case.
The District Court upheld the preliminary objections raised by defendants and decided to dismiss the lawsuit.
