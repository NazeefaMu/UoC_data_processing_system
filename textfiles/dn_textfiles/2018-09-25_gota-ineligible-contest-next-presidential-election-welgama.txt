Gota, ineligible to contest next  Presidential election - Welgama

Joint Opposition MP Kumar Welgama on Saturday said there was no point in talking about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election as he was a US citizen and therefore ineligible to contest.
He was responding to a question from a journalist following a public event in Kalutara.
When questioned about the possibility of a member of the former President, Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa’s family becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election, Welgama reiterated that he was against a family centred rule.
Kalutara district MP Welgama during a public event last week said former President Rajapaksa should not talk about fielding a member of his own family as the next Presidential hopeful.
He said family bandyism is not suitable for the country and former President Rajapaksa faced defeat at the last presidential election due to this family centred rule.
Welgama considered a close confidante of the ex-President said if a Rajapaksa is going to contest the next polls it should be Mahinda and no one else.
The parliamentarian also said he believed there were no impediments against the former President from contesting the next presidential election.
When he was questioned with regard to allegations that the JO was linked to a conspiracy over alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he responded that the JO has no such killers but there were such people during their government.
