Sneeze Into Your Elbow, Not Your Hand

It’s good to cover up when you cough. But some ways are better than others.When you feel a sneeze or a cough coming on, covering your mouth prevents the spread of infectious germs. You probably knew that.
But the way you cover up also matters, and there are plenty of people who haven’t yet heard the consensus guidance of health officials: If no tissue is available, you should aim into your elbow, not your hand. Even if that means breaking a long-held habit.
“If somebody sneezes into their hands, that creates an opportunity for those germs to be passed on to other people, or contaminate other objects
that people touch,” said Dr. Vincent Hill, chief of the waterborne diseaseprevention branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Germs are most commonly spread by the respiratory droplets emitted from sneezing and coughing. When they land on your hands, they’re transmitted to things like door knobs, elevator buttons and other surfaces the people around you are likely to also touch.
This isn’t just us nagging. Sneezing and coughing into your arm has become the standard suggestion of not just the C.D.C., but also organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association. Even the New York City subway system occasionally runs an announcement asking riders to “cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm or use a tissue.”
