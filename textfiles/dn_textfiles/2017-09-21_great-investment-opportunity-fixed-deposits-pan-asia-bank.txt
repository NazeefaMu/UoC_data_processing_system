Great investment opportunity on fixed deposits from Pan Asia Bank

Pan Asia Bank has come out with a short term fixed Deposit promotion which offers a higher rate of interest on four month fixed deposits where customers get the opportunity of receiving 13.1% annual effective rate on their fixed deposits.
There is no limitation to the amount one can invest and every investment is guaranteed the high return.
In a Fixed Deposit, the return is guaranteed in comparison to most of the other form of investments regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Also it is an easy to understand tried and tested secure investment method which will give peace of mind to any investor.
Apart from offering higher interest rates for deposits, a deposit at Pan Asia Bank is a highly secure investment since Pan Asia Bank is a licensed commercial bank which is regulated by the Central bank of Sri Lanka.
The bank was also recognised as the ‘Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka 2016’ for the fourth consecutive year by Global Banking and Finance Review and it is currently operating with 83 branches and 82 ATM points.
