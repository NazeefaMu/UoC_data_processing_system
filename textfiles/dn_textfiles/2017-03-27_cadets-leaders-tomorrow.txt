Cadets, the leaders of tomorrow

Cadets, neatly dressed in their uniforms and heads held high, stand apart from your ordinary students at school. Their sense of adventure, preparedness, and discipline is a result of vigorous training for many years. But as exams and tuition classes take over, every minute of student life, extra-curricular activities such as cadetting have been given less importance in schools. The Cadet Training Centre in Rantambe, however, is seeking to change this trend. It is the place every cadet dreams of going every year, and it is, according to the cadet trainers, the experience that can change your life.
“It is not only an adventurous trip, but also an experience which teaches you about life,” said National Cadets Corps (NCC) Director Major General A.K.P Wickramasinghe, whose motto he said has been “Always want to train and inspire them to be good citizens”.

The NCC is the Sri Lankan Military Cadet Corps' youth organization sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. Formally known as the Ceylon Cadet Corps, it is open to school students on voluntary basis, and has a history spanning 135 years. The officers are teachers who act as instructors, and the cadets are given basic military training in small arms and parades.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe also stressed that they imprint the importance of education on their cadets. “Cadetting is an additional qualification. It is value-addition to the academic qualification they receive in schools,” he said.
Commandant of the Training Centre, NCC Rantambe, Lieutenant Colonel Palitha Mendis said, there should be a healthy balance between education and cadetting. “Some parents think that cadetting will spoil their children’s education, while some just want to get a certificate. The certificate will not be valid if the students have not understood the core values of cadetting,” he added.
While stressing upon the importance of cadetting in a student’s life, Lieutenant Colonel Mendis added that it would be great if cadetting is incorporated into national policy. “It will help schools maintain discipline, and those students will pass out of schools as useful and well-behaved citizens,” he said.
Cadets are brought to the Cadet Training Centre after one year of training at their respective schools under a teacher who acts as the instructor.
“Only a limited group is taken to the training centre. Usually, the teachers have training sessions in the morning or evening at schools, and that is not easy as the students have the habbit of going to tuition classes now,” explained Lt. Colonel Mendis. He added that the school principals should also show some concern over this and ensure that the students receive quality training at school. “Some schools train the students only a few days before they come for training. We see the difference when they start doing their practices here,” he said.
More Cadets would be given opportunities to be trained in Rantembe
At Rantambe, discipline is instilled from day one. Cadets line up for their daily routine at the Centre, and scheduled activities are executed with great precision—one after another under the watchful eye of an instructor. This schedule given to them on their first day of arrival will remain unchanged throughout their time at the Centre. At the top of the training grounds, a big sign reads, “Never be unprepared”—the NCC motto which would be drilled into the heads of the cadets time and time again by the instructors.
Lt. Colonel Mendis explained that the cadets training schedule also includes lessons on how to clean, eat, and most importantly, how to manage their time.
“All the activities here are done according to a timetable. At the inauguration, the cadets will be given a sheet that clearly explain the schedule and rules that need to be followed during their stay. Teachers in charge of cadets will then take on the responsibility to continue with this practice in their respective schools,” he said.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe further explained that the mission of the NCC was “To train school cadets and inspire cadets using effective training curricula in order to develop character, sportsmanship, self-reliance, discipline, civic-mindedness, spirit of adventure, responsibility, and comradeship to be a valuable human resource of well-trained youth capable of providing leadership in all aspects of life”.
“NCC’s objectives are to encourage leadership, initiative, and teamwork, enhance and promote the image of the youth, encourage them to acquire the basic concept of teamwork and other interpersonal skills in order to produce future leadership, encourage the youth and to inculcate and foster the importance of community service and responsibilities and create an opportunity to develop physically, intellectually, and socially,” he said.
By the end of this year, the NCC also has three objectives to achieve in its own capacity,
“The first objective is to establish new cadet platoons island-wide and conduct cadet training in National schools, MMV and MV. Second, to conduct junior cadetting in 2017 and to increase the number of cadet trainees from 27,000 to 40,000 at the Rantambe Training Centre,” he said.
He further said that according to President Maithripala Sirisena’s concept, initially, 500 cadet platoons would be established in 500 schools, which do not have cadetting at present.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe noted that many new subjects have been included to senior cadetting.
“They are very important for the improvement and performance of the cadets. The new subjects are: leadership and management, positive thinking, personality development, first aid, regimental duties, general knowledge, disaster management, work ethics, and team building,” he said.
Their plans for junior cadetting too, is ambitious, since it was restarted last year. It had been stopped for the last 35 years due to unavoidable reasons.
“The subjects included for junior cadetting are physical training, squad drill, map reading, field trips, first aid, leadership, ethics and manners, confidence and team-building, bullet inspection, and concert,” he said.
There are 38 battalions and 1,873 cadet Platoons island-wide. Currently, they are 5,700 schools that do not take part in Cadets, and the NCC’s aim is to form cadets in every school.
According to Maj. General Wickremasinghe the students who have been cadets have very little chance of being demoralized later in life.
“They get adjusted to the situation and organize themselves. We always ensure that they are well-behaved and disciplined. We correct them by rehabilitating; we do not punish them,” he said.
For Lt. Colonel Mendis, cadetting is more to do with multi-skills development training,
“Parents should also think about attitude-building of students along with their education. The students come here once every year for training. We cannot fully take responsibility for their overall behavior. If they misbehave within the training centre premises, the marks of those cadets will be reduced,” he said.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said the cadets come to Rantambe to improve their leadership, skills but there are also exceptions who misbehave.
“We all know who how children behave. They are impulsive by nature. NCC has a history of 135 years, and has produced thousands of cadets who are in a better position today,” he said, “We never let children misbehave here; we watch them”.
A different experience for students
Cadets from all over the country gather at Rantambe grounds once every year for cadet training. Having been trained in their respective schools for about a year, the cadets come to Rantambe to polish their training through a stricter and a well-organized program.
Here, they learn to fire a gun and cross obstacle paths, train in march pasts and drills, and many more. The cadets are also awarded for their best performance at the end of the training programme.
“It is only the best cadets from every school who are selected for training here. At present, 27,000 cadets are given training annually,” said Maj. General Wickremasinnghe.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said the officers and cadets have no liability for active military service, but many volunteer to join the armed forces.
“It is also an opportunity for the cadets from all parts of the country to mingle, as they come from different religious, social, and economic backgrounds. Whatever their background, all of them will be treated equally. This will create good understanding between the cadets,” he said.
He further said that Hermann Loos Championship Trophy is awarded annually to the best performing cadet platoon from a boys' school, and the De Soysa Champion is awarded annually to the best performing cadet platoon from a girls' school.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said that under the youth action programme, Sri Lanka is also privileged to visit the SAARC countries to join their independence/victory parade. That’s a great advantage for the cadets as well as NCC.
“When talking of education, the cadets also get bonus marks from the University Grants Commission, if they have received Hermann awards. Cadets in senior ranks will also be given extra marks to enter their respective colleges of education,” he said.
He added that NCC cadets also annually participate in the Independence Day parade.
Cadet instructor at the Ampara Hegoda Sri Indrasaara Vidyalaya Captain L.H.K. Priyantha has 10 years of experience in training students for cadetting.
“We train cadets at schools, and we are also given positions in the schools to maintain discipline. The administration also believes that we will be able to handle and control the students better,” he said. He further said that the students are very much interested, and he gives them training every day after school.
The cadet instructor from Akkaraipattu Central College Lieutenant Mohamed Zifan has seven years of experience in cadet training. “I am very proud to say that this is the sixth platoon that I have brought this year for training at Rantembe,” said Zifan.
“Earlier, people had a feeling that these children are being taken to give army training and were reluctant to send their children. Now, we have proven that to be a myth. When the parents see the transformation in their children, in discipline and behaviour, they willingly send their children,” he added.
Lt. Zifan further explained that though parents think that cadet training would be a barrier to the academic process of the children, it was completely untrue.
“It was a challenge for me to select 25 students from all the cadets at school to bring to Rantambe for training. When I said training, they were very excited, and all of them wanted to join. That’s the spirit,” he said. He further said that the training in Rantambe was very special and important to the cadets from his school as it is a novel experience for them.
“It allows them an opportunity to come out of their own village to a different place; engage with cadets from other areas and religions. When they leave home after the training, they carry only positive vibes,” he said.
