Girl who was told  she was paralysed defies odds

A girl who was told she was “paralysed from the skull down” is defying doctors by getting out of her wheelchair to run, rock climb, dance and swim.
Nine-year-old Seattle Lennox, from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, lost her ability to walk after suffering a spinal cord injury called Transverse Myelitis (TM) after suffering a cold at 15 months old.
The paralysis was caused by an inflammation of both sides of a section of the spinal cord that can develop at any time and interrupts messages sent to the rest of the body.
Doctors didn’t think she would survive the attack, which rarely occurs in young children, and believed the best-case scenario was paralysis from the skull down.
However, thanks to years of therapy, Seattle has been able to get out of her chair, and has even forced herself to try activities alongside her siblings.
Miraculously, Seattle can now swim, run, dance and rock climb.
Despite being active again, Seattle suffers from crippling fatigue and low muscle function. However, she battles on – often pushing herself to the point where her legs physically stop working.
The symptoms of fatigue affect her while she’s in school and sometimes cause her to fall asleep on her desk.
Her mother Lindsay said, “The doctors still stare in amazement every time they see her. They cannot believe it. She sees her brother, sister and friends doing things and she’ll want to do it so badly that she’ll just push herself. She’s willing to try anything. She is just so determined. That’s how she has been able to do all of this. Sometimes she even pushes herself so much that she’ll suddenly fall down.”
She continued, “Before, doctors either thought she was going to die or be completely paralyzed for the rest of her life. She’s the best swimmer in the family. We go swimming every day in the summer and she just swims for hours and hours. Running really gives her momentum. She usually doesn’t even have to stop.”
Seattle also stays positive while going through medical treatments, even smiling during her procedures.
After having a foot reconstruction surgery in September, she was supposed to stay home for two months, but returned to school a month early.
Lindsay has shared her daughter’s positivity online to inspire TM patients around the world.
She said, “I’ll look at her when she’s going through an intense procedure and she’ll be smiling. Even though she needed to recover, she wanted to be back in school. I’ve had other families write to me and tell me that they are thankful that our story is out there and that it inspires them. We have Transverse Myelitis friends all over the world.”
Alongside a supportive family, Seattle’s classmates are also very encouraging, and try to help her as much as they can.
She has never dealt with bullying, and the other kids are incredibly fond of her.
However, Seattle will get upset sometimes that her body gets tired, meaning her friends can keep playing while she can’t.
Her limited muscle strength also makes it difficult for her to write.
Lindsay said, “She’ll have so many good ideas sometimes, but she won’t be able to get them down on paper. Sometimes she’ll have to take a seat and it will really bother her that her friends are still running around the playground.”
In addition, something as simple as cold can cause her to relapse, losing her walking abilities again and possibly leading to Multiple Sclerosis.
Lindsay said, “We’re constantly trying to make sure she doesn’t get sick and we keep her home as much as possible during flu season.”
Although many TM patients have suffered from a virus leading up to the injury, Gabrielle deFiebre of the Transverse Myelitis Association says a cause has not yet been identified.
Gabrielle, the association’s associate director of research and education, said: ‘There are no known risk factors or behaviors that predispose someone specifically to Transverse Myelitis.
Effects include residual motor weakness, sensory changes and bladder and bowel problems.
