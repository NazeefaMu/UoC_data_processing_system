Protesting South Eastern University students defy court order

A group of Technology Faculty undergrads of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka who have barricaded themselves inside Administration Block, continue to do so in defiance of the Akkaraipattu Magistrate’s Court order for them to disperse.
The undergrads have locked themselves inside the university’s Administration Block since Monday and continued to piclet, preventing the Vice Chancellor, Registrar, Bursar and other Administrative Officers from entering premises
As result, all activities of the university’s Administration Block have come to a standstill.
However, the Vice Chancellor’s, Registrar’s officiers are functioning as usual at the Faculty of Arts and Culture. Meanwhile, the academic activities of the University are also functioning as usual except for the Faculty of Technology.
It is learnt that a group of Technology Faculty students involved in acts of indiscipline such as ragging and other acts of violence were punished with the Faculty premises being made out of “Out of Bounds.”
The parents of the punished students held negotiations with the Vice Chancellor and the other administrators last Friday with 9 demands.
Thereafter, the students had convinced the parents to join them (students) inside the Administrative Block. But, the parents had changed their mind about from joining the picketing students in the wake of the Akkaraipattu Magistrate’s Courts order.
The University authorities had yesterday (Octber 17) lodged a fresh entry with the Police to ensure the safety and security of the documents and other valuable items belonging to the University. However, the student picket continues inside the Administrative Block.
