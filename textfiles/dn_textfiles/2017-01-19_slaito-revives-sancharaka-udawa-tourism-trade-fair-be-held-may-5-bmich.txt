SLAITO revives Sancharaka Udawa Tourism Trade Fair To be held from May 5 at the BMICH


The Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) announced the annual Sancharaka Udawa Tourism Product Trade Fair, which will bring to the forefront many unidentified small and medium service providers by creating a platform to showcase their services as well as build links with the tourism industry.
A brainchild of NKAR Travels Managing Director Nilmini Nanayakkara, then President of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and the founder of Sancharaka Udawa, the trade fair had a huge impact on developing tourism when it was first initiated by him in 2011. Sancharaka Udawa will be held on May 5 and 6 May at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre (BMICH).
SLAITO Founder President Nilmin Nanayakkara said The Sancharaka Udawa tourism product trade fair to be held in May will provide a forum for small and relatively unknown suppliers and producers, while creating a cascading effect of revenue generation to all levels of society in Sri Lanka. "It will not only be limited to showcasing sources of accommodation, but will also cover new and varied locations to visit, transportation facilities, foreign language speaking guides, wildlife parks and rain forests,he said.

This event is aligned to SLAITO's mandate to ‘promote and foster the rapid and long term growth of tourism by providing and maintaining a high standard of excellence’ to foster the long term growth of tourism.
The Sancharaka Udawa Tourism Product Trade Fair will benefit the smaller organizations and businesses which depend on tourism but need support from an institution like SLAITO. We are confident this will boost their business prospects and benefit the long term sustainability of Sri Lanka Tourism as well.”
The Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) has identified a need to revive the fair to have a beneficial impact on tourism and tourism operators as the apex body for in-bound tourism and established to promote and foster the rapid and long term growth of tourism in Sri Lanka.
