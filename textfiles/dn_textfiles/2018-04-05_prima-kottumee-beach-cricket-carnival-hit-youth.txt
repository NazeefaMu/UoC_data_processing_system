Prima KottuMee Beach Cricket Carnival, a hit for Youth

Mount Lavinia beach was abuzz with excitement last Sunday as Prima KottuMee and YFM hosted the first ever Beach Cricket Carnival in Sri Lanka.
Teams representing 8 higher educational institutes competed against each other to claim the championship. ACBT, ICBT, SLIIT and NSBM entered the semi-finals after a day full of exciting matches played on the purpose-built turf by the sea. The final match for the championship between ICBT and SLIIT was played under flood lights, adding a novel experience to the atmosphere. Following a thrilling encounter, ICBT emerged champions of the Prima KottuMee – Y FM Beach Cricket Carnival.
Celebrities, YouTubers and Social Media stars joined in the fun by taking part in a number of exhibition matches. The ‘Hot & Spicy’ atmosphere created by Prima KottuMee was almost palpable, making the carnival the best experience for all the youth present. At sunset, the crowds who were gathered were entertained to a line-up of popular artists and much more entertainment at the mini concert.
