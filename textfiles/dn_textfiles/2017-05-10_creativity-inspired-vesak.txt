Creativity inspired by Vesak

With the dawn of the Vesak season, quite a number of creative activities are observed helping the masses to gather knowledge creatively via interpersonal group and mass communication means.
This has existed since times immemorial as the history records. In the first instance, there is preparation on the part of the adults to disseminate knowledge on aspects of the significance of Vesak, which marks the birth, the attainment of Buddhahood, and entering the Parinibbana or the passing away of Buddha.
Traditionally these are the most significant and most sacred two days in the life of a Buddhist.
It is not only the mere celebration that is significant to the lay Buddhist, but also the search for the insight into various aspects of the doctrine via textual material available.
As such, the adult communicators make it a point to educate and also to entertain the masses via print, visual and sound media.
The Buddha’s birth stories have been the stock in trade of most creative communicators, for they make use of these materials in many ways. In village temples the habit of reading birth stories by well-versed monks, in the appropriate tonal expressions, with others listening to it, has been a popular oral tradition handed down the centuries from King Dutugemunu’s era. The King was so delighted in getting the services of the Buddhist priesthood to read them loudly.
Presumably it is this form that had given way to the Bhakthi Gita (devotional songs) tradition that we hear so often by groups of singers during the Vesak season.
These monks having inculcated the habit of reading aloud mixing a style of prose and verse with tonal variations, selected the birth stories as the subject matter; these monks were vernacularly known as Jataka Bhanakas, the reciters of birth stories.
The Bhanaka tradition is also utilized as a faith healing exercise. In this manner the reading aloud the birth stories have been one of the main items adhered even by the later laymen and then gradually transferred to poetical expressions or versifications giving way to a special ballad creation called Jataka Kavi Katha, the ballads based on birth stories.
During the Kandy period of Sinhala literature, these ballads were proliferated by the learned as well as minor poets not much versed in the language. The birth stories, on versification, enable the listener to remember well the religious essence of the original work.
The poets too believed that it is a way to gain merits if one versifies a birth story and make it available to masses. The later scribes, who transferred the original versifications from the oral sources to the palm leaf manuscripts, were regarded as merit givers and those who listened as merit gatherers.
Similarly episodes from such Sinhala works as Pujavaliya, Saddharma Ratnavaliya and Buthsarana were versified into the simplest forms of communication enabling common readers and listeners to be more knowledgeable in the doctrinal matters at a higher plane of understanding.
The main intention, it is observed, is to create a sense of faith or Saddha, a primary way to achieve higher goals of doctrinal insights.
This too is the intention of the temple painter when he delves in the painting of episodes of birth stories and the life of Prince Siddhartha the would be Buddha, his renunciation, the achievement of Buddhahood, and the various challenges brought about by rivalries symbolizing the prevention of this achievement, for example, the onslaughts of Mara, the death and his daughters, Tanha, Rathi and Ranga, who attempted to entice the mind of the Buddha by their various worldly mundane pranks.
For the common man full of Saddha, this is known as Mara Parajaya or Mara Yuddhaya, the battle against the death. Dealing with the versifications of Dhamma, utilized by the masses in the Buddhist society, one cannot undermine the two Sinhala works Lovada Sangarava and Budu Guna Alankaraya.
Although these two works were meant to be used by the masses in the day-to-day life, the literary critics over the years have not evaluated them as great pieces of literary works as they contain, more or less, didactic commentarial references to good living alluding to the life of the Buddha and the events that followed.
But it is observed that these two works, though not acclaimed as classics, were the common poetry that lived with the masses in search of Buddhist insights inspiring the way to more and more poetical lyrical and dramatic creations that remain as memorable creations up to this day.
The Lovada Sangarava refers to various types of merits and demerits via the utterances of the Buddha, and helps save one’s life style from all sins.
One such utterance: ‘if one is sinful, the very act at the spur of the moment is like the partaking of honey which is sweet, but when the very same person receives its retribution it is like the burning from a glowing’ (karana kalata pav miriya meese vindina kalata duk dadivei ginise).
The subject matter in Budu Guna Alankaraya is the plague that infested the city of Visala to which the poet sought the reasons being the demerits of not only the kings and the rest of beings but also absence of faith and mutual human understanding that should emerge through the insights of the words of the Buddha.
According to the poet, the layman should make it a point to realise the virtues of the Buddha, and recite them day in day out as a necessary expression.
The poet selects the historical episode where the Buddha recited the Ratana Sutta in order to avert the evils that befell the city of Visala, and expands the theme to suit all conditions of human misbehaviour.
In this manner we see that the season of Vesak had given way to a special entity where the masses are made to feel more enlightened on Dhamma insights via reading and listening.
Special local publications are made available to address these insights; Dinamina Vesak Kalapaya is one such example. Many publishers feel that it is a merit-gathering venture to bring out reading material on religious matters especially on this occasion.
