Canard about water supply

People in Kalutara District faced much inconvenience on Saturday searching for safe drinking water after they heard a radio announcement that the pipe-borne water distributed by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) station in Kalutara is not suitable for drinking purposes as it had been contaminated with salt water.
Later, the NWSDB Chairman announced over the radio that certain officials had given wrong information to consumers. He said a disciplinary inquiry against the officials who had misled consumers would be initiated.
