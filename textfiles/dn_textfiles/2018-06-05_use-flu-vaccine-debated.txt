Use of flu vaccine debated

A panel of scholars and experts has been appointed to look into the possibility of introducing the flu vaccine, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at his office in Colombo yesterday, he said other countries use preventive methods of maintaining personal hygiene to control infections and no country relies on flu vaccines. The vaccine is different from the vaccines included in the National Immunization Programme which are 100 percent reliable with single or double dozes.
Consultant Virologist attached to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha said the vaccine is only 40 to 70 percent effective and it should be given more than once or twice because the influenza virus changes from time to time within a short period. The vaccine included three viruses but the exact strain existing in Sri Lanka at a given time should be investigated through scientific research to make the vaccine match with the virus. The vaccine has side effects similar to any other vaccine.
The scholarly panel includes pediatricians, gynecologists, virologists, epidemiologists, and representatives from the Medical Supplies Division etc. The panel will decide whether to use the vaccine or not, when, to whom and how, the doctors said.
