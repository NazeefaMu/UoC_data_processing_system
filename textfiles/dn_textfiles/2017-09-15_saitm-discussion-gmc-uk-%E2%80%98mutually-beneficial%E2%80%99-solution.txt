SAITM in discussion with GMC UK for a ‘mutually beneficial’ solution

 
The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), in a statement issued today, said it was in discussions with the General Medical Council (GMC) of UK towards a ‘mutually beneficial solution’ to the problem that has arisen regarding applications to the GMC from Sri Lanka.
It was revealed yesterday that GMC had listed the Malabe Private Medical College (awarded by the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine) as a medical school ‘not accepted’ by the GMC ‘in light of our main objective to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public.’
‘Contrary to the statements that are currently being circulated within the media,’ SAITM said, ‘SAITM management clarifies that the GMC Registrations Application Head Richard Amison confirms the qualification criteria and acceptance of applications from SAITM graduates to the GMC will be reviewed as and when the concerns in question is resolved.’
‘As clarified by the GMC to SAITM, it states that it is not in a position to determine any of the legal or factual issues involved, but will proceed to review the quandary following the direction of the Government of Sri Lanka and other legal institutions. SAITM further informs that they are in par with the necessary requirements for graduates to apply to the GMC,’ SAITM said.
The statement, signed by SAITM Deputy Chairperson Himali Jayatilake said SAITM has been represented to the GMC by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to halt SAITM graduates from applying.
‘The Management of SAITM are in discussion with the GMC, U.K towards a mutually beneficial solution that will enable SAITM students to submit their applications if any and work towards an immediate resolution,’ SAITM said.
