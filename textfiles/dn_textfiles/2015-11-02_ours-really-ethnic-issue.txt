Is ours really an ethnic issue?

Ours is not an ethnic problem between the Sinhalese and Tamils. Rather it is a problem between successive Sri Lanka governments and Tamil politicians. The problem may have started with the Sinhala-only of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956. But it became unmanageable only with the July 1983 anti Tamil riots when JR was in power. It was only after these 1983 riots that the LTTE took the upper hand, and in fact took control of Tamil affairs. I was vaguely on the Tamil side from 1956 onwards, and very strongly on the Tamil side after the July 1983 riots. But the LTTE turned out to be one of the most brutal terrorist groups in the whole world. Somewhere in 1985 or 1986, they massacred over 100 innocent pilgrims at the Sri Maha Bodhi at Anuradhapura. After that, I found that I could not continue to be a pro Tamil, though of course the massacre was carried out by Tamil terrorists and not the average moderate Tamils.
Since late 1980s, the LTTE had been exploding bombs. They sometimes carried out suicide bombs, almost twice or thrice a week. In fact four of my close relatives were killed by LTTE bombs, and one of my brothers and his wife who were working at the Central Bank then had a narrow escape.
Successive governments, starting with the JR led UNP government, the Kumaratunga-led SLFP government, the Wickremesinghe-led UNP government and finally the Rajapaksa-led UPFA government tried to have talks with the LTTE. The venues for the talks were Thimpu in Bhutan, Jaffna, various places in Thailand, Geneva and Oslo. But on each and every occasion, these talks were ultimately sabotaged by the LTTE.
Vadamarachchi Operation
The first military offensive of the Sri Lankan government against the LTTE in response to terrorist acts was in 1987 when Lalith Athulathmudali, who was then National Security Minister of the JR government, carried out what was called the Vadamarachchi Operation. This operation was halted by India. When Chandrika came to power in 1994, once again in response to LTTE terrorism she carried out an operation that resulted in a major portion of the Jaffna peninsula getting out of LTTE control and coming under government control.
Finally during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s UPFA government, a serious war broke out between the government and the LTTE triggered off by what came to be called the Mavil Aru incident in June 2006. For the successful conduct of this war, we have to be grateful to the three armed forces with their three chiefs, especially Sarath Fonseka, Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya.
The war came to an end with the death of Prabhakaran in May 2009. Since then there have been no LTTE danger within Sri Lanka. But it is still there internationally. The so-called Tamil Diaspora in countries like Bhutan, USA, Canada, Australia and some countries in the European Union, in my opinion comprise three factions. One faction consists of LTTE who are still raising funds to fight the Sri Lankan government to get whatever they want. A second faction consists of Eelamists who are not LTTE but they are still keen on establishing an Eelam in the North and East of Sri Lanka. The third faction consists of moderate Tamils who would like to cooperate with whatever government we have in Sri Lanka, to arrive at a suitable solution to this problem, provided the Sri Lankan government is impartial, wise and decent.
This is where Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government failed though as I stated earlier that we have to be grateful that his government defeated the LTTE militarily within Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa’s government did nothing after that to give a suitable and decent political solution to the problem. In fact the end of the war was a glorious opportunity for that government to solve the political problem once and for all. That government may have pumped in a lot of money to the North and the East to build roads bridges and may be houses, schools and hospitals.
But that was material development, and nothing was done to mentally heal the wounds of the Tamils and Muslims who suffered due to both the atrocities of the LTTE and unwise and wrongful actions of successive Sri Lankan governments.
Several months after the end of our war, I went and had a chat and discussion with Ananda Sangaree. During the period of the war, of all the Tamil political leaders in the country this gentleman was the most vociferous anti LTTE figure. Almost every week there was an article by him in the local newspapers criticizing the LTTE. Sometimes he compared them to the Nazis in German prior to and during the Second World War, and in fact compared Prabhakaran to Adolf Hitler. Ananda Sangaree described how the LTTE was having concentration camps and torture chambers just as the Nazis did. But the interesting thing was that after the end of our war in May 2009, Ananda Sangaree was spectacularly silent. I found out the reason for his silence was that after the successful conclusion of the war, the government did nothing tangible to solve the political problem.
Now it is over six years since the war ended. During the past three years, whenever I asked someone as to what was going on in the North and East those who were pro Rajapaksa had one thing to say and those who were anti Rajapaksa had a different thing to say. So I decided to go to Jaffna and find out which story was correct, at least as far as the North was concerned. The rest of this article describes what I heard and found in Jaffna.
I was thinking to myself as to how best I could go to Jaffna, where exactly I could stay, how long I should stay there and so on when suddenly I had a telephone call from one of my good Tamil friends. He was one of my batchmates at the university, Dr. P. Shivanathan. He called from Jaffna to say that he could be coming to Colombo the following week, and that he would like to meet me just to have a chat. So the following week I gave him a call and met him at his flat in Kirulapone. Amongst other things I told him what I was planning to do in Jaffna. He promptly told that I could stay at his residence in Jaffna, as long as I liked. He also advised me to take the Jaffna intercity train which leaves Fort at 5.45 a.m. so that I can reach Jaffna by 12.30 noon. I did just that about a fortnight later, towards the end of June this year. By that time he was back in Jaffna and he was nice enough to come to the Jaffna railway station by 12.30 and take me to his residence in Kopay, a village just four to five kilometres away from Jaffna town. I stayed with Shiva for three nights and four days, and managed to meet and interview a good representative cross section of the Jaffna populace.
Jaffna University
Shiva did not have a car, as he was in Sri Lanka only half of every year, spending three months every year with one of his sons in Canada and another three months with another son in the USA. But there was a three-wheeler close to his residence in Kopay. I went to all the places in this wheeler. Shiva not only accompanied me to all the places, but also paid for the wheeler on every occasion.
I first went to Jaffna University and met the Dean of the Arts Faculty. We discussed matters relating to the ethnic problem, for about 45 minutes. He partly agreed with what I said, especially the nature of the problem as outlined in my opening statement in this article and also the probable origin of the problem. He also gave me some information regarding the student composition in various facilities that surprised me. He said that in the Faculty of Management and Commerce, nearly 45 percent of the students were Sinhalese, in the Science Faculty 60 percent of the students were Sinhalese, and in the Medical Faculty 25 to 30 percent were Sinhalese.
Later it occurred to me that the posting of students to the various faculties was the work of the University Grants Commission in Colombo, not the work of the Jaffna University itself. So there was nothing to be surprised about. I raised the issue of student violence, the Dean said that a good portion of student violence was due to love affairs between Sinhala girls and Sinhala boys. There were also differences between urban and village groups, both Sinhala and Tamil. I asked the Dean about political inclinations and affiliations of the students. He replied that all he knew was that there were no TNA or JVP supporters amongst the students. He then took me to the Arts Faculty Senior Common Room, where besides partaking of some tasty Vadai and tea, he introduced me to a few professors of the Arts Faculty. One of them was a former Dean of Art in Jaffna. He had studied Geography at Peradeniya, where he had graduated in 1970. Then he had been an Assistant Lecturer in Peradeniya (1970-1974), then in Kelaniya (1974-1979) and finally in Jaffna (1997-2007). He had been Dean of Arts in Jaffna from 2004 to 2007.
Amongst other things one specific timing he mentioned was that the constitution for Sri Lanka drafted by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Neelan Thiruchelvam was very good. Actually if I remember right this Constitution was drafted by G.L. Peiris and Neelan Thiruchelvam on instructions of the former president. Then I was introduced to a lecturer in English Language teaching from whom I gathered that the Medical Faculty had just one lecturer who was Sinhala and it was the same in the Engineering Faculty. I was a bit disappointed, because appointment of academic staff was not the work of the UGC, but the work of the particular University itself.
Then I went to Jaffna Hindu College and met the principal. He pointed out that as far as our ethnic problem was concerned, both sides, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, were to be blamed. He said he can trust the present regime (Sirisena-Wickremesinghe) more than the former (Rajapaksa) and that he was expecting a solution to the problem soon. He also said that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution should be implemented fully - that is land powers and Police powers should be given to the Provincial Councils. He also pointed out that as far as government employment was concerned middle grade recruitment was fair by the Tamils, but in prominent All-Island services e.g. SLAS (Sri Lanka Administrative Service), SLEAS (Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service), SLOS (Sri Lanka Overseas Service), Customs, etc, the recruitment of Tamils was very much restricted.
Discrimination against Tamils
At this point my friend Shiva intercepted and said this is because of nepotism more than discrimination against Tamils.
Then I had a chat with Shiva's three-wheeler driver. He said rich people in Jaffna got what they wanted from the Rajapaksa regime, through Douglas Devananda. Poor people like him got nothing from the Rajapaksa regime, nor are they expecting anything from the present regime.
I wanted him to introduce me to his friends. He introduced me to one of his good friends, who to my surprise happened to be an old-Royalist.
But at Royal, he had been mainly at the Royal Primary, Grade I to Grade VI (1977-1983). He had to leave Royal in 1983 due to the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots. Then he had studied at Jaffna Hindu College (1984 - 1987), then gone to India and continued his studies there (Grade IX to X, 1987-1988 up to O/Level).
Then he had come back to Jaffna Hindu College (1988), studied at Colombo Hindu College. Employed since 1994, he had worked at Lanka Bell Colombo (2005-2008). His father passed away in 2007. Subsequently, his mother had fallen seriously ill (aged 80). So he decided to be unemployed and look after his mother.
He and his mother are presently depending partly on his father’s pension which amounted to Rs. 16,700 per month. They have their own house, plenty of coconut trees in their compound, so they also sell coconuts. They possess a 160-perch paddy field, given on lease with a third of the profits given to them. They are therefore reasonably well off. He said that Douglas Devananda was into illegal sand mining and earned about Rs. 600 million. He said that during the Rajapaksa regime, a lot of work was done in the North by foreign organizations. The regime itself built only roads. He said he expects something good from the present regime.
When I dropped in at St. John’s College, Jaffna and met the Principal who happened to be a clergyman. He asked me whether I came to interview him in order to collect data for a research project. I told him that was not my purpose, and that I wanted to discuss our ethnic problem. To every question I put to him, he repeatedly said “Don’t put the blame on anyone. Just go to the root causes.” After sometime I felt I was getting nowhere, so I gave up questioning him.
