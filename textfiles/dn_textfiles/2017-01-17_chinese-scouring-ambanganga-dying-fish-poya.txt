Chinese scouring Ambanganga for dying fish on Poya

Chinese nationals engaged in the Moragahakanda project were seen scouring the Ambanganga for fish, slow worms and other aquatic species breathing their last in the dried up spouts along the Ambanganga on Poya day, only a day after the Moragahakanda water filling ceremony was held.
The project company seemed to have provided a chauffeur driven vehicle too for their nationals engaged in this hunt, people in the area alleged.
They also alleged that a mass scale sand mining racket is taking place in the Ambanganga close to the sluice gate disregarding the regulations.
They say a powerful individual had obtained a contract to sell the mined sand to contractors.
Entry to the region of the sluice gates is prohibited to unauthorised persons. Vehicles deployed for the sand mining racket are parked in the official car park of the company employees. Labourers involved in the mining activities said they have been hired on a daily payment basis.
