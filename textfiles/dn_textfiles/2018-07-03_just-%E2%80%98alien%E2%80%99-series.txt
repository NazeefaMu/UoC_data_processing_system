Just like the ‘Alien’ series?

The tale of a morally compromised CIA agent (Josh Brolin), who teams with a Mexican associate (Benicio del Toro) and a plucky young agent (Emily Blunt) following some gruesome murders on this side of the border, it was the kind of stark, uncompromising movie that created a nearly unbearable level of tension and suspense with each passing moment. It was also the type of movie whose world was rich and expansive enough that it practically begged for a follow-up.
And that follow-up is finally here, in the form of “Sicario: Day of the Soldado,” a movie that reunites Brolin and del Toro (Blunt sat this one out), for a story of escalating violence in Mexico and the ways in which the American government both facilitates and reinforces that violence. And when things get out of hand, it’s up to del Toro’s Alejandro to make a very difficult choice.
The less you know going into the movie, the better. But it definitely delivers on the high-octane mixture of thrills and political intrigue that the first film provided, with even more insightful cultural commentary.
So you can imagine our thrill when we got to sit down with Stefano Sollima, the Italian director who took over for Villenueve and who made a movie all his own. Sollima has made a number of Italian crime movies and television series, and will next turn his attention to a big budget adaptation of beloved videogame franchise “Call of Duty.” Moviefone
