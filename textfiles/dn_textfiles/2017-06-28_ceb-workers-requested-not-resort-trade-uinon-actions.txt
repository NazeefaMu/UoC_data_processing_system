CEB workers requested not to resort to trade uinon actions

Minister assures to look into salary issues:
Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, while assuring to look into the salary issues of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers, yesterday requested them not to resort to inconvenience the public through trade union actions.
The minister addressing a press conference at his Ministry said a Committee headed by the CEB Vice Chairman has been asked to submit a report by August on the CEB workers’ salary issues. Several TUs of the CEB has organised a strike and demonstration today urging the immediate intervention of the authorities to resolve their salary issues.
The minister said the CEB Director Board was having series of discussions with regard to this problem with its 60 TUs. He said he hopes to submit a Cabinet paper next week to resolve the salary issues of the CEB workers.
“Towards the end of 2014, the CEB engineers received a salary hike and they received another salary hike when all CEB employees received 30 percent salary increase as per a joint agreement. Non-engineers were of the view that it was unfair by them. We have paid our serious attention to this matter.
The CEB has about 22,000 employees and increasing their salaries must be done after careful thought. Four court cases have been filed in this regard and we have to consider the legal aspect as well,” he said.
