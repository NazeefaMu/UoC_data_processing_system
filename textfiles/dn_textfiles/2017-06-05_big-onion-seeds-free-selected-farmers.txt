Big onion seeds free for selected farmers

 
Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare has decided to distribute indigenous big onion seeds free of charge among the selected onion growers within the current Yala season in Matale district.
This was decided at a discussion held at Matale district secretariat auditorium.
Minister further stated that 5,000 kg of indigenous big onion seeds would be purchased on Rs.9,000/= per kilo from onion seed growers in Dambulla, Sigiriya, Galewela and Dewahuwa areas where the big onion seed production is abundant and  it will be distributed among selected farmers free of charge.
The aim of this is to encourage the farmers to promote the big onion cultivation.
“Matale district is the hub of the big onion production for about three decades but the big onion production is limited only to 40 percent (40%) of the annual need as farmers could not produce the entire requirement of big onions,” the Minister said.
“Therefore, the agriculture officials should encourage them to reach the anticipated goal” Minister Aluvihare further said.
The representatives of farmer organizations and agrarian service officials participated at the occasion.
