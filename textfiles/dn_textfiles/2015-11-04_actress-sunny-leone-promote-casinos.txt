Actress Sunny Leone to promote casinos?

NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa yesterday asked the government whether it is going to promote casino industry by bringing well-known actress Sunny Leone to the country.
"Sri Lanka has degenerated to a level that infamous actresses such as Sunny Leone is used to promote casinos in the country," he said.
Weerawansa said that those who were clamouring for good governance are silent about this and added that the leaders of good governance including Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera are not even to be seen.
"Ven. Rathana Thera is rarely seen in parliament too," he said
Leone is said to be planning to visit Sri Lanka in December and during her visit, she is expected to present a musical concert at a casino in Colombo.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Weerawansa said that the government's dreams to bring economic development to the country have shattered and the country's growth rate which was at 7 percent last year has dropped to 5 per cent within a very short span.
The people who are employed in the state and private sectors are facing the threat of losing their employment due to the country's present economic plight. He said that the Public Service Commission Secretary is appointed through a transparent mechanism. Weerawansa said that the appointment of the commission secretary was carried out without following a transparent procedure.
"Weerawansa questioned the independence and credibility of the commission, if appointments to key positions of the commission such as secretary are not carried out through a proper process.
He said if the government has a real intention of meting out justice to the HNDA students who were subject to police attack, the services of police officials who attacked the female student indiscriminately should be suspended.
"Nothing of that sort has taken place and the police attacked the students on the orders of government leaders," he said.
Weerawansa said that country has never witnessed a press conference held by Sri Lankan sex workers. The governemnt receiving requests to accepts the rights of LGBT community, he said
Weerawansa added that country did not witness such a situation during the previous regime.
