Army aims to improve services to meet emergencies

The capacity development in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations of the Army should be further enhanced to meet any emergency, said Chief of Staff of the Army Major General Mahesh Senanayake.
The Army renders yeomen service in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations and further enhancing its capacity could improve its service delivery in future natural calamities, he added. Major General Senanayake was delivering the key note address as the chief guest at the biannual academic sessions of the Officer Career Development Centre (OCDC) at Buttala during the weekend.
Referring to future of military engagement, the keynote speaker highlighted ‘terrorism’ to be considered as the prioritized security concern. “We are the guardians of all Sri Lankans and the Army is the nation’s means to seize, retain and exploit the opportunities. Terrorism is at the forefront of our security concerns and we have to nip the origins of terrorism in the bud. Constructive engagement with international and regional intelligence players is therefore a must. The Army should be, all the time, agile, lethal, versatile and modernised to suit tomorrow’s operations. That is the need of the hour. Close combination with Navy and Air Force is another essential component since the Army should act as a capability-based force and not a threat-based one because threats are always hard to predict.
