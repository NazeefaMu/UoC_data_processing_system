Six electors challenge legality of Gazette Notification

Six electors
representing several Local Government institutions have filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal challenging the legality of a Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017 ammending the boundaries, number of members and the constituents in respect of Local Authorities.
This petition is to be taken up for support today (16) before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya.
This petition had been filed by six electors representing Colombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council, Paduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha, Hali-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha and Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government and the Secretary to Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government as respondents.
The petitioners are seeking an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification bearing No.2006/44 dated February 17,2017 until the final determination of this application.
The petitioners stated that a National Delimitation Committee has been established with a mandate to make recommendations to the Minister of Local Government for the division of local authority areas to the wards and to determine the boundaries of each ward and assign a name and number of each such ward.
The petitioners stated that if any electoral process commenced in terms of the Gazette Notification which has been promulgated by the Minister ultra vires the powers vested on him in terms of Section 3D of Local Authorities Election Ordinance, irreparable loss and damage would be caused to the petitioners.
