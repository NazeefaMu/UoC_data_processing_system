Doors are Open

As the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, I want to extend my congratulations to all of the students who have received offers of admission to study at a university in the United States. You are joining a group of bright, talented, and energetic individuals who are making use of the top quality education they received in the United States to improve their own countries. I know because I meet them almost every day. International education strengthens the bonds between nations. American universities are among the best in the world, and students should be proud of their invitations to join a select group of young people, American and foreign, whose lives will forever change as a result of the dynamism, openness, and quality of education available across the United States. Be assured, American colleges and universities welcome you, as do the American people and communities throughout our country.
Over one million international students are now at U.S. higher education institutions, maintaining our long-standing record as the world’s top host nation for international students.
Over 3,000 Sri Lankans are studying in the United States this academic year, an increase of 7 percent from the year before, and we have 37Maldivians studying in the US as well. Since the inception of the Fulbright Scholarship Programme in Sri Lanka, almost 700 Sri Lankan scholars and students have benefited from graduate study in the United States through these scholarships. We’re honoured that so many of our Sri Lankan and Maldivian friends have chosen the United States as the place they want to attain their higher education.
International students from diverse backgrounds strengthen ties between the United States and countries around the world, developing the relationships necessary to solve global challenges. We value inclusion, and actively support students from diverse racial, ethnic, religious, and geographic backgrounds on campuses across the United States. U.S. colleges and universities take pride in providing safe, welcoming environments for all their students, and I want to stress how welcome students are in the United States. Many universities have come together to send a specific and direct message to students around the world through the #YouAreWelcomeHere Campaign.
I invite all aspiring students to come to the U.S. Education Fair we are hosting at the Embassy’s American Center on May 20th from 2:00 – 5:00 p.m. The Fair will serve as a resource both for Sri Lankan and Maldivian students who have received university acceptance offers, as well as for prospective students. It will feature Education USA advisers, Embassy Consular officers to field questions about student visas, Sri Lankan graduates of U.S. colleges and universities, and American Foreign Service Officers to talk about what it is like to study at their alma maters.
We want to help students make informed choices about where to pursue their higher education and highlight the tremendous value and benefit offered by American colleges and universities. I am partial, of course, to my alma mater, the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson, but there is a school for every passion and discipline you may pursue.
I personally encourage those who have received offers of admission to accept this life-changing opportunity and join your peers in experiencing the unique value of an American education.
For those who think you might be interested in studying in the United States please visit us on-line at https://lk.usembassy.gov/education-culture/study-usa/. And if you can’t come to our Education Fair, stop by one of our American Centers in Colombo, Malé, Kandy, and Jaffna. The doors are open, please do come on in.
