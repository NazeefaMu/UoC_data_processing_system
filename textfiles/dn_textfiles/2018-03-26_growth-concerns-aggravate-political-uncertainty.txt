Point of view 
The Sri Lankan equity market rout continued yet again this week, with the benchmark ASPI recording its highest weekly loss since late-Nov’17 as ongoing political uncertainty was aggravated by growth concerns as the Sri Lankan economy recorded its lowest growth rate in 16-years.
The broad-share price Index lost ~66 points (-1% W-o-W), to record its highest weekly loss since late Nov’17 when the market lost 70 points.
Since the rise of communal tensions in early-March, the ASPI has lost 113 index points or 1.7%, paring down the 2.3% gain (between Jan to immediately prior to the communal riots) down to just 0.5%.
Declines on the Index on the back of these domestic political headwinds have been aggravated by rising global geopolitical tensions, resulting in the benchmark index falling below the key 6500 level for the first time in 2-months.

Activity levels on the Colombo Bourse reflected the general sluggishness in sentiment, and daily average turnover levels fell ~42% W-o-W to Rs. 0.73Bn.
Market activity however was dominated by Local Institutional and HNI investors who accounted for ~67% of the week’s market turnover, as retailers opted to remain on the sidelines yet again this week.
Foreign investor appetite for risky domestic assets meanwhile also took a dip this week, as net foreign flows to the CSE fell 89% W-o-W to Rs. 0.1Bn (cf. Rs. 1.0Bn last week).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to move in line with developments on the political and economic front.
FY 2017 GDP falls tomulti-year low of 3.1% 
Sri Lanka’s GDP growth fell to a 16-year low in 2017, as growth fell to 3.1% Y-o-Y amid a sharper slowdown in H2’17. H2’17 GDP growth slowed to 3.2% Y-o-Y compared to H1’17 when growth was 3.9% Y-o-Y and H2’16 when growth was 5.1% Y-o-Y.
Slower growth was evident through all three sectors (Agriculture, Industry & Services) with the drought-driven slowdown in the Agriculture sector (-0.8% Y-o-Y) only partially offset by the slower growth in Industry (3.9% Y-o-Y in 2017 cf. 5.8% in 2016) and Services (3.2% Y-o-Y in 2017 cf. 4.7% Y-o-Y in 2016).
Industry sector growth remained low as Y-o-Y improvements in the F&B (+1.5% Y-o-Y cf -0.2% in 2016) and Garment (+5.7% Y-o-Y cf. 1.8% Y-o-Y in 2016) industries failed to offset slower growth in the sector’s largest contributing industry, Construction (3.1% Y-o-Y cf. 8.3% Y-o-Y in 2016).
Services sector growth was also lower despite a recovery in the Wholesale and Retail industry ( 3.8% Y-o-Y cf. 2.5% Y-o-Y in 2016) as growth in the other major industries within the sector (Transport (0.9% Y-o-Y cf.5.5% in 2016), Financial Services (9.4% Y-o-Y cf. 12.3% in 2016) and Real Estate (4.7% Y-o-Y cf. 6.3% Y-o-Y) remained sluggish.
National inflation levels in Feb’18 meanwhile slowed to a 22-month low of 3.2% Y-o-Y (5.4% in Jan’18 and 7.3% in Dec’16) supported both by the base effect (a high base prevailed in Feb’17) and favourable supply conditions.
NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, meanwhile continued its downtrend since Sep’17 to fall to 2.0% (cf. 2.1% in Jan’18).
