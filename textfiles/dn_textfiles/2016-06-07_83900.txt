Nadal to be fit for Wimbledon

 
Rafael Nadal has whisked his girlfriend Xisca Perello away on holiday off the coast of Spain as the tennis star looks to put his injury nightmare behind him after pulling out of the French Open.
Nadal was forced to withdraw from Roland Garros due to a tendon injury but he took this mind off his ailment as he soaked up the Balearic sun in Formentera near Ibiza. Nadal, who turned 30 last Friday, had only reached the second round when he was forced to pull out of his attempts at a 10th French Open title after tests showed his condition had deteriorated.
He explained during a press conference that an anesethic injection had been able to get him through his match against Facundo Bagnis but he now faces an anxious race to be fit for Wimbledon.
His hopes are hanging by a thread after he withdrew from the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club. The Spaniard explained that an MRI scan revealed the extent of the injury with the negative results showing an inflammation on the sheath of the tendon, with three months out being the worst-case scenario.
The 14-time Grand Slam champion was concerned that had he not acted, it would have led to a longer period off the circuit, but he is hopeful that the recovery time will take just three weeks. DAILY MAIL
