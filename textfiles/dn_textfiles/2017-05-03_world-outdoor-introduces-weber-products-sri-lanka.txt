Going forward with its essence, “Don't just grill, let's Weber”- Weber is here to add a new dimension to your culinary experience”, said Business Development Manager, Weber – Sri Lanka, Jehan Noor.
“The advantages of grilling with Weber are manifold. Weber Grills retain the nutrients of the meat while greatly reducing the oil content one would usually use when grilling as the excess fat drips off the meat, leaving less fat in the cooked food ,” said Chef Melwin .
“Weber’s vision is to change the way of grilling with the ultimate barbecue experience — done the Weber way.
It brings together communities and allows users to spend quality time with friends and family.
Weber’s Charcoal and Gas grills are both compact yet versatile and can easily be connected to domestic or portable LPG cylinders.
Differing from other grills, Weber will soon be bringing a brand new concept of “closed lid grilling” to Sri Lanka via World of Outdoor.
Weber Grills and Barbecues will be available at World Of Outdoor’s flagship store on Bullers Road.
