Kandy’s 101st Battle of the Blues :
Trinity-Antonian should be a close game

St. Anthony’s College Cricket squadThe clash between two huge cricket rivals Trinity College and St. Anthony’s College - the postponed big match will take place at the Asgiriya Stadium today Friday 16th and on 17th Saturday. For these two schools there are no games bigger than this clash. St. Anthony’s and Trinity are the two of the oldest Colleges and this encounter is also the 6th oldest Big Match in Sri Lanka and this time both schools are evenly balanced with good records in the season going into this match
Trinity have been in good form so far, without losing a game, they have won six games and have been a dominant force in cricket in the recent past, this season they were one of the hardest teams to beat. Trinity has a proud history of producing some excellent cricketers who have gone on to shine in both local and international arenas.
St. Anthony’s who lost to St. Peter’s College have won nine games. A school which has been a major force in cricket, they have not only produced several champion teams but have also produced some of the finest cricketers. But in the last few years they failed to keep up to those traditions and were demoted to Division Two a couple of years back. Last season they had a good chance of getting promoted but the losses to St. Benedict’s College and Vidyarhta College deprived them of promotion.
This game will be played under the distinguished patronage of Trinity College 1960 captain Jayantissa Ratwatte. He will be received by Principal Andrew Fowler-Watt, vice principal former Royal captain J.D.Shaw Wilson and St. Anthony’s principal Rev. Fr. Henry Bernard Wijerathne. The winner of this nail biting crash will be presented the Halangoda trophy. So, these two good cricket playing schools will play for supremacy in their 101st Big Match.
