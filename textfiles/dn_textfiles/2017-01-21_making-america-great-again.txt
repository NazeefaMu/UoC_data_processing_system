Making America Great Again

A new era dawned for the United States and the world yesterday when Donald Trump took oaths as the 45th President of the United States. This is the first time in contemporary history that the US has elected a President who has had no prior political or military experience. His victory at the election came as a surprise to the entire world. The billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star came as a complete outsider to the Republican Party nominations fray and ultimately walked away with the coveted prize of the Presidency of the United States. This is a singular achievement by any yardstick, but most analysts believe that simmering voter disenchantment with the Washington status quo was one of the reasons that led to his victory. In other words, voters believed that a complete outsider with no Washington links could do a better job.
And being the President of the United States is no easy job. We have often heard the phrase “with great power comes great responsibility” and nowhere is it more applicable than to the US Presidency. Precisely because he is not a politician, Trump has spoken his mind on many issues, setting the Twitter sphere alight with statements on everything from foreign policy to US exports. However, he may find that actual governance in a different matter altogether because the US has to work in a global framework, especially when it comes to dealing with multilateral issues such as the Iran nuclear deal. The deal is holding and any unilateral action by Trump may affect the delicate nature of the agreement.
Another reason for Trump's victory was his populist and nationalist agenda which advocated tough controls on immigration and trade. He has vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico, though the latter has outright refused to pay for it in whatever manner. Nevertheless President Trump has outlined plans to initially build it with US taxpayers’ money, which might not go down well with the populace. A wall with Mexico will fundamentally alter the American landscape literally and metaphorically.
As for trade, President Trump has threatened to pull the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership, impose higher tariffs on goods from China and even Germany (a 35 percent import duty on German cars) and re-evaluate any other trade agreements not favourable to the US. He has urged companies such as Apple to make their products in the United States. His Twitter tirades on this issue has already resulted in Fird cancelling a plan to build a car plant in Mexico. But due to the complex nature of global manufacturing and trade, it might always not be possible to manufacture everything in the US itself. Higher prices precipitated by higher labour costs in the US may also drive up prices of US made goods in the world market, which will not augur well for the US in the long run.
Judging by his controversial Twitter pronouncements, the world will eagerly watch the new President's foreign policy moves. He has repeatedly pledged to mend fences with Russia, which many within his own party have viewed with disdain. However, a thaw in relations between the two giants could be a good development in terms of global stability. It is no secret that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin admire each other and a personal rapport between the two men may turn out to just what the doctor ordered for maintaining world peace and combating terrorism.
Trump was the first incoming or sitting President in more than 40 years to directly speak to the leader of Taiwan, which has not been well received in China. Any break from the One China policy will have far reaching ramifications for the two countries and we hope that saner counsel will prevail on this issue. Trump's staunchly pro Israel policy has been equally controversial along with a plan to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. Many in Israel itself are wary of the move. The previous Barack Obama administration was a passionate advocate of the two state solution and again, President Trump will have to negotiate these waters carefully.
It is well known that Trump did not have a good rapport with the media before and after the election. He has accused them of siding with his opponent Hillary Clinton, calling the likes of CNN “fake news” outlets. Plans to send the White House press corps packing to another building has already stirred a hornet's nest. Trump apparently believes that he can get his message through to the public in a more effective manner through the social media.
Trump's Cabinet picks mostly follow his line, but some have expressed reservations about certain issues such as warming up to Russia. The actions of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defence General James “Mad Dog” Mattis will be closely watched by the world, but it is Trump's other two picks that have created a bigger controversy. Both his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner will be intimately involved in the administration which may pose an ethical dilemma. The same applies to Trump's vast business empire and critics are already pointing out conflict of interest issues.
But President Trump seems to be unfazed by his detractors. His will certainly be a different style of Governance and upholding some of his pledges will not be easy. But there is every chance that he will get over the rhetoric and turn out to be a very practical and pragmatic leader. However, only time will tell whether he could Make America Great Again.
