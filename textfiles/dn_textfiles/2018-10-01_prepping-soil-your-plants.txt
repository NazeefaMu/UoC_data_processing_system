Prepping soil for your plants

It’s true that all plants need is sun, soil, and water. But that’s not all there is to it. Good soil is critical for growing healthy, strong plants. Whether you’re growing vegetables, flowers, or just a really nice patch of dandelions, you need to prepare your soil to get the best results.
Good soil has lots of organic matter (like decaying leaves and compost), nutrients for the plants, living organisms (like earthworms and fungi), and it needs to be turned or loosened so the roots can get oxygen and water can drain.
There are different ways to prepare your soil for planting.
Lasagna Method
It’s not called the lasagna method because you’re growing lasagna plants. With this method, you prepare the soil by layering different materials on top of each other, like the layers in lasagna
It starts like this: mow the grass or the weeds down as far as you can. Lay flattened cardboard boxes over the grass, right next to each other with the edges touching. Use moving boxes or non-shiny cardboard, and take off any tape because it won’t decompose. Spray the boxes with enough water to dampen, and then stomp on them a bit to get them to settle. You don’t want them to blow away before you get to the next step.
On top of the cardboard, put layers of newspaper. Again, don’t use the slick ad pages but just the regular newspaper pages. Arrange them kind of like shingles so no weeds can grow through. Dampen again and stomp–carefully this time, because you’ve got two wet materials to deal with.
The final step is to cover the newspaper layer with a thick layer (like 2 inches or more) of shredded leaves, straw, or other “brown” composting material. Then add alternating layers of “green” composting material, like veggie scraps, manure, lawn clippings, etc. and “brown” composting material.
It takes several months for the grass to die and for the lasagna layers to break down and turn into rich, useable soil.
Double digging
Double digging is a soil preparation technique that most people haven’t heard of. It’s very labour-intensive and is used for plants with deep roots like carrots or beets.
Start by digging a trench one foot wide and one foot deep. It can be as long as you want it to be. Pile all the dirt you dig up into a wheelbarrow or put it on a tarp out of your way.
Then dig another trench next to the first one, also one foot wide and one foot deep with the same length. Go back to your first trench, and loosen the soil at the bottom of the trench (so you’re digging the first hole deeper). Put the soil you dug up from the second trench into the first trench.
Lather, rinse, and repeat until you have dug all the trenches you need. Fill the last trench with the soil you dug up from the first one.
