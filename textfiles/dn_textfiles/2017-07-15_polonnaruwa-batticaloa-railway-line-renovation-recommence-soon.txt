Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line renovation to recommence soon

Renovation work on the Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line, which has been suspended for many years due to war, will recommence soon, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. Minister de Silva made this observation during an observation tour of the Polonnaruwa Railway Station recently. The minister said the renovation project will be completed within two years. 
He said over 12,000 sleepers are required for the renovation of the 90 kilometre railway line between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa. Around 10,000 sleepers have been brought to the site. Trains run on the line at about 60km per hour due to many bridges and over 60 culverts. But, trains will travel at a speed over 100 km per hour after renovation, he said.
Encroachment by people on lands belonging to the Railway Department is a main reason for the delay of renovation. Steps will be taken to remove unauthorised occupants according to circulars approved by the Cabinet, the minister said.
