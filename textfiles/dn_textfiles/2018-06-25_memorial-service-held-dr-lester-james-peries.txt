Memorial service held for Dr. Lester James Peries

A memorial service for late Dr. Lester James Peries organised by his widow Sumithra Peries and extended family, was held at St. Mary’s Church, Bambalapitiya, recently. Holy Mass for the repose of the soul of Dr. Peries was offered by Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis along with Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Felician Perera and Social Communication National Director Rev. Fr. Lal Pushpadeva, OMI. Touching on the life of Dr. Peries, Bishop Mendis said one could clearly see how God moulded him through his family, where his father, Dr. James Francis Peries and mother, Mrs. Winifred Jayasuriya, were devout Catholics (living at Sihagiri, Dehiwala), who showed great devotion to St. Mary.
Bishop Valence Mendis pointed out how Dr. Peries effectively portrayed the Sri Lakan countryside, villages, temples and the Buddhist influence on the lives of the people, as well as customs, languages and music through his films, adding that Dr. Peries was fortune to have received the wholehearted co-operation, assistance and encouragement of his wife, Sumithra, who was a pillar of strength to him during 53 years of wedded life. He said Dr.
Bishop Mendis added that Dr. Peries’ simple lifestyle, the unassuming ways and his humility in the wake of greatness, were worthy of emulation and that even though he did not create films to amass wealth, through his cinematic creations, he earned the greatest honour of being called the Father of Modern Sinhala Cinema.
After Holy Mass, eulogies were delivered by Nirasha Gomez, the granddaughter of Dr. Peries’ only sister Erica and Professor Carlo Fonseka.
