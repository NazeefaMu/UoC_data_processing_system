Rain frustrates home side after Rudolph blast

LONDON, Saturday - Glamorgan were left frustrated by the rain after running up an impressive 171-5 in 17.2 overs against Somerset in their T20 Blast match played at Cardiff.
Captain Jacques Rudolph led the way with a beautifully-timed 65 not out off 37 balls, including six fours and two sixes.
He accelerated after the dismissal of Colin Ingram for 39 off 21 deliveries.
Th Spinner Roelof van der Merwe (0-29 in 4 overs) was Somerset's most economical bowler, while Aneurin Donald (24) and Chris Cooke (21) also chipped in quick runs for the Welsh county.
Both teams faced rapid turn-arounds for Sunday fixtures, with Glamorgan facing Essex at Chelmsford and Somerset taking on Middlesex at Uxbridge.
The match, which began 35 minutes late, was called off at 21:25 BST, giving Somerset their first point of 2017.
