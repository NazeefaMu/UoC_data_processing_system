Thisara Perera shines in BPL

Barisal Bulls opened their account in this season’s BPL with a six-wicket win over Comilla Victorians, whose fight fizzled out during a fourth-wicket stand of 49 between Mushfiqur Rahim (33) and Thisara Perera (34 n.o.), which sealed the contest.
Comilla, the defending champions, remain winless and would be worried by a brittle batting line-up, though bowling seems to be their strength.
Set 130 to win, Barisal opener Dilshan Munaweera struck two pleasing fours before getting caught at mid-off in the fifth over but Dawid Malan quickly restored the pressure with two boundaries in the same over.
