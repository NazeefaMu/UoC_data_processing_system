Floating hotel room sends guests drifting into the ocean

These incredibly futuristic hotel rooms take alternative holiday destinations to the next level.
Shaped as a perfect-ball, the sci-fi looking pods float across the ocean to a specified desert island programmed into its mapping system. Guests enjoy a night bobbing across the waves, before waking up on a blissful sandy shore.
The floating Mizukami Hotel has been designed by Japanese company Huis Ten Bosch and has massively divided opinion when it comes to hopping inside and setting off. Sleeping up to four, each room comes with double beds, toilets, showers and a perfect view of the star-spangled sky.
Measuring between 36-36 square metres, the self-contained pods are programmed to drift towards an island also owned by Huis Ten Bosch.
Company president Hideo Sawada said: "The room is the same as ordinary hotels. 36-38 square meters and about four people will be able to stay." Mirror
