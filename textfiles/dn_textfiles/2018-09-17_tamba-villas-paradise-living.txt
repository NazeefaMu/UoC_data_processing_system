Tamba Villas for paradise living

The Southern coast will soon be home to an idyllic, luxurious, yet at the same time, a home away from home development; Tamba Villas.
“To build a home that is so exceptional that coming home either for a holiday, or to live there permanently would be the ultimate in paradise living! This is Eduard Hempel’s vision for his latest venture, Tamba Villas, which he expressed at an exclusive gathering held in Colombo at Tintagel, to appraise those present of his latest project.
Director and Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas, Eduard Hempel a project in excess of US $ 15 million said “we want to give each home owner an idyllic life in a beautiful, safe space with all the comforts of modern day living. Our collection of 37 Villas have been purpose-built for people who like to work, holiday or retire in one of the most beautiful areas of Galle, a place that affords them a 5-Star life-style; in short Tamba villas in Thalpe”.
Tamba Estates Ptv Ltd, a Sri Lankan Limited company, owns 100 per cent of the land that Tamba Villas will be built on and this coupled with the fact that foreign investors can now buy Freehold in a condominium development, ensures that the Tamba Villa development will indeed be a sell out.
In Sri Lanka very specially for the launch of Tamba Villas were Architects to the project Darlene Smyth and Warren Liew from AD Lab Singapore, Anita Ricquier , Financier, Trust Singapore and Trevor Morgan, Director and Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas.
“Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the fourth floor up, and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldn’t sell them to foreigners, but this latest development now opens the doors wide for foreigners to invest in real estate in Sri Lanka. The timing is perfect and we are incredibly excited, as we are just going into market with our delightful Condominium/Villa development in Thalpe, and it is the first of its kind in the Country. Our timing couldn’t be better! Foreigners can now own their Free-hold, which opens up the doors globally” said Hempel.
Tamba Villas is a collaboration between Shakticola and Award-winning A D Lab, a Singaporean Architectural firm focused on cutting edge residential projects, while STIX, another award-winning landscape designer designed the lush tropical gardens. Together, they have designed generous spaces for tropical living in the form of unique villa homes which coexist in harmony with nature.
