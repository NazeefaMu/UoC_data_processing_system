LOLC Securities crowned Best Brokerage Research House in Sri Lanka 2017

The Global Banking and Finance Review Award for the Best Brokerage Research House in Sri Lanka 2017 was awarded to LOLC Securities Limited (LOSEC), the stock broking company of the LOLC Group.
With this latest accolade, LOSEC becomes one of the most awarded research teams in the broking industry of Sri Lanka, over the last few years. It is noteworthy that LOSEC clinched the ‘Best Brokerage Research House, Sri Lanka award’ – a category which was introduced for the first time in the country by the Global Banking and Finance Review.
Established in 2011 and now a fully owned subsidiary of the LOLC Group, LOLC Securities has been built for excellence in all its dimensions, keeping in mind the assurance sought by discerning investors. The company has devised a new operational model centered on the investors’ portfolio management strategy to ensure that LOSEC’s investment advice is backed strongly by an in-house advanced research team of highly qualified analysts.
The market reports compiled by LOLC Securities are detailed and analytical and offer valuable insights into market and economic trends and statistics. LOSEC’s subsidiary company, LOLC Capital One, established about a year ago, is a boutique investment bank which provides advisory services for mergers and acquisitions, debt capital markets and alternative investments.
Sharing his thoughts about the achievement, LOSEC CEO/Managing Director Sriyan Gurusinghe said, “Being recognized as the top brokerage research house in the country is a great accomplishment achieved by LOLC Securities Research Division. I’m extremely pleased and take humble pride of our experienced research team and expect they will continue to provide research with valuable investment insights to our clients to grow their wealth while helping to move the company towards the pinnacle of success.”
Shehan Bartholomeuz, the Research Head of LOSEC added, “LOLC Securities has over the years set the benchmark in equity research in Sri Lanka with unwavering focus in catering to the research needs of a wide range of clients from retail, institutional to foreign. The innovative culture we have inculcated in our team since the inception has resulted in driving our analysts to continuously improve and innovate, creating unique research products to capture vagaries in a frontier market like Sri Lanka. It is very humbling to see the prestigious global financial magazine 'Global Banking and Finance Review' recognizing us, cementing LOLC Securities’ place as an industry leader in equity research.”
LOSEC Senior Research Analyst Gayan Rajakaruna said, “As an analyst at LOLC Securities, I am delighted and encouraged by being recognised by 'Global Banking and Finance Review' magazine as the top brokerage research house in the country. Our strong team effort and the drive for producing high quality investment research were perhaps the key factors of paving the way to such accolade. We will continue to provide unbiased and investor-oriented research opinions through more in-depth and timely research to address a larger range of client needs”.
The Global Banking and Finance Review is among the world’s leading online and print magazines, which has evolved from the growing need to have a more balanced view for informative and independent news within the financial community.
