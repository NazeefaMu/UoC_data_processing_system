In the dying moments of the game with the score reading 21-all Kandy conceded a penalty and Charith Seneviratne put over the penalty and Air Force won 24-21. Kandy SC know that only a victory will keep them in the hunt for the league title for the 20th time in 24 seasons. It all points to a battle between the forwards and the halves. The Airmen will depend heavily on their forwards to deliver the goods, they have some superb forwards who are expected to dominate in the loose, they are also like to obtain a major share in the loose rucks and second phase attack. For Kandy SC it is going to be their three quarters who should pave the way, they have one of the best halves combinations. With good ball coming their way the standoff should set the line in motion at every turn as they have some speedy runners and good thinkers of the game. Dinka Peires will handle the whistle.
