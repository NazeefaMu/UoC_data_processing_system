LSSP rejects CTF recommendations

The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) vehemently rejects the recommendations by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) and urges the government to reject them and refrain from implementing them, LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said it will totally destroy the existing reconciliation and also create a huge conflict in the country making it another country in the Middle East. The recommendations are based on the 'Darusman Committee Report' which contains inaccurate and fabricated facts such as killing 40,000 Tamil civilians during the last days of the humanitarian operation.
But the actual and accepted number by the UN and the entire world is between 7,000 to 8,000, Prof Vitharana said. He said all countries where foreign and international judge or judges were involved ended up with taking all political and military leaders to the International Court of Criminal Justice, prosecuting them and convicting them for committing war crimes.
"The same will happen in Sri Lanka if the CTF recommendations are implemented," Prof. Vitharana said.
He said according to military leaders, the Sri Lankan armed forces did not use multi barrel rockets and only used arms that could attack short distances to defeat the LTTE. It was the LTTE which killed civilians. According to scientific calculations, if 40,000 civilians were killed there would have been around 200,000 casualties. The entire Sri Lanka, except the Western Province, does not have 200,000 beds in hospitals, he added.
