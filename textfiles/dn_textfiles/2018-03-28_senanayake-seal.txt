The Senanayake seal

“Monument of D S Senanayake is far finer and rarer than stone or marble”— Donald Kennedy
‘Men are known by the monuments they leave, the roots from which they come and the quality of their personalities. The monument Mr Senanayake has left is not of stone or marble. It is far finer and rarer than that. He was the architect of Ceylon’s independence and its first guiding hand. He has left a free, independent people who may now enjoy their freedom of thought, speech and right of worship in their own way’: Donald Kennedy --US State Department: President of Stanford University; Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during the Carter Administration.
DS realised that the future prosperity of Sri Lanka depended on the growth of nation’s agriculture. He was anxious that national reputation could not be maintained if food supply was to depend on foreign resources. Authoring “Agriculture and Patriotism” the first book on his pet subject as Minister of Agriculture in the State Council, he wrote, “It is almost as if that sense of inferiority that is sometimes seen to overwhelm a Ceylonese to the presence of his European brother has also attached itself to the native products. Rice and other grains, eggs, onions, chillies and ginger are humble, though useful, commodities. Fruit has a status only a trifle higher than these. To be engaged in their production is something to be ashamed of.”
One of his greatest achievements under the rebuilding of ancient irrigation schemes and reclaiming of the dry zone, is the system he initiated in and around Polonnaruwa. The main requirement in this task was the renovation of the Parakrama Samudraya.
Senanayake was a practical man of high calibre— a visionary he was glad to share his thoughts and opinions with anyone who had something useful to offer— his priorities are valid even today as they were in 1930s and 40s.
Senanayake understood that the decline in food production was due to the fact that this form of agriculture was un-loved by the educated and the well-to-do in the society. The irrigation schemes in ancient Ceylon, the earliest recorded from about 300 BC, during King Pandukabhaya’s reign and under continuous expansion for the next millennium, were some of the most intricate systems of the world.
In addition to building underground inland waterways, they were among the foremost to build totally artificial tanks to accumulate water.
The system was widely restored and further extended during Parakramabahu’s reign (1153–1186), followed by D. S. Senanayake [1931-1952]. One of DS’s greatest achievements under the rebuilding of ancient irrigation schemes and reclaiming of the dry zone, is the scheme he initiated in and around Polonnaruwa. The main requirement in this task was the renovation of the Parakrama Samudraya.
Another measurement of DSS’s Economic wisdom was the encouragement of animal husbandry as part of agriculture reforms. He educated the peasantry in the methods of housing, feeding and breeding in live-stock farms.
He also introduced protective procedures for animal husbandry and agriculture produce, by doing away with the egg imports. Senanayake finished his first term laying sound foundation for a rural economy by building irrigation facilities and led the stride towards self-sufficiency in rice. The rice production had been placed on the delicate shoulders of the debt-ridden peasant who did not own land.
“It is a remarkable fact that we in Ceylon, while repeating in season and out, that ours is an agricultural country and that her prosperity is inextricably bound up with her agricultural progress, should yet be apparently content to pay a bill in a year of depression (1933) of nearly 87 million rupees for the imports of our food and drink.” - D. S. Senanayake
Hands-on wisdom
The commercial products or plantation crops commanded credit from the banks and brokers and more profitable and of course more respectable.
Senanayake acknowledged the significance of nutrition in a food production policy. His book contains chapters on irrigation, land policy colonization, rural indebtedness and agricultural labour.
The wisdom of the late DS Senanayake’s agricultural policy needs concerted attention at a time when the country is facing a rice crisis. Attention to administrative efficiency was primary among his economic and political wisdom.
DS’s hands-on realistic wisdom, too helped a lot in carrying out the programmes. Realism was another measurement of his Pragmatism.
His recommendations should have been carried out rigorously and carefully by those who followed him to leadership, if so, the village economy today would be in a much better condition.
If DS disagreed with someone’s idea, he would put across it with an introduction like “I would mean”, “As a matter of fact” or “Actually”, and never pushing his way up in an oppositional face. If unconvinced, in the nicest likely way, that they should now withdraw, think again and come back.
‘Ours is an agricultural country and our prosperity is inextricably bound up with her agricultural progress’--DSS
Racial issues, cultural sloppiness, religious hostility and language enmity have made any real progress in a developing country; is it possible under a so-called democratic system of government?
It is not the system, but success depends finally on bold and clear-sighted leadership who can follow a direct course without much politicking in development without above attachments.
Independence from British
Sir Ivor Jennings, former Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University, writing on Senanayake and Independence, says, that most of the agitation for independence by others have been on the wrong lines.
The British getting the fullest support for the war effort from the State Council headed by Senanayake, Dominion status was promised soon after the war. Not breaking the word, there came to be appointed a Commission under Viscount Soulbury. “Soulbury Constitution’ it was called, but the fact is that it was produced by Mr Senanayake”- Jennings
Sir John Kotelawala, his nephew and loyal subordinate says— “No other man had so many political enemies. But few others lived to make those same enemies come round to at least to grudging admiration”.
‘Ours is an agricultural country: her prosperity inextricably bound up with agricultural progress’
