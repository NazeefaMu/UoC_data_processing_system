Chosen Chaucer

Critics consider Chaucer as the father of English Literature. He wrote in what is known as “Middle English”. He was a significant writer in the 14th century. Although his style of witting was far removed from the 21st century what he produced, particularly his The Canterbury Tales contains amusing and humorous stories that have been enjoyed by successive readers up to now. It’s really a long poem.
A group of pilgrims while on their way to Canterbury tell each other different stories. Reading these we come to know the life and social setup in England six or seven centuries ago. In terms of Linguistics, the language has a strong influence of the French language, but we are able to read these stories rendered in modern English.
Language of yore
Academics point out that Chaucer modelled his work on some early Italian works. However, he enriched the English language of yore. Besides, he had also served in the Army of Edward III. Therefore, he was a poet, soldier and a diplomat. That could have brought him varied experiences.
An interesting observation is that in his Canterbury Tales, Chaucer describes vividly the scene of the pilgrimage as both a pilgrim and poet. Good literature withstands time and Chaucer’s works have proven that.
That’s great.
Here now are short reminders on Geoffrey Chaucer’s work that would stimulate your reading. He belonged to the House of Ulster and we learn that a famous French poem titled’ Roman de la Rose’ popularized the dream vision of the pet. In the Canterbury Tales, we notice that 29 pilgrims are travelling. In Canterbury, the Saint Thomas Becket was martyred.
Springtime entertainment
In the General Prologue, the poetic tradition of the Medieval Reverie- the evocation of April and spring find a place. That was lyric that spoke of springtime and all that went along with it.
The mention of Ram signifies dependence on astrology. The pilgrims met at the Inn at Southwark. The structure of the poems is based on the Italian text-The Decameron of Boccaccio. Levels of feudal society in Medieval England are King, Barons, Knights and Villains. The Knight loved chivalry, truth, honour, freedom and courtesy-the poet implies.
There is a line in the Tales- foughten for our faith. Here Feith means Christian Faith and it was included because it was one of the duties of the Knight. The Knight has fought in such places as Alexandria, Prussia, Latvia, Russia and Granada.
Prioress refers to a Nun who is the Head of the convent od Priori. Her name is Madam Eglantine. She speaks in the style of French Stratford-at-Bowe. She feeds her dogs roasted flesh, milk and white bread. In her brooch ‘Amor Vincent Omni’. It stands for Love Conquers All. Red and Green are the colours in her rosary.
Various medicines
In the original sense the word, ‘doctor’ meant a very learned person. The pilgrim doctor had read some of the early writers of medicine such as Esculaopias, Seficorides, Riufus, Hippocrates, Hali, Galen, Averrhoes, Gilbert and Constantine, we learn from the text.
The physician was well-versed not only in medicine but also in astrology as it was closely related to medicine in the Middle Ages. He had trade relations with the Apothecary. Pestilence means the plague. He loved money or gold exceedingly well.
When Chaucer says “Wife of Bath: he is not referring to Bath. Bath was the name of a place and his portrait is of a housewife from there. Her profession was weaving. She had had five husbands. The predominant colour of her dress was red and scarlet. Her gap-toot signify her flirtish nature Chaucer suggests.
As we would have noticed, the General prologue to the Canterbury Tales describes various characters who are on their way to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas a Beckett.
The narrator describes the appearance and behaviour of each of them without openly judging them. The characters are a cross-section of medieval British society. The irony is that the characters are far removed from the ideals of their professions and vocations. But the Knight is presented with high ideals.
Interesting tales
The subtle irony and humour make this General Prologue a classic word picture or cartoon of medieval society. I enjoyed reading the Canterbury Tales and the General Prologue prompted me to go and read the different tales. Yow will enjoy. Try.
