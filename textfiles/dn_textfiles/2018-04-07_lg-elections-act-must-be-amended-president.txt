LG Elections Act must be amended - President

President Maithripala Sirisena, yesterday, emphasised the need to change the Local Government Elections Act immediately to avoid distortion of opinion expressed by the people.
“The LG Elections Act should be amended to ensure that the winning party forms the administration of the Council, contrary to what has happened today,” he said.
The President was addressing the heads of media institutes at President’s House in Colombo, yesterday.
He said that it was not always the winning party forms the administration in local councils. “This is not a good political culture,” he said.
President Sirisena also emphasised that the number of members in local councils should reduce to 4,000 as it was earlier, since it was a burden on the government to maintain 8,000 members. In short, he said the government cannot afford it.
The President said the changes would take place from the next elections.
