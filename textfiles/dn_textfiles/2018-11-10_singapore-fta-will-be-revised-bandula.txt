Singapore FTA will be revised : Bandula

The Free Trade Agreement with Singapore would not be hastily abolished, but would be revised to prevent any harmful impact on local entrepreneurs, International Trade and Investment Promotion Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department yesterday, after assuming duties in his Ministry.
He said the report of the five-member Committee headed by Colombo Universityformer Vice Chancellor and Emeritus Professor of EconomicsW.D.Lakshman, is expected within another week. “We will consider this report and the Supreme Court judgment on it.
After consulting the opinions of experts, I will present a Cabinet Paper to revise the FTA with Singapore,” he said.
He noted that he had asked his Ministry Secretary to seek a report from the Customs Director General on the current status of lifting import duties on over 4,000 items listed in the FTA.
He added that the FTAs with Thailand, Bangladesh and China, which had already been prepared, would be subject to a careful study prior to inking them.
Outlining his future plans in his new ministerial portfolio, he stressed that his approach would be entirely different to that of his predecessor Malik Samarawickrama, adding that local producers would be given prominence over foreign investors.
However, he said that none of the on-going projects would be suspended in haste, adding that the new Government would not act in an arbitrary manner as the previous Government did when they suspended the Colombo Port City.
He said that he would propose an “investment promotion package” to private sector local and foreign investors to protect them and to provide them special incentives. He said this package would be available to those who invest in projects approved by the Finance Ministry. He said this budgetary proposal would provide unprecedented incentives to local producers.
He also came up with the proposal to set up “5,000 export processing villages” to boost exports within a short period. “Agriculture and industrial products with a permanent market would be processed in these villages. Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia follow such a system and a similar effort was made by former Trade Minister Lalith Athulathmudali,” he explained.
He also said that certain imports would be regulated, adding that the tax policy would also be revised. He said close ties would be maintained with India, China, the US and Korea.
