TUs decision today

The Railway unions will decide on whether to continue with the strike or not based on their meeting with the Ministerial Sub-Committee on the railway issue chaired by Dr Sarath Amunugama, scheduled to be held at 9.00 am today (13).
“We will continue the strike until a favourable agreement is reached, said Railway Guards’ Union, President Janaka Fernando speaking to the Daily News.
The Union members also refused to accept their ‘vacated post’ letters yesterday bringing action against the unions to a stalemate.
“You cannot remove us and we will not accept it”, was the defiant stance taken by the unions as explained that the letter did not come into effect if the employees do not officially accept it.
“According to the law, the original letter of vacated posts is given to the employee, and a copy is filed in office. The copy does not become valid if the employee refuses to accept it,”he said. If the Department is to send the letter through registered post, then too only the person it is addressed to can legally accept it,
“Even if a family member accepted the letter on behalf of the employee, the Department cannot state that the letter has been accepted by the employee, thus he remains in employment,” Fernando said.
“We are permanent employees and there are certain procedures that need to be met to remove us, the Union leader further said.
The Unions have been on strike since December 8 citing salary discrepancies and problems in the Engine Driver Assistant recruitment exams.
