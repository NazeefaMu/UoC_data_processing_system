Airman attached to BIA nabbed trying to smuggle out gold jewellery

An airman attached to the Sri Lanka Air Force security at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was arrested yesterday while trying to smuggle out Rs 1 million worth of gold jewellery, strapped to his legs.
Sri Lanka Air Force officials who made the discovery while monitoring their surveillance cameras had handed the airman over to the Customs, Customs Media Spokesperson Dharmasena Kahandawa said.
“A Sri Lankan passenger traveling from Dubai had handed over the jewellery to him in the toilet and he was trying to walk out of the Departure section when he was caught,”Kahandawa explained.
According to the Customs Media Spokesperson, the airman had been working at the BIA for some time and investigations have revealed that this was not his first time smuggling gold out of the airport. Investigations are also being carried out into the passenger who transferred the gold to the airman.
The airman has been identified to be a 32 year old resident of Dehiyattakandiya and the gold weighed in at 2.64 kilograms.
“A fine of Rs 1 million was imposed on the airman and the gold forfeited,”Kahandawa said.
