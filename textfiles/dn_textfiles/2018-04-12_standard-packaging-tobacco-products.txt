Standard packaging for tobacco products

Cabinet this week approved the introduction of ‘Standard Packaging’ for tobacco products to reduce the appeal of smoking.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Rajitha Senaratne asked that the standard package have only two colours; black and white, and no other picture or mark can be displayed other than the trade name, product name, quantity of the production and information or mark determined or made compulsory by the Government such as health warnings.
In order to adopt this change, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No 27 of 2006 would have to be amended and cabinet directed the Legal Draftsman to make draft the necessary amendments.
Tobacco smoking is estimated to kill 25,000 persons every year and the government from time to time has introduced; pictorial health warnings, the restriction of places where smoking is allowed, banning of advertisements and promotion, rationalization of the tobacco tax structure and nationwide information and education programmes to discourage smoking among the general population.
The Minister in his paper pointed out that cigarette consumption by adult males had decreased from 29 percent in 2011 to around 24 percent in 2015 as a result of the measures above and that his target was to reduce it to 15 percent in next four years.
Australia and the UK which have adopted plain packaging or standard packing together with pictorial health warnings have shown that these steps have contributed to a decline in smoking in the last three years.
