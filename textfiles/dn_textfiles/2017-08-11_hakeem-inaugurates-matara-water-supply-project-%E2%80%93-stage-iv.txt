Hakeem inaugurates Matara Water Supply Project – Stage IV

Although a litre of bottled drinking water is sold at a minimum price of Rs.60 and the people readily buy it and the government provides clean drinking water to residences and premises of consumers at a subsidized price of merely Rs. 12 for every 1,000 litres. the expenditure incurred on it by the Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) is Rs.49, more than four times the price charged, Minister of City Planning and Water Supply and Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Rauff Hakeem said.
He was addressing the official inauguration of the construction of the Matara Water Supply Project – Stage IV, held last Sunday (August 6) at the Nupe Junction regional office of the WSDB.
“While we inaugurate this new water supply project in Matara, an acute drought and water scarcity prevails in another part of the country and the government is also extending relief assistance to the drought-affected people in such areas,” the Minister said. The officially stipulated time span for revising water tariffs is only three years, but the government has not enforced any revision of tariffs although four years have lapsed, he said. In spite of it, the government’s decision to increase the tariff rate by Rs.6 has come under politically-motivated and unreasonable protests, he further said.
The NWDB obtains investment-oriented loans for implementing new water supply projects and the loans have to be repaid and this fact should be understood by the people without political colouring, he said. Under the Matara project, steps will also be taken to construct a protective wall to prevent the the Nilwala river water being mixed with saline water during the drought season, the Minister said. Protests against such far-reaching development projects due to political reasons are obviously detrimental to the people’s welfare and should be avoided, the Minister said.
The previous government encountered similar problems but very unfortunately they too are now encouraging such protests on political expediency, he said.
Not a single project was initiated during the past decade, disregarding the rapid population growth of the district.
The extension of the Southern highway to Matara and the relative increase on the demand for drinking water and today’s necessity is to address the need for drinking water taking all these factors into consideration, the Minister said. Matara, Mirissa, Malimbada, Devinuwara, Kottegoda and Dickwella areas are benefiting under the water supply project, especially under the Matara Joint Water Supply Project and the Wligama Water Supply project. 59,300 cubic meters water is produced per day, with provision of 86,000 water connections and about 350,000 people are benefited.
There are difficulties in supplying water regularly to certain high and low elevation areas due to water-pressure problems, especially in the months of February and March, the Minister said.
