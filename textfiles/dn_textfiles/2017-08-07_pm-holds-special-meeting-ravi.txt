PM holds special meeting with Ravi

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe held a special meeting with Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, on Saturday evening.
Informed government sources said the Prime Minister would soon have a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Minister Karunanayake’s issue. The Prime Minister met the Foreign Minister in the light of recent developments at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate into the Treasury Bonds issue.
In a testimony before the Commission, last month, it was revealed that Arjun Aloysius, the former CEO of Perpetual Treasuries had paid a lease amount of close to 8.7 million on behalf of the family of the then finance minister Ravi Karunanayake, for a fifth-floor super luxury condominium apartment at the Monarch residencies.
