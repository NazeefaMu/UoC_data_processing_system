Hambantota incident: Prof. G.L  asks  for maximum punishment

The police officer under arrest for attacking a journalist at the Hambantota protest should be given the maximum punishment under the Penal Code, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna President Prof. G. L. Peiris said yesterday.
He was addressing a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition in Colombo.
"A police officer has no right to attack a person. The journalist's ear was extensively damaged with the attack. This was a serious offence under the Penal Code," he said.
He said the Joint Opposition asked for maximum punishment on the offender.
