ICF Pentecost rally 2018

The Inter-Church Fellowship (ICF), an informal interdenominational fellowship, will hold a rally on Saturday, May 26, to mark the feast of Pentecost.
The Pentecost 2018 will be held at the Kollupitiya Methodist Church, from 9.00 to 12.00 noon on Saturday, May 26.
This eighth annual inter church Pentecost rally brings together people representative of the entire Christian community: Catholic, mainline Christian churches and the Evangelical churches.The spirit of ICF is to build bridges of friendship and trust, spanning the diversity of the community. The Pentecost rally draws both lay people and clergy, in all three language media into a celebration with the intent of interaction at all levels of the community.
Praise, worship, prayer, insightful messages and an opportunity for fellowship are included in the programme.
ICF’s theme for the event this year is ‘Spiritual Superpower.’ It is the power of the Spirit of God in the church. This enables its service to the community in love and compassion. Speakers from each of the major groups of the Christian community will bring messages in Sinhala, Tamil and English, portraying a united and reconciled community.
ICF invites Christians from all traditions to this event.
