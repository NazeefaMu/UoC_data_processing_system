Wedding ring reappears after nine years

A New Jersey woman has her wedding ring back, nine years after she accidentally flushed it down her toilet.
Paula Stanton was sure the diamond-encrusted gold ring was lost forever after she noticed it wasn't on her finger while she was cleaning her bathroom nearly a decade ago.
Luckily, a member of Somers Point's public works department remembered Stanton mentioning the ring about three years ago. Last month, Ted Gogol was doing maintenance work near a manhole about 400 feet from Stanton's house.
He tells the Press of Atlantic City he saw a shiny object sitting the mud. It turned out to be Stanton's ring, and after boiling it in peroxide and lemon juice, she is wearing it again.
