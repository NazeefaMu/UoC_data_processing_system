Positive vibes

Umara Sinhawansa is a phenomenally gifted and talented artiste and an individual who values uprightness with a set of principles. She is a well- known face on the show Youth With Talent and is a charismatic judge and a household name. Melodies features Umara, who has been in the music industry for a long time and has conducted herself with honor.
“To me music is not about showing skin, I don’t believe in music that is about nudity or drugs. I think music is a universal language where people can connect, and there has to be a message. To me music is trying to make someone feel good. If you are feeling down and I make you feel good through my music then I am happy. It is not about singing about drugs and alcoholism and showing skin. That is so not about me.
If you go through back in time, you never see me revealing my skin, I have not come this far by showcasing something that I am not. To me it is my throat, it is my voice and if I can touch you for some reason and inspire you to do something good in life, that is what music is to me,” explained Umara.
Umara does not believe in short cuts. For her hard work is a must. To her success means work ethic, determination, focus and having passion and love for what you do.
“To be a successful musician I do not believe in short cuts in life. Currently unfortunately money does all the talking. Working hard and sacrificing a lot of blood, sweat and tears and coming up the ladder the right way with your own experiences, will help you sustain yourself in the industry for a longer period, rather than spending money and coming up in the industry – it will be a shorter period of your time. You will not be able to sustain yourself in the industry. To me success is being able to sustain yourself in the industry after your hard work and after being recognized for your hard work,” said Umara.
Umara and her sister had an idyllic childhood being born into a musical family. Music she says hits her to the soul, whether it is rock, jazz or classical music. It just hits her to the core. Because she grew up in her family, it became a norm for her. It became a day to day thing for her like inhaling and exhaling and is something she cannot live without.
“My childhood was the best I ever could have ask for or dream of because my parents were both musicians, so we toured a lot in Europe. My sister Umariya and I were very fortunate to grow up in that atmosphere. We were exposed to different genres of music and different cultures. So we learnt the very basics of stage management. I always wanted to be like my mother.
I still remember us cousins being on the couch with our milk bottles, while they were rehearsing on stage and wanting to be just like my mom. It was the best time I could say. I don’t remember anything that was negative at all. My passion for music can be traced back to my parents. We are a very musical family, from generation to generation. It was in our genes and our blood,” stated Umara.
Inspiration to write lyrics is based on the situation she is in. Where song writing is concerned, it is mainly her life experiences, be it a sad moment or an inspirational moment in her life. Even after her son was born she jotted down a few lyrics.
“In 2011 I did release an album, I have a couple of singles that were released. My most famous single was ‘Wassanayata Atha Wanala’.I think I went to the furthest that I could have imagined in this country, to the rural people with that song. It has been more than seven years since I released that song. And it is still very popular which I am very proud about.
In addition to that I have done a couple of collaborations. I was fortunate to do a collaboration with Shanker Ehsaan Loy. I was with Bhathiya and Santhush for a long time. I did a couple of hit songs with them as well. The last song I released was with the ever so famous Chitral Somapala – Malakuth Thibuna,” pointed out Umara.
Her music is a mix of R&B, blues, classical, rock, hip hop and so based on every occasion it changes. If it is a sit down dinner then it is jazz.
“One of the most special events that I have done is making a guest appearance at the Make A Wish Foundation, in Hong Kong. There was one particular concert where I had to sing with my parents and their band as well which was in Germany. Every concert is memorable in their own different ways. Singing with my sister has been very special for me. On and off we perform,” added Umara.
Umara says creativity is being inspired by that particular moment and trying to think out of the box. This has helped her sustain herself in the industry and she feels blessed to be accepted by the public for who she is.
“There is no point in me thinking the same thing someone else is thinking and trying to plant the seed of that and letting it grow. Because that would be the same thing all over the place. So being creative is about being me. Being truthful to who I am. And not trying to be something which I am not,” pointed out Umara.
Umara has no fear when facing challenges. She does not avoid challenges.
“There is no experience if there are no challenges in life. You have to face every challenge. To sustain yourself in the industry you face those challenges without avoiding them. It is easy to avoid them but then your reputation will not survive. I think reputation is very important. When there is a challenge facing it without fear is the right thing to do,” said Umara.
Youth with Talent holds a special place in Umara’s heart. It means a lot to her because it is very Sri Lankan. She feels very privileged to be a judge. She feels nothing but honor and pride when she sits down before the performers.
“Youth with Talent is an amazing show, that opened my eyes to so many things in my own country that I never thought I would see. We have a habit of underestimating ourselves because we compare ourselves with international platforms. Youth with Talent helped me widen my perspectives about Sri Lankans and why I am proud to be a Sri Lankan. We are very authentic and different compared to the international platforms. We can stand out in the international platforms because we use our Sri Lankan culture. This is what I notice about this show. It is so different to the international platform.
These people come from rural areas and with very less facilities. There were people who came with Rs. 400 in their pockets and they slept in the streets for two weeks because they were selected to the second round and they borrowed money from people. They really work very hard. For me to sit there and watch, that is such a privilege,” explained Umara.
Umara is a big fan of Nanda Malini, Umaria, Nirosha Virajini and Amaradeva. Internationally her idols would be Whitney Houston, Destiny’s Child, Beyonce and Maria Carey. “American Idol, X- Factor, Youth With Talent is an opportunity and a platform to showcase your talent, your vocal flexibility and the flexibility of your talent. What I say is, use that platform to come up in the industry. Kelly Clarkson won American Idol but is still huge today. She used that platform. Same goes for Carrie Underwood. Beyonce competed in contests she never won but she is huge today. I would love to be successful internationally. I want to slowly expand as a Sri Lankan musician,” said Umara.
