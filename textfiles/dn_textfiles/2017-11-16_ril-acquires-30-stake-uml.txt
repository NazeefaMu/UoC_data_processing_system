Post acquisition, the strength of UML’s core business operations and strong dividend track record, will also contribute to the overall strength of RIL Group. In the meanwhile,RIL is steadily progressing towards using the funds raised through our recent IPO to achieve the objectives stated in the Prospectus, particularly the redevelopment of the “READYWEAR” Building. We are also actively pursuing the branch expansion strategy of the BreadTalk operation in line with our intended plans. “
