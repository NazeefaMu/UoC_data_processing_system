‘NWP to produce its own herbal medicine’

The required herbal medicine for 34 central Ayurvedic dispensaries and 10 Ayurvedic hospitals within both, the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP), would be hereafter manufactured within the province, NWP Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Anura Seneviratne told the Daily News.
For this purpose, a manufacturing plant was recently set up at the Kurunegala Welegedara General Ayurvedic Hospital. A sum of Rs. 12.5 million could be saved annually, as there would be no need for the import of essential herbal medicine, he added.
