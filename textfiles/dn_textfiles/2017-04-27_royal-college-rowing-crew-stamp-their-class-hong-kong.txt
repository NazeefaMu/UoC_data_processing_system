Royal College Rowing Crew stamp their class in Hong Kong

The Royal College, Colombo Rowing Crew of 2016 stamped their class by winning medals in all events they have participated at the recently concluded 62nd Head of the Bay regatta conducted by the the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club (RHKYC) at the Middle Island club house in Hong Kong.
The Head of the Bay regatta is a time trial race rowed over either a 2.5km fine rowing course or a 5km coastal rowing course. What makes this race unique is the fact that it is held in an open water course instead of the flat waters where most regattas are held. The oarsmen faced new challenges from water conditions and difficult navigations throughout the race. Unlike the common straight courses, the Deep Water Bay course requires coxswains to accurately steer to marker buoys and complete quick turns around them. This different style of racing made it an interesting and completely new experience.
The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is one of the oldest sports clubs in Hong Kong and have a rich and colourful history of over 170 years. The regatta was participated by 11 Clubs and representatives from 4 Counties.
The Royalist who entered in the Fine Course event dominated the category winning every event included the Men’s U19 Fine 1x won by the 2017 captain Hashen Hettigoda.
The Men’s U19 4x was won by the Royal Crew comprising Waruna Hewamanne, Kaveen Rajapakshe, Hashen Hettigoda, Jatu Rockwood and Coxed by Revata Karunasundera with a timing of 11.09 which was ranked as the best time in the regatta for the fine boats category. The Men’s Open 2x was won by Hashen Weerakkody and Praveen Weerakkody.
The Mens fine open 4+ was won by The Royal College ‘A’ crew which was stroked by Prathap Perera with Praveen Happugale at Three, Charin Wijethilleka at Two, Lasaru Kudaligama at Bow and Coxed by Avishka Jayaweera, where as the Royal College B4+ Stroked by Kaveen Rajapaksha with Praveen Weerakkody at Three, Kavinda Mathew at Two, Lasindu Gamage at Bow, coxed by Revata Karunasundera came in second only behind the ‘A’ crew by 2 seconds. Both the ‘A’ and ‘B’ crews which timed 11:32 and 11:34 respectively, ranked as the 2nd and 3rd best timings for the fine boats category.
This was a significant achievement as the Royal crew managed to perform at such a caliber displaying class, skill. It was a memorable tour as it had been over a decade since the entire team represented school internationally. The RHKYC was pleased by the Royalists visit and invited them to participate again in the future.
