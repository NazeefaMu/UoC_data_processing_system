Wimal, six others, to be charged for protest demo

The Cinnamon Gardens police yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court that the prosecution was intending to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocks the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein.
Seven suspects ,NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lucien are currently out on bail.
MP Wimal Weerawansa was not present in Court yesterday since he had been remanded in connection with another case.
Police informed Court that the suspects who organised the procession had failed to obtain the prior permission from police to organise the march. They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license. Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocks the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic. President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the suspects.
Further magisterial inquiry into the matter was postponed for April 24.
