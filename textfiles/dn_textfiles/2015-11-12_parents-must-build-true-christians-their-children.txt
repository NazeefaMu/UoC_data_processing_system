[CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVES]
Parents must build True Christians in their Children

In the heavily packed Diocesan Council Chamber, the Lord Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Delo Canagasabey in his opening address at the 3-day session, opted to talk about Christian upbringing of children as early as possible so they may know the Lord as their Father and Saviour. His focus at the 130th session, apart from little ones were his concern for the retiring priests.
“Encourage little children towards spirituality by keeping Sunday free for God as a dedication in their faith. Leave behind tuition classes on the Sabath and energise their feel of God and be guided by his love and blessings. The parents must make it their priority to influence and build good Christians in their children so that they will grow up in the wisdom and knowledge of their Father. This is their responsibility towards nurturing what they learnt as little children so that generation to generation God will live in their hearts and realize the importance of the Kingdom of Heaven”, Said his Lordship.
If the young are directed at a tender age towards their faith, they will know to identify evil from good and not stray towards temptation and worldly leanings as they grow up and bear witness to God's eternal love away from the internet and a fast-moving world because Jesus loved the young very much and said ‘Let the little ones come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the Kingdom of heaven. (Mathew 19:14)
The Rev. Marc Billimoria, Warden St. Thomas College presenting his paper said that pursuant to Resolution number 18 passed at the 129th Session of the Diocesan Council in 2014 be amended by the repeal of all existing words in the said sub-section and by the substitution therefore of the following new words namely, the Bishop may at his sole discretion to continue a Presbyter referred to in service for a further period done annually on such terms as the Bishop may determine provided however that notwithstanding such extension of services, any Presbyter holding the office of Archdeacon or Area Dean shall cease to hold such office on December 31 of the year that person reaches 65 years of age. Such persons extended would be entitled to a full stipend and allowances during the extended period.
This retiring age Resolution came into much discussion with Rev. Billimoria explaining in detail why it should be adopted once all without it being carried over to next year's sessions. The House adopted the Resolution unanimously.
It was also resolved by the Council whereas the Council has been made aware that the National Christian Council of Sri Lanka NCCSL of which the Church of Ceylon is a member, is taking steps to grant Associate membership to few selective Churches. It was also resolved that it is the right of every child to learn his own religion in schools among the many lapses that our Christian children face with admission to schools and who are forced to learn other faiths in many schools.
Among almost dozen of important Committees elected among the clergy and laity, the most important one being the Standing Committee, elected from among the representative clergy and laity of the country to steer the whole process of the Church, sadly lacks fair representation outside the Colombo Diocese year after year and it is Colombo Diocese that get elected except for a few strays.
This is not fair.
Where is the voice of the rest of the country?
How can Anglicanism be fostered this way?
This sadly leads to frustration and disinterest where the rich Churches in Colombo Deanery gets richer and the rest gets poorer both spiritually and materially. This power-block must be broken if we all share to upkeep Anglicanism in the country through the Church's ‘Caring For Our Life, Together In Our Common Home.
A constitutional change where by the Bishop is empowered to nominate some outstation members to the Standing Committee might suffice the sad situation.
