New Cabinet to be sworn in this week

The full set of new Cabinet Ministers will take their oaths this week, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He disclosed this at a meeting held at the Panadura Divisional Secretariat on January 21.
The meeting was held to mark the distribution of furniture and other equipment among 14 social organisations in the division.
These included Death Donation Societies, Youth and Women Societies in the area.
Dr. Senaratne said the new Cabinet has been formulated on a scientific basis.
It would be a full Cabinet. The Ministers would take oaths once the President discussed the new list of Ministers on his return from Britain after attending the CHOGM meeting. The Government would march forward as one component and launch a new programme of work targeting future elections.
The Minister said during the recent local elections too, he suggested that the two main parties contest together. But, it was not implemented.
Although the Prime Minister agreed with this idea, certain lawyers in the President’s camp took an opposing view. And this caused a confusing election result.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said the Joint Opposition would not win the 2020 General Election.
“It could not gain 50 percent of the total vote without the support of minority communities,” he said.
The present government would win the next election too by uniting all forces under its banner. It could follow a better path and march forward as it has learnt a good lesson,” Minister Senaratne added.
