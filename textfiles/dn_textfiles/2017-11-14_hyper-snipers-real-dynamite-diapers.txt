Hyper snipers: Real dynamite in diapers!

Take it from one who knows and remember this: Kids may be cute but can be extremely manipulative. They will try all types of shenanigans to get what they want out of you! They have an astounding knack for making you feel guilty to get what they want. Many of them are award-winning thespians to boot.
Most times they remind me of ‘Hot Stuff’ – portrayed in the cartoon above - the little devil comic book character created by Warren Kremer in the 50s. Imbued with a mischievous personality and able to produce fire, Hot Stuff appears as a red child devil who wears a diaper (said to be made of asbestos) and carries a magical sentient pitchfork (referred to as his ‘trusty trident’, which is a character in its own right. Much to the consternation of his demonic brethren, Hot Stuff sometimes performs good to irritate them.
Don’t be fooled by the tears and tantrums or the guilt when you say ‘no’. Remember you are the adult. You are supposed to be in charge. But whoever you are never forget that the brat packs are totally anti-establishment. Oh yes, they are well-aware that they are totally dependent on you. But they do possess some ungrateful, perverse streak in their makeup that clearly displays an antagonistic view of all adults.
Beware! Don’t be taken in by them. Never underrate their cunning. They will target your vulnerabilities and use them against you. Besides, they execute the payback very well too. And if you give in once they will try harder to make you give in again. Are we talking here about babies or small children? I must agree there is a sort of difference. Babies tend to act for survival, they cry when they need something. But don’t be too sure!
Yet small children test boundaries around them to see what they can get away with. It’s more about want than need. Little Keshi from a very early age used to try to see what she could get away with especially with her doting aunts or grandmother. I have observed her being given pancakes with ice cream because she ‘couldn’t eat’ the chicken and rice they had made. Ridiculous!
The second I walked into the room she knew that she’d been exposed. She and her siblings Rex Tharindu, Moya and Kingco used to get away with the same ploy. The other thing they would do when they were smaller was fake crying. Again the tactic was employed only with their aunts and grandmother.
If they wanted to watch something or get into bed with them, they would start crying. I watched them and told the gullible adults it was just fake. But no, they would always give in and immediately the entire weeping gaggle would go into gales of giggles.
Still, a baby anywhere does make its presence felt. Its shrill cries, drooling mouth and gurgling laughter, can give the onlooker a feeling of ecstasy. There is no greater joy than watching a baby. A baby can melt even the toughest heart. What makes a baby tug at our heartstrings?
A baby has only one description. Cute! But hold on a second! The freshness, radiance and delightful gurgles exuded by the little bounders can change dramatically too. That is when the bubbly babble changes into banshee baying and diapers need to be replaced. Reminding one of the most apt descriptions of babies the world has been bequeathed with: “A baby is a loud noise at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.”
Ok, so imagine the scene. I am standing in a large Colombo supermarket queue. I am pushing a trolley of groceries while holding a little six-month bundle of someone else’s pride and creative joy in my arms. The woman in front of me can’t help admiring the bouncy bambino.
Then the well-meaning old soul simply begins drooling over the squirming sensation. “Oh, what a sweet baby! How cute! What an angel!” I smile politely and thank her for the compliment. Hey I nearly forgot how the adorable little rascal spent three solid hours screaming himself silly before I was forced to take him on this little jaunt.
And still the woman keeps looking at him with great awe and admiration before she pops the dreaded question: “Is he a good baby?” Imagine dear reader, what you might have done in my position. If you are ever in a court of law and are asked a similar question it is essential you plead whatever amendment you like to remain silent.
I mean, let’s be honest. Any way you respond could either be constituted as outright perjury or as undeniable proof that you are one of those guardians, the ones who are outwardly pitied but secretly labelled as a failure for having a difficult infant.
I just grin nonchalantly. How do you tell a stranger that whenever the mood gets to the tiny bozo he displays his true colours by working himself into a red-faced rage that tends to last the majority of each day and sometimes night. I have already decided he is in reality a con-artist. Yes, a bald, toothless con-artist who has duped everyone into bringing him home from the hospital to be waited on hand and foot for heaven knows how long.
I think I have solved the problem as far as toddler tantrums are concerned. It is best to ignore the flare up. This will work with some children. Distraction works best with younger toddlers at the onset of a tantrum. And if you can’t beat them join them.
If you are at home just join them and make a fool of yourself. Lie on the floor with them, kicking and screaming and turn it into a joke. Lighten up this very normal phase of childhood. But be warned. Some children will find this method even more infuriating, because you are stealing their spotlight!
As I said there is no foolproof technique in dealing with all tantrum throwing toddling tyrants.
There is this fool Clint who tried imitating me by rolling on the floor with little Kingco. Clint was on his knees as he and the toddler stared defiantly at each other. The standoff continued for some seconds. That was until Clint suddenly screamed as Kingco came at him headfirst.
The head-butting toddler got him square on the nose. A second later Clint was rolling on the floor in grotesque contortions, his hands clutching at his crotch. And the moral of my story? Never underestimate the reaction of dynamite in diapers. And never raise your hand to kids. It leaves your groin unprotected.
