Visual feast of diversity

The man is too frail, but he would not still give in. His cinema house does not attract crowds anymore. For they have moved beyond the scratch, watermark, film rolls and the shaky project. The crowds moved on to the newest phase of cinema, digitisation, about a decade back. And the old film exhibitor and his family are left with no option.
That sad story comes from India as ‘Cinemawala’ as directed by Kaushik Ganguly.
Sri Lanka has not yet accomplished cinema digitisation in full form. The country nevertheless upholds its cinema culture. The newest in its cinema agenda is SAARC Film Festival to be held from June 1 to 6 at the National Film Corporation premises. Ganguly’s ‘Cinemawala’, among others, will be screened on June 4.
SAARC Cultural Centre Director Wasanthe Kotuwella said that the motion picture is the advanced creative form of humanity’s gradual growth.
“In studying fellow humans, we cannot afford to forget anthropology. Anthropology is where we get the opportunity to study human behaviour and its evolution. The film and its gradual evolution is also helpful in understanding how we have evolved,” Kotuwelle said.
He added that the SAARC Festival has been promoting the cream of the region’s cinema creativity. The festival, held for the last five years, could promote each and every culture through different genres of art – film, in this case.
“The festival celebrates the best of South Asian talent, from feature films to short films. Each of these creations portrays various cultural features of the respective region,” SAARC Cultural Centre Deputy Director Soundarie David said.
The festival held in Colombo will provide a platform for cinema aficionados to interact with their foreign contemporaries. For any Sri Lankan student of culture – including anthropologists – this will be the opportunity to study how creativity works in neighbouring regions: India, Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan.
“The festival has been successful in the past. And we hope to expand the festival with more workshops and parallel programmes,” David added.
While David focused on the festival, Organising Committee Consultant Dhanushka Gunatilleke laid emphasis on the films being screened at the festival.
“All the films screened at the festival have been nominated by the Cultural Department or Cultural Affairs Ministry of the respective country. Our own ‘Ho Gana Pokuna’ and ‘Bora Diya Pokuna’ were also nominated by Cultural Affairs ministry,” Gunatilleke said.
The films are the window to observe the country that it represents. That said, the public can watch the cream of the South Asian region’s creativity.
Awards will be given to the Best Feature and Short Film. That category will be judged by a panel of international jury: France, Russia and Korea. The jury members have earned reputation in cinema. Parallel events such as masterclasses, workshops and interactive sessions are organised in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Foundation - Digital Film Academy.
The best feature trophy, in 2015, was given to Sri Lanka for ‘Motor Bicycle’ Directed by Shameera Rangana Naotunna.
Bangladesh bagged the Silver Medal for its ‘Mrittika Maya’ by Gazi Rakayet and ‘Insaana’ from the Maldives by Ali Seaxana received the bronze medal. The best short film of the 2015 festival was Nepal’s ‘Love Lust Life’ by Utpal Jha.
