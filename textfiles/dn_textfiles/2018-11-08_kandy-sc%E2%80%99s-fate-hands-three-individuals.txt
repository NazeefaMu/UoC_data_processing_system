Kandy SC’s fate in hands of three individuals

Kandy SC the defending league champions will field a strong XV this season too. Kandy SC’s destiny this season in the inter-club rugby is in the hands of three individuals, rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya, coach Sean Wijesinghe and Richard Dharmapala, the skipper.
Wijesuriya’s pleasant approach is drawing the players to Nittawela, while Dharmapala’s approach to the game should win him the full support of his team mates to overcome the challenges they have to expect from Colombo’s other glamour teams.
Wijesinghe, a product of Trinity College, a former Kandy SC and national “cap” helped the NIttawela club to reach dizzy heights in the last few years with his good coaching and this is going to be his last season. He is expecting to say goodbye to Kandy SC rugby.
In the past Kandy SC has put up gallant performances to thwart some of the best equipped clubs in the game. With some of the top ruggerites in the country with them there is little reason why Kandy SC cannot do it again.
As many as 35 players have turned up for practices at Nittawela, and they have been put in the correct path by Wijesinghe, his assistant Fazil Marija and former Isipathana College ruggerite Kapila de Silva who is the team manager. The blend of experience with the present players should help the Nittawella club to blossom out into a side as the best in the league.
Some the players who should keep Kandy SC colors flying are Richard Dharmapala, Gayan Weeraratne, Danushka Ranjan, Lahiru Ranaweera, Anuruddha Wilwara, Danush Dayan, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamitra Jayasinghe, Nigel Ratwatte,. Roshan Weeraratne, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Heshan Jansen, Tilina Wijesinghe all back division players. The forwards are Buvaneka Udangamuwa, Shehan Pathirana, Suhiru Anthony, Yaqoob Ali, Jason Dissanaike, Heshan Kalhara, Uchita Jayasuriya Ganuka Dissanaike, Ashan Darling, schoolboys Ishara Herath, Lahiru Daulagala, Harsha Dhananjaya and Rashmika Madushanka all from Maliyadeva who have thrown in their lot with Kandy.
Kandy SC’s matches for the season are: 10th November v Air Force SC at Ratmalana, 18th November v Police at Nittawela, November 24th v Army SC at Racecourse, December 2nd v CR & FC at Nittawela, December 9th v CH & FC at Nittawela, December 16th v Havelock SC at Nittawela and December 22nd v Navy SC at Welisara.
