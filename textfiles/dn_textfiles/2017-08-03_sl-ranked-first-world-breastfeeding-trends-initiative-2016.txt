SL ranked first in 'World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative - 2016'

Sri Lanka became the first country in the world in World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative - 2016's policy and progress scores. It is good if all Sri Lankan mothers can be granted six months of full-paid maternity leave in order to create a healthy and productive future generation, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Dhammika Rowel said.
Addressing a Health Seminar on 'Sustaining Breastfeeding Together,' held at the Health Education Bureau Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, she said that according to the Labour Force Survey in Sri Lanka - 2016, it is revealed at 34.4 percent of the country's labour force is women. But at the moment, only female employes of the State sector enjoy 84 working days of full-paid maternity leave. It differs when it comes to the private sector. According to Dr. Rowel, under the Maternity Benefits Ordinance Number 32 of 1939, only State sector female employes are entitled to full-paid 84 working days of maternity leave, another half-paid 84 working days and 84 more working days without pay. They get one hour for feeding if they return to work early. But the current maternity leave for Sri Lankan breastfeeding mothers is not adequate.
Private companies can benefit by providing 'Creche Centres/facilities' for their female breastfeeding employees.
The companies and business ventures can lower their absenteeism rate, health care cost and turnover rates. Companies can expect employees to return to work earlier from maternity leave. It could also provide higher employee productivity and boost morale. Higher employer loyalty can be expected, while the company would gain public recognition as a 'family friendly' company/business, she added.
