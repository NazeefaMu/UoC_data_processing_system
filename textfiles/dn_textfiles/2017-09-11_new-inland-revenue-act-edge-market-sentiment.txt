Point of view
Markets responded positively followed by the new Inland Revenue Act passed on Thursday. GoSL, in line with its regional peers aims to reduce revenue contribution from Indirect taxes to 60% and increase revenues from direct taxation to 40% by 2020.
Notable concessions under new act include: Lowered corporate tax rate for SMEs & Exporters, Tax exemptions for investments in Northern Provinces and raising of tax threshold for employees & senior citizens.
In response to these policy directions ASPI recovered by 14.8 points on Friday, from the 20 week low 6,361.03 recorded on Wednesday.
Market sentiment meanwhile started to pick up as the weekly turnover levels stood at a 7 week high LKR 3.74Bn (15.4% W-o-W).
The turnovers were mainly buoyed by Crossings over the week, which accounted for ~61% of week’s LKR3.74Bn turnover, helping push week’s average daily turnover to LKR 0.94Bn - highest seen since Jun’17.

Crossings over the week were primarily driven by TKYO - accounting for 28% of total market turnover (46% of week’s crossings) and SOY - accounting for 17% of total market (27% of total crossings).
Significant interest in counters i.e. JKH, SPEN and SAMP further helped drive the rebound in turnover.
The week meanwhile ended with a net foreign buying position of LKR 247.65Mn in contrast to last week’s net foreign selling position of LKR 434.02Mn.
LOLC, JKH & TKYO topped week’s foreign purchases list, helping the turnaround in net position while recovering from over 4 month low foreign buying.
Following the sanction of Inland Revenue Bill on Thursday, market has gradually edged up on Friday and we expect this sentiment to prevail over the next week.
GoSL outlines economic vision
In its 2025 Vision statement the GoSL stated that it plans to base growth on a social market economy while seeking to foster innovation and entrepreneurship to facilitate skill-based technological change as a driver of productivity and economic growth.
The GoSL added that it would do so through the provision of an appropriate incentive regime for a private investment led and export-driven growth model to leverage Sri Lanka’s advantages as a trade and services hub.
The vision statement further noted that the economy can no longer depend on a public investment-led and infrastructure-driven growth process and that the high levels of public debt, a rapidly diminishing export share of GDP and an ageing population underscore the need for a transformative reform process.
The reform initiatives will address the policies, the state of markets, the role of Government, and regulatory institutions that determine long-term growth dynamics.
The GoSL further noted that since a strong and stable macroeconomic foundation lays the basis for a broader reform effort, a better mix of fiscal consolidation efforts, coupled with prudent monetary and exchange rate policy reforms will lay the basis for deeper reforms pertaining to trade and investment as well as factor market constraints in land, labour and capital that impede growth.
The vision statement also noted that the GoSL would provide economic security to the less well-off through stronger social safety nets to mitigate their vulnerability to shocks.
