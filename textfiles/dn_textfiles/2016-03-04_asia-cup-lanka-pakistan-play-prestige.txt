Asia Cup: Lanka-Pakistan to play for prestige

 
Despite the disappointing show by Sri Lanka winning only one match out of three and failing to qualify for the Asia Cup final skipper Lasith Malinga is optimistic that his team could give a good performance against Pakistan at Dhaka tomorrow in a match that will have no bearing on the tournament.
With nothing to play for this match which will only be of academic interest both Sri Lanka and Pakistan will play each other for prestige.
Malinga who is not certain whether he could make it into the playing eleven till the eleventh hour said that it could be a different ball game at the T20 World Cup because the pitches are quite different from the one that they have encountered in Bangladesh and that it should help the spinners more.
Malinga added that the pitch in the earlier games of the Asia Cup helped the fast bowlers and no side could go beyond the 120 or 130- run mark as runs were hard to come by. He said that if his side bats first that he will go for a required target and defend it.
Malinga further said that the team was the best available one with youngsters and experienced players. Some questions were raised with regard to the team selections.
"We all know Chamara Kapugedera's capabilities, and the new comers. Dasun Shanaka is a players who has scored two centuries in the domestic T20 tournaments, so if a player of that calibre cannot find a place what's the purpose of playing in a domestic tournament. Likewise , Jeffrey Vandersay is a right- arm leg- spinner and no doubt he is an asset and an investment for the future.
"Niroshan Dickwella is also a player for the future. He could come in as a stop-gap wicket keeper as well. Changing the team constantly will not help the players develop or stabilise themselves," said Malinga.
"When we returned from Australia in 2012 we lost three matches to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. But in 2014 we came here and won the Asia Cup. Just because you lose a couple of matches in a contest that shouldn't affect the talent of the players and one should not give up hope," he said. Malinga said that most of the Sri Lankan players do not have the experience playing in franchise T20 cricket except for a few.
"Most of the players in other countries play 50 to 60 T20 matches whereas the Lankans do not have that luxury. Only myself and another two or three players get the opportunity to play in the IPL.
We have only the domestic T20 and the talented players emerge from there," Malinga said. "Bangladesh coming into the final is a good sign of cricket going forward. Irrespective of the country if someone is playing good cricket that is the need of the hour for the betterment of the game," he said.
