CB Deputy Governor asked to look into unsolicited transactions

Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said he was requested by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to look into the unsolicited transactions that had taken place in road development projects carried out by the previous regime.
Minister Kabir Hashim requested Minister Karunanayake to release money from the Treasury to be paid for an outstanding amount of road development projects started by the previous regime, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
Minister Hashim said many workers were at the risk of losing their jobs, if the government does not pay the outstanding amount. According to Minister Hashim, the initial requirement was about Rs.15 billion, while the total requirement was about Rs. 40 billion, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
