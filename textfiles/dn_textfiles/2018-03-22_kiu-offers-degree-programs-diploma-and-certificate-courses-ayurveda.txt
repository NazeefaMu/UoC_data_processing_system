Dr. Alan Lewis, a lecturer in architecture at Manchester university said “research has shown that visible light helps the human body to regulate the production of the hormone melatonin, which in turn helps to regulate our body clock.
Visible light also helps to stimulate the body’s production of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can reduce the symptoms of depression.”
