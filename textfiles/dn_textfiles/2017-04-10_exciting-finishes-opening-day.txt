Exciting finishes on opening day

The opening day of the Super provincial limited overs cricket tournament produced some nail-biting finishes in both matches played at the CCC and NCC grounds respectively.
At CCC grounds in-form batsman Sadeera Samarawickrama’s fine century (109) for Galle proved insufficient as Kandy chased down their total of 347-7 to win by one wicket with three balls to spare.
At the NCC grounds the contest between Dambulla and Colombo ended in a tie. Lahiru Milantha scored 106 and Hiran Cooray 94 for Dambulla to total 289-6 in 50 overs. Colombo buoyed by a fluent century from skipper Dinesh Chandimal (116 n.o.) and supported by Malindau Hasaranga who scored 84 finished on 289-7 when the overs ran out.
