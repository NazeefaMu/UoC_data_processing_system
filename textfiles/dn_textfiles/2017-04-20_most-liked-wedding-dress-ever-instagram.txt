The most liked  wedding dress  ever on: Instagram

Racking up an incredible 7,500,000 likes, Beyoncé's memorable twin pregnancy announcement earned her the accolade of having the most popular Instagram image ever.
It knocked Kendall Jenner's image of her lying down with her hair made into heart formations off the top spot, which got a respectable 3.7 million likes.
Now there's a new image whipping up a storm of approval and admiration.
While it's not quite in the same league as Beyoncé's and Kendall's offerings, it's still pretty impressive.
When Indonesian bride, Intan Azzahra married Zendhy Zaen, her dress apparently became the "most liked wedding dress on Instagram of all time" according to Allure .
You need a big dress to live up to such a bold claim, but we think Intan's gown lives up to the hype. The dress is long-sleeve ivory and pink with a sweetheart neckline over a sheer bodice decorated with thousands of pearls. The pearls and lustrous beads gather into scallops, continuing down to a ballgown skirt complete with train. The incredible creation was the handiwork of designer Ivan Gunawan and was a big factor in the wedding being liked over 167,000 times.The whole wedding had a definite 'Disney fairytale' feel about it, with the groom looking smart in a Prince Charming diamond-encrusted uniform and pink sash.
That's not where the haute couture ended though. For the reception, Intan changed into a custom Hengki Kawilarang gown in bright crimson, which somehow managed to be even more elaborate than her wedding dress.
