Seven decades of friendship

President Maithripala Sirisena’s State visit to Australia is highly significant for several reasons. It is the first State visit by a Sri Lankan Head of State to Australia in several decades and follows visits by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe back in February this year, former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera (April 2016) and State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene (October 2016).
“President Sirisena's visit will be an opportunity to advance key areas of bilateral cooperation, including education, defense, science and technology, economic development, medical research and the fight against people smuggling,” Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement. The two leaders held bilateral discussions on these and several other issues.
The visit marks the 70th anniversary of Australia-Sri Lanka relations, which began in January 1947, even before Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) gained independence from the British. Both countries share the British colonial legacy and are now members of the British Commonwealth. Sri Lanka’s High Commission in Canberra was opened in 1949 and the country’s first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake visited Australia in 1951, followed by Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala in 1954. Several Australian Prime Ministers including Sir Robert Menzies, Gough Whitlam and Tony Abbott have visited Sri Lanka.
Ties between the two countries have always been excellent, regardless of which party was in power in either country. In fact, even when the rest of the Western world poured scorn on Sri Lanka due to HR issues after the conflict ended in 2009, Australia took a more enlightened and accommodating view whilst expressing its own concerns to the Sri Lankan Government of the day.
The Australia-Sri Lanka bilateral relationship is important in so many ways. Sri Lankans numbering close to 90,000 form the 12th largest expatriate group in Australia. Both Sinhala and Tamil are widely spoken in Australian cities. Sri Lankan Australians have contributed in numerous ways to enhance the Australian socio-economic and cultural fabric. They also regularly visit Sri Lanka and remit funds to family and relatives back home, thus contributing to the Lankan economy as well. Hundreds of Sri Lankan families legally migrate to Australia every year.
Trade has also become a pivotal issue for the two countries. In 2015, trade between the two nations exceeded A$ 950 million. There is potential for a significant increase in Australian trade and investment, which the President has explored during his tour. Tourism is another key sector - Sri Lanka is Australia’s 25th largest tourist destination. Australian tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka have grown by 12.7 per cent over the past five years. The number of tourists to Australia from Sri Lanka has also increased by 10.4 per cent since 2010. The recommencement of SriLankan Airlines’ direct flights to Melbourne from Colombo is likely to boost these numbers and enhance people to people contact.
There is another very strong bond that unites the two countries - cricket. Ever since Sri Lanka emerged victorious over Australia at the Cricket World Cup Final in Lahore, Pakistan in 1996, the cricket rivalry between the two countries has intensified and from Australia’s point of view, second only to its rivalry with England. Let’s hope that the two sides will meet for a scintillating match in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England (Sri Lanka and Australia are in separate preliminary groups).
But there is more. The two nations share the same democratic structures and values as well as the English language. The strong relationship is founded on a shared history of cooperation in areas such as education (dating back to the Colombo Plan of the 1950s), trade and investment, culture and development and links through the Commonwealth.
There was another issue that led to some tension a few years earlier. People smugglers operated a ring that smuggled mostly economic migrants from Sri Lanka and other Asian and African countries to Australia. However, the Australian and Sri Lankan Governments worked closely with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the two Navies to resolve this issue. No Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reached Australia by boat since 2013 but Sri Lankans, Iranians and Afghans are the largest national groups among more than 2,000 asylum seekers who are kept on the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea by Australian authorities.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has assured that the Sri Lankans held in Pacific island camps were free to return home without any fear of persecution. The President’s discussions with Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton focused on this issue.
The two Governments should perhaps study and explore the ‘Korean solution’ to provide a number of opportunities for youth to work legally in Australia with or without the final prospect of legal migration. In the early 1990s when it was found that some Sri Lankan youth were trying to leave for jobs in South Korea illegally, the South Korean Government stepped in and offered a quota of jobs for Lankan youth through a programme that continues to this day. Such a beneficial programme will take the Australia-Sri Lanka relationship to new heights.
