FEATURE: Post-Independence challenges

Fourth of February every year is a special day for all Sri Lankans. Most of us will eagerly take a break from our busy schedules, watch the Independence parade on TV, read few stories about Independence in the newspapers and, maybe, have a chat with the neighbour about the current political scenario. But when all these things have ended, only a few will have reflected upon the true meaning of independence and the role it has played in shaping our nation’s character.
Our first Prime Minister, D.S.Senanayake, who was known as the “Father of the nation,” made it clear in his speech on the first Independence Day that all citizens should work together for the country’s development forgetting ethnic and religious differences.
At that time Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was Britain's model Commonwealth country. After the second world war, it was a good middle-size country with fewer than 10 million people. It had a relatively good standard of education, with 2 universities of high quality, an efficient civil service largely of locals, and experienced politicians in representative government starting with City Council elections in the 1930s.
When Ceylon gained independence in 1948, it was the classic model of gradual evolution to independence and moving up towards prosperity. Alas, it did not work out that way. One of the main reasons was that we did not heed to the advice given by our first Prime Minister and, as a result, we paid a big price for not doing so.
Rights and freedoms
It is easy to take for granted the rights and freedoms we share as Sri Lankans today. However, it is important that we understand and appreciate the hard work and sacrifice that many people – Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and burghers- made in order for us to enjoy our luxury of freedom.
Freedom and independence are cornerstones in the foundation of our country’s heritage. The independent ideology of the Sri Lankan people is a fundamental element of our society and a key to our nation’s prosperity. Therefore, we must protect that independence at all cost.
Protection
How do we protect our Independence? First, we must ensure the growth and stability of racial harmony. Healing the wounds and building a society in which people of diverse backgrounds live as members of one family are the most pressing issues confronting Sri Lanka today. Our peace, our prosperity, and even our standing in the international community depend on the resolution of these issues.
To build a society in which the rights of all its members are respected and guaranteed, all three races must be animated with the spirit of optimism and faith in the eventual realization of their highest aspirations. Everyone must recognize that unity is essential for their common survival. Everyone must recognize that there is only one nation – Sri Lankan nation. Everyone must recognize that a harmoniously functioning society that permits the full expression of the potential of all persons can resolve the social and economic problems now confounding a society wracked with disunity.
Transformation
It is evident that non-Sinhala groups in large numbers are feeling disappointed and frustrated. They seem to perceive that adequate efforts have not been taken to effect cordial inter-racial and inter-religious relationships. To rationalize this failure, they have been reacting by retreating to the more familiar ground of racial and religious separation.
Racism, in particular, runs deep. It infects the total nation and the hearts of all Sri Lankans alike. Since without conscious, deliberate, and sustained effort, no one can remain unaffected by its corrosive influence, all groups must realize that such a problem cannot be easily resolved.
The transformation of a nation ultimately depends on the initiative and change of character of its citizens. Therefore, on this Independence Day let us advance with an unflinching determination to lend effective support to the resolution of the ethnic and religious issues that are hindering the progress of this country.
Reforms
When we talk about. protecting our Independence, another important matter which needed to be considered is political accountability. Fortunately, President Maithripala Sirisena is a firm believer in the Parliamentary system. As a seasoned statesman, he would have understood that the political accountability is the key to the democratic consolidation, which is an essential requisite for the protection of Independence and sovereignty of the country.
This means, we need reforms that will substantially improve the role, the processes and accountability of our Parliament to the extent that it is not only deliberating, but anticipating, and leading. As a representative institution, our Parliament should not only want to have public confidence in its motives and actions, but should want to genuinely deserve that confidence.
Opportunity
Today, we have a unique opportunity of creating a political system and an environment where nearly all citizens can appreciate and participate in government and politics. This can be done only as long as the idea of political efficacy is built into our parliamentary system. During the last 2 years, Sri Lankans have seen some indication of a democratic government and that should serve as a ringing evidence of how people can be motivated to work for their Government.
We cannot expect citizens to get involved in social development if the politicians practice mindless politics rather than act as honourable and capable men and women. If the politicians themselves do not believe in our country’s ineffable capacity for good governance, how do we expect citizens to extend their support to develop the country.
We need to put the right people to work. We need to cultivate a generation of educated workforce. We need to take the towns to the villages. That is the meaning of true independence. It means ‘taking the road less travelled” or sometimes, that “unconventional path” devising different solutions to our problems.
Patriotism
Independence Day is also about patriotism. On this day, let's reflect upon what we have done for our country and what we still 'can' do. And by so doing, we will have delivered on the sacred promise of our nation to all those who gave selflessly of themselves - the ancestral martyrs to whom this day really belongs.
Independence Day is also an occasion to remember those who died under our national flag fighting against the terror. Let’s also reflect on the very genius of our heroes who paved the way for the present generation to continue with peace and dignity. And, if we ever think of honouring them in a more meaningful way, we should commit ourselves to work hard to build our country into a decent place fit for every man, woman or child to live and dream.
Determination
In the midst of all the activities celebrating the Independence Day, we should all pause to remember the true meaning of this most uniquely Sri Lankan event.
We gained independence because of the courage and sacrifice of the men and women from the very first day the colonial powers took our country into their grip. They risked everything to gain for themselves and succeeding generations the blessings of independence. They had no guarantee of success in the centuries that followed and it seemed they were doomed to failure. They did not give up, however, because they would have liberty and, if not, they preferred to die.
That determination to live free or die is why those generations prevailed in their struggle for independence and why Sri Lanka is the land of the free. If we, the beneficiaries of that great sacrifice, are to retain the independence we enjoy today, then we must, first, be eternally vigilant in the protection of our independence and, second, be as willing as our ancestors to give our all in the defence of the sovereignty of the people.
