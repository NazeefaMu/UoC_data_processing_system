Two men putting up ‘Pohottuwa’ nabbed

Two suspects, one a public servant, were arrested by Kuruduwatta police while the suspects were putting up a painting of the “Pohottuwa” symbol of the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Party (SLPP) along the Nawalapitiya-Gampola main road in contravention of the election laws on December 28.
Investigations revealed the public servant, a brother of a leading politician in the area, had fallen out with his politician brother and decided to support the SLPP.
They were produced before the Gampola Magistrate and released on a Rs. 50,000 surety bail each.
