Bradford Doctor takes pioneering kidney stone treatment in Sri Lanka

A Bradford consultant has been using his expertise to introduce a new medical procedure in Sri Lanka's hospitals.
Dr. Harry Bardgett, a consultant radiologist at Bradford Royal Infirmary, learned of the plight of people suffering from kidney problems on the island during a chance meeting with consultant urologist, Graham Watson, who runs his own charity.
The Medi Tech Trust is dedicated to the promotion of urological surgery and donation of medical equipment and surgical goods in the UK and the developing world.
Last June, it donated new equipment to the BRI called an 'Ultra Mini PCNL' (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) - which brings huge benefits as doctors could use much smaller equipment than what was traditionally used to carry out kidney stone surgery in the past.
This innovative technique enables his fellow doctors to glean better pictures of the kidneys, allowing them to shatter and extract stones using an endoscope, instead of the need to revert to open surgery with all its risks to the patient.
PCNL is a minimally-invasive procedure to remove stones from the kidney by inserting a small incision through the skin. It is used to remove stones of more than 2cm in size which are present near the pelvic region. Impressed by what he saw, Watson asked Dr. Bardgett to accompany him to show this new technique to doctors in Sri Lanka, which aids PCNL which is less damaging to patients and helps them recover more quickly, compared with more conventional open surgery which was used in the country.
Dr. Bardgett said: "PCNL ultrasound has huge benefits for surgeons as it helps identify which part of the kidney to puncture into. Doctors can then see the renal stones and glean important information on the structures around the kidney.
"It also makes the procedure easier to perform as with PCNL the patient lies on their back, rather than their front.
"Other vital PCNL benefits for patients include reduced blood loss, less damage to the kidney and a shorter hospital stay - for some, the stay can be as little as 24 hours, as opposed to around four to five days."
