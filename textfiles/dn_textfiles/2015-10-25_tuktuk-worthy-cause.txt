On TukTuk for a worthy cause!

Forty Asia-based European and Asian senior corporate executives reached their final destination in Matara, ending their ride which commenced in Jaffna under the banner ‘Pimp My TukTuk Sri Lanka - 2015.’ This rally was sponsored by David Pieris Motor Company Ltd, the first automotive company to introduce the Bajaj three-wheeler to Sri Lanka.
Participating in a charitable ride to raise US$ 100,000 to set up a reverse osmosis plant for water purification in Anuradhapura and a Boys’ orphanage in Valvaagam in Jaffna, these drivers covered a distance of 1,000 km, riding from Jaffna to Matara, with stopovers at major towns en-route.
In Ratnapura, participants were warmly received by the staff of David Pieris Motor Company Ltd, who served them traditional Sri Lankan Helapa, Pol Roti and Beli-Mal drink, to the accompaniment of music provided by much-loved Sri Lankan Papare band. Upon reaching Matara, they were served refreshing Thambili (King coconut) and traditional short eats such as Kewun, Kokis, Aasmiand Kiribath. A fitting culmination of a long, yet, enjoyable journey.
David Pieris Motor Company, as sponsors, played an immensely supportive role throughout this rally, providing the riders with the skills required to handle the three-wheelers, as well as familiarization with the terrain. In addition, the riders were accompanied by the Bajaj Service three wheeler and crew members, who provided technical and maintenance support to ensure their safety and well-being.
The expatriate drivers were most appreciative of the support extended by David Pieris Motor Company and the Bajaj team. They were also pleased with the cheering and camaraderie shown by the extended Bajaj family of three-wheeler drivers, dealers and spare parts vendors all along the way.
