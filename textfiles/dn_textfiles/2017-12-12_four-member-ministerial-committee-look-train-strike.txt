Four member ministerial committee to look into train strike

 
A four member Cabinet sub-committee was appointed by President Maithipala Siripala to look into the demands of the railway trade union strikers, today.
The committee comprising of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, was appointed to be chaired by Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama.
