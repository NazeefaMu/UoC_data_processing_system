Non-compliance with the order: Ven. Siridhamma Thera apologizes to Malwatte Prelate

Ven. Pitiduwe Siridhamma Thera who called on Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter and members of the Malwatte Chapter Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha at the Malwatte Viharaya, Kandy on October 15, tendered an apology to the Mahanayake Thera and the Karaka Sangha Sabha if he had expressed views or acted in a manner derogatory of the Maha Sangha or the Buddhist laity.
The Thera offered a written undertaking that he would never act in a manner that would cause inconvenience to the Maha Sangha or the Buddhist laity in the future.
Earlier, the Malwatte Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha had informed Ven. Siridhamma Thera in writing that he would be expelled from the Malwatte Chapter in case of non-compliance with the order on his part.
In response to this warning, Ven. Siridhamma Thera informed the Malwatte Prelate that he would be present before the Karaka Sangha Sabha on October 15.
