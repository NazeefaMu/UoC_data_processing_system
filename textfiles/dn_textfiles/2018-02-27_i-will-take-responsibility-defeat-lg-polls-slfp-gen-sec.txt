I will take responsibility of defeat at LG polls: SLFP Gen. Sec.

General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said that he is ready to take the responsibility of the SLFP's defeat at the Local Government Election held recently.
He pointed out that the SLFP election campaing was a collective effort. There were several committees appointed to overlook the SLFP election campaign, Minister Dissanayake said. All those committees overlooking the campaign should share the responsibility of the setback recorded by the SLFP.
Minister Dissanayake said the post of General Secretary of a political party is like a “chopping-block” and said “If I am expected to sacrifice my head at the chopping board, I am more than willing to”.
Minister Dissanayake said that if there is any discussions on his role as the General Secretary of SLFP, those should be aired at the Central Committee meeting. "If someone is discussing such matters outside the Central Committee, that is uncustomary. This is a moment we should get together and motivate out voters,” he said.
Minister Dissanayake, pointing out that he gave up his position, power and security when he walked out from the previous regime, said that he can dedicate anything to secure the mandate of the Yahapalana government elected in 2015.
“The only challenge I have is to fulfill the mandate we pledge in 2015,” he said.
