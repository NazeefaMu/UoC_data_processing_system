Three injured in car-train collision

Two women and a child were injured on Friday (19) at 10.40 pm, when the car they were travelling in collided with a train plying from Aluthgama to Colombo at the level crossing situated at Kuda Waskaduwa, Kalutara, between the No.1 Railway Station and the Kalutara North Station. The Kuda Waskaduwa level crossing lacks a gatekeeper, and hence, is unsafe and prone to accidents.Residents had rushed to the scene and pushed the ill-fated vehicle away from the crossing and rescued the three persons. They were then immediately admitted to the Kalutara Nagoda Hospital for medical treatment. The women and child sustained minor injuries.Residents of Kalutara North and Kuda Waskaduwa appealed to the responsible Ceylon Government Railways (CGR) authorities to look into the situation and make all possible arrangements to employ a responsible gatekeeper for this unsafe level-crossing, immediately.
