Joint Council of Asgiri and Malwathu Chapters decide
Country does not need a new Constitution

The Joint Councils of Asgiri and Malwathu Chapters yesterday, decided that the country does not need a new Constitution or Amendments.
The Council suggests continuing with the existing Constitution. The Council also suggests adopting a new approach for discussions if a necessity arises for a new constitution in the future.
The Council also advices not to abolish the Executive Presidency.
Reasoning out the decision, the Joint Council states that the introduction of a new Constitution may create divisions between the communities.
The decision came after extensive discussions
held between representatives of both Chapters at the Sri Dhalada Maligawa yesterday.
Anu Nayake Thera of the Asgiri Chapter Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said that they are to continue discussions about the matter with the Maha Sangha.
“It is important to develop the country instead of inviting trouble by introducing a new Constitution,” Ven.Dhammananda Thera also said.
Anu Nayake of the Malwathu Chapter Most Ven. Dibulkubure Wimaladhamma Thera while pointing out that the Maha Sangha agreed with the new electoral system, stated that the proposed Constitution
will create problems for the unitary status of the country and national harmony.
