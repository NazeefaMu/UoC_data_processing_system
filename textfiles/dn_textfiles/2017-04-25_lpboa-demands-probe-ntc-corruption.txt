LPBOA demands probe into NTC corruption

The National Transport Commission is a fully corrupted institution which should be probed by a Presidential Commission, the President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijeratne alleged.
At a press conference on Sunday, Wijeratne said they are requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into the corruptions taking place within the NTC.
Referring to the delay in issuing and re-tendering the Highway Route Permits, Wijeratne said despite a court order, the NTC is delaying the process. He also said about 800 have applied for the Permits this year.
“During the previous regime, only five Highway route permits were properly issued in 2011. Now there are about 200 buses running on the Galle-Maharagama Highway with no proper legal permission to do so.
The permits issued in 2011 have to be re-tendered in 2016. It has not been done either by the NTC so far this year,” Wijeratne said.
He pointed out that the government is undergoing a loss of about Rs.700 to1,000 million due to the NTC not issuing new Highway Route Permits.
