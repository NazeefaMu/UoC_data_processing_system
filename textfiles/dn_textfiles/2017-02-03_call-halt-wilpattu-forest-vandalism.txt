Call to halt Wilpattu forest vandalism

The forest destruction of the surroundings of the forest areas of Wilpattu, is still taking place, Convener of the “Parisarika Ekamuthuwa” Ven. Paahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera said.
A slight decrease of the forest destruction rate can be noticed, but it has not been completely halted since the persons engaged in the forest destruction are still carrying it out as usual.
The Thera was addressing the media yesterday in Colombo.
According to the Ven. Sagara Thera around 3,400 acres land extent of the forest reserve has already been cleared and invaded.
The affected area is situated close to the Northern boundary of the Wilpattu reserve.
“The People who are responsible for this forest destruction level allegation against us that they do not clear Wilpattu forest reserve.
It is true but they are continuously clearing the forest areas of the Marijjakattu, Vilachiya and a few other forest areas” the Thera said.
Sajeewa Chamikara of the Parisarika Ekamuthuwa said that the direct intervention of the government is vital to protest the forests and wildlife of the country.
He further said that several money motivated so called environmentalists are trying to dilute this massive forest destruction while leveling baseless allegations.
According to them, there were human habitats in the forest areas, which has been cleared.
“Actually there were colonies or human settlements in these forest areas during the last centuries.
"It is only a move to justify this massive forest destruction,” Chamikara said.
According to him around 700 hectares of the country's forests is subjected to deforestation annually resulting a huge environmental impact.
