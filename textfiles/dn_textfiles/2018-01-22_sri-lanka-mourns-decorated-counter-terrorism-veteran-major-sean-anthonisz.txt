Major Sean Anthonisz, who served as a commanding officer of the army’s Field Engineer Regiment (SLE) passed away on Saturday afternoon. He was 45 years old. An old boy of S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia, Major Anthonisz was one of the army’s most vaunted practitioners and instructors of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and demining during his nearly two decades of service through the bloodiest chapters of the war against terrorism. Major Anthonisz, who led several victorious military operations, had an illustrious service record in the armed forces.
He received his commission as 2nd Lieutenant on May 3, 1993, and served in several leadership and operational roles in the army’s elite Field Engineer regiments, including stints as Troop Commander, Intelligence Officer, Adjutant and Commanding Officer.

His badges of honour include the Deshapuththra Sammanaya, Ceylon Armed Service Long Service Medal, North and East Operation Medal, the Poornabhumi Padakkama, Riviresa Campaign Service Medal, Sri Lanka Army 50th Anniversary medal, and commendations for his service in Humanitarian Operation North and Humanitarian Operation East.
