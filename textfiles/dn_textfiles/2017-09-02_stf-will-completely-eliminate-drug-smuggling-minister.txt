STF will completely eliminate drug smuggling: Minister

Law and Order and Souther Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake yesterday said he had set a challenge to the Special Task Force (STF) to completely eliminate drug smuggling in Sri Lanka.
Minister Ratnayake said drug smuggling negatively complements the spread of underworld activities and terrorism.
Minister Ratnayake said the STF was the chief power countering the issue.
The Minister said a new division was formed headed by Senior DIG M.R. Latheef, combining the Organized Crime Division and Police Narcotic Bureau as a part of the challenge.
He said no party would be able to influence the new division. “It is solely responsible to counter drug abuse and underworld activities,” he said.
Minister Ratnayake was participating in the 33rd commemoration ceremony of the STF War Heroes held at the Katukurunda Training College yesterday.
The Minister said the STF would eliminate the drug issue, just as it contributed exceptionally to the war against terrorism.
