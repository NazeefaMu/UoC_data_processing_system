Lottery sales agents end strike

The lottery sales agents yesterday called off their strike following discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena.
A member of the All Ceylon Lottery Dealers Association (ACLDA) said that the President had promised to look into the grievances of lottery agents.
The lottery agents boycotted sales for several days to protest the government’s decision to increase the price of a lottery ticket by Rs.10. The government had decided to increase the price of lottery from Rs.20 to Rs.30.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had told media earlier that lottery agents’ protests against the government’s decision was unacceptable. The minister said the increase was done with the aim of providing more winning opportunities for the public. Meanwhile, earlier Chairpersons of the National Lotteries Board (NLB) and Development Lotteries Board (DLB) yesterday, urged sweep ticket sellers to carry out their duty promptly.
They noted that if the sellers continuously refrain from selling sweep tickets, new agents will be appointed.
The process of appointing new agents will be completed by next week. It has been planned to end the issue by next week, they said.
NLB Chairman Shamila Perera said that tough action will be taken against sales agents who are engaged in protest campaigns. DLP Chairman Romesh Jayawardena said that dealership of certain agents threatening dealers engaged in sales will be cancelled.
The chairmen said the commission of sales persons had been increased from Rs. 3.50 to Rs. 4 per sweep ticket.
The NLB chairman said sales persons are working on personal agendas and not for the people or clients.
