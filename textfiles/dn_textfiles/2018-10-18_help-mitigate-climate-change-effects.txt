President tells engineers
Help mitigate climate change effects

President Maithripala Sirisena has called on senior engineers and lawyers in the irrigation sector to form a working committee to discuss ways of mitigating the effects of climate change, particularly with routing rivers up streams from the country’s Wet Zones to dryer areas.
“When we know the effects of climate change and the affects it has on our country, why allow places to suffer due to floods, when we can come up with ways to route rivers or streams in a manner that water would reach the Dry Zones of the country,” he queried during the Regional Conference of the Federation of Engineering Institutions of South and Central Asia.
The President commended the efforts made by engineers in the various fields adding that Sri Lanka’s has a proud history of engineers who’ve paved the way for projects that have stood the test of time.
He referred to the chief architects and engineers of the Gal Oya, Eng. J.S Kennedy, Parakrama Samudra Eng. Ismail and most recently Eng. Kulasinghe who mapped out Moragahakanda.
“The country is indebted to these engineers and many more who continue to offer their services. It is my request that they continue to work for the betterment of the country.”
This Conference is organized annually in collaboration with Sri Lanka Engineers Association and Eastern and Central Asian Engineers Federation. This year’s theme is, “Challenges and targets in achieving sustainable development t goals”.
The representatives of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal also participated in the conference which expects to uplift the professional cooperation between the allied countries of the Eastern and Central Asian regions towards establishing a productive mechanism, discussing issues and providing opportunities for Non Governmental Organizations engaged in the field of engineering education and training.
President Sirisena who addressed the inaugural session said that the severe challenges in achieving sustainable development goals are the variations of climatic changes, poverty, challenges faced in building a health safety public, corruption, and fraud.
