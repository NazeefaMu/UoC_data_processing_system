State minister scotches rumours of quitting TPA

Up-Country People’s Front Leader and State Education Minister Velusami Radhakrishnan scotched rumours of him planning to quit the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA).
He said there had also been a rumour of him looking forward to join the Ceylon Workers’ Congress. He was addressing a press conference held last Sunday, at the Avishka Hotel in Kotagala, Hatton.
“Considering delimitation, it is not that we disagree with the ward system,” State Minister Rahakrishnan said, adding that there were flaws in the manner it was implemented.
“Those who spent for the election were defeated and those who did not, were elected,” he said, “If history were to repeat itself this time as well, we would face a grave situation.”
“We deem the previous electoral system to be preferable,” the state minister added.
