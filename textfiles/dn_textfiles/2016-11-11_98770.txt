Kandy out to maintain their supremacy

The Kandy Sports Club was founded in 1874 by a group of expatriate coffee planters and others working in the plantation sector in and around Kandy. In 1888, the club also started playing rugby, hockey and polo. The home ground was Bogambara grounds until 1939 when the British Colonial Army took over during the Second World War. Later the buildings were taken over by the General Hospital to house its offices; however Kandy SC continued to play rugby at the Bogambara grounds without a club house. In 1949 the Municipal Council released the garbage dumping ground area at Nittawela to the club.
From 1997 to 2009 Kandy SC had won all the President’s trophy knockout tournaments with the exception of the 1998 tourney, where it lost 26-30 in the final to CR&FC. They have also dominated the Clifford Cup tournament, winning 17 titles in the last 20 years, which is the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. In the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC had won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
On March 10, 2010 the rugby team of the Kandy SC left for a 15-day tour of Dubai and South Africa. The club played one match in Dubai and two in South Africa. This was the first time Kandy SC toured two different countries on one tour.
Kandy SC who were one time the kings of local rugby lived up to their expectations last season by winning all three major cups (League, Clifford Cup and Seven’s) which were on offer and this season they are working hard towards retaining their position at the top.
They are in search of their past glory and in the upcoming 2016/17 season they will have some of the best players in the country led by that fantastic scrum half ex-Kingswood and Sri Lanka vice-captain in Roshan Weeraratne.
This season they are under the watchful eyes of their head coach, former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka skipper Sean Wijesinghe, ably assisted by former Kandy and Sri Lanka player Nalaka Weerakkody and Saliya Kumara. The manager of the side is former Isipathana, CR and FC and Kandy SC player Kapila Silva.
Kandy SC must be really happy with the squad of players that they have got for this season having a blend of youth and experience that they only have to motivate them and do a bit of fine tuning for the guys to deliver the result. The real concern is that every club in Sri Lanka wants to beat them; no matter it can be even Air Force or CH and FC, because at present they are the reigning champions. Due to this when Kandy is playing a game they are under tremendous pressure, since they are carrying the legacy of the whole Kandy crowd and their expectations are high, so Kandy SC has to somehow deliver the goods by winning all the games for their fans.
There are many new faces turning out for them this season out of which some of the well known national players are centre Danushka Ranjan, third row forwards Jason Dissanayake and prop forward Ganuka Disssanayake who are all out to give a good display of rugby for their new club in the upcoming season.

Roshan Weeraratne (captain), Fazil Marija, Gayan Weeraratne, Kishore Jehan, Gayan Jayawardane, Asitha Ratnayake, Damitha Dissanayake, Lavanga Perera, Oshan Perera, Dansha Dayan, Anuruddha Wilwara, Pumal Manchanayake, Uchitha Jayasooriya, Lasitha Maduranga, Thilina Wijesinghe, Tharindu Chanaka, Richard Dharmapala, Heshan Kalhara, Gayan Ratnayake, Arshad Jamaldeen, Yakoob Ali, Nigel Ratwatte, Buwanaka Udangamuwa, Dimithri Wijetunga, Chanaka Bandara, Shehan ‘Lema’ Pathirana, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Soyuru Anthony, Danushka Ranjan, Jason Dissanayake , Ganuka Disssanayake, Raveen de Silva, and Fazrul Rahuman.
