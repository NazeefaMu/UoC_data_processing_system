Bandula on Economic  Management

Foreign investers have removed nearly Rs.10.000 million within a week from the stock market. This shows how the level of trust the investors have in our country, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) President Prof. G.L. Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition Economic unit in Borella, MP Bandula Gunawardena added that in 2019, there will definitely be a great economic collapse, which would be too much for Sri Lanka to endure.
“But we are too late to prevent it from happening,” he said.
Gunawardena said that the main problem facing Sri Lanka, is that its outflow of foreign exchange is far greater than its inflows which is mainly due to the government’s wrong economic management.
“If the government is to resolve this crisis, then they must first stop the lies being spread that this crisis is the result of the Rajapaksa regime debts,” Gunawardena said.
Parliamentarian Sisira Jayakodi also participated.
