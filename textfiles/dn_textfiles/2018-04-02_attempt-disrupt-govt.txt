Attempt to disrupt Govt.

The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) mooted by the Joint Opposition(JO), is a clear attempt to dismantle and disrupt the Unity Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, State Minister for Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera said.
Elaborating further, he said that the move was an attempt to defeat the Unity Government which would eventually put an end to the government’s efforts at keeping the Yahapalana promises, including the setting up of the Anti-Corruption High Court, which is to be moved in the House on April 5, a day following the vote on the NCM.
“The JO fears the government’s indefinable move to set up an Anti-Corruption High Court that would fast-track and hear corruption cases on a day-to-day basis”, State Minister Perera said.
Speaking at Sirikotha yesterday, he added that the motion would be moved on April 5.
“But this is nothing but a dream since all the constituent parties of the government are united than ever-before at a crucial and challenging juncture,” State Minister Perera said. “Like family, the members of the government will unite in facing and defeating this No-Confidence Motion against the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena,” he said.
“Due to this reason, no Minister in the government could be expected to support the No-Confidence Motion as it is not logical,” he said.
He however added that there are a few stalwarts of the likes of S.B. Dissanayake and Susil Premajayantha who are using this NCM as a means to join the JO, with the General Election in mind.
“They are sure that they cannot contest from the UNP, SLFP or the UPFA for fear of their nefarious activities being exposed in this Yahapalana Government.”
State Minister Perera said that Minister S. B. Dissanyake had taken measures to suspend the Elders’ Allowance and the Samurdhi Allowance two months prior to the election. It had an adverse impact on the Unity Government,” he said.
“He had done it with a malicious intention to defame the government, alleged State Minister Perera.”
He also said that their decision is a win-win situation for those who leave the government and those who remain.

President removed subjects and institutions on PM’s request
Subjects and institutions which came within the ambit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, were removed by President Maithripala Sirisena at the PM’s request, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He made this observation during a press conference held at the UNP Party headquarters Sirikotha in response to a query made on the assumption of a friction between the Premier and the President, since the latter removed some of those institutions which came under the purview of the PM.
He pointed out that it was a part of the Government’s plan to forge ahead led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
He added that everyone could see the reforms that are to be made within the government and the UNP well ahead of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year.
The State Minister also said that the UNP has decided to meet the UNP Working Committee on April 5, 6 and 7, adding that, there will be many considerable changes within the UNP.
