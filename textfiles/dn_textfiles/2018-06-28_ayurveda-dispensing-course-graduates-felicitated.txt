Ayurveda Dispensing Course graduates felicitated

A group of 39 selected assistants attached to Ayurveda drugstores and institutions affiliated to the Ayurveda Department, who had successfully completed a three-month Ayurveda Dispensing Course, were awarded certificates at a function held at the Galle-Labuduwa Dhashina Paya Provincial Ministerial Complex, under the patronage of Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, recently.
The course was jointly sponsored and organised by the Southern Province Ayurveda Department, Southern Provincial Wackwella Management and Training Institute and the National Institute of Traditional Medicine.
The course is designed for professional advancement and skill-development of minor category employees of Ayurveda drugstores and institutions. Upon completion of the course, qualified employees would be designated Grade 111 Ayurveda Dispensing Chemists and would be appointed to government and government-affiliated Ayurveda institutions of the province in future. Southern Province Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry Secretary Saman Dharshana Pandikorale, Southern Province Deputy Chief Secretary (Personnel and Training) Gamini Weerawickrama, Southern Province Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. C.
