KOICA supports beauty culture industry in Anuradhapura

The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) provided a new practice room for beauty culture and hairdressing to the Anuradhapura National Youth Services Council (NYSC) on March 19.
The project was carried out by Korean volunteer Dakyung Kim. Renovating the practice room and equipping the shampooing chair, mirror, study desks, chairs and etc. were carried out at a cost of Rs. 3.4 million with the support of NYSC Anuradhapura.
The Anuradhapura NYSC was established in 1980. It provides Sri Lankan youth with mainly five courses; vocational training, language, traditional dance and music, hotel management and pre-school education. KOICA provides Korean volunteers to the Anuradhapura NYSC and supports to improve the education environment for Sri Lankan youth.
The beauty culture project is expected to nurture more Sri Lankan youths as beauty specialists by providing a high quality beauty culture education environment up to NVQ level 5 in the future.
About 100 people attended the ceremony, including KOICA Sri Lanka office Deputy Country Director Gyong Shik Chon, NYSC Director Training Sunil Karunarathna and other guests.
Chon congratulating the implementation of the project, said the Sri Lankan government has interest in empowering Sri Lankan youths. He hoped that KOICA’s activities would support the Sri Lankan people by providing voluntary services in many areas.
Karunarathna expressed intention for further cooperation between KOICA and NYSC, which has 52 branches throughout the island.
