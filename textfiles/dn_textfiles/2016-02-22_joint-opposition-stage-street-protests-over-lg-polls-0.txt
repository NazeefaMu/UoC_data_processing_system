Joint Opposition to stage street protests over LG polls

Unhappy over the situation hanging over holding of Local Government elections, yet to be announced by the President, the members of the Joint Opposition yesterday insisted that the Local poll be held soon or they will take to streets urging the government to hold the election on time.
Rebutting statements by the government’s main ally, the United National Party (UNP) alluding that the election is being held up pending ongoing work on the demarcation of electoral boundaries in local government wards, the Joint Opposition members said the members of Commission working on the delimitation process had said they can complete the task of demarcation within three months - that was when they undertook it several months back.
Joint Opposition member Prasanna Ranatunga told the Daily News that there is still time to announce upcoming local poll.
Meanwhile. The Joint Opposition planning to form a new political party, had yet to decide who will lead their campaign in the poll, as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not yet accepted their offer of taking the leadership of the party.
The next in line for the post is Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena. Ranatunga said they expect the government to hold the upcoming election as they have promised earlier. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said that the local poll would be held before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Cabinet spokesman Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna had announced that the election would be held in June.
Asked if their group is planning to hit the streets to pressure the government to hold the poll, Ranatunga said, “We have not reached a decision with respect to taking any such action yet.” “Our member Dullas Alahapperuma is looking into it,” he said.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition member and Mahajana Eksatha Peramuna Leader Dinesh Gunawardena had reportedly said at a public meeting in Kotigahawatta on Saturday that they will hold public proteststs if the government did not hold the local government poll before March 31.
