Navy brings sick fiserhman to shore

The Fast Attack Craft P439 attached to the Eastern Naval Command brought a fisherman who took ill aboard a multi-day fishing trawler, to the shore for immediate treatment, on Monday.
On receipt of information from the Trincomalee Fisheries Inspector, the Navy dispatched the fast attack craft to retrieve the patient who was vomiting blood. He had left the Cod Bay fisheries harbour on July 4 aboard Roshan Putha I, a multi day fishing trawler.
The patient was transferred to the fast attack craft about 90 nautical miles off Foul Point, Trincomalee. After taking the fisherman to the Naval Dockyard, he was rushed to the General Hospital of Trincomalee, a spokesman for the Navy said.
