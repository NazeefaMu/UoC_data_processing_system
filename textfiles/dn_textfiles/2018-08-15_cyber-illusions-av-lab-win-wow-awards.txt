Cyber Illusions, AV Lab win WOW Awards

Live experience designer and consultant Cyber Illusions, supported by local audiovisual pioneer AV Lab, won big at WOW Awards Asia, bringing home multiple awards that was held recently at New Delhi Aerocity.
The recognized work was conceived and executed by the VAEG (Visual Art and Experiences Group) Collective, a creative partnership between Cyber Illusions and AV Lab.
The Collective was awarded a coveted Silver for “Achievement in Audio Visual Film” for its “Time Machine - Lion Re-Launch” submission, in addition to a hard-won Bronze for “Achievement in Projection Mapping” for its “Graduation Ceremony of MTC Oman” entry. These impressive wins were achieved within an extremely competitive talent pool where thousands of well-crafted, creative and innovative entries, from over 25 countries, battled it out for top honors.
Winning Silver for the Collective was its “Time Machine” for the re-launch of Lion Breweries, an event produced by Ant’s Works (Pvt) Ltd, which featured a live feat of techno-magic that was conceptualized to trick the senses. Comprising a seamless, immersive LED display where panels were placed 270 degrees around the venue to almost fully wrap-around the audience, the work featured content with high level of animation to give it a hyper realistic motion experience.
The Collective won its Bronze for delivering the largest projection-mapping live experience in Oman for that country’s Military Technical College. Featuring a set up that spanned over 620 feet, across two buildings; the installation was part of a ceremony marking the graduation of the college’s first batch of recruits.
Handpicked by Oman’s leading event solutions provider, GT Stage Tech, for this remarkable undertaking, VAEG was chosen due to its exciting portfolio of successful projects carried out across Asia and the Middle East, which showed it was abundantly qualified to deliver a project of this unique scale and complexity.
Lalindra Amarasekara, a 10-year veteran of the Creative and Audio Visual Industry, and Managing Director of Cyber Illusions said, “We at VAEG are particularly pleased to be recognized at this year’s WOW Awards Asia, which is widely regarded as the most holistic platform in the world showcasing almost every aspect of the event business.”
A merging of technology and art, delivering unparalleled live experiences, VAEG (Visual Art and Experiences Group) is a Collective that has taken Sri Lanka’s design aesthetic and inventiveness to the world in a big way.
