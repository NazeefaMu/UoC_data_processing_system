Ali Kathava: Beautiful, meaningful and creative

Having seen Professor Sunil Ariyaratne’s latest cine creation, Ali Kathava (An Elephant Tale), I felt that it was a fairytale which suits the modern day conscience.
Though in many ways it rests upon the term once upon a time realm, it may refer to any counts at any time. Children, adults, kings, queens, hunters and hermits play a vital part in this story which culminates in the inculcation of a conscience for the time. The king and the queen have no heir to their kingdom even following a lapse of five years. They lament over that, despite the ceremonial activities swinging on.
It so happened that in the process of the grand ceremony, the peaceful living conditions of the elephant family in the nearby jungle by the side of a river is disturbed. The outcome is a fascinating event. An expectant she-elephant finds a newborn, keeps it on her back and retreats into the jungle. The vision of innocence as against the turmoil of humans is sensitively captured.
This is one of the most sensitive visuals that had ever been picturised in Sinhala cinema. There lives a hermit in the village who foresees the well-being as well as the calamities in the vicinity. He accepts the newborn child in the basket to bring up, naming him as Bhanu.
Hunter hunted
The she-elephant gives birth later to a baby elephant named as Raju. The cine spectator sees two sides of the wildlife: elephant and human cultures. Ariyaratne has written the screenplay carefully in order to bring about an affinity for the two creatures, amalgamating them as one entity. But at the same time, he had been extra careful to pinpoint salient behaviour patterns among hunters who live in the same jungle. After the queen was enticed by Bhanu, there appeared a move to capture him.
As a result, the whole jungle life is depicted as disturbed. Bhanu who had developed a firm intimacy with Raju at a particular moment falls apart. As a result, the hunter family lays a net, enslaves him and take him to the palace. A sensitive series of scenes ensues from here onwards. I noticed several layers of visual meanings in the process.
The royal family that include king the queen and the advisors (who are almost clowns), the elephant clan and the hunters who laid the net trap to catch Bhanu as well as the entire environment is shown as disturbed. The meditative hermit tries to visualise what had taken place.
The hermit is symbolic of the mindfulness which I felt is a sensitive portrayal well maintained by actor none other than Ravindra Randeniya.
Though the movie is titled as Ali Katha, meant mainly for children, I felt that it could well reach a wider audience of all ages and all types of audience in the global context. The film is a total creation though rests on a well-made narrative that resembles a fairytale where the original creator is credited as Laticia Botheju. The screenplay presumably is a reconstruction of the original work giving vent to more creative layers which rest on symbolism and realism. Perhaps this is the best director function of a local filmmaker that would be commended by the critics.
The man’s effort to protect the nature is sensitively hinted when Bhanu is trapped by the hunters. What happens ultimately is not a question raised. Bhanu, symbolic of the protector, makes the entire progeny of adult that the life should be blessed by nature and not by the rigid rule or rough governance. Similarly, the love of lie rests not on those who love the life as it is despite perhaps temporary upheavals. The message of naturalism and spiritualism lies like a thread of the whole work.
Animal affinity
I feel that this is the type of visual work that should be promoted by teachers to their students at all levels of education in order to make a better world for living beings. The creative commotion via visuals is at its best in the visual exercise. The creators of the film at home as well as abroad (Thailand) have taken pains to bring about a lasting human-animal affinity, a need of the hour. There is hardly a scene of dullness or bore. The songs, inclusive of a lullaby, are in the most pleasing and sensitive manner possible.
The reel work as an entity could be summed up as a work of virtue, both distancing as well as bringing close and interoperations of human behaviour.
As Rudolf Arnheim has shown carefully in his pioneer work Film as Art, a film resembles a painting, music, literature and the dance will, in turn, may embrace most of these areas.
Professor Ariyaratne’s Ali Kathawa attempts to embrace all these areas appropriately with the intention of rewarding the audience with delight and wisdom, reaching a high point in maternal love and eradication of cruelty to all that encircle the natural habitats. To achieve the goal, it is observed that all players inclusive of the baby elephant are well trained creatively insight with a vision.
One of the most ecstatic episodes in the film revolves round the two child character portrayals of Bhanu and Sumangali who join hands to enhance the humane high point in the cine work. Bhanu who is brought to the palace as trapped by the hunter family in the forest meets Sumangali in the royal physician's cubicle. Although in the first instance they happened to be strangers, gradually they feel that they are like-minded. As such, Sumangali too leaves the palace to join hands with Bhanu. I sincerely feel that these two child actors bring about new vistas in their skills hitherto unseen in any other cine work.
