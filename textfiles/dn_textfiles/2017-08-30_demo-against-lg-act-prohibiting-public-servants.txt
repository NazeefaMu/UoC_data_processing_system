Demo against LG Act prohibiting public servants

The Government had brought in an amendment to the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Act, prohibiting public servants from contesting in local government elections, All-Island Samurdhi-Development and Agricultural Research Production Assistants Officers Society Secretary S. A. D. Jagath Kumara said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said that over 1,000 of these officers across the country were due to contest as candidates under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming Local Government elections.
We will stage a peaceful demonstration and a token strike on August 31 in front of Sethsiripaya, urging the Government to solve several problems related to pension of Samurdhi officers, confirmation in appointment of new officers and stopping Samurdhi curtailment,” he said.
