JO to stand against government as United People’s Front

The Joint Opposition (JO) in Parliament, would function as the United People’s Front in future, Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the JO at the N. M. Perera Memorial Centre in Borella, yesterday, he said all political parties belonging to the Joint Opposition had unanimously decided to stand against the government under United People’s Front banner.
He said the United People’s Front was formed with an objective of brining all parties who stood against the despotic rule of the government, under one banner. He added that the JO had decided to be independent in Parliament as the second-largest parliamentary group.
