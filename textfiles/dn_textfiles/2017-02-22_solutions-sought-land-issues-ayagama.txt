Solutions sought for land issues in Ayagama

Short and long term solutions should be found to the problems encountered by the people in Ayagama and surrounding areas reeling under the influence of a long spell of drought, said G.M. Jayasundara.
He was representing Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara at a meeting of the Ayagama Regional Co-ordinating Committee held at the Ayagama Divisional Secretariat on February 20. Kalawana UNP Chief Organiser Sarathchandra Ramanayake presided.
UNP Parliamentarian A.A. Wijetunge said limitations could be imposed on a land which is a private property under a court ruling. MOH Dr. Namal Kasthuriarachchi pointed out that the river water had been polluted because shop keepers had diverted their waste into the river. Jayasundara said a worse problem may occur in future unless steps were taken to preserve catchment areas of rivers and streams. Assistant Director (Planning) M.L.S. Medawala said a majority of proposals for development of rural infrastructure had been submitted in relation to schools and temples. Such proposals may have to be dropped because funding was not provided for such development from ministries. MOH Kasthuriarachchi said the biggest problem in Ayagama was the lack of a proper waste management system. Since the Pradeshiya Sabha could not handle it single handed a proper plan should be discussed in collaboration with Estate managements and other institutions. He said it would be most advisable to invite representatives of the management of estates to attend the coordinating meeting in future. He also said complaints were being received daily about man made fires in forest land in the area.
Kalawana Forest Range Officer R.M.L. Ratnaweera said a large number of wetlands in the area were being brought under tea cultivation. Wetlands should be kept untouched without bringing them under any cultivation. He said land problems could be avoided if the LRC surveyed the land prior to land alienation. He said boundaries of forest land should be properly marked to overcome unnecessary land problems.
