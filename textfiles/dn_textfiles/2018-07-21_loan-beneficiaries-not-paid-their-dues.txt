Loan beneficiaries not paid their dues

Several low-income householders, who received credit facilities from the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) in 2017, have ignored the payment of their monthly housing loan premiums.
The NHDA has to receive Rs. 2.8 million as arrears of loans obtained by those who have already built their houses with the financial aid provided by the NHDA, Kurunegala District Office. Accordingly, 3,278 householders of 30 Divisional Secretary divisions in the Kurunegla District have thus failed to pay back their loan installments, said NHDA Kurunegala District Manager N. K. B. S. Narasinghe.
He said mobile meetings would be held at village level by NHDA field officers to educate and encourage them to pay back their dues soon.
