Leopard love

Noel first realised his love of leopards when he was on a school trip to Wilpattu National Park where he only caught a glimpse of one. But that was enough to light a great flame in him that burns brighter than ever today. It is still in Wilpattu that it burns brightest as this is the largest and wildest of the parks offering “more space and freedom for the leopards”, as he puts it, and is therefore his favourite, and, combined with Yala, constitutes 880 square miles of totally protected wilderness.
From that time onwards, he began to feel increasing affinity for the leopard and why wouldn’t he? They are truly amazing animals and probably the most majestic of beasts. He has now followed them for so long that he genuinely feels like a leopard – with the way of the world now, he could probably apply for genus realignment. Well, in the West anyway – or is that order realignment? Regardless, he is the Diane Fosse, or better still for a happy ending, the Mowgli of Sri Lanka, walking barefoot from a young age with a few Bagheeras and finally meeting a like-minded human, Cecile, who keeps him connected with his kind, while also sharing his connection with the feline kind, and who stops him from going completely wild.
Cecile explains her love of the wild “My first encounter with a leopard was seeing a huge male killing a crocodile,” – you can see the odd mugger crocodile occasionally with its mouth wide open but don’t be too concerned as it is not vainly waiting for something to fall into it, only using it to regulate its body temperature; it is however a similarly accomplished killer. Cecile goes on, “My second experience was of a female leopard being chased by an elephant. From then, I have been hooked; Noel and I spend every free minute in the jungle together researching and learning more about them. Those incredibly exciting moments made me quickly realise that I share the same level of passion about leopards as Noel. “This is just as well as the life of a leopard aficionado is otherwise a lonely and difficult one although they are fascinating creatures. A great deal of time and effort is required to truly satisfy the passion and the drive to ensure the survival of this king of the bush. Incidentally, as far as passion is concerned, “the leopard can mate up to 10 times an hour or 50 times a day,” says Noel with a twinkle in his eye. Noel and Cecile have been together for eight years now and are as similarly dogged, or should one say catted, in their pursuit of leopard conservation.
Noel set up his highly successful Noel Rodrigo Leopard Safaris during the thirty year Civil War in Sri Lanka in very dangerous circumstances and was never far from a potential confrontation with the Tamil Tigers in Yala but as he says, “My character is such that I do what most people say can’t be achieved. I want to be like a leopard and he always has to take calculated risks. I never had armed guards.” Also, his choice of animal to follow is much dreaded, saying, “People here fear the leopard; rural people believe that he’s a vicious man eater.” The few killings that have occurred in the hill country and the infamous man-eater of Punami and Panama of 70 years ago have not helped this reputation, but man-eaters are few and far between, and most likely to have been treated very badly by humans before they have turned on them. In truth, though, the leopard is critical to the ecosystem and it has been proven that where a natural apex predator has been wiped out, the ecosystem collapses as there follows a population explosion in the prey animals, which then strip the surrounding area of food, both because their numbers are uncontrolled and because they no longer have anything to fear, which means they no longer lightly graze an area before moving on to keep ahead of the feared predator.
Every trip with Noel is amazing, always starting just before sunrise, the travellers unzip their luxury tents with solar power and four-poster beds that are hard to get out of at 4am, and have their showers beneath a crystal clear night sky lit up with vibrant stars and the full moon. They then head off on another spectacular adventure of leopard ‘hide and seek’, holding on for dear life with one hand on the jeep rail, as the roads are hellishly bumpy, with the other hand on sketchpads to draw the voodoo of the location and maybe a leopard if they are lucky. The binoculars swinging above them are vital to get a closer look at the hundreds of incredible exotic birds, later in the morning while eating breakfast at one of Yala’s many waterholes. As the track twists and turns in search of ghosts of the jungle, cameras are precariously balanced, held at the ready to capture the National Geographic moments – they will almost certainly not be disappointed as Noel has an encyclopaedic knowledge of leopards and the parks, making every trip an adventure. Rodrigo brings to every safari an inexplicable wow factor with his charismatic leopard-like looks and passion and years of understanding how wildlife think and act. A man that is always some way away from the five-hundred-jeep entourage of a million ordinary photo shots of the more obvious parts of Yala, he instead heads off to remote areas where the roads are muddy and hardly used, where you won’t see another vehicle for hours and can sit in isolation, listening to the wildlife chitter chatter and wait for that exhilarating alarm call that harkens of a leopard on the prowl.
Suddenly, the peace is shattered by the harsh alarm calls of the elders of the toque troop of monkeys just above the jeep, who swing as fast as they can to safety. One naughty ‘teenage’ monkey carries on playing in the trees, ignoring its mother’s pleas to flee, and even though we can’t see anything, the animals have picked up the whiff of a leopard, from the prevailing winds. There’s a loud scream and then silence in a moment that is so swift that even on video, played over and over again, it is hard to comprehend just how fast a leopard can move in for a kill; in a heart thumping moment, a massive male, after racing across the plains at nearly sixty kilometres per hour, scrabbles up an acacia tree and grabs the terrified teenage monkey by the throat, not unlike a cobra strike. The screams that came from its family troop, now across the valley, ring out desperately, distraught at their loss, leaving everyone deeply moved - cries that are even more deafening than the warnings. A cool reminder to all observers that jungle justice is summarily executed on the unwitting and, as the leopard drags the limp monkey’s body further up the tree to devour it in peace, who really is the king of the jungle.
