Netiquette means networking etiquette

Courtesy and politeness should apply to all aspects of life. Email is now an inextricable part of life. When it comes to your business email activities, underestimating or disregarding courtesy and politeness which lends to a perceived level of professionalism will be at your own peril.
Netiquette, short for ‘network etiquette’ or ‘internet etiquette,’ is a set of social conventions that facilitate interaction over networks, ranging from Usenet and mailing lists to blogs and forums. It means respecting other users’ views and displaying common courtesy especially when posting your views to online discussion groups.
A very real impact
Etiquette in technology is the conduct that is socially acceptable in an online or digital situation. While etiquette is ingrained into culture, etiquette in technology is a fairly recent concept. Although certain rules have been established for correct etiquette while using technology, many users believe that current users are not as well-mannered in etiquette for digital devices, such as the computer or a cell phone.
Social networking provides companies with a user-friendly, fast and far-reaching way to connect with employees and clients. But as with face-to-face meetings, there are certain rules of etiquette that must be followed to achieve the desired outcome.
The Internet is a big, limitless place where the rules of everyday life don’t always apply. You can be whoever you want to be and say whatever you want to say, right? Well actually, no! You can’t or at least, you shouldn’t. Especially if your online presence is connected to your professional image. The fact of the matter is, just as there is proper etiquette in the ‘real’ world, there’s a right way and a wrong way to behave in the online world, too. In fact, how you choose to communicate can have a very real impact on your relationships with employees, customers, and partners. For some reason, many people seem to think that using social media gives them a pass to leave manners and etiquette behind. They don’t realise that social media can actually be a critical vehicle by which to engage customers and inspire employees.
When you communicate electronically, all you see is a computer screen. You don't have the opportunity to use facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice to communicate your meaning; words, lonely written words, are all you've got. And that goes for your correspondent as well. You must put as much thought into online communications as you do other forms of communication to make sure your messages are received in the manner you intended.
It's much easier when you're communicating with someone in person, because you can use gestures and vocal inflections to reinforce your message. More important, you can gauge your listener's body language and facial expressions and almost instantaneously clarify misunderstandings by changing a few words.
Replying to e-mails
When you are holding a conversation online, whether it is an e-mail exchange or a response to a discussion group posting it is easy to misinterpret your correspondent's meaning. And it's frighteningly easy to forget that your correspondent is a person with feelings more or less like your own.
It is ironic, really. Computer networks bring people together who would otherwise never meet. But the impersonality of the medium changes that meeting to something less, well let’s say less personal. Humans exchanging e-mail often behave the way some road hogs behind the wheel of a car do: They curse at other drivers, make obscene gestures, and generally behave like savages. Most of them would never act that way at work or at home. But the interposition of the machine seems to make it acceptable.
Whether using email for business or personal reasons, it pays to be polite. When it comes to your career, one misinterpreted email could result in limited job opportunities, or lost business. When it comes to family and friends, a hasty or inappropriate response can cost you a relationship. Fortunately, courteous e-mail protocols aren't difficult to learn and remember. Sometimes, all it takes is a dose of common sense.
Be timely when replying to e-mails. Typical turn-around time is 24 hours or less, unless the recipient asked you to reply earlier. Check your e-mail at least twice a day to ensure that you receive any new, and possibly urgent, messages that need a quick response. Not replying to e-mails in a timely manner can delay the recipient in taking needed actions.
The message of Netiquette
Be concise in your e-mails, unless a longer response is needed. Whether for business or personal use, most people don't have or want to spend time wading through extraneous information. Only put what is necessary to communicate your message clearly and omit needless words and details. Always address the e-mail recipient by proper title, in the proper order. For instance, if an e-mail needs to go to the CEO, vice president and your supervisor, list them in that order. Don't list those with lower rank before those with higher, this can be seen as an insult to superiors. In addition, don't needlessly ‘cc’ or ‘carbon copy,’ people on e-mails they don't need to read. Although it's often easier to hit the ‘reply all’ button than to take out specific addresses, clogging up recipient inboxes is sure to be noticed, and certainly not appreciated.
Always keep your emotions in check when writing e-mails. If you are feeling angry or annoyed, don't send a reply right away as your feelings will show in the e-mail. But do make sure you reply within 24 hours. Take steps to calm down, such as having a cup of tea or going for a walk, before crafting a measured response. Once you have sent harsh words through an e-mail, not only are they impossible to take back, but an electronic record of them will exist.Unless you are sending a personal e-mail, use standard font types such as Arial, for example, or Times New Roman and sizes 10 or 12 point. Don't use fancy script fonts or different colours. Just stick to black. Other styles and colours are sometimes difficult to read.
The message of Netiquette is that boorish behaviour is not acceptable. Yes, use your network connections to express yourself freely, explore strange new worlds, and boldly go where you've never gone before. But remember the prime directive of Netiquette: Those are real people out there.
