PM will emerge victorious on January 5 - Keheliya

The UNP clique led by Ranil Wickremesinghe took domestic political divisions by taking the international factor into consideration during the last three years. A people’s Government was required to save the country from that quagmire and transform it in accordance with indigenous norms, former state Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.
Addressing a press conference held at his Kandy Aniwatta residence, Rambukwella said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will certainly form a new Government on January 6.
He said when Ranil Wickremesinghe lost his post as Prime Minister, his group sought the help of the international community by holdings meetings with Diplomats and other international representatives.
“When the public was overjoyed by the change of Government, the international world wept over the fall of their puppets. This was quite natural,” Rambukwella said.
Rambukwella said that at last the people could realise the expectations they entertained for the last three and a half years and it would be further augmented on January 5.
“The Joint Opposition had carried out a straggle to achieve this end for the past several years and they had now established the strongest political party in the country within a period of only 10 months,” he added.
He said the President has taken an important decision to cry halt to the country’s march towards disaster and he hoped the people would take this opportunity to profit from it.
