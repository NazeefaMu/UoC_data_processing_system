Lanka must go for more promotions to woo Japanese investors

Sri Lanka must go for more promotions to woo Japanese investors Sri Lanka must do more business promotions in Japan to woo Japanese investors, said Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma.
Speaking at the National Chamber of Commerce (NCCSL) organised event he said that though some have heard about Sri Lanka and they still think Sri Lanka is a part of India.
The Ambassador said that Japanese investors specially in the SME sector was keen to invest outside Japan.”If they are told about the huge potential of Sri Lanka they would be ready to invest,”he said. Suganuma said that the Japanese people have more assets and ‘money’ than the Japanese government. “Japan also has a growing older generation and and they also have colossal sums of money. This elder segment likes to travel and stay in high end hotels. The Sri Lanka travel sectors must try to attract them to Sri Lanka,”he said.
The ambassador said the Japanese business faces more challenges today due
to the cost factor. “Most of the Japanese products are reproduced by Chinese at a lower cost and this is driving our competitiveness. So Japanese have to make products that can not be easily duplicated”.
He said that the Sri Lankan government should also spell out long term investment policies that won’t change regularly. (SS)
