Solar power generation will help  reduce country’s colossal debts: Ravi

 Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that converting current expensive power sources into new energy sources through conserving environment is a turning point of the ongoing rapid development agenda. He said that introducing solar power will help the government to manage its cost factor, specially in repaying the existing colossal debts. He said the Finance Ministry expects to cut its monthly electricity bill by Rs.200,000.
The minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the national project to convert all state sector buildings into solar power generating centers within two years was officially held with the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Ministry of Finance on January 9. The project was launched following a proposal by Budget 2017. The project will be implemented under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena’s “Beginning of 3rd Year of a Sustainable Era”, and the Prime Minister’s concept to build a powerful Sri Lanka under his “Economic Policy Statement”. The first solar power generating scheme under this project was fixed on the Finance Ministry building. The project was commenced by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
“A huge amount of debt had borrowed haphazardly when we took over the government on January 8, 2015. We found as a government two methods to come out from this colossal debt trap. One is to leave them as they were and continue our activities. The second remedy is to go ahead by minimising public costs, managing the economy and look for new sources of revenue.
"We have been implementing the best remedial measures. The national project that we inaugurated today will protect environment on one hand and, on the other hand, it will convert the current expensive energy sources into cheap solar system thereby cutting the state sector energy costs. Therefore, we believe that all will extend their support to make this venture a success. Our aim is to set up solar panels on all state buildings by 2019 to enable them to meet their electricity demand by solar power,” the Minister said.
State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the previous regime which foresaw two imminent crises called snap elections two years ahead of its mandate. One crisis was the international allegations against the previous regime. The second was the looming economic challenges. Under the rule of the current good governance, democracy was already established in the country and minimised international influences as well. However, the economic crisis is still prevailing. Today, a special milestone was achieved in the journey towards the economic goals, the State Minister said.
