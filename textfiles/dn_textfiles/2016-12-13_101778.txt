‘Poseidon’: Advanced U.S. Maritime Patrol Aircraft in Sri Lanka

 
The P-8A Poseidon aircraft arrived in Colombo on December 4, where its sailors met with Sri Lanka military personnel to demonstrate the capabilities of the P-8A and exchange expert advice.
The bilateral exercise is aimed at enabling the Sri Lanka Air Force and Navy to safeguard the international shipping lanes that are vital to global commerce.
“This bilateral partnership with Sri Lanka security forces reinforces the global maritime rules that produces greater prosperity for all of us,” U.S. Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Robert Hilton said.
The P-8A is a multi-mission aircraft that provides long-range maritime patrol capabilities, making it the most advanced ocean surveillance aircraft in the world.
The ‘Red Lancers’ of Patrol Squadron TEN (VP-10) are stationed in Jacksonville, Fla. and are currently on a routine deployment to the Indo-Asia-Pacific, to ensure safety and security of vital sea-lanes and trade routes, integrating air and sea patrol operations.
The team departed Sri Lanka on Sunday, December 11 aboard the P-8A Poseidon from Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota.
“We are pleased about the opportunity to partner with our friends in the Sri Lankan government and armed forces,” said Lt. Anthony Beres, the detachment officer in charge of the ‘Red Lancers’ said.
“The P-8A Poseidon brings advanced capabilities to maritime safety patrols, search and rescue, counter-narcotics, and humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, and we appreciated engaging with the Sri Lankan Navy during this visit.”
