How will Bangladesh fare? : Only three nations have won their 100th Test

Bangladesh still the youngest Test playing nation and the last to gain full ICC membership 18 years ago will celebrate their 100th Test match when they take on Sri Lanka in the second Test at the P Sara Oval from today.
Not many countries have been successful at winning their 100th Test match and whether Bangladesh can fall into that exclusive category will be known over the next five days.
Of the ten Test playing nations only three have won their 100th Test match – Australia, West Indies and Pakistan whereas five countries have lost – England, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. New Zealand is the only country to draw their 100th Test.
ENGLAND
Wasim Akram (Pakistan)
England was the first country to get to the 100th Test match mark when they played Australia in the Ashes Test of 1909 at Headingley, Leeds. In a low scoring Test Australia finished victorious by 126 runs after three days. Australia were dismissed for 188 with slow left-armer Wilfred Rhodes taking 4 wickets for 38 and England finished the first day strongly placed at 88-2. The next day England advanced to 137-2 following a 106-run liaison between John Tyldesley (55) and John Sharp (61) but Charles Macartney with his slow left-arm bowling accounted for seven wickets as England collapsed to 182 handing Australia an unlikely lead of six runs. In their second essay Australia managed 207 recovering from 127-7 with strong batting by the tail. This left England with the task of making 214 for victory, but Macartney in the company of his new ball partner Tibby Cotter ran through the England second innings for 87 which remains their lowest total in a Headingley Test. Macartney achieved his best innings and match analysis in Test matches. England suffered a setback when their most attacking batsman Gilbert Jessop strained his back on the first day and was unable to bat in either innings.
Scores: Australia 188 (SE Gregory 46, VS Ransford 45, W Bardsley 30, W Rhodes 4/38) and 207 (MA Noble 31, WW Armstrong 45, H Carter 30, SF Barnes 6/63) beat England 182 (JT Tyldesley 55, J Sharp 61, CG Macartney 7/58) and 87 (JB Hobbs 30, A Cotter 5/38, CG Macartney 4/27) by 126 runs.
AUSTRALIA
Australia’s 100th Test was made memorable by right-arm leg-break bowler Jimmy Matthews creating a unique Test record by taking a hat-trick in each innings – both instances being on the second day as they crushed South Africa by an innings and 88 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester in 1912. The Test was part of the Triangular tournament which also involved England. Boosted by centuries from Charles Kelleway (114) and Warren Bardsley (121) who figured in a third wicket stand of 202 Australia amassed 448 batting first. South Africa replied with 265 recovering from 54-4 largely to an unbeaten century from George Faulkner. Forced to follow-on South Africa crumbled in a heap to be shot out for 95 with Kelleway following his century with a five-wicket innings haul. Tom Ward the South African wicket-keeper and no. 11 bagged a ‘king pair’ being the third victim of both hat-tricks by Matthews.
Scores: Australia 448 (CB Jennings 32, C Kelleway 114, W Bardsley 121, SE Gregory 37, TJ Matthews 49 n.o., WJ Whitty 33, SJ Pegler 6/105, RO Shwartz 3/142) beat South Africa 265 (GA Faulkner 122 n.o., R Beaumont 31, WJ Whitty 5/55, TJ Matthews 3/16) and 95 (C Kelleway 5/33, TJ Matthews 3/38) by an inns & 88 runs.
SOUTH AFRICA
South Africa’s 100th Test was highlighted by a successful run chase by England who won with just one minute of play remaining at Port Elizabeth in 1949. Set 172 runs to win in 85 minutes England got off to a pulsating start with Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook setting the tone with 58 in 27 minutes. The England 100 arrived in 53 minutes but wickets fell rapidly before Jack Crapp won the match by taking 10 runs off three successive balls in ‘Tufty’ Mann’s final over. Earlier wicket-keeper Billy Wade (South Africa) and England captain George Mann (England) had completed their only Test centuries of their careers. Opener Bruce Mitchell who played in 42 consecutive Tests for South Africa ended his career scoring 99 and 56.
Scores: South Africa 379 (B Mitchell 99, AD Nourse 73, WW Wade 125, AV Bedser 4/61, C Gladwin 3/70, RO Jenkins 3/53) and 187-3 decl (Mitchell 56, EAB Rowan 37, AD Nourse 30 n.o., Wade 34 n.o.) lost to England 395 (L Hutton 46, C Washbrook 36, DCS Compton 49, FG Mann 136 n.o., AV Bedser 33, AMB Rowan 5/167, NBF Mann 3/95) and 174-7 (Hutton 32, Washbrook 40, Compton 42, Rowan 3/65, Mann 4/65) by 3 wickets.
WEST INDIES
West Indies’ first home win against Australia (which later led them to win the first rubber against them) was achieved in their 100th Test played at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica in 1965. Captaining West Indies for the first time Sir Garfield Sobers took his 100th Test wicket when he dismissed Peter Philpott and became the first player to complete a double of 4000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests.
Scores: West Indies 239 (CC Hunte 41, BF Butcher 39, G St A Sobers 30, AA White 57 n.o., LC Mayne 4/43) and 373 (Hunte 81, Butcher 71, JS Solomon 76, JL Hendricks 30, Mayne 4/56, PI Philpott 4/109) beat Australia 217 (NC O’Neill 40, NJN Hawke 45 n.o., WW Hall 5/60) and 216 (BC Booth 56, Hawke 33, Hall 4/45) by 179 runs.
INDIA
England make a clean sweep of the series 3-0 when they beat India playing their 100th Test by 132 runs at Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1967, The Test came to an end on the third day after 20 wickets had fallen on the second day.
Scores: England 298 (C Milburn 40, KF Barrington 75, JT Murray 77, BS Chandrasekhar 3/94, EAS Prasanna 3/51) and 203 (DL Amiss 45, DB Close 47, Chandrasekhar 3/43, Prasanna 4/60) beat India 92 (DJ Brown 3/17, RNS Hobbs 3/25) and 277 (BK Kunderan 33, AL Wadekar 70, Nawab of Pataudi jnr 47, R Illingworth 4/92, DB Close 4/68) by 132 runs.
NEW ZEALAND
The only low innings of this high scoring Test match played at Bridgetown, Barbados in 1972 which happened to be New Zealand’s 100th was in West Indies first innings when they were shot out for 133 with all-rounder Bruce Taylor returning career best figure of 7 for 74. New Zealand boosted by a fourth wicket partnership of 175 between Bevan Congdon (175) and Brian Hastings (105) went onto score 422. West Indies lost half their side for 171 and New Zealand smelt a historic victory but magnificent sixth wicket stand of 254 in 363 minutes by Charlie Davis (183) and Sir Garfield Sobers (142) saved West Indies from defeat.
Scores: West Indies 133 (G St A Sobers35, TM Findlay 44 n.o., BR Taylor 7/74) and 564-8 (MC Carew 45, LG Rowe 51, CA Davis 183, Sobers 142, DAJ Holford 50) drew with New Zealand 422 (BE Congdon 126, BF Hastings 105, GE Vivian 38, VA Holder 3/91, G St A Sobers 4/64)
PAKISTAN
Pakistan celebrated their 100th Test with a most improbable win with fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz producing one of the greatest spells of bowling Test cricket seven wickets for one run in 33 balls. Australia needed 71 runs to win with seven wickets in hand but Sarfraz had other ideas as he grabbed all those wickets in a sensational spell that saw him return figures of 9 for 86 and bowl Pakistan to a71 runs win at Melbourne in 1979. Sarfraz became the first bowler to take nine wickets in an innings for Pakistan.
Scores: Pakistan 196 (Mushtaq Mohammad 36, Imran Khan 33, Sarfraz Nawaz 35, RM Hogg 4/49, AG Hurst 3/55) and 353-9 decl (Majid Khan 108, Zaheer Abbas 59, Asif Iqbal 44, Hogg 3/75, Hurst 3/115) beat Australia 168 (DF Whatmore 43, Imran Khan 4/26) and 310 (AMJ Hilditch 62, AR Border 105, KJ Hughes 84, Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86) by 71 runs.
SRI LANKA
Wasim Akram ruined Sri Lanka’s 100th Test with an outstanding all-round display at the SSC grounds in 2001 where Pakistan won by five wickets. Before his match-winning spell Wasim figured in a last wicket stand of 90 off 95 balls with Arshad Khan (9 n.o.) to lift Pakistan from 176-9 to 266 in reply to Sri Lanka’s first innings of 273. Wasim’s contribution was a hard hit 78. In the Lankan second innings Wasim destroyed the batting for 123 with a five-wicket haul that left Pakistan with a moderate target of 131 to chase which they did successfully. Arjuna Ranatunga became the only player in history to appear both in his country’s inaugural and 100th Tests.
Scores: Sri Lanka 273 (MS Atapattu 73, PA de Silva 30, DPM Jayawardene 77, Waqar Younis 3/50, Arshad Khan 4/62) and 123 (Atapattu 40, Wasim Akram 5/45, Arshad 3/30) lost to Pakistan 266 (Saeed Anwar 56, Moin Khan 47, Wasim Akram 78, M Muralitharan 5/115) and 131-5 (Mohammad Wasim 30, Younis Khan 32 n.o., Muralitharan 3/53) by 5 wickets.
ZIMBABWE
Graeme Cremer the Zimbabwe captain stuck it out for 175 balls and 121 dot balls to give his team hopes of saving their 100th Test played at Harare in 2016 but Sri Lanka dug deep into their reserves to secure a hard earned victory by 225 runs with 45 balls to spare. Cremer’s contribution in the Test was a maiden hundred and 43, while Sri Lanka who were dominant had three centurions Kusal Perera, Upul Tharanga and Dimuth Karunaratne.
Scores: Sri Lanka 537 (FDM Karunaratne 56, JK Silva 94, MDKJ Perera 110, BKG Mendis 34, WU Tharanga 110, DAS Gunaratne 54, AG Cremer 4-142) and 247 for 6 dec. (Karunaratne 110, DM de Silva 64, CT Mumba 4/50) beat Zimbabwe 373 (TMK Mawayo 45, H Masakadza 33, PJ Moor 79, AG Cremer 102, DT Tiripano 46, RAS Lakmal 3/69, HMRKB Herath 3/97) and 186 (Mawayo 37, SC Williams 40, Cremer 43, MDK Perera 3/34, Herath 3/38) by 225 runs.
