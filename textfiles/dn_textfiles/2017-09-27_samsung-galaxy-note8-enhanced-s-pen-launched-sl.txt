Samsung Galaxy Note8 with enhanced S Pen launched in SL

Samsung Electronics launched its flagship smartphone Galaxy Note8 in Sri Lanka, offering the next level Note for people who want to do bigger things. Samsung will also introduce Bixby Voice capabilities which will be available on Galaxy Note8 and Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices.
With Galaxy Note8, consumers get a big, immersive Infinity Display that fits comfortably in one hand, S Pen to communicate in more personal ways, and Samsung’s best-ever true Dual Camera with dual Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to capture stunning photos in all conditions.
The incredible Note series loved by thousands of consumers in Sri Lanka will also come with the revolutionary Samsung’s defense-grade security platform Samsung Knox, making it the most desirable smartphone available in the market. Galaxy Note8 is designed for the way consumers lead their lives and lean on technology today.
Hanbae Park, Managing Director, Samsung Sri Lanka, said, “Sri Lanka loves the Galaxy Note because they saw that it would be a canvas for their creativity, an engine for their ideas, and a platform for their productivity. I take this opportunity to thank all our consumers in Sri Lanka who have made Samsung the No.1 Smartphone brand, especially those who have patiently waited for the Note 8”.
“Galaxy Note8 with its stunning Infinity Display, enhanced S Pen and a true Dual Camera, is designed for those who want to do bigger things. At Samsung, we listen to our consumers and bring in meaningful innovations that help make their lives better. With this launch, Samsung will further consolidate its leadership in the premium smartphone segment in Sri Lanka,” said Nigel Adams, Head of Division, Mobile Business, Samsung Sri Lanka.
Galaxy Note8 has the biggest screen ever on a Note device, yet with superior engineering and design, it comfortably fits in one hand. The 6.3-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity Display lets you see more and scroll less. Galaxy Note8 gives you more room to watch, read and draw—making it the ultimate multitasking smartphone.
Note users have long been able to do more with Multi Window. With Galaxy Note8, the App Pair feature lets you create a custom shortcut on the Edge Panel to simultaneously launch two frequently used apps and invoke them with ease.
So, they can watch a video while messaging friends or dial into a conference call with the number and agenda in front of them.
Since its introduction, the S Pen has been one of the Note’s defining features. With Galaxy Note8, the intelligent S Pen unlocks entirely new ways to write, draw, and interact with the phone and communicate with friends. It has a finer tip, improved pressure sensitivity, and features that enable users to express themselves in ways that no other stylus or smartphone ever has.
Galaxy Note8’s Screen off memo allows you to take up to one-hundred pages of notes, without even unlocking the phone. Users just need to remove the S Pen and jot down notes, pin them to the Always On Display and edit directly from the Always On Display, letting users, including professionals, do what other smartphones can’t. The improved S Pen acts as a personal translator and convertor—just hover over text to quickly translate not only individual words, but entire sentences and get the output in up to 71 languages, or instantly convert units and foreign currencies.
