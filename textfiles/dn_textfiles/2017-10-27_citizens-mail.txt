Citizens' Mail

New education system vital for rapid development
As a principal and a parent, I fully agree with the statement of Special Assignments Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama. He reiterated that the current unemployment crisis is due to the improper educational system. Although we speak highly of a 93 percent literacy rate, in comparison the dividend we get from education is almost the lowest where we release 90 percent of unemployed youth from schools and universities. This has been an alarming scenario witnessed though all the governments tried their best to make unemployed the employed. It is a severe burden to the country’s growing economy.
The prevailing education system keeps the youth from getting sustainable jobs when they leave schools or universities. Since Independence, Sri Lanka hasn’t made the educational system conducive. It continues as a textbook oriented education system from the primary to the secondary. The schoolchildren carry a big bag of books and they are compelled to confine to the classrooms listening to the monotonous lectures. The students are not made to practical learning where they can find a vocation after leaving school. Even after learning science, a science student cannot change a bulb at home or fix a switch or a plug when it is needed. That is the sad situation of our educational system.
Every year nearly 47 percent of the students manage to pass the GCE O/L examination and the rest discarded to the streets and venture as tuk-tuk drivers, restaurant waiters, boutique salesmen and unskilled workers abroad. In Advanced Level too only about 42 percent pass and 15 percent are admitted to the universities. After the graduation, quite a number of students become jobless as they depend on Government employment which is limited. They are unable to find employment even in private sector since most of them lack English knowledge.
As the minister stressed, there should be a new system of education to produce youths who fit into the country’s development process.
I request the Education Minister to formulate a new educational system immediately to cater to the present needs of the country where youths could be involved in the country’s development work rather than producing white-collar workers who would confine to offices killing the precious time and money.
