Kandy Sports Club – League kings for record 18th time

Kandy Sports Club have retained the Dialog ‘A’ division league championship for yet another year with one more match to play against bottom of the table CH&FC the following week which will be of academic interest.
Kandy SC playing 24 carat gold rugby recorded their sixth win in a row win in the second round league to set a new league record by winning the trophy for the 18th time. They had earlier won in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2016.
The Kandy players made the hill capital proud and especially their godfather Malik 'Mr. Ruby' Samarawickrema who has been the cornerstone of their victory. Despite his onerous duties as minister he still found time to come and watch his ruggerites perform which inspired the team and the players.
In a tough league competition Kandy earned the top spot when the team grew in stature after early hiccups and competed admirably at the highest levels of competition.
The defending champions stunned Havelock SC 26-11. As game it served as a microcosm of Kandy’s improvements, be it in adversity, the dominant set-pieces or the clinical way they finished off their four tries.
Havelock SC took the field with dreams of completing the season with high hopes and winning the title, but all their hopes went up in smoke as Kandy SC tore them into shreds playing some amazing and eye catching rugby. Havelock were terrible in the first 40 minutes, but in the second half they were hanging on by their skins. Although the Park club had home advantage of playing under lights with master tactician Ronnie Ibrahim the coach guiding the team well this year, all this went astray as Kandy showcased a powerful performance to win the game convincingly.
Shehan Pathirana played extremely well for Kandy with his individual brilliance. He has grown as a rugby player and a person and has developed his game incredibly well. After the amazing teamwork and good thinking, Kandy players made the hill capital proud and fire crackers were lit in the town when victory was achieved and the trophy won.
The Park club started out strong scoring three points off penalties within the game’s opening six minutes and never looked back, using strong options passing the ball with good defensive tactics to dominate throughout the first half. A good passage of play was observed but they failed to add points on the score board. The second half continued as normal and Kandy took control of the game and blocked all passages not allowing the Park club free of handling of the ball.
Kandy SC hit back in the back-end of the game with Havelock’s mistakes ruining the home team's chances. In the second half Kandy SC were much better than Havelocks in many areas, and the strength of this side was in their fitness, co-ordination and ability to play under pressure. Kandy SC gave it their best shot in the second half with some intelligent rugby; they completed their job by scoring four tries, a penalty and a drop kick. The score would have been higher if the conversions and penalties were converted. Thilina Wijesinghe had an off day with his boot and he was able to convert only two out of the nine opportunities he got to kick at goal. Kandy SC team will now be at peace having totally fulfilled their potential and becoming the first club to win the tile the highest number of times in Sri Lanka.
Senior players such as Fazil Marija, skipper Roshan Weeraratne, Gayan Weeraratne, Kishore Jehan, Richard Dharmapala, Sashika Jayawardene, Nigel Ratwatte, have formed the backbone of this team for more than a half a decade. They are great players and outstanding men. Kandy SC has reached peak form at the right time after a poor start and now the sky is the limit.
It’s a pleasure to see them play as a combined unit with considerable power, co-ordination, and good control, discipline, kicking and navigating the team superbly and dropping another game-changing goal to bury the disappointments of previous games.
All players contributed extremely well towards the success of the team, notably the highest try scorer Dhanuska Ranjan, Richard Dharmapala, Thilina Wijesinghe was a great asset for the team with his kicking ability. The other players worthy of mention for their contribution are Shehan Pathirana, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Buwanaka Udangamuwa and Gayan Ratnayake actually the entire team should be applauded for their fine performance Kandy SC also has the luxury of a fantastic bench of players as replacements. The coach Sean Wijesinghe and the Rugby Committee should be considered the best for the decade for guiding the team to reach great heights this rugby season.
