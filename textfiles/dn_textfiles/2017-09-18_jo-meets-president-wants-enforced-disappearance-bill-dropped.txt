JO meets President, wants Enforced Disappearance Bill dropped

A group of Joint Opposition members led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena met President Maithripala Sirisena at his Paget Road residence on Saturday night and urged him not to proceed with the proposed bill for protection against enforced disappearances.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena speaking to the Daily News yesterday, said two main points were discussed at the meeting that extended for over one and a half hours.
“We asked the President not to move the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in Parliament next week. We told him the dangers the security forces would undergo if it was passed into law. We pointed out that this legislation undermines the sovereignty of the country,” he said.
Observing that the talks had been ‘very cordial’, the MP said they expect a positive reaction from the President.Asked as to how this legislation could pose a danger to the war heroes, if it does not apply to the past but only to the future, MP Gunawardena said the JO has no trust in what the Prime Minister says.
“There have been many flaws in the laws brought in by the Prime Minister. We cannot accept what he says and that is why we met the President,” he commented.
He said the other main point discussed at the meeting was the recent Amendment brought to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance that hindered the space for field officers to contest in Local Government Elections.
“We requested the President to withdraw this Clause and allow Samurdhi and other field officers to contest Local Elections as before,” he said.
When pointed out that the Amendment has been proposed by the Elections Commission Chairman, the MP argued that the laws are prepared by the legislature and not by the Elections Commission.
MPs Dullas Allahapperuma, Bandula Gunawardena, Jayantha Samaraweera and former MP Prof Tissa Vitharana took part in the special discussion held a day before the President left for New York to attend the UNGA summit.
