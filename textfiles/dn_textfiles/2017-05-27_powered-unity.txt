The ruling UNP-SLFP coalition will soon set up a joint mechanism comprising officials of the government as well as the Northern Provincial Council to accelerate Northern Province development. Northern Province consists of Jaffna, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mulathivu administrative districts. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced government plans in Jaffna after having met Jaffna District people’s representatives and officials.
The announcement was made at a joint media briefing given by PM Wickremesinghe and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. In addition to the joint mechanism, there would be a committee consisting of Northern Province Provincial Council ministers, Jaffna district parliamentarians and ministers, Wickremesinghe said.
Social Market Economy
In the mean time government sources said “The Government plans to create a competitive Social Market Economy that will give everyone the opportunity to create wealth. Our efforts to overcome the debt burden left to us by the previous Government and our efforts at empowering the economy have been commended and supported by the international community. We are setting the stage for Sri Lankan companies engaged in sectors such as agricultural, industrial and services, to be able to compete successfully in the global market while securing the inclusion of Sri Lanka in the Global Value Chain. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been the heart of the Indian Ocean.
“Sri Lanka was the hub that connected eastern and western Asia; accordingly, Sri Lanka’s capacity to become the economic and shipping hub of the region is imperative. Against such a background, we have the challenging task of developing mechanisms towards achieving sustainable development. Undoubtedly, it is no cakewalk – rather, it is a formidable task that must be undertaken with vision and foresight. In order for us to emerge as a prosperous nation, free of poverty and backward thinking, we must be able to encourage and foster foreign investment, which will fuel the developmental process. We plan to make Sri Lanka an export driven economic hub of the region, enabling connectivity with the region and the world via a highly developed network of ports and airports. We are committed to encouraging local and global investors to enhance the level of investments in Sri Lanka; as a result of the short sighted economic policies of the previous government, the country had to take on a very heavy burden of debt while investments tapered off at the time. We can only overcome the economic hurdles by obtaining a greater share of the market for our products and services via free trade agreements with other countries.”
While we hear the optimistic estimations from economic development front there are problems in the politics of national unification. President Sirisena addressing the nation at the National War Heroes Memorial Ceremony 2017 at the Parliament Grounds said that Sri Lanka was unprepared for a separatist terrorism when trouble started in the mid 70s. “There was smooth running of the country sans any significant economic or national security hiccups until 1970 after gaining independence in 1948. Though there were occasional failures and setbacks, our armed forces, the Police and Civil Defence Force fought the separatist war bravely and with utmost dedication and resolve until the final victory. Even about 100,000 Indian soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force were not able to contain the LTTE terrorists. However, the sons and daughters of the three armed forces and the Police of the motherland were able to annihilate the separatist terrorism from its soil forever by using their experience in the war, strategies and knowledge combined with technological acumen,” President Sirisena said.
Fight against terrorism
They faced many a hardship, threats and difficulties in their fight against terrorism. Hundreds of thousands of heroic soldiers made the supreme sacrifice in the war front on behalf of the motherland. Many others lost their limbs in the war and today they live as disabled soldiers in their own homes of welfare centres maintained by the armed forces. The number of civilians and armed forces personnel and members of the Police and Civil Defence Force who became victims of terrorist exceeds 100,000.
There were soldiers who were killed by the terrorists directly and innocent civilians who perished to bomb attacks in towns and villages in remote areas that were the targets of the LTTE. President Sirisena said incumbent government under him as well as the previous government for the last eight years had done much for the welfare of the soldiers and Police personnel as well as families.
During the period of the previous government May 18 became a day of tension in the North. The previous government too, celebrated the war victory over the LTTE in the South of the country. However Mahinda regime prohibited any public memorial services for those who died in the last battles in the North. This time too, there was a report that police in the North had obtained a court order to put on hold a commemoration event in Mullivaikkal scheduled for May 18. This took the centre stage of public attention in the North.
It appeared that the prohibition was for all commemoration services for the victims of the war and with that the past had returned to haunt the present. However, the court order was only with regard to a single commemorative event and was not a general directive that prohibited all commemorative activities. There were many commemorations organised by political parties and civil society groups in the North and East.
Some media reports said that families of the victims and the church groups had defied the ban and held commemorations. Even the blocked event was later permitted to be held in a church, though not on the last battleground of Mullivaikkal as originally planned. The biggest event in Mullivaikkal, which had been organised by civil society and political parties and which was attended by TNA leader R Sampanthan and Northern Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran. This event attracted the most public attention as TNA leader Sampanthan was heckled by some of the participants as he spoke.
Propose alternatives
This incident took over the centre stage of public attention. Both the court order halting a commemoration event at Mullivaikkal and the heckling of the TNA leader points to the level of democracy in the country. On the one hand, it shows the political space that has opened up which enables people in different parts of the country, and from different classes, to publicly express their dissent. Whether in the North or South those who protest are feeling increasingly emboldened to challenge those in authority and to propose alternatives.
Still, there is a serious challenge to Lankan state that commemorates the victory without mentioning the defeated. After all, those involved in the conflict were citizens of this country; whether belonged to the Sinhala nationality or the Tamil nationality; all were children of this country – Lanka. If there are heroes on the Sinhala side there should be more heroes on the defeated Tamil side. Depressed and humiliated, if Tamils yearned for a country of their own, free and independent; it is a problem that should be solved by the sympathetic participation of the majority community. If not it will lead again and again to the liberation struggle of the Tamil people.
Defeat of Tamil liberation is a void, unless serious attempt to unite the country with power sharing is done; it has to include a substantial autonomy with the right of self determination. At least, are we serious about a new constitution with Police and Land Powers to Provincial Councils?
