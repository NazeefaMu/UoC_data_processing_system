In addition, its three operating theaters, geared to handle all types of surgical procedures including Laparoscopic surgeries, facilitated over 3,000 surgeries during this period. The hospital also runs the only Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU) in the area offering 24x7 care during medical emergencies.

The hospital also offers a wide range of diagnostic and treatment facilities including CT and Ultrasound scanning, ECG, physiotherapy, and dental screening and treatment services as well as a fully-fledged Dialysis Centre.
