Terrorism, visa-exempt travel to take centre stage

Suppression of terrorism and visa-exempt travel between SAARC countries for the promotion of trade in the region are to take centre stage at the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting in Colombo, today.
Parallel to the Meeting of Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs), Colombo will also host the eighth meeting of the SAARC Secretaries of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) and eighth meeting of SAARC Immigration Authorities.
Sri Lanka also hopes that at the meeting would be successful in obtaining approval for the Secure Database of the SAARC Terrorist Offences Monitoring Desk (STOMD) established at the Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) in Colombo, in 2013.
The Secure Database would allow SAARC member countries to share information on terrorists and terrorist-related activities with each other.
“The proposal for such a database has been discussed for a long time, but countries have had issues regarding its security. But this year, we hope our proposals will be approved,” said Law and Order Ministry Secretary Jagath Wijeweera, at a media briefing held at Temple Trees last week.
He further said that Sri Lanka had volunteered to establish the database at its own Terrorism Investigations Department (TID) in Colombo.
TID DIG Nalaka De Silva in the meantime explained that while the project had been mainly funded by India, the system was home-grown; designed by the University of Moratuwa.
“Technical experts from member countries came to study the system and earlier they had voiced concerns regarding its security, but this time, we have improved on it and this time if approval is granted from all member countries, we can go forward with it,” said DIG De Silva. The DIG explained that member countries could update the database with information on terrorists and terrorist-related activity in their own country, but the information could only be accessed by another SAARC member after permission from the relevant member country is obtained.
At the Meeting in 2015, SAARC members approved the report on the database with Pakistan stating that “in principle it supports the establishment of secure data base and expressed the hope that the database would be utilized only for information and intelligence sharing.”
The meeting which is held once every two years has been brought forward by a year, said Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, as member countries had pointed out that this was an apt time to discuss issues related to terrorism in the region.
