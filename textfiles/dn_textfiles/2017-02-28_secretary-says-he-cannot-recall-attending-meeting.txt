Secretary says he cannot recall attending meeting

Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said he cannot recall attending a meeting a day prior to the first auction of the treasury bonds took place with the participation of the Finance Minister, the Highways Minister, and former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran.
Samaratunga was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday.
President’s Counsel, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda leading the evidence said it was critical for Dr. Samaratunga to refresh his memory on the meeting since it was very much relevant to the primary focus of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the issuance of Treasury Bonds.
Dr. Samaratunga said he cannot recall on the meeting since there would have been series of meetings on a given date.
“A very seasoned civil servant of your calibre would obviously be having details of an appropriate time on the meetings that you have attended. Especially on a briefing where a critical decision said to have been taken,” PC Kodagoda said.
Dr. Samaratunga said he, as the Secretary to the Finance Ministry, does not keep minutes of all the meetings he attended.
Following Dr. Samaratunga’s answer, PC Kodagoda read out the page 66 of the Hansard proceedings of the 17 of March 2015 where Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tells the House that there was a meeting on February 25, 2015 with the participation of aforesaid officials including the Finance Ministry Secretary.
Dr. Samaratunga added that he cannot recall who proposed to opt for a 30-year bond at the discussion.
Asked whether the decision to issue 30-year bond is a deviation from the issuance of treasury bonds, Dr. Samaratunga said it is not so.
“Are you in a position to explain the factors you put in to consideration when agreeing with this decision?” Kodagoda asked.
“I can only give a general explanation since I do not recall the incident,” Samaratunga answered.
It was also pointed out to the Presidential Commission, the minute of the discussion reveals that the decision has already been implemented by the Central Bank, and the information on the decision was provided to the Monetary Board by the then Central Bank Governor, Arjun Mahendran.
It was also pointed out to the Commission that a board paper of the discussion was not available.
“I was unaware of a press release published in print media on February 26, 2016,” Dr. Samaratunga said.
He said he did not issue or authorise to issue such a press release. The press release may have been issued by the Finance Minister’s office as they are also responsible in issuing press releases, he said.
