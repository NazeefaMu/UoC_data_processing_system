IFS aims to drive next phase of growth in South Asia

IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announces that it is ready to drive the next phase of business growth in South Asia.
IFS plans to drive business growth by establishing its leadership position in focused industries in existing markets and reaching out to untapped markets in the region through the IFS partner network.
In line with its regional business expansion plans, Shiraz Lye will take the reigns as Managing Director and Vice President Sales for IFS in South Asia. The new appointment will be effective from October 1, 2018 and aligns with the departure of Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO of IFS Sri Lanka.
Luis Ortega, Managing Director for IFS in the Middle East and South Asia, said, “IFS is transforming into a bigger, faster and even more customer-centric business and I am personally proud to be part of that journey. The appointment of Shiraz Lye as the Managing Director and Vice President Sales for IFS in South Asia comes at a time when IFS has real opportunity to increase momentum in the sector and extend its leadership position. This is good news for customers, partners and IFS employees.”
Managing Director and Vice President Sales IFS South Asia Shiraz Lye said, “I am excited and privileged to lead IFS’s South Asian business through this next chapter of growth. IFS is an incredible business! I plan to bring my experience and skills specifically around reaching out to new markets, increasing sales and enabling companies to perform better by using IFS solutions, and thereby empowering our South Asian organization to flourish. A strong ERP heritage and exemplary customer satisfaction gives the perfect platform to position IFS in new markets.”
Shiraz Lye has more than 27 years of experience from roles in business development, sales, channel management, key account management, marketing, and PR. Shiraz has been instrumental in heading the sales and marketing team in the South Asia region for the past 11 years.
Jayantha de Silva has been instrumental in growing IFS in the region from an organization of six people in 1997 to the second largest IT company in the country. Today, he leaves IFS as the President and CEO of IFS Sri Lanka after 21 years of service and at a point where IFS Sri Lanka is at the top of IFS world map.
As one of the most prominent figures in the Sri Lankan IT sector, Jayantha has held leadership positions in numerous business and industry associations and has committed himself in varied capacities to bring about service globalization and to boost offshore joint ventures in the IT industry of Sri Lanka.
Jayantha has received many international and national honorary awards for his outstanding services and commitment to the industry. Among these are, the National Best Quality ICT Awards (NBQSA) 2011 for his outstanding contribution, recognition and appreciation of the yeoman services rendered to the development of the ICT industry in Sri Lanka and the most valuable player for IFS in 2004 and 2007.
Jayantha De Silva said, “Looking back at my 21 years at IFS, I am proud to have been a part of building the Sri Lankan business into what it is today. I would like to thank the many colleagues who have been a part of this journey. They have helped sustain a culture that enables IFS to attract and retain talented employees and industry-leading customers. I would like to congratulate Shiraz and wish the whole IFS community the very best for the future.”
Luis Ortega added, “On behalf of IFS, I would like to thank Jayantha for his commitment to the company and for his efforts to establish IFS as one of the regions’s most respected and successful brands.”
