Suspension bridge a death trap

The suspension bridge across the Mahaweli River on the Ginigathena-Wevelthalawa road in the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha area in Nuwara Eliya District has been in a state of disrepair for several years. The wooden planks fixed on the 40 metre-long bridge which was constructed by the then Ambagamuwa North Village Council several decades ago are decayed and its supportive wires have become loosened making it a death trap.Villagers of Wevelthalawa walking daily to and from Ginigathena town, urge the authorities concerned to take steps to renovate the bridge.
