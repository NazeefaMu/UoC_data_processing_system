Human-elephant Conflict : Victims to get high compensations

Compensation paid for victims of elephant attacks will be increased, Department of Wildlife Conservation Southern Zone Assistant Director Prasanna Wimaladasa said.
He said three zones were identified as the most affected including the Southern Zone.
The Lunugamwehera, Tissamaharama, Ambalantota, Hambantota, and Suriyawewa Divisional Secretaries were earmarked to be granted a high compensation for those affected with the human-elephant conflict, he said.
Electric fences will be set up in these areas at a cost of Rs. 42 lakhs, he said.
