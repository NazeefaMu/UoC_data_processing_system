Bookworm makes ‘bookstagram’

Instagram isn’t short of stunning pictures; whether it’s travel, food, or just really attractive people having fun.
People also love showing off what books they’re reading, but perhaps no one is as enthusiastic about reading than bookworm Elizabeth Sagan. She has over thousands of books and creates stunning pictures with them, posing as some of the characters and worlds she’s reading about.
Her 90,000-strong followers tune in to see what creations she makes on her account as her ideas have become more complex and intricate over the years. Elizabeth is also best friends with James Trevino who has also become an Instagram sensation thanks to his artwork created out of his favourite books. When it comes to creating their ‘bookstagram’ the pair help each other assemble the books and take the photographs. Elizabeth tells Metro.co.uk that some of the books are borrowed from James and donated by people such as her dad.
“I have so many that after giving away 28 bags of 10 kg each I can barely see the difference,” she says.
“I have no idea how many exactly there are, but I’m sure there are thousands. And if you count the ebooks too, the numbers are even bigger. But not all of them are my cup of tea – in my collection you can find a lot of old science textbooks or other books that are outdated, for example, old computer science books thanks to my father. I’ve not read even half, they are so many! But I’m reading as much as I can.
"A picture can take from half an hour (the fortunate case) to a few hours (the unfortunate case) to create. After that comes the editing, which can also take from 15 minutes (the fortunate case) to more than an hour (the unfortunate case).
The good part is that I’m taking my pics in batches, and a batch usually translates to 16 to 20 pics that last for a month or so.”
