Defeated politicians spreading communalism - Mangala

 
When an attempt was made to expose the misdeeds of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the people who criticised Geneva are headed for the same destination to express their views, which is a joke, declared Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
The minister expressed this view addressing a gathering at the Athaullah Auditorium in Akkaraipattu recently.
Relations of missing persons comprised the gathering. National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganeshan, Jaffna District Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran were also present.
The meeting was preceded by a procession from Alayadivembu DS division to the Athaullah Auditorium.
Minister Samaraweera said those who were defeated by the people are now touring the country spreading communalism and breaking coconuts. Since this did not work, they are now going to Geneva in search of white coloured Gods. "Unlike the former government we who gave various promises, we are dedicated to address the genuine grievances of the people and do the needful. We will not ignore the prime needs of the people".
"We are not afraid of those disgruntled politicians who are trying their level best to topple the government. We will in the near future find solutions to all the problems confronted by the people. We are making necessary arrangements to find out the whereabouts of the people and pay compensation to them wherever necessary".
The minister said they are prepared to do a thorough search of those people who went missing and also make necessary arrangement to pay compensation to their families . They have also appointed a commission to look into the grievances of the families of missing persons .
"Please place before the commission all your grievances," he said.
