Norway, FAO will scale up innovative  forest monitoring tool

Access to satellite data and cutting-edge geospatial technologies will be broadened thanks to deeper collaboration between FAO and Norway, whose International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI)agreed to scale up an innovative FAO digital platform that helps countries measure, monitor and report on their forests and land use.
The $6 million, three-year project, announced during the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum, will allow for boosting the power and reach of FAO’s innovative forest monitoring platform, SEPAL (System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring).
The easy-to-use platform offers developing countries unparalleled access to granular satellite data and super computing power, paving the way for them to improve the accuracy and transparency of national plans to mitigate the effects of climate change and fine-tune land-use policies and implementation.
“Governments, civil society, companies and citizens need accurate and complete forest information to manage our forests. This is critically important in efforts to combat deforestation - efforts which must succeed if we are to reach the Sustainable Development Goals or fulfil the Paris Agreement,» said NICFI Director Per Pharo.
“Platforms such as SEPAL show how state of the art technologies can make forest information easier and faster. SEPAL has lowered costs, removed barriers, and improved forest monitoring for more than a dozen national governments. I am particularly eager to see what SEPAL can achieve with new access to high-resolution satellite data. “SEPAL allows users to query and process satellite data quickly and efficiently, tailor their products for local needs, and produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses quickly. Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. Google Earth Engine), SEPAL enables access and processing of critical historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europe’s Copernicus programme.
An example demonstrated in a recent training session in Indonesia showed how the platform allows for rapid detection of changes in the location and scale of burned areas. Such information is of enormous use to track activities that affect greenhouse gas emissions.
“This project underscores how FAO delivers value to member countries, providing them with the means to deliver sustainable results on their national climate and development plans,” said Hiroto Mitsugi, Assistant Director-General for Forestry.
The new agreement between Norway and FAO will allow the scaling up of the platform and the procurement and distribution of high-resolution satellite imagery via the SEPAL platform. Together - with cooperating partners such as the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility - SEPAL will improve forest monitoring and contribute to REDD+ Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV), for countries progressing towards results-based payments for actions that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as well as foster the conservation and sustainable management of forests.
