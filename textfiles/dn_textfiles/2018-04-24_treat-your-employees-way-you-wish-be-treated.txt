From crisis to sustenance - Part 24:
Treat your employees the way you wish to be treated

Over two decades ago, the concept of heart-centred leadership was met with scepticism. The concept of a leader who champions traits such as empathy, transparency and self-care was intriguing to some people who found themselves questioning the status quo.
Today, leaders are beginning to recognize the value of a heart-centred approach. Business owners who genuinely lead with their heart - not just their head - are more equipped to connect with the emotional needs of employees. They understand that people want to be valued, respected, listened to and involved. Leaders who consistently show their employees that they are appreciated possess the wisdom and capacity to run thriving, profitable businesses.
People like to be recognized in different ways– high fives, thank you notes, certificates, free movie tickets and so many others. It is great to figure out what makes people tick and what really makes them feel valued. At the very least though, say thank you and acknowledge the good things people are doing. It will make a difference. Show people with both words and actions that you appreciate them.
Techniques
Following are some techniques to assist leaders who wish to implement a heart-centred approach.
1. Solving, not just selling
Stop selling your employees about why they need to perform better. Explain why their contributions help solve problems and contribute to the company’s advancement. Employees are more inclined to step up their performance when they know their work can add-value to the healthier whole.
For example, I would always show my team the outcome of their collected efforts. We would go to the demo room and watch on screen new product on the production line or to the stores to see new label designs on the shelves. Inspire performance by connecting the dots of your employees’ efforts.
It is not only about what you are trying to sell, but also what the team is able to solve along the way.
2. Purpose, not just profit
Employees are inspired by knowing that their hard work makes a difference beyond profitability. Employees want leaders who see beyond the obvious and look to create wider reaching impact that extends into the community and influences social causes.
Look at IKEA, a Swedish-founded Dutch-based multinational group, that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories. It is the world’s largest furniture retailer.
Since 2003 IKEA has been raising funds annually for UNICEF and Save the Children through sales of IKEA soft toys. The project supporting 40 projects in 20 countries is designed to fight for children’s rights to a healthy and secure childhood with access to qualityeducation.
“Together we can re-write the future for children all over the world.Thousands of children with disabilities, from poor rural areas or ethnic minorities have been given access to education thanks to the donations from IKEA Social Initiative,” President IKEA said.
3. Know the ingredients, not just the recipe
The secret recipe to inspiring employees is to know the “ingredients” of the people you are inspiring. People want to know that their leaders understand their tendencies, attitudes and behaviours well-enough to best work with and motivate them. The best leaders and coaches always do.
When you spend time with your employees, make it matter. Don’t just expect your time and title to inspire them. Employees want a leader that pays attention and genuinely cares about them.
Great leaders take the time to know the ingredients before they can create the best recipe for success. Employees are most inspired when a leader takes the time to know them and show that they have their best interests at heart.
Leaders that know how to prepare thousands of recipes are those who continually make the ingredients better – and keep them from spoiling.
4. Learning, not just lecturing
Employees are tired of being told what to do. They are eager to learn and remain relevant. But they find it difficult to be inspired by leaders who only inflict fear. In today’s fast-paced world, people don’t have time for lectures; they want continuous coaching and leaders that are paying attention. Eager to grow, they want objective feedback.
Simplify the process. Don’t exhaust your employees through complexity and buzz-words. People seek direction that is to the point. Remember, most people have mastered the art of execution. Let your employee do their jobs well by providing the right tools and support to make them better at carrying out their roles and responsibilities. Be a great teacher, but quickly shift into facilitator mode. People are inspired when given the opportunity to learn how to do new things. Stop lecturing and start teaching.
5. Innovation, not just ideation
Employees want to create impact. Allow them to be part of the innovation-based projects in your company by letting them get their hands dirty. Ideation is important but being part of implementing the ideas that come to life can be a more exciting and meaningful growth opportunity for your employees that will inspire them to perform.
Additionally, provide your employees the resources to be innovative in their work. Stay close enough to your employees’ activities to know the 2 or 3 tools and/or resources that each would require to take their performance to the next level.
When given the right tools and resources, the best employees will instinctively challenge themselves to be more innovative in their work – and will perform better. That is why incentives inspire performance – but remember that money alone is not the sustainable answer. Focus on giving your employees the opportunities to elevate their individual value while serving the needs of the company.Allow innovation to inspire performance.
6. Significance, not just success
Helping your employees to be successful is important, but not inspiring enough in itself. People want much more out of their leaders and if you can activate the natural talents of your employees in ways that make them feel more responsible about their jobs, you will be inspiring something that is more significant – and has longer lasting impact.
The next time you conduct an employee performance review, evaluate each performance in two areas: success and significance. Let’s say that “sales” is a performance category – and your employee has performed at 90% of plan. That’s good. After you discuss what is required to reach 100% of plan, measure the significance of the sales generated. For example, perhaps reaching 90% of plan generated enough revenue to hire five more people or contributed to a particular community outreach plan as a result of a local market push. You never know the significance of someone’s performance until you measure it and when you do, it’s an effective way to inspire even greater performance.
7. Ownership, not just accountability
Enforcing accountability is a key component to sustaining performance momentum. However, when you can give your employees “ownership” in the process of defining how accountability is enforced – you inspire trust and a desire to go above and beyond the call of duty.
Giving your employees ownership means that you have shared and entrust them with your authority. You are now allowing your employees to “call the shots” based on what they believe is in the best interest of the team and the organization. For example, create a special project and allow an employee to take ownership of it. Outline your expectations for the end-result but allow him or her to take charge of the project.
Agree to meet once-a-week and observe the change in attitude and desire to perform. Use the results and what you learned along the way about the employee as a means to customize your approach to best inspire that employee’s performance long-term.
8. Respect, not just recognition
Beyond appreciation and praise, show your respect and admiration for the work of your employees. While people want to know they are respected, you must establish the ground rules for how respect is earned.
There are too many recognition addicts in the workplace. In a world of fierce competition, we have come to believe we are our own best allies. We believe we must rely only on ourselves. We believe we can sell ourselves better than anyone else. But this attitude puts our long-term careers in danger.
Unfortunately, too many people want recognition because they forgot the significantly greater value of earning respect. Re-train your employees about the importance of respect and lead them in how to earn it. When they see the greater impact respect delivers, they will be inspired by your example.
9. Personal growth, not just responsibility
Historically, leaders have used “increased responsibility” to inspire performance. While this approach may still have merit, it is when a leader can help foster the professional growth and development of their employees that performance most flourishes. Leaders must take more time to mentor and / or guide their employee’s development and growth.
Encourage networking opportunities and performance development forums. If the budget gets cut, – put your money where your mouth is. For example, purchase copies of a book that you believe will help your employees advance and grow in their work. Or even a video or CD.
10. Trust, not just transparency
Ultimately, it is a relationship based on trust that inspires employees to perform. When you are mindful of managing and concurrently implementing points #1 - #9 this will certainly jump-start your ability to earn trust with your employees and inspire their performance. When you trust someone, you believe in them. People are inspired when they know that their leaders believe in their capabilities to deliver.
