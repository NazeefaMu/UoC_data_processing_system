GMOA to fight against foreign trade agreements

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is working hard to make Sri Lanka the country in the region with the best doctors, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said this was stated during the 92nd Election of the GMOA, held recently. “It was decided there to fight against the ongoing foreign trade agreement racket and defeat it, similar to winning the fight against the SAITM racket,” he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA has also decided to stand by Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya, who is now being victimized by a well-planned conspiracy against him. The minimum standards of medical education should be legalized according to the recommendations made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), he said.
A period of one more month will be given to the Health Minister to gazette the rules and regulations and to hold elections for the four vacant positions in the SLMC. If he fails to do so, the GMOA will commence an island-wide protest and trade union action, he said.
