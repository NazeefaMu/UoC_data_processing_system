Steve Smith returns to cricket with a half-century in Canada

Steve Smith, the former Australia skipper, scored a half-century in the Global T20 Canada on Thursday, to mark his return to professional cricket.
Smith was handed a one-year ban from international and domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for his involvement in the ball-tampering scandal that erupted in South Africa in March.
However, he is allowed to play in the low-key Canadian event. The 29-year-old eased his way back by scoring 61 off 41 balls for the Toronto Nationals in a six-wicket victory over the Vancouver Knights at King City.
Smith’s knock included eight boundaries and one six before he was out stumped off the bowling of Fawad Ahmed. - AFP
