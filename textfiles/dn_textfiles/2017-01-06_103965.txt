Front Line Socialist Party National Convention

The second National Convention of the Front Line Socialist Party will be held on February 1 at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, Colombo, Front Line Socialist Party General Secretary Senadheera Gunathilaka said.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said visa has been granted for Premakumar Gunaratnam until February 20 this year.
Gunathilaka said on or before this date, he should be given Sri Lankan citizenship or his visa should be further extended.
“Otherwise he faces deportation. The authorities have not given a clear answer after forwarding his accurately filled formal written citizenship application three times,” he said.
According to Gunathilaka, the Front Line Socialist Party will provide a common platform for the voiceless and suffering people who have been cheated by all political parties so far.
The people were cheated by various political parties on various occasions, he said.
Gunathilaka said on January 8h, 2015 the two main political parties got together and cheated the people.
