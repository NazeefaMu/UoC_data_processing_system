At  your  fingertips

When there are beauty enhancers for every part of your body, should your nails be left out? Well groomed nails are an essential part of looking good. Your nails are also a fashion statement and can complement your wardrobe. Beautifully applied nail polish adds more beauty to the nails and attracts attention.
Technique of applying nail polish 
Clean each nail with Non Acetone Polish Remover.
Always start with a basecoat before applying coloured nail polish. This will avoid the nail plate from discolouring. 
Apply one or two layers of your favourite nail polish. Remove the brush from the bottle and wipe off on one side. Place the brush in the middle of the nail, slightly away from the cuticle, gently push down towards the cuticle and sweep over the centre of the nail up to the free edge. Seal the free edge of the nail for extended wear.
Finish with your favourite topcoat for glossy nails and extended wear.
Best shape for nails 
Simple and classic, round shapes are the easiest to maintain at home or in between salon visits.
The short length and natural curved edge are a no-fuss option for anyone who puts their fingers to work.
Why nail polish thickens after a while 
As polish ages, the solvents evaporate, causing it to thicken and get stringy.
This makes applying polish quite difficult.
Old polish also doesn’t adhere to the nail as well as fresh polish does. As a rule of thumb, go through your polishes every year and replace anything you didn’t buy in the last 12 months.
Reason for peeling nails 
Make sure all the polishes, base and top coats are fresh and not thickened. When polish is applied very thickly it’s more likely to peel off. Prepare your nails for polishing. Give yourself a proper manicure making sure you clean your nail bed and push back your cuticles.
Discoloured nails 
Nail discolouration, in which the nails appear white, yellow, or green, can result from different infections and conditions of the skin. In about 50 percent of the cases, discoloured nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be found in the air, dust, and soil.
Use a base coat to combat this issue. A base coat is typically a clear nail polish that goes onto your fingernails first, keeping the colored fingernail polish-and its potential lingering stain-off your nails.
White spots on nails 
The white spots on your nails are not caused by a calcium deficiency. These white spots in fingernails are called “leukonychia” and are very common. Most of the time the white spots simply are a sign of some past injury to the matrix (base) of your nails.
Remedies for nails which can break easily 
Eat plenty of protein to attain strong and healthy nails. Nails are made out of protein, so the first thing you can try is to add more protein to your diet.
Include lean poultry, fish, beef and pork, as well as spinach and other vegetables that contain protein in your diet.

Different types of manicures 
l French manicure
The ever-classic French manicure is guaranteed to give you the clean, gorgeous look you desire. For this style, a clear, pale pink, or beige polish is applied over the entire nail, with white polish along the tip.
 
l Gel manicure
If you want a long-lasting manicure without the commitment (or potential damage) of acrylic nails, a gel manicure is a great option. All the steps of a basic manicure are taken, except a special polish that requires curing under a UV light which is also applied.
 
l Shellac manicure
Another popular type of manicure is shellac. Your natural nails are cleaned, filed, and shaped at the salon. Then, a special base coat is applied, followed by two coats of shellac nail polish, and a top coat. In between each step, a dryer is used to cure. Similar to a gel manicure, shellac lasts for about two weeks and is resistant to chipping.
 
l Airbrushing
Airbrushing is a quick way to apply a design to the nails. The technician may use a stencil or create the style freehand.
