Citizens' Mail

The case of narrow-minded politicians
The situation in our country was very tragic. This you will realize when you speak to your friends. When you watch television, read newspapers there was clearly a political crisis. This placed our country in an economic crisis. International community laughed at us. There was a debt crisis.
Ignoring all these disasters, politicians were in an enormous power struggle. We fervently believe that none of these senior politicians could take our country out of this tragic situation. They had no plan. They had no commitment. They were not dedicated. They did not love the motherland. They wanted power for their personal benefit. They wanted to hide their weaknesses and frauds.
The main reason for this is that the senior politicians had been very narrow-minded. A narrow-minded person is not willing to listen to or tolerate other people’s views. They are prejudiced. A narrow-minded person has a mind firmly unreceptive to new ideas or arguments.
Open-mindedness helps you learn and grow.
The politicians lacked tolerance or breadth of vision. They were unwilling to consider alternative ideas, perspectives or thoughts.
We hope the new parliament will be broadminded and listen to other views and new ideas.
