Holding LG polls on electoral basis ensures democracy: SB

In accordance with election pledges of the “Yahapalana” government, it is now possible to hold the Local Government election on the electoral basis ensuring democracy and the people’s franchise, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
According to this system, an MP will be elected from each electorate while a number of MPs from each political party will be decided on the number of votes obtained by them.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the Minister said this system will prevent candidates campaigning based on race, cast and religions.
“Although the UNP and Joint Opposition wanted to retain PR system, the SLFP was against it from the beginning,” he added.
The Minster further said that JO is keen to show that the government and President Maithripala Sirisena are yearning to join with their “Pohottuwa” party. But, the actual situation is that JO members are coming behind SLFPers requesting to recruit them.
The JO members want to show that President and the government want to recruit them, but, they are not joining with them.
But, the real situation is many members in the JO are calling us day and night suggesting that they like to join with us at least on the temporary agreement. However, we also believe it is good for both parties to join hands and working forward. That is why President made an open invitation for all to join with the party.
He added that It is President Maithripala Sirisena who ended the practice of poaching MPs belonging to one party to another. I can state with responsibility that 11 politicians of the JO tried very hard to join the UNP.
“Some people were on the verge of joining and several others were not accepted into the UNP. But, after discussions between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,the practice of grabbing MPs from one party to another party was stopped.
