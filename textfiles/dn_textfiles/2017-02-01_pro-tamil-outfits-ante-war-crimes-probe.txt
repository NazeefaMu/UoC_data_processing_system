Pro-Tamil outfits up ante on war crimes probe

As a regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council is set to meet in Geneva in March, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Monday urged the Indian government to sponsor a resolution at the council that would ensure that there is an international investigation led by international judges into the alleged war crimes in the final stages of the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009.
He said that VCK, SDPI, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi, Tamil nationalist parties and Periyarite groups will soon protest outside Central government offices to urge the Indian government in this regard.
MDMK leader Vaiko demanded that a plebiscite be conducted in the Northern and Eastern regions of Sri Lanka, where Tamils are in a majority.
“In an e-mail to the United Nations general secretary and the UNHRC’s Commissioner, I have explained the history of the conflict and underscored how Sri Lankan Tamils have been subjected to injustice. In my statement, I have also presented evidence for the war crimes committed by Sri Lankan armed forces in the final stages of the war,” said Vaiko.
