GMOA on-board with government stance on SAITM

 
 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President requesting an appointment for a meeting in order to inform him of the GMOA's stand on SAITM solution presented by the Government, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. 
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that during the meeting with the President, the GMOA also expects to resolve unclear facts mentioned in the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue.
Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it is commendable the Government decided to abolish SAITM, remove the ownership of SAITM from its current owner and his family and to legalize the minimum standards of medical education according to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) document.
The GMOA will extend its fullest support to implement the set of proposals - with certain amendments - he said.
He said he was confused about the proposed new institution to be set up after abolishing SAITM.
“Whatever new institution must obtain the compliance certificate from the SLMC. This new institution should be scrutinized by a state body. The `Government / State Policy' mentioned in the Government's statement is not clear at all,” he said.
“An Interim Committee should be appointed under the SLMC immediately to look into the issue of current students in SAITM. The country's law should be implemented against the current SAITM owner for all grave offences executed by him so far,” he added.
