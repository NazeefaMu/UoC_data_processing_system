[APPRECIATIONS - (27-11-2017)]

A.M.A. Azeez
An iconic nation builder
A.M.A. Azeez was born on October 4, 1911, to a traditional elite family of Vannarpannai in Jaffna. He had his childhood and entire schooling in Jaffna. He attended leading Hindu schools and was a brilliant student. He passed away on November 24, 1973.
The legacy of Dr. Azeez, I sometimes think, is like an iceberg. What is visible is miniscule and the profound part is just submerged in history, which has to be carefully extricated through time-consuming and methodical research. Quite often, when we revisit the life and times of Dr. Azeez, we remind ourselves of the mature and astute political leadership he practised as a senator, his profound contribution for the advancement of the education of Muslims and the active role he played in the upliftment and reform process of Muslim society. Overreaching all these achievements, is his distinction of being the first Muslim to be recruited to the very prestigious Ceylon Civil Service of the bygone era.
His Senate and other speeches are erudite and have all the hallmarks of a visionary, a true statesman and a patriot. The mere reading of what he said in his speeches and writings are an inspiration to its readers, with his forward looking thoughts that transcend time. His contribution in the field of Muslim education is there for all to see even today. The grandeur and splendour of Zahira College and the Ceylon Muslim Scholarship Fund that he founded, continue to invigorate generations of Muslim youth to forge ahead in life and strengthen their role in Sri Lankan society. The YMMA movement he founded has energized the aspirations of many Muslim youth island-wide, and this has over the years helped young Muslim men to play an honourable and dignified role in society.
There is another more profound facet to Dr. Azeez’s legacy which is quite often forgotten by many people. This is his outstanding achievement in introducing major agrarian reform in the Eastern Province, which has resulted over the years, in the Ampara district being elevated to the rank of a major rice bowl of Sri Lanka. As the architect of this groundbreaking reform, he virtually opened the flood gates for economic prosperity of the people in the region where large numbers of Muslims live.
I was a student at Zahira College during the stewardship of Dr. Azeez. As he was my principal, I had the rare opportunity of getting to know first hand the fine qualities of this refined gentleman. During my student days I also learned a lot about Dr. Azeez’s other accomplishments. I also moved very closely with Ali, the eldest son of Dr. Azeez. Ali has been my dear and close friend for over fifty years starting from our university days. Despite all my close links with the Azeez family, I was never alerted to the role Dr. Azeez played in the economic uplifting of Muslims in the Eastern Province.
I discovered this quite accidentally when I was given a part time teaching assignment at the South Eastern University at Oluvil. Oluvil is 400 kilometers from Mount Lavinia where I live, and my long journey by car usually took about 8 to 10 hours. The tail end of my travel was through predominantly Muslim areas like Maruthamunai, Kalmunai, Sainthamaruthu, Sammanthurai, Nintavur, Oluvil and beyond that Addalachenai, Akkaraipattu and Pottuvil. As I entered Maruthamunai, I would always see the glorious sight of vast, in fact very vast, expanses of paddy fields stretching from the main Pottuvil road up to and beyond the horizon. This carpet of verdant green paddy fields encircle the predominantly Muslim areas, bringing enormous prosperity to the people of the region.
These vast paddy lands extending over 100,000 hectacres, irrigated by the plentiful waters of Senanayake Samudra at Inginiyagala, Ampara, has transformed the Ampara district into a granary of the Eastern Province. These lands are owned almost entirely by Muslims and large-scale paddy production has been the source of financial empowerment of this Muslim community. Whenever we reflect on matters concerning food security of the nation, we must remember with gratitude the remarkable contribution made by these people, who year after year have helped to feed the nation and eradicate famine and extreme poverty from our country. In the process, these people have also improved their economic status. The Muslims of this area enjoy robust and strong cash flows and the prosperity they enjoy is externally very visible. Home and motor car ownership, is very broad based, the ubiquitous motorcycle has invaded the precincts of nearly every household in the region and people generally enjoy a very high quality of life .
Several good schools in the region have sent large numbers of students to universities and the Ampara district continues to produce significant numbers of professionals including engineers, university lecturers, accountants, administrative officers, doctors, teachers, erudite ulemas and an army of highly entrepreneur businessmen.
This road to prosperity obviously has been the result of the dedication, tenacity and sweat of these hardworking people. At the very early stages of this agrarian revolution there was also an important catalyst who planned, energized and put together the vital ingredients of development. The role of this catalyst is what many of us have forgotten. My contemporary at school and at university, the Late S.H.M. Jameel has highlighted in his excellent and well researched article in 2007 titled “Contribution to Eastern Development 65 years ago,” this catalyst of change, who was none other than the illustrious Dr. A.M.A. Azeez.
My journey to Oluvil was always through Habarana, Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa. As I took the turn at Habarana on to Polonnaruwa road, I entered the majestic Habarana jungle stretch, which led me to Minneriya. I then go past the Minneriya reservoir which nestles like a mini ocean in the midst of virgin jungle. It is surrounded by thousands of acres of fertile paddy fields producing vast quantities of rice to feed the nation. I then drive past Giritale and Parakrama Samudra reservoirs which irrigate vast extents of paddy lands. This region has been energized to become a major granary of the North Central Province.
Around the same time when Dr. Azeez was assigned the task of accelerating food production in the Eastern Province, D.S. Senanayake picked another eminent civil servant, C.P. De Silva and assigned him the similar task of increasing paddy cultivation in the Polonnaruwa district. Incidentally, Dr. Azeez and C.P. De Silva sat and passed the tough Civil Service exam together. Dr. Azeez was placed second in the merit list with C.P. De.Silva being ranked eighth.
C.P. De.Silva restored the ancient glory of the Polonnaruwa district by renovating the ancient tanks, rehabilitating irrigation channels and bringing thousands of acres of neglected jungle land under the plough for paddy cultivation. During the immediate post war years, the rich harvest from these vast paddy lands was like God given mercy, with food shortages being slowly relegated to the backwoods.
The people of the region benefited immensely from this new agricultural reawakening and profuse material prosperity came to them like in tidal waves. The grateful Sinhala people of Minneriya never forgot their benefactor C.P. De Silva. His name still reverberates in local folklore and he is reverently referred to even today as the “Minnery Deviyo” the Deity of Minneriya.
When the Gal Oya scheme was completed, Senanayake picked another Civil Servant of the same batch, K. Kanagasundram (ranked first), as the first Chairman in 1952. He did a splendid job. The others in the batch, H. Jinadasa (ranked third) and M. Rajendra (ranked sixth), attained the highest posts before retirement. Some of the post CCS administrators say that the Civil Servants of yore were revenue collectors and did not contribute to development. This is not so looking at the above CCS batch of 1934.
Apart from agriculture, Dr. Azeez established institutions for the educationally backward Muslims in the district, encouraged by Poet Abdul Cader Lebbe and Swami Vipulananda.
God made some humans with major structural flaws, forgetfulness, and no gratitude. The good that people do is either trivialized or quite often forgotten.
This is the fate that has befallen Dr. A.M.A. Azeez’s legacy in the Ampara district. Dr. Azeez’s name is now unsung and unheard of in the predominantly Muslim areas of the Ampara district. Recorded history will perhaps be the only silent sentinel of the achievements of this fine gentleman, educationist, thoroughbred professional administrator and an iconic nation builder.
The Tamil poet Subramania Bharathi has stated that “a community that fails to honour its heroes tends to lose its capacity to nurture heroes in its midst.”
A.I. Marikar
Dr. Sarath Abeyakoon
He was a loving uncle
I would pace the corridor impatiently as I waited for you to come home; to hear your car turn in at the metal gates, to run and open the garage door for you to drive in. I would have been three, four, five, and six years at the time–I am now 37. I can still feel that sheer joy and excitement I felt as you came home, the familiar ‘hospital’ smell as you get down from the car with your newspaper and stethoscope. It feels like it was yesterday. To be honest, that pure childhood joy of spending time with you, maama, never faded, but only matured as I grew older.
Just last month, when we visited Sri Lanka, whenever our doorbell rang, there was always a leap of happiness that it may be you at the gate. With all your work, you never disappointed or failed to spend time with us. To me, you were a parental refuge of happiness, peace, kindness, and comfort. It seems impossible for me to explain it in words, but to describe inadequately; you always seemed to have a special aura of loving kindness that managed to lift my spirits simply by being there, whether at home, over the phone or during numerous tests when you have been by my side, even while I was losing consciousness.
Maama, you were a second father to me. I feel incredibly privileged to have not one, but two of the most amazing, kind and selfless fathers along with the most amazing, kind and selfless mother–your Akka, who doted on you and whom you doted on and took care of so devotedly. You were the best Malli she could ever wish for, and through her, you were my precious maama. People who know me may remember that I regularly cite ‘The Selfish Gene’ by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins theorises genetically why your mother’s brother is exceptionally close to you. To me, this seemed to be a scientific explanation of the exceptional bond I feel with you. I remember amma saying how angry I used to get as a child if she ever ‘told you off,’ even though I later realised it was always only a bit of sibling advice–both of you never bickered or fought, ever. Thank you for teaching me the value of family. To this day, this is still how I feel about you; I cannot bear the thought of you being hurt or pained in the slightest way.
Your bond with me didn’t stop there. My husband was like a son to you and my son, like a grandson, and the feelings were reciprocated. You were so worried about my son’s hearing and even from afar, managed to be a key part of making him better. He regularly remembers you, often saying, “Am I a good person like Sarath seeya? Am I a mini Sarath seeya?” I will of course encourage him to keep looking up to you as a role model. You are a role model to all of us though aspiring to be like you is beyond my capabilities. If I could be one-millionth of the person you were, it would be a massive achievement.
To this day I do not understand how you managed to have time for everyone, although I know that this was often by giving up your own needs. You never forgot a birthday and yours was always the first birthday card we received. You even took the time to write new year cards. You planned so much ahead that you, Luckshmi nanda, and Chathuri managed to give my little boy his birthday present when you saw him, even though his birthday was months ahead, and now you, are not even here to be a part of his big day. I, on the other hand, am ashamed to say that I still have a birthday card that I wrote to you, but never got round to posting. You faithfully called or messaged regularly, however busy you were, even though I am many thousands of miles away. Not once in my whole life have you ever not had the time for us. But it looks like you have always had time for everyone. How did you do it?
Thousands of people have shared their personal stories of what an exceptional person you were professionally, as a colleague, and as a friend, and how many thousands of lives you have touched. Although I knew that, even if a single word hadn’t been said, I could not be any prouder–I just could not feel prouder. How honoured I am to have been your niece. The last few weeks have been the hardest I’ve ever been through–I hadn’t felt the meaning of ‘a part of me is missing’ until then. Whilst I sought answers in the teachings of the Buddha over the last few weeks, I suddenly came to a realisation; you understood the Four Noble Truths so well. Suffering, the cause of suffering, cessation of suffering, and the path to the end of suffering–you must have experienced and explained this day in and day out in your own special way with loving kindness (metta), compassion (karuna), sympathetic joy (muditha) and equanimity (upekkha).
The words of your patients and their families are testimony to how exceptionally well you did this. You have taught me so much about what’s important in life–not through words, but just from the way you lived. I hope that I have enough wisdom to keep this at the forefront of my mind for the rest of my life and remember to live as you did. Luckshmi nanda and Chathuri, I am sure you take comfort in this knowledge as well.
I could write on for several books and never be able to scratch the surface of what you meant to me, to us, to everyone who has had the good fortune of knowing you. However a picture speaks a thousand words and your loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity continues to shine in every picture of you as if you were in the room. Maama, that seems to be a little bit of magic that you have left behind.
Maama, you know that I usually do not express my feelings so freely and publishing this has been very difficult. However, you often pushed boundaries for others and I feel that I owe it to you.
The void you have left in our lives can never be filled, but I know that with all the merit you have gained, you will be reborn to an exceptionally good life and that your path to Nirvana will be a short one. Dear maama, may you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.
With much love from you ever loving,
S. duwa

Dr. Nath Amarakone
He was an inspiration
Dr. Nath Amarakone had his early education at Nugawela Central College and later joined Ananda College, Colombo, for his secondary education. He was a bright student who received various prizes at every level including a gold medal from Ananda College.
His first degree was in engineering and after its completion, he was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship and then continued his studies at Imperial College, London. After Working for a few years with renowned engineering establishments, he returned to Sri Lanka. He was then employed by State Engineering Corporation.
He was appointed as the Housing and Construction Ministry Secretary, where he introduced innovative ideas for housing. It was at this stage that he felt professional knowledge in various fields had not been exploited and to elevate professionals’ roles, he embarked on programmes to promote professionalism in the country. It was at this stage that he requested a professional association to come together.
He initiated the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka. Dr. Amarakone met various top-ranking members of the Commonwealth Foundation and convinced them to provide a sizeable grant for the construction of the Professional Centre and also met government ministers and officials to discuss about the benefits to be gained from that programme.
The government allocated around 1 hectare of land in a prime location in Colombo. Dr. Amarakone was also the architect who erected the Buddha statue opposite the BMICH, which was put up within 23 days and was ready when the nonaligned conference was held at the BMICH.
He had a keen interest in upgrading the skills of others, not only of the work force, but also of the middle-grade employees, and he had a conducted various programmes to achieve this objective at his Sanathana Foundation Complex in Maharagama.
He was involved in various social and religious service activities.
Dr. Nath Amarakoon has left us leaving behind a vast legacy for those who will follow him. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!
