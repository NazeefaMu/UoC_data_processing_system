The guardstone miracle

Ancient Sri Lankan architectural patterns, Hindu temple structure, cultural chambers, sculpture and paintings resemble those of South Indian temples. Despite such similarities, Sri Lanka preserves its own identity. Ancient historical sites of Sri Lanka play an important role in society. The buildings were not built for general purposes. They were considered as community development centres. The construction of worshipping places has its own patterns and plans which resemble their own culture, customs, regional and religious influences of different periods. Besides, construction patterns of each worshipping place and region provide ample evidence of the ruler’s taste. They built temples with their own involvement in art, culture, tradition and religion.
Different categories
Ancient Indian rulers were deeply involved in culture and traditions. Different rulers built temples and cultural chambers throughout the Indian sub-continent. That also influenced the neighbouring Sri Lanka where temple architecture and sculptures constructed during various periods reveal different styles of social and cultural influences.
Most of the sculptures are divided into different categories. These sculptures are long-lasting. Yet the longstanding metal sculptures are not durable like the ancient temple sculptures which were made out of granite.
In the Hindu temple structures, at the entrance, the two guards are always installed. In the Sri Lankan archaeological sites beautiful guard stones are installed. The guard stones are found at the entrance of the important and sacred places such as Buddhist temples. Earlier guard stones were installed at royal palaces, important royal courts, water reservoirs and cultural chambers. In Sri Lanka, a variety of guard stones is found at different archaeological sites.
They are in standing postures with a curved body and different foot positions. All these resemble the classical dance stand poses and postures. In technical terms, the stands of dance and body positions are often referred to as Mandala Isthana positions.
Dance costumes
The hood of the guard stone is more often covered with multi-headed cobras. Such guard stones were often found at the entrance of water reservoirs, royal palaces and places where the treasures were buried. The multi-headed Naga king is called Naga Raja. The guard stones are highly decorated with beautiful ornaments and layers of waist chains. The costumes of the guard stones resemble the beautiful dance costumes. Besides, beautiful ear and chest ornaments and highly crafted head crowns are worn by the sculptures. They show a close resemblance to Hindu temple and tower sculptures.
One hand of the guard stone carries Punkalasa (a pot) and the other hand holds a bunch of buds and flowers. In some places, we see only Naga Raja guard stones. With the passage of time, Bahirawa was added to Naga Raja guard stones. Bahirawa was added to protect wealth. Sankha and Padma the two Ganas (Yakas) were installed at the feet of Naga Raja.
Beautiful Naga Raja stones could be found in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. Heads of the Naga Raja were decorated with exclusive beautiful ornaments. Over some guard stones, Makara’s heads were installed. At the base of the arch, lion and dancing human figures were depicted. These imply the close links of dance with Sri Lankan archaeological guard sculptures.
Earlier villagers performed poojas to the Yakas to protect their family and wealth. It was believed that the two Ganas or Yakas were employed by the God of wealth Kubera to protect the wealth. In some guard stones, we find a coin chain. In dance Kasumalai of gold sovereigns is worn around the neck.
