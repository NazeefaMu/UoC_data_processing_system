Family oriented ‘Judwaa 2’

Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan has recalled enjoying going to the movies with his family during his younger days. He says he wants his forthcoming film ‘Judwaa 2’ to draw families to the theatres.
Sajid Nadiadwala’s upcoming comedy film ‘Judwaa 2’, directed by Dhawan’s father David, features the actor in a double role. He will bring back the iconic characters Raja and Prem, portrayed by Salman Khan in ‘Judwaa’ back in 1997.
“When ‘Judwaa’ released, I was a child... I watched it in my childhood and I loved it very much. I would enjoy the reflex actions, I would love seeing Salman bhai in that way and then his song and dance with Rambha and Karisma [Kapoor] ma’am,” he said. “I had enjoyed the entire package of that film. So when I got the opportunity to do this film, I was like I need to do this film because I want children to come to the theatre, I want families to come to the theatre and that’s been my number one thing since I became an actor,” Dhawan added.
‘Judwaa 2’ also features Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu. India Today
