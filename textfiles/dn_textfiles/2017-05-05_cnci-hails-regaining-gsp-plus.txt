CNCI hails regaining GSP Plus

The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), has expressed appreciation to the Government for its work in the past two year period in regaining the GSP Plus facility.
Ceylon National Chamber of Industries Chairman Tissa Seneviratne said it was unfortunate that we have been deprived of this facility for years with which the country lost billions per annum from exports, especially to the EU countries.
Seneviratne said there has been a general understanding in the European Union (EU) that even though improvements could be made in the above sectors, the present achievements can justify Sri Lanka’s efforts to regain GSP Plus.
