Oldest cat in the world celebrates 30th birthday

Meet Rubble, a cat from Exeter, England, that is now being called the ‘oldest cat in the world’ after recently celebrating his 30th birthday.
Rubble and his owner, Michele Foster, have been the very best of friends since she got him as a kitten on her 20th birthday, back in May 1988.
Michele believes that the secret to Rubble’s longevity is the fact that she pampers him as if he were a child, she never had children of her own so Rubble is positively showered with attention and care. “He’s a lovely cat, although he has got a little grumpy in his old age,” she said.
“He has plenty of life left in him yet, but I don’t think we will go down the Guinness World Record route as I am not sure he would like lots of people coming to see him or a fuss being made out of him.He is old now and would not like too much attention or be hassled. We would prefer if he was just left to live out his old age in peace.”
The oldest cat who ever lived, according to the record books, is Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005, an incredible 38 years and three days!
Rubble has some way to go before breaking that particular record, but Michele is very proud of his achievement. She remembers her 20th birthday, the day they first met, quite clearly. “He was part of a litter of cats that my sister’s friend had, and I had just left home,” she explained. “I was lonely living on my own so got him in as a kitten. He is very loyal. We used to live in London and moved around a lot. If you care about something and someone and really love them, that goes a long way. I have always treated him like a child – I don’t have any children and had another cat called Meg – who passed at the age of 25. If you care about something, no matter what it is, it does last.”
Understandably, due to his advanced age, Rubble suffers from high blood pressure. He needs regular medication, which he gets from Shaun Moore of City Vets. “We recently had this amazing cat in for a check up and to celebrate his 30th birthday,” he said. “Rubble is quite likely to be the oldest cat in the UK and is still going strong. He is on medication for his blood pressure but apart from that, he is in remarkably good health. He enjoyed a free check up, some Whiskas Catmilk and Felix pouches, and less appreciated a free supply of medication for the next month as his birthday present from City Vets.”
While we are sure Rubble appreciated the treats, if not the medication, we can only salute his achievement and wish him continuing good health.
