Fifty inspiring stories!

The ‘Top 50’ Professional and Career Women Awards 2018 were celebrated recently, with remarkable women leaders from Sri Lanka recognized for their significant contributions within their corporations, communities, or livelihoods. Achievements like these have, in turn, led to more inspiring stories of Sri Lankan women entering the global market, and has spurred more women to enter the workforce.
With only one in three women participating in Sri Lanka’s formal labor force, increasing their participation becomes vital for sustainable, and inclusive economic growth.
Presented by Women In Management (WIM) and the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, the awards witnessed 63 women from Sri Lanka and the Maldives being honored with prestigious Gold and Silver awards for excellence in either their chosen career or for inspiring women in their community. Additionally, corporates and other institutions were also recognized for accomplishments benefiting women.
Top awards for 2018 went to Jayanthi Dharmasena, Managing Director of Hayleys Agriculture (Career Role Model of the Year), Marise Deckker, Managing Director of Astron Ltd (Best Woman Corporate Leader of the Year), Indrani Fernando, Managing Director of Philips Hospital (Business Role Model of the Year), and local retail icon Otara Gunewardene (Woman of the Year).
At the same time, Sri Lanka’s own Bollywood hit-maker Jacqueline Fernandez was highlighted as “Woman Achiever for South Asia”, while Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary General’s Envoy for Youth, was recognized with the “Youth Leadership Award”.
Dr. Gayani Tillekeratne, Assistant Professor at the Department of Medicine at Duke University, one of the most prestigious medical institutes in the world, Senior TED Fellow Asha de Vos, a marine biologist, ocean educator and pioneer of blue whale research within the Northern Indian Ocean, Prof. Chamindi Dilkushi Senaratne, an author and Professor of English Language Teaching at the University of Kelaniya, and J.M. Kamalawathi, a social worker, were all showcased as “Inspirational Women of the Year”.
Two highly accomplished international women took home Gold for “International Woman Leader” this year. The first was Damindra Dias, a former international executive at the Kellogg Company and Coca-Cola Company working in Canada, USA, Germany and South Asia. A high achiever with a passion for organizational leadership, strategic thinking and “never say no” attitude, she progressed from Accounting Clerk to Corporate Controller and Vice President Finance, ultimately climbing to the rank of Managing Director and CEO. The second was Sheree Atcheson, an award-winning board-appointed Global Ambassador for Women Who Code, a Consultant at Deloitte, the Founder of www.iamlanka.org and the Ambassador for One Young World Belfast, United Kingdom.
