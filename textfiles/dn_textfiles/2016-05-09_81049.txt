WMBD celebrations

World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD) is an annual, global awareness-raising campaign highlighting the need for the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats. The designated date for World Migratory Bird Day 2016 is May 10. This year’s theme is ‘the illegal killing, taking and trade of migratory birds’.
World Migratory Bird Day was initiated in 2006 and each year, on the second weekend in May. People around the world take action and organize public events such as bird festivals, education programs, exhibitions and bird-watching excursions to celebrate WMBD.
Connecting this Event with a Global Campaign and Theme, Villa Escondite, Kotte, will host a presentation in their venue on May 10 at 6.30 pm titled ‘Birds of Escondite’ by few experts in the field of Ornithology.
Presentations will be made by Ismeth Raheem – Chartered Architect, Art Historian on Study of Birds’ illustrations for the distribution of the species. Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka’s Frank Ryde will talk on ‘Kingdom of Bees’. Entrance free.
