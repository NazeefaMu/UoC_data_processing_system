SL wants new resolution for two year extension to implement Oct. 2015 joint agreement

The Sri Lankan Government on Wednesday expressed its intent to submit a new resolution to the UNHRC seeking another two years to implement the recommendations in the resolution 30/1 adopted in October 2015.
Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms Mano Tittawela said Sri Lanka would co-sponsor the new resolution led by the US together with the UK and Montenegro.
Tittawela made these remarks after participating in a side event organized by the Sri Lanka mission on the sidelines of the 34th Session of the UNHRC. The Sri Lankan mission in Geneva expressed the desire to seek two more years to implement the recommendations with regard to promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka through the draft new resolution led by the US and the core group. TNA Spokesman MP M.A. Sumanthiran told foreign media reporters in Colombo on Tuesday that his party was willing to give the government more time to fulfill promises made to the UN human rights council in 2015, but under a strict timetable and monitoring process.
