Raid on refuse tea centre in Divulapitiya

A stock of refuse tea over a 20,000 kg was taken into custody from a warehouse in Balagalla, Divulapitiya by the police yesterday.
The warehouse had been used as a centre to mix stocks of waste tea with small quantities of quality tea and import them to foreign countries in the guise of pure Ceylon tea, police said. Labels and packets to be imported to several Middle Eastern countries were seized. Two suspects were arrested while several others working at the centre had fled the raid was carried out. Investigations are continuing.
