Finance Minister was present at Primary Dealers meeting - Mutugala

 
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was present at the Primary Dealers’ meeting which was held following the controversial Treasury Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, former Additional Superintendent of Public Debt Department U. L. Mutugala said.
It was unusual for a Finance Minister to appear in a Primary Dealers meeting since usually the meeting is chaired by a Deputy Governor of the CBSL, she said.
The content of the meeting was the usual and focused on current market conditions, she added.
The Primary Dealers had asked the Finance Minister if it is possible to change the Sri Lanka Development Bank Bonds issuances from script to script-less.
When asked if the Primary Dealers confronted the Finance Minister on the questioned Bond issuance, Mutugala said they were rather silent about the matter.
Mutugala said the meeting minutes must be in order if the Commission wishes to examine them.
