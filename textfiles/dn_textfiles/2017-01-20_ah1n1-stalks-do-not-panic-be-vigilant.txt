A(H1N1) stalks: Do not panic, be vigilant

 A(H1N1) virus circulates throughout the year in all tropical countries. The routine pattern of the illness shows peaks of infection in November, December, January, May, and in June. The death of three patients at the Kandy General Hospital is an unfortunate incident. They were victims of unexpected complications. Therefore, generally the public has no reason to panic about an Influenza A(H1N1) spread.
According to Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige, elderly people over 65 years or children below two years, pregnant women, mothers in postpartum period, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner to prevent complications.
Without panicking, the public needs to be vigilant. Some people develop complications very rarely. However, those who suffer from flu and feel short of breath or weakened health condition, should seek prompt treatments.
Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said the public need not panic about A(H1N1). The virus can be at any public place in this cold weather conditions. Many may have already been infected and passed the infection unnoticed or with general medical treatment. The best advice the public must heed is to seek medical treatment from a qualified doctor when they get infected with flu without opting for any domestic remedies.
According to Dr. Bandara, individuals in high risk categories should avoid crowded places these days and should not visit infected patients. It can put them in danger as well as the already affected A(H1N1) patients in further more danger by exposing them to more infectious viruses and bacteria.
Consultant virologists encourage the public to followgeneral hygienic measures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections and to seek medical attention for flu. All possible measures to equip health institutions and health staffs to handle Influenza A(H1N1) patients have been taken by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Epidemiology Unit.
Symptoms
Individuals infected with A(H1N1) get sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and runny nose. Cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks. Influenza can severely affect people in high risk categories with can lead to death . The time from infection to the onset of illness, known as the incubation period, is about two days.
Prevention
When an infected person coughs, droplets spread into the air and another person can breathe them and get infected. The virus can also spread by contaminated hands. People should cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs or tissues when coughing and sneezing, and use a germ killer soap/liquid and water to wash their hands. Used tissues should be disposed while handkerchiefs should be washed thoroughly with a germ killer soap before reusing them.
Other preventive methods
Health professionals recommend further preventive methods as well. By following good personal hygienic habits like of not touching eyes, nose or mouth, washing or cleaning hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rubs, avoiding spitting in public places can help prevent infections. Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as having more severe symptoms. Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, sanitizing surfaces may help prevent some infections.
Treatment
Influenza patients need to seek treatment from a state/private hospital or from a qualified doctor. The hospital authorities/the doctor/s decide the diagnosis method and treatments. Home remedies should not be applied.
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is prescribed for Influenza A(H1N1) patients. The drug should be given twice a day (150 mg per one dose). Patients in critical condition may require it more than twice a day. Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) should be avoided.
A private company in Sri Lanka recently announced that SD BIOLINE Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1) PandemicOptimal test for all types of Influenza Virus are now available in Sri Lanka from all leading private hospitals and laboratories. It is a chromatographic immunoassay for the differential and qualitative detection of Influenza virus types A, B and A(H1N1) Pandemic antigens directly from nasal/throat/nasopharyngeal swab or nasal/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens. This assay is intended for professional use and for vitro diagnostic use only. The test can detect Influenza virus type A, type B and A(H1N1) pandemic antigen (4 lines) with the highest specificity. The samples tested positive, are determined as influenza H1N1 positive without additional tests.
