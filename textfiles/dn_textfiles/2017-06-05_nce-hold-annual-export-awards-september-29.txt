NCE to hold Annual Export Awards on September 29

National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) proposes to celebrate the 25th Annual Export Awards ceremony on September 29 at the Hilton Colombo.
The Annual Export Awards Ceremony of the NCE recognizes and rewards Sri Lankan exporters on their achievements in the International Market Place. It serves to motivate them to reach greater heights in the field of exports, and enhance their contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka.
It is the most looked forward to event in the business calendar of Sri Lanka, and is attended by over 600 participants including the political leadership, members of the Diplomatic Corps, high State Officials, the cream of the Business Community, member exporters of the Chamber, and special invitees.
The newly elected President of the Chamber Ramal Jasinghe in his address at the AGM had stressed the importance of reaching out to the Regional Chambers, and present special awards to especially export oriented SMEs, Service Providers to Exporters, and entities which are links in the Export Value Chains, with a view to motivate them. The Management Committee of the Chamber has also taken special interest this year to ensure that Entrepreneurs linked to the Export Value Chains from the Regions are recognized with Special Awards.
In this context the NCE also wishes to emphasize that the Export Awards Ceremony is not exclusively for its members.As such all Direct Exporters, Indirect Exporters, Service Providers to Exporters,as well as other Stakeholders in the field of exports could apply for awards.
Shiham Marikar, Secretary General of the Chamber emphasizes the reasons, why Sri Lankan exporters of Products and Services, as well as upcoming SME exporters should apply for Awards. Firstly, winning an Award serves to motivate employees of the enterprise by witnessing the outcome and benefits of their efforts. Secondly, an award winning export enterprise receives tremendous exposure and publicity through the print and electronic media, regarding its business and professional standing, there by boosting its image among stakeholders. Thirdly and most importantly recognition of the achievements of an enterprise enables it to attract overseas buyers thereby facilitating expansion of the business.
The event this year which celebrates its 25th anniversary, includes several new features, which gives recognition not only to the value and growth in exports of an enterprise, but several other important areas related to the Management of the enterprise, financial parameters, impact on the environment including aspects such as Waste Management and Recycling, Energy Management and Energy Audits, ability to acquire internationally recognized special certifications related to exports, as well as the overreaching activities of an enterprise which has a positive impact on the stakeholders and associated communities etc.
In the above context the Chamber in its 25th year of the event has extended its outreach to Provincial Exporters, as well as related stakeholders in the field of exports.
The objective of the Chamber in respect of this outreach program is to encourage Regional SME Enterprises and Potential Exporters,and develop them into independent export enterprises. It also serves to increase the number of entrepreneurs and export enterprises in Sri Lanka, in order to diversify and expand production capacities of Sri Lankan Export Enterprises.
Officials of the Chamber have already met with Key representatives of Regional Chambers in Kandy, Kurunegala, Uva, Trincomalee, and Jaffna Districts and have appraised the importance of their members applying for 25th Anniversary Awards of the NCE.
