Ideal vision Auto & lifestyle Show from Saturday

Ideal vision "Auto & lifestyle show" 2017, a unique concept which is far different to the traditional motor Shows that we witness will be held on July 15 and 16 at Nelum Pokuna.
“ We are showcasing our product strengths from a motor cycle, scooter, 3 wheeler, light truck, medium truck, heavy truck, SUV, double cabin pickups, electric cars, to the latest diagnostic maintenance, renewable energy, finance, automotive spare parts, white goods, electronic goods, IT, & many more.”
Nalin Welgama, Founder and Executive Chairman Ideal Group, said that this is the first time in Sri Lanka, they will be showcasing the entire range of vehicles marketed solely by Ideal; a step taken by no other automotive major.”
“We are also proud to be the first auto major in Sri Lanka to introduce a franchised electric vehicle from the house of Mahindra & Mahindra, a global conglomerate which manufactures the widest spectrum of automobiles ranging from the 2 wheelers, 3 wheelers, light trucks, heavy trucks & buses, UVs, construction equipment, SUVs and cars”.
Welgama went on to say that an impressive line-up of electric vehicles from Mahindra will also be introduced in the next few months in keeping with current world trends. Speaking further on the electric cars he said that one of the biggest emitters of carbon to the atmosphere are vehicles with combustion engines.
“We have witnessed the rapid rate at which Tesla has progressed making it the 4th largest car company surpassing car giants like BMW on valuations. It is believed that we will have 100 million EVs by 2025,” he said.
The Narendra Modi government has taken a bold step to have only EVs on all Indian roads by 2030. They are also launching a driverless metro train over a 13 km stretch in New Delhi commencing in October 2017. Prime Minister Modi is also fully committed to transforming India to EVs by 2030. Our president is also a keen believer of renewable energy and was a key participant at the Paris Agreement last November and Sri Lanka too should follow on these lines.”
Sri Lanka too is committed to improve solar power generation to around 20% from the present 7%, which is encouraging. This will no doubt motivate both the government and the public at large to improve awareness.
Cementing on the dearth of trained technicians and engineers and how the Ideal Group propose resolving this he said most trained technicians, are overseas in search of better prospects. “Time is ripe to try to lure them back home by introducing "state of the art" workshops in keeping with the modern trends. We have successfully achieved this with the setting up of our "Ideal Choice Premier Workshop" in Ratmalana. This has attracted a lot of highly trained Sri Lankan expats particularly from the Middle East.
