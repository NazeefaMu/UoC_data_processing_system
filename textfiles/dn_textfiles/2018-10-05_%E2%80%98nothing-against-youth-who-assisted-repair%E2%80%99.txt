Railway technicians clarify:
‘Nothing against youth who assisted repair’

Sri Lanka Railway Technical Trade Union said yesterday that they have nothing against the youth who had assisted in the repair of the Colombo-bound express train from Jaffna which stalled in Mahagalkadawala, Galgamuwa, recently.
Although there were reports on several websites that Railway technical officers were against the action of the youth Janith Dimantha, there is no truth in such allegations, Sri Lanka Railway Technical Trade Union Secretary B.S. Kamal Peiris said.
“We appreciate the youth’s action at a time when passengers and Railway workers were facing inconvenience,” he said.
Generally, when a technical fault occurs, Railway technicians undertake the repair, but the assistant technician was absent on this occasion. Under the normal Railway law, outsiders cannot assist the repair of a train’s engine or compartments.
If something goes wrong during the repair by an outsider, the relevant technicians have to take the responsibility ultimately and not the outsider, Peiris said.
Meanwhile, Railways General Manager Dilantha Fernando said that he has not received any letter of protest from any Railway union in this regard. However, an independent inquiry is being held by the Railway authority on the Galgamuwa incident, he said.
