President, PM give due recognition to women: Bandara

Women in Sri Lanka are fortunate as both, the President and Prime minister, have given women due recognition in society, said Women’s and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara.
She said this while addressing the International Women's Day celebrations held in Matara, on March 8.
“The 25% female representation at the forthcoming local government election was a big achievement. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has supported me in getting cabinet approval for proposals made by my ministry,” she added.
She said, “In the past, even the illiterate villagers treated females with respect and love as it was the female that sweated to cook and take care of her family. The role played by women have changed; women have been empowered with the strength to surpass male domination in many fields, including government. You should remember that it was Sri Lanka that elected the first Woman Prime Minister in the world.”
“This year’s theme for the International Women’s day celebration in Sri Lanka is ‘The one who sees the past, present, and future is victorious in her efforts," the Minister said.
Minister for Law and Order and Southern Development read the message sent by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while Provincial Minister Chandima Rasaputhra read the message sent by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Former first lady Hema Premadasa was the special guest at the event attended by Minister for Foreign Employment and Welfare Thalatha Athukorala, Deputy Minister for Sustainable Development and Wildlife Sumedha G. Jayasena, State Minister for City Planning and Water Supply Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Members of Parliament Hirunika Premachandra and Buddika Pathirana, Provincial Ministers Weerasumana Weerasinghe and Chandima Rasaputhra, and a large gathering of officials from government, private sector, and NGO’s attended the event.
