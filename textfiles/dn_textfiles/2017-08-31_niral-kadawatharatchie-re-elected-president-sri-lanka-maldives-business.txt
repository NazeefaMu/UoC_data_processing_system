Niral Kadawatharatchie re-elected President of Sri Lanka - Maldives Business Council

Sri Lanka - Maldives Business Council (SLMBC) of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held its 9th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Friday, August 25, at the Hilton Colombo Residences.
Charge D’ Affairs from the Embassy of the Republic of Maldives, Khadheeja Najeeha was the Chief Guest at the event.
Welcoming members and guests to the event, SLMBC President Niral Kadawatharatchie said, “As we all know, the main objective of our Business Council is to promote trade and tourism between the two countries and also to facilitate investments.
In this context, we have done well. If you look at the figures indicated in the annual report, you will see that the trade has increased from Rs 10 billion in 2015 to Rs 14 billion in 2016. The tourist arrivals in 2016 has also increased from 90,000 in 2015 to 95,000 in 2016. It is just a 5% increase, but hopefully it will be better in the years to come.
"We have done well on both counts, but I would like to urge all our members in the Council to do more. The secretariat is actively involved in promoting trade, tourism and investments in the Maldives. One of the areas that we actively promote is the trade exhibitions held in the Maldives.
"Our members are welcome to take part in the Hotel Asia exhibition in the Maldives.
We are more than happy to help any Sri Lankan company willing to participate in these exhibitions held in Maldives. This is one easy way to promote trade. This method has proven to be very successful.”
Delivering the keynote speech, Charge D’ Affairs Khadheeja Najeeha said, “The close bond of friendship that the Maldivian people and the people of Sri Lanka share are unmatched.
There are no two countries which are socially, culturally and economically closer to the Maldives than Sri Lanka. These close ties have been further strengthened over the years by closer trade relations between the two countries.
"Maldivians have from time immemorial relied heavily on purchase of various products from Sri Lanka, and in return Sri Lankans have been fond of fish products from the Maldives.
"Today, this traditional merchant-to-merchant trade has been intensified over the decades in the form of supplying shipments in bulk and through various other services.
Moreover, trade relations have been further strengthened by the significant increase of Sri Lankan investments in the Maldives and Maldivian business ventures in Sri Lanka.”
Niral Kadawatharatchie, President/CEO of Freight Links International (Pvt) Ltd was re-elected as the President of the Sri Lanka – Maldives Business Council for the year 2017/2018.

The Sri Lanka Maldives Bilateral Business Council was inaugurated on May 25, 2007, under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce as its 19th bilateral business Council with the objective of promoting trade, investment and tourism between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Maldives.
