Former PS employee held for attempted murder

A former employee of the Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha was arrested by Chilaw Police on April 17 on charges of attempted murder for forcibly entering the office of the Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary in a drunken state and trying to attack him.
Police said investigations revealed that the employee who had been assigned as a substitute vehicle assistant during the previous council administration had been dismissed following a disciplinary inquiry.
As he entered the secretary's room and tried to attack the secretary, another individual present on the occasion had caught and overpowered him.
Further investigations are continuing.
