Jumbo trouble on Kataragama - Buttala road

Wild elephants roaming on Kataragama - Buttala road looking for food pose a threat to people travelling in vehicles, pilgrims say.
The road leads to Buttala from Kataragama through Block 5 of the Yala National Park and frequently, wild elephants come to the road to get food given by people travelling in vehicles.
Now the number of elephants had increased. About five elephants roam in the area looking for food.
Some elephants become aggressive and charge at vehicles and people.
The pilgrims want the Wildlife Department to stop elephants from coming to the road.
When inquired by the Wildlife office in the area, they said the road goes through the Yala National Park. Therefore, wild animals cannot be stopped.
“The wild elephants come to the road as people give them food. We have informed the people not to feed wild elephants. However, it has become useless. As long as people feed them, they come for food,” an official said.
