NCM against Rajitha will be defeated by two-thirds in Parliament: Ravi

Former Finance Minister MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said they would defeat the No-confidence Motion (NCM) against Minister Rajitha Senaratne by a two-thirds if it was presented in Parliament.
MP Karunanayake was participating in a ceremony to hand over a clean drinking water supply project to Anuradhapura yesterday (31).
MP Karunnayake said it was important to note that the Joint Opposition was bringing the No-confidence Motion against a minister who brought down drugs and medical equipment prices.
“When we are making a change in the country, some parties cannot stand it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s creative development plan has expedited our economic growth. Some who cannot stand the rapid development process try to hinder it many ways,” MP Karunanayake said.
MP Karunanayake said their dedication was towards the country and for the good governance for which he gave up his post.
“Who is bringing this motion of no confidence? One MP is someone who paid Rs. 500 million for his divorce case. Another has two passports. No-confidence Motions have turn into a joke now,” he said.
The drinking water supply project was halted for many years and MP Karunanayake restored it by providing special provisions. Over 100 families in Nelumkanniya, Sattakulama and Halmillewa will benefit from the project.
