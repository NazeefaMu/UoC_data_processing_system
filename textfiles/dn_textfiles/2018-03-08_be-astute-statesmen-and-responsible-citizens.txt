Rumour mongers should be taken to task:
Be astute statesmen and responsible citizens

The ugly heads of ethnic tension and communal disharmony raised themselves this week as the government clamped down hard on unrest in the Central Province, even if its own political course remained unclear almost a month after the local government elections.
At the time of writing, the declaration of a state of emergency had been announced for a period of seven days following clashes in Digana and Teldeniya which had the potential to escalate into a conflict between the Sinhalese and Muslim communities on a greater scale. Police curfews were also being imposed in areas thought to be at higher risk.
A concern in government circles is that incidents which would otherwise be personal disputes are being exploited, giving them a communal undertone. The incidents in Digana and Teldeniya were sparked by the death of a Sinhalese man who was reportedly severely assaulted by several Muslim youths. The unrest forged a life of its own and evolved, leading to the destruction of several Muslim owned shops and houses from which the body of a Muslim youth had been recovered.
That this senseless violence comes days after similar- if not so severe- clashes erupted in Ampara is a cause for serious concern to the authorities. The issue at stake in Ampara was a myth propagated through rumour and social media that Muslim owned restaurants were introducing ‘sterilisation pills’ into food consumed by Sinhalese customers.
Nationalist and racist rhetoric
This is not medically possible because oral contraceptive medication usually needs to be taken by females in a regular manner. However, the myth seemed real to those inflamed by nationalist and racist rhetoric propagated through social media and word of mouth. That the incidents in Ampara in the Eastern Province and Digana and Teldeniya in the Central Province occurred only days apart, appears to be too much of a co-incidence.
Even if they did occur spontaneously and were not orchestrated, there is no shortage of groups willing to take advantage of the circumstances. Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, the head of the Bodu Bala Sena organisation which is known for its persecution of minority communities was quick to visit the funeral house of the Sinhalese victim and his presence there wouldn’t have helped to ease tensions. Buddhist monks were also at the forefront of demanding the release of those charged with arson in the violence there.
On the political front, Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) leader Wimal Weerawansa was quick to seize the situation to discredit the government, as he is wont to do. Weerawansa accused the government of being lethargic in dealing with the unrest deliberately.
“When people resorted to violence, the government turned a blind eye because it was an excuse to suppress burning issues. The government wanted to do so because it wanted to divert attention from the crisis in over the Premiership and the United Nations Human Rights Council sessions,” Weerawansa claims. Such allegations are of course Weerawansa’s hallmark, although most would consider them preposterous because the government wouldn’t surely want another issue to contend with at this critical stage.
There have however been several indications that law enforcement authorities were not, at least at first, quick to clampdown on the growing unrest, perhaps underestimating its consequences. Both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament that initial investigations suggest that persons who are not from the locality may be involved in propagating the violence.
“Buddhist and the Islamic clergy in Digana and Teldeniya were engaged in a dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully but a group of extremists who had come from elsewhere were engaged in violence” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told Parliament. Inquiries, under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are underway to probe this more extensively.
Communal unrest
President Sirisena also declared that action would be taken against those seeking to create more communal unrest. “Stern action would be taken against those who breach peace and provoke citizens by spreading rumours and false news by various means, including social media platforms”, the President said in a special statement. If the law and order situation in the Central Province was a key focus of attention, so was the Law and Order portfolio within the Cabinet. At the recent Cabinet reshuffle, the portfolio was taken away from Sagala Ratnayaka and vested with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. However Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne is on record saying this is a temporary measure and the ministry would be brought under Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
The current impasse has arisen because parliamentarians of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) oppose such a move. It has been reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had made several representations to the President in this regard and so has Fonseka himself.
The President’s predicament in vesting this ministry with the decorated soldier who served jail time under the previous regime must be viewed in the current political context. In the aftermath of the local government elections, it is no secret that overtures were made by President Sirisena to the dissident faction of the SLFP headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition (JO) group in Parliament.
The JO is thus far playing hard to get. They have mooted a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. They have also stated that in the event such a motion is successful and a SLFP led government is formed, they will not accept any portfolios but would provide conditional support. The JO also demands the Opposition Leader’s position. These are difficult demands to agree to, even if the SLFP is able to muster enough numbers to oust Prime Minister Wickremesinghe- which they haven’t been able to do.
Local government election
The SLFP- as well as the UNP- realise that one key issue at the local government election was the government’s inability to punish those who were corrupt in the previous regime. If this is done now by entrusting Field Marshal Fonseka with the task and he executes it with the same precision he dismantled the Tamil Tiger terrorists, the JO leadership as well as some in the mainstream SLFP could find themselves having to answer some difficult questions.
With SLFPers in the government now seeing rapprochement with the JO as their only path to survival at the next general election, they oppose Fonseka’s appointment as Minister of Law and Order. The UNP and the SLFP are in a stand-off on this issue now, reminiscent of when former President Chandrika Kumaratunga refused to swear in S. B. Dissanayake as the Minister in charge of the Samurdhi programme in the UNP led government of 2001. In that instance, Kumaratunga eventually yielded and Dissanayake was sworn-in. The JO meanwhile is keen to push through its agenda for a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. A few UNP backbenchers were supportive of the move but the JO then announced that it had been postponed. The reason it gave was the current unrest in the country but observers say it is more than likely it was because it lacked the sufficient numbers in Parliament.
The political climate in the nation is therefore in a state of flux. What is important that in the midst of all this, the country does not hurtle into yet another ethnic conflict. For such a calamity to be prevented however, its political leaders of all hues should act as astute statesmen- not petty politicians.
