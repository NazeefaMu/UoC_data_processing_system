First case at Permanent High Court-at-Bar today

The first case filed in the Permanent High Court-at-Bar will be taken up for hearing today (24).
This court was set up to hear high-profile financial fraud and corruption cases. The three-judge-Bench headed by High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon will hear the case against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage, former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna and Lasantha Bandara.
They have been charged for allegedly transferring Rs.500 million from Litro Gas to Canwill Holdings.
The indictments will be served on the accused today by the Permanent High Court-at-Bar and the case will be fixed for a trial date accordingly.
This court was opened by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale last Tuesday (21).
