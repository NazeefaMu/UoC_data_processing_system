Parking fees through mobile phones

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday introduced a Smartphone APP that will enable motorists to pay their parking fees through mobile phones.
This is being implemented as a public-private partnership project between the CMC and Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) Ltd,.
The company has entered into an agreement with the CMC to implement an effective parking system in designated areas of Colombo from January 1, 2016.
Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Engineering services). Eng. L R L Wickramaratne said it was the CMC which began the practice of collecting parking fees through female park wardens nearly ten years ago.
However, the CMC did not meet the targeted parking revenue as the service was inefficient. There were also many public complaints. As a remedy, we have found a more effective and efficient electronic parking system for the selected areas in Colombo.
The Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) LTD was selected after a tender process to implement this project and it was the highest bidder.
This was implemented as a pilot project from last year on Galle Road (from Dehiwala bridge to Galadari Junction and connecting bylanes) and R.A.De Mel Mawatha (from Dharmarama road to Liberty Plaza Junction and all the connecting bylanes.).
We have installed 100 machines including 8 machines in Galle Face Green,55 machines on Galle Road, 24 machines on Duplication Road and 13 machines in by Lanes.
The aim of the new parking system is to introduce better traffic discipline with an improved parking management system in the Colombo area to ease traffic congestion,” he said.
The CMC believes it is necessary to have advanced parking solutions to ensure steady flow of traffic and to ease vehicular congestion.
“ Now, we have made it easier for the public to pay parking fees via the mobile phones.
The fee structure will be as follows” trucks and lorry-Rs.50, Car and jeeps-Rs.30, threewheelers-Rs.20 and motorcycles and schooters-Rs.10.
This street meter parking management system is being monitored by the traffic division of the Urban Engineering Section attached to the CMC.
Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) LTD CEO Dilan Perera said the mobile app will provide many benefits to customers. Customers can pay parking fees at their convenience without having to walk to a meter and payments are cashless and paperless. Automatic reminder for expiring parking time and easy management for user including the e-receipt,parking history and parking tracking are other benefits.
Smart parking is a vital step towards building a smart city and this dynamic partnership between Tenaga Car Parks and the CMC will serve to take the parking space in the city of Colombo to the next stage in its developmental history,” he added.
