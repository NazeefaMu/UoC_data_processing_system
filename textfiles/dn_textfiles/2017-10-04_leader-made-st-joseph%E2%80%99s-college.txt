Leader made St. Joseph’s College

The key to success lies in strong links. If the company holds true then a team can succeed. If there is a weak link the strongest force can fall apart. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of St. Joseph’s College Raveen Antonio who understands this well, which is why he is successful as a leader.
“Every link in the chain is important, and I play rugger and I am the vice -captain of my college. We have a motto. That is – ‘You can have a thousand enemies around you, but if there is one enemy inside your team that will be a big problem!’. So I feel all 37 of my prefects must be united and if there are any loopholes it is going to be a big problem. I have made sure that this does not happen. There can be no room for misunderstanding. Because this can lead to a big problem. The link is the most important thing. Everyone needs to work towards one goal,” explained Antonio.
Rigorous trainer
Rugger is the sport he plays. Rugger is when 15 men go against another 15 men. From their young days they are trained rigorously at matches. When you play a lot of matches and gain a lot of experience you don’t have that fear. If you have experiences you don’t feel the fear. The opposition team can be really good or really weak, but on one day the weaker team can be better.
“What I feel is that you should lead in the proper way. There can be good luck or bad luck for both sides. If we do all things correctly, if I give my first tackle properly and collect the ball well, then I can gain confidence. Then you don’t feel nervous. If you do the basics correctly and understand that small things can make a difference on the field then you can be successful. To do well in rugger you should know the basics first. You need to know the hard work can beat luck,” added Antonio.
Antonio certainly has a bright future and has been selected to South Eastern University of Sri Lanka.
“I have done my A/Ls and I have obtained four A’s and have been selected to South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. Currently we are also working on our college walk and preparing for Prefects Day. As a Prefect, it is the most important day for a prefect. That is the day we do a lot of work. It is also the time when we get a lot of experience approaching sponsorships meeting people. I am also doing ACCA at Mercury Institute,” said Antonio.
TO understand life
As a Head Prefect, the experience of being a Head Prefect has benefited Antonio a lot. A Head Prefect understands life. The need for a leader to understand life could be cliché statement, but that is exactly what it is. The society beyond the world of a student is a complicated and full of peril. One is suddenly beset with various problems when stepping into this world beyond school. Society makes demands and one is suddenly surrounded by its multiple problems. It is what you learn at school that will prepare you to engage with these personalities who may not be very friendly or nice, personalities whose motives maybe ill-intentioned.
“As senior prefects at St. Joseph’s from an early age we are sent out to approach a lot of people. We go from bank to bank to get advertisements, banners and sponsorships. So that environment enables us to understand how to approach a person and talk to a person. It is really easy for us. As prefects we have learnt a lot. The role of Head Prefect is easy for me because I have had that experience as a senior prefect,” said Antonio.

Antonio has faced many challenges as Head Prefect. Overlooking the work in college is what he find most strenuous. In an event the Prefects hand has to be there. Invariably the prefects are involved, and working with the teachers is one of the main challenges.
Gigantic task
“One of the most challenging events was when we had to control 200 cardinal priests at the President’s House in December (Asian Bishop’s Conference) So, there were only 37 of us prefects. This was gigantic task. That gave us invaluable experience. It was a first time I was there with all the security systems and we were basically doing the ushering part,” said Antonio.
A person who relishes putting himself to the test, Antonio works very hard. From morning till dusk he works. He is a ‘finisher’ while relying on his deputies. A man who believes that the best way to getting something done is to do it yourself, he is no stranger to hard work. He does the job no matter what.
“They key to my success is the family background that I have. My religion is also a great source of strength. The fact that I went to church from a young age has helped me a lot. I have received many things spiritual, and I believe in doing something useful for the country. One of the most important keys to success is the ability to listen. Listening is also being silent. I feel that listening hard can put you onto the road of success. Discipline and commitment are also important. Words are powerful, so be careful about what you say. It can break someone’s heart. Once it is said you can’t take it back. They say the tongue has no bones but can break a heart,” pointed out Antonio.
Antonio’s leadership is not just a title. He wants people to respect him not for his position but for his character. But he also believes in talking to people the correct way. Then they will listen to him. So when controlling the student body he distributes his work amongst his fellow prefects. So organization is the key.
For anyone in life bravery is important. You need to be really adaptable. There are situations where you have to adapt. This applies to life and to his Rugger. Rugger has helped him a lot to work as a Head Prefect.
“Cleverness and strength can make a big change. And of course you have to be brave to play rugger. Then you will give your heart and soul to the field. I have sustained many injuries on the field but that can’t be helped. My position is fly half and cleverness is needed in that position. He generates ideas. The main position ideas are generated is in the fly half position,” stated Antonio.
Feeling that any decision is better than no decision he is able to assess the situation. This is off the field and on the field. He will act. If it is tough he will ask those who are senior to him like his parents or teachers or the principal.
“They are always there to help me. I will get everyone’s idea and select the best idea then I can solve the problem easily,” said Antonio.
Antonio feels that to be a good leader you have to have patience. You have to be strong because trouble finds anyone in leadership. You can’t prevent it from coming to you but you can control the way you react.
