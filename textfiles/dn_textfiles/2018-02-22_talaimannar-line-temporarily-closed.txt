Talaimannar line temporarily closed

Sri Lanka Railways will temporarily suspend train services on the Northern line from Medawachchiya to Talaimannar for one week from February 26.
Accordingly, two trains from Colombo Fort to Talaimannar and two other trains from Talaimannar to Colombo Fort will not be in operation during this period.
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) Operations Superintendent Vijaya Samarasinghe said this was due to the construction work on replacing the old bridge located between Medawachchiya and Talaimannar with a new one. Meanwhile, a special bus service will be in operation to transport passengers between Medawachchiya and Talaimannar during the rail closure.
