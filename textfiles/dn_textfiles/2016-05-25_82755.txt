President to leave to attend G7 Summit

President Maithripala Sirisena will leave for Japan today (25) to participate in the Group of 7 (G7) Summit which is to be held in Tokyo on May 26 and 27.
The President participates in the summit on a special invitation by Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is the present Chairman of the G7 Summit. It is indeed an unprecedented invitation since no leader of the country has received such an official invitation to take part in the G7 Summit. It is indeed an honour to the President and our country.
In addition to the G7 set agenda, attention will be drawn to the global economy, foreign policies, national security, global health and women's empowerment at the summit
The G7 is a group consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union is also represented within the G7.
