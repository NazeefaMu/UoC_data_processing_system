Soul Coffee, Sri Lanka’s premium coffee brand, recently partnered with Mount Lavinia Hotel as their exclusive total coffee solutions provider. The partnership ensures that guests at the Mount Lavinia Hotel can experience the finest locally grown and handpicked Ceylon coffee at any of the Hotel’s premier restaurants, banquets and rooms.
Group General Manager of Mount Lavinia Hotel Group, Bazeer Cassim said, “At Mount Lavinia Hotel we take great pride in offering our guests unforgettable experiences at our many dining options.
And, as a natural accompaniment to a meal, coffee plays an important role in that experience. Hence it was important for us to find a partner that understood our needs as well as provide us with the finest coffee available. That is why we are proud to be partnering with Soul Coffee – a company with a keen understanding of coffee and its local heritage.”
Soul Coffee, with its ethically conscious and environmentally friendly approach to coffee, has been reviving Sri Lanka’s rich coffee heritage and been the driving force behind the country’s renewed coffee culture. After entering the market with the promise of providing handcrafted coffee, sustainably sourced from the highlands of Sri Lanka, the company soon established itself as a favourite amongst coffee drinkers and aficionados.
Forming strategic partnerships with leading hotels and cafes in Sri Lanka, Soul Coffee has spread the joy of tasting locally grown and artisanally roasted coffee.
Speaking about his company’s push to revive Sri Lanka’s coffee culture CEO and Founder of Soul Coffee, Rinosh Nasar said, “Coffee has a long and rich history in Sri Lanka and we are proud to play a part in reviving that aspect of our culture in today’s environment.
This partnership plays a big part in that revival as it marks the beginning of two great heritage brands coming together – Ceylon Coffee and the Mount Lavinia Hotel – which will greatly enhance the local coffee experience we provide visitors to our beautiful island nation. I look forward to exploring further opportunities to add value to the coffee experience with the team at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.”
