Realistic buttercream botanicals

Cake art is more popular than ever, with many bakers creating sweet treats that not only taste good, but are a feast for the eyes too. One creative chef to do so is self-confessed “buttercream enthusiast” Leslie Vigil.
The California-based artist is part of Tasteful Cakes, a family-owned cake shop that specializes in delectable desserts that look almost too good to eat. Vigil’s multi-tier masterpieces are topped with a variety of art and nature-inspired buttercream frosting designs that showcase her incredible skill and creativity.
From perfectly piped petals to life-like cacti and succulent icing, many of Vigil’s edible works hardly resemble food at all. Some pieces even feature flower pot bases sculpted from fondant, containing “potted” cake plants within. In other designs, Vigil’s crafty confections resemble sparkling, natural geodes, made with gold leaf, molded isomalt crystals, and rock sugar. And for one particularly impressive project, Vigil created a cake inspired by Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Sunflowers paintings, complete with three-dimensional yellow flowers and swirls of painterly buttercream.
