Additional daily Qatar Airways flights to Colombo and Dhaka

 
Qatar Airways has announced an increase in the number of daily flights to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh due to the continued robust demand from passengers on both destinations.
Qatar Airways revealed in a press release that it increased its Colombo service from four to five flights per day, while it increased Dhaka service from two to three flights per day, commencing from September 1, 2017, just one month after the last frequency increase.
The additional non-stop daily services to and from Colombo and Dhaka will each be serviced by Qatar Airways modern A320s, adding more than 1,000 seats to the current weekly capacity to and from both exciting destinations.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker noted the growth of the business and tourism sectors in these cities, pointing out that these new flights will provide more convenient options for more passengers to travel to and from Doha to many destinations in Europe, America and the Middle East and will enable them to experience Qatar Airways’ services.
The increased capacity on the Dhaka and Colombo routes represents a major commitment by Qatar Airways to enhance its offering to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Al Baker said, adding that this commitment has been rewarded with the loyalty of many thousands of passengers per month who choose to fly with it.
