Baptism by fire for Lankan young ’uns

The recently concluded three-Test series against South Africa was a fiery baptism for Sri Lanka’s young batsmen who were all at sea against some top class fast bowling - the likes of which some had never encountered in their brief careers thus far.
What that series taught them was that runs against that class of bowling was never easy to come by and unlike in the subcontinent where the ball rarely swings or bounces - in conditions they were up against the name of the game was endurance, which they clearly lacked.
The deficiencies in inexperience obviously showed during the series and if the young ’uns have learnt from that bitter experience then Sri Lanka should not be disappointed with their 0-3 whitewash, if not they have a long hard struggle ahead of them playing overseas.
That only three of the batsmen managed to get past a half-century mark just showed how dominant the opposition bowlers were. They simply preyed on the weaknesses of the Lankan batsmen probing constantly outside the off stump and testing them with short-pitched deliveries that sometimes reared off a good length which to say the least, the batsmen clearly displayed their incapableness.
Sri Lanka had their chance in the first Test at Port Elizabeth where the pitch was best suited for them than at Cape Town or Johannesburg, but they failed to capitalize on it. Had they done so the performance would have given them more confidence to tackle the South African fast bowlers for the rest of the series.
Prior to departing to South Africa head coach Graham Ford confided that if Sri Lanka was to perform well in South Africa the top three batsmen had to deliver, if not they would be in trouble. Well that didn’t happen and we all know the result.
The top three in the order were Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and the elusive number three position which Sri Lanka has yet to plug following the retirement of the great Kumar Sangakkara. It is said that the number three position is occupied by the best batsman in the team and at present Sri Lanka does not have anyone to fill that spot. Against a high class bowling attack as the one the South Africans have especially in their conditions one cannot experiment with the all-important number 3 position. Sri Lanka went to South Africa with no clear idea of who would play in that position.
They tried Kusal Perera for the first Test and he clearly didn’t look the part especially with his loose stroke play. What that position required was a solid batsman in the mould of an Anura Tennekoon, an Asanka Gurusinha or a Kumar Sangakkara - not a stroke player who flashes his blade at each and every delivery and tries to commit hara-kiri.
For the next two Tests Kusal Mendis was promoted to number three and although he batted with some conviction it is early days to confirm whether that is the permanent position for him.
Promoting Dhananjaya de Silva to number four was a good move but after Angelo Mathews at five and Dinesh Chandimal at six, the number seven slot is again open to either Upul Tharanga or Kusal Perera. Perera at seven is a better bet than at three.
With captain Mathews and his deputy Chandimal, the two most experienced batters in the side failing to put runs on the board one could not expect the rest of the team with less experience than the top two to perform.
Mathews managed just 178 runs from six innings which was the most by a Sri Lankan and Chandimal a disappointing 85 in as many.
While the batting was a disaster the same cannot be said of the bowling. Teenager Lahiru Kumara and Suranga Lakmal were the standout players for Sri Lanka in the series. Lakmal the spearhead of Sri Lanka for several years finally achieved his first five-for in a Test innings and throughout the series bowled consistently without much luck at times. His 12 wickets is only the second time he has achieved a double figure haul in a Test series, the first being a similar haul against Pakistan in the UAE in 2014.
Kumara is the real ‘find’ in the series for Sri Lanka. For one so young at 19 Kumara displayed tremendous pace clocking 140 plus consistently, but he needs a little more experience to tighten up his bowling and make the batsmen play at every delivery. Kumara needs to be nurtured carefully and ensured that he is free of injuries which are a common occurrence amongst modern day Lankan fast bowlers.
As for South Africa they are at the moment on a roll. They were expected to steam roll Sri Lanka following their 2-1 triumph in Australia and they lived upto that prediction. Although their batting at times wavered their bowlers delivered from the top drawer. Philander, Rabada, Abbott, Parnell and Olivier were simply unplayable at times and gave the Lankan batsmen a torrid time in the middle.
They hardly made South Africa feel the absence of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel from the firing line. Very rarely does a Man of the Series go to a bowler and on this occasion it was won by South African opener Dean Elgar who aggregated 308 for an average of 61.
