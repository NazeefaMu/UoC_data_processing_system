Green notes

For the first time eight ornamental Nepenthes ‘Bandura’ hybrid starter plants have been introduced in Sri Lanka. These eight varities have been named as Lady Luck, Bill Bailry, Binky, Crimson Kiss, Mimi’s Kiss, Queen Malani Suki and Susan. One variety has been named as Queen Malani as a tribute to Sri Lankan screen queen Malani Fonseka.
There are around 120 Nepenthes verities in the world and around 2000 ornamental Nepenthes hybrids have been introduced to the world. Borneo Exotics (Pvt) Limited Managing Director Robert Centley said that they have been engaged in experimenting with Nepenthes hybrids for around two decades and have come up with about 200 new varieties. Eight of these new varieties have become top sellers. The company hopes to introduce and popularize them among the public. Those who are interested in growing the Nepenthes hybrid verities can purchase them from the nurseries in Lindula from January 20 to February 28. The varieties will no longer be on sale after this period.
Sri Lanka has one Nepenthes variety which is endemic to the country. This rare breed grows in Sinharaja.
