Breakfast Power

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day; you probably heard it from your own parents many years back. But now you're the one saying it to your sleepy, grumpy kids, who insist to run to school empty stomach as you try to get everyone fed and moving in the morning.
It can be tough to get kids fueled up in time for school. But it's important to try. Here's why breakfast is the most important meal for everyone especially the kids.
Why bother with breakfast? 
Nutritionists advise that breakfast should be eaten within two hours of waking. Breakfast is a great way to give the body the refueling it needs. Children who eat breakfast tend to eat healthier overall and are more likely to participate in physical activities — two great ways to help maintain a healthy weight. Children who don't eat breakfast often consume more calories throughout the day and are more likely to be overweight. That's because someone who skips breakfast is likely to get famished before lunchtime and snack on high-calorie foods or overeat at lunch.
Having breakfast kick-starts the body's metabolism, the process by which the body converts the fuel in food to energy. And when the metabolism gets moving, the body starts burning calories.

Apart from providing us with energy, breakfast foods are good sources of important nutrients such as calcium, iron and B vitamins as well as protein and fibre. The body needs these essential nutrients and research shows that if these are missed at breakfast, they are less likely to be compensated for later in the day. Fruit and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals so try to include a banana or a glass of juice as part of your child’s daily breakfast.
Skipping breakfast can make children feel tired, restless, or irritable. In the morning, their bodies need to refuel for the day ahead after going without food for 8 to 12 hours during sleep. Their mood and energy can drop by midmorning if they don't eat at least a small morning meal.
Breakfast and brain power 
Just as it is important for children to have breakfast daily, what they eat in the morning is crucial too. Choosing breakfast foods that are rich in whole grains, fiber, and protein while low in added sugar may boost child's attention span, concentration, and memory which they need to learn in school.
Children who have breakfast are more likely to get fiber, calcium, and other important nutrients. They also tend to keep their weight under control, have lower blood cholesterol levels and fewer absences from school, and make fewer trips to the doctor with stomach complaints related to hunger.
Breakfast is also an excellent occasion to eat together as a family when possible. Establishing good breakfast habits in childhood and maintaining them throughout adolescence may be an important factor in reducing the prevalence of breakfast skipping and developing good eating habits that last a lifetime.
So, breakfast really is the most important meal of the day!
