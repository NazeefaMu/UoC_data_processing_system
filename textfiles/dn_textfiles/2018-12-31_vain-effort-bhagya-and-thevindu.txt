Vain effort by Bhagya and Thevindu

Magnificent centuries by Bhagya Dissanayake 142 and an unbeaten 100 runs by Thevindu Senaratne was of no avail as Royal College Colombo could not defeat Dharmaloka Vidyalaya Kelaniya in their inter school first eleven cricket match played at Godigamuwa.
Anyhow Royalists gained a healthy first innings lead of 168 runs in this drawn game.
Bhagya hit five fours and six sixes and occupied the crease for 245 minutes while Thevindu had eight fours and five sixes and faced 96 balls. The pair added 159 runs for the second wicket. Batting first Dharmaloka scored 195 runs and Manula Perera bowled best for the visitors with 4 for 64 and in reply Royalists declared at 363 for 6 with Ishiwara Dissanayake and Kaushan Kulasooriya scoring 46 and 42 runs respectively. In their second essay Dharmaloka were 31 for 1 at the close.
