The transcendental, defiant world of Druvinka Madawala

For the first time since 2012, the work of Sri Lankan native Druvinka Madawala will be displayed in a solo exhibition at the Barefoot Gallery from July 18 to August 5. The upcoming show consists of 46 paintings, each accompanied by a poem written by her friend, Jozie. Druvinka’s work gained prominence after a solo exhibition in Colombo in 1990 and has appeared in Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, and London. However, none of that matters much to the 47-year-old, who spends her days living as a yogi in the mountains of India’s Himachal Pradesh.
With legs half-crossed, and an arm resting lazily over her knee, Druvinka discusses her work in the studio above Barefoot gallery. In the corner of the room, Druvinka’s paintings lean up against a wall, awaiting her final touches.
The paintings are absorbing and other-worldly, though many of them seem dark and ominous with grey, brown, and black colours figuring prominently. But these impressions are false, says Druvinka, because “all colours go into my work, so even if it looks like a dark painting, underneath, if you look, there’s a lot more.” On second glance, darker tones tend to inhabit only the outer edges or epicentres of her paintings and add to the rectangular and circular infinities of the canvas. The collection “is all to do with nature and nothing against it. I believe in evolving and change. Like a snake shedding its skin.”
Druvinka’s art is a clear extension of her lifestyle, “I am a yogi myself. I sit on the ground, I eat once a day.” Druvinka takes an inclusive approach to spirituality, informed by Hindu philosophy, her grandmother’s influence as a Buddhist who practised Hindu rituals, and her mother’s Christian family.
The process of creating her work (in addition to the art itself) is a transcendental one. “It’s like a spirit comes into me and it happens,” she says, “I am just an instrument in a human body.” Druvinka works late at night when “everyone else is sleeping.” She puts her artwork on the floor and works around it, then puts it up against a wall, touching it up. Then back to the floor, then touching it up again, as the process repeats itself. Her pieces are primarily layered tempera, a method of mixing water and colour, though some in this exhibition are pen and ink as well.
Druvinka refrains from describing her work piece by piece, or even from collection to collection, because “what I am comes out. Even I am not in control of it sometimes, when I paint.” Painting is simply a part of Druvinka’s lifestyle, which is reflected in an erratic and sometimes prolific pace of producing art; she can complete anywhere between one and five pieces in a day, and she is always working on a few at a time. “In a year I can do, if I am really working continuously, maybe fifty sixty works. It’s possible,” though, “it depends on the mood and the weather.”
Another of Druvinka’s quirks is her defiance towards labelling her work. She doesn’t title her pieces, “because that becomes a seal. Maybe you don’t see the painting as I do.” At the mention adding a signature, Druvinka recoils—she didn’t want to sign her pieces, but “For artists, documentation, signature and date are important. For me, it’s not.” This is where Druvinka’s artwork clashes with her philosophy, as a person who believes that“You don’t own anything in the world, really.”
Druvinka’s latest exhibition comes at a time when the artist has reached sannyasa, or monk-hood, in her life. She is deeply detached from worldly things, including her own artwork: “I don’t keep my artwork,” she says, “I send it out. You can burn my painting in front of me. I won’t say anything.”
Druvinka’s philosophy is also what draws her away from modern society. She scorns the smartphone (though she has one), all ‘isms,’ including feminism, and environmentalism. She hates passports, gates, locks, barriers, wars, “I don’t think you should have them.” She only has a bank account because it’s necessary.
It’s unsurprising that for her first solo exhibition in several years, Druvinka went back to basics. She focused on the elements of nature, the shivling, the yoni, kundalini, or serpent power, and fire. One painting in the new exhibition captures these interwoven motifs particularly well: against a background of deep blues and splashes of yellow and red colour—an open circle, a yoni, encompasses a shivling. Within the shivling, a collection of shapes and parallel lines frame two intertwined, red snakes. The imagery flows towards the deep red colours at the base of the canvas, which seems to allude towards the culmination of the five elements in the fire. “When you burn wood,” which Druvinka says is a composition of all five elements, “the result of it is dust. That’s what we are. Burn anything it becomes dust.”
