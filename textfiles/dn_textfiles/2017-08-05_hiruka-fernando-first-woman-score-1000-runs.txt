Whilst at school I participated at the Youth Sports Meet and I became the champion. There was an officer from the Ministry of Sports namely Mr. Lakshman and he introduced me to another Sports Officer called Mr. Ranasinghe and he encouraged me to continue athletics. I became the champion athlete at the Colombo Athletic meet and I was sent to the All Island Meet in Matale.

My team mates were Vasanthi Ratnayake, Gayathri Kariyawasam, Chamani Seneviratne and Thanuja Ekanayake. They later went onto represent Sri Lanka. In 1997 I was selected in the first World Cup squad. I had the advantage as I was a left hand opening batswoman. The squad was coached by Guy de Alwis and I toured for the first World Cup to India.
