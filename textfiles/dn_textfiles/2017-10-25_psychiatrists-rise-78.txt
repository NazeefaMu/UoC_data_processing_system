According to Minister Senaratne, one of the most notable achievements was the creation of the Medical Officer for Mental Health (MOMH) cadre in the year 2000. Currently, there are 252 MOMHs working in all districts.
He expressed these views during a success story workshop on promoting mental health and well-being, 'Best practices and lessons learned,' held in Montevideo, Uruguay, recently.
Minister Senaratne said that for the first time, the central government allocated a dedicated budget of Rs. 50 million (325,000 USD) outside the regular budget to the Mental Health Directorate in 2015 and again in 2016, to strengthen mental health services.
The number of districts with acute inpatient units in General Hospitals increased from 10 to 22 health districts since 2005. In other words, 40 percent of districts had such units in 2005 and now 90 percent of districts have such units that are at the district levels the centers from which outreach clinics are organized. The country expanded mental health care almost nation-wide.Today, outreach clinics exist in almost all health divisions (sub-districts) of the country, standing at a total of 215 clinics, the Minister added.
