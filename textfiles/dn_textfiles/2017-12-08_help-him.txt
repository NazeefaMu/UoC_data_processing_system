Help him

W. Asoka Tillakaratne of Pussatota, Weligepola has been suffering from loss of vision on both eyes for nearly 13 years following a motor accident. He says while receiving treatment for loss of vision, he was struck by a debility in both legs.
His sister is also suffering from a hearing debility and the mother who looked after him also passed away. The family is in dire financial straits since the father is sick and bedridden. He says his monthly medical bills amounted to nearly Rs. 5,000 which he could ill afford due to the family's financial plight.
He requests philanthropists and the public to assist his cause by sending whatever financial contributions possible to meet his monthly expenditure on treatment. All contributions should be remitted to account no. 245-2001-2005-6034 at the Peoples Bank, Godakawela branch.
His contact numbers are 0719966935 and 0775574253.
