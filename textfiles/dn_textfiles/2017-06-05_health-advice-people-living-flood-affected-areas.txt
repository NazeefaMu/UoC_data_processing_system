Health advice for people living in flood affected areas

The public should drink boiled and cooled water and eat home- made cooked meals as much as possible. Meals should be eaten immediately after cooking. Food should be stored in cleaned containers and they should completely covered without letting flies to contaminate them.
* The infants below the age of six months should be fed with breast milk ONLY and the infants and children above six months should be fed with breast milk and other clean complementary food. No milk powder should be given to them.
* Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap after using toilets, before cooking meals, before taking meals etc. All fruits and raw vegetables should be thoroughly washed with clean water before consuming. Eating green leaves, salads and other raw vegetables should be discouraged as much as possible during these days.
* People should not get themselves contacted with contaminated flood water because they can be infected with rat fever. Two Doxycycline tablets should be taken and the two tablets will provide immunity against rat fever for a period of two weeks. This should be done by relevant persons who are being forced to get contacted with contaminated flood water or mud.
* Fungal infections can be developed on the skin after being exposed to contaminated flood water. Medical treatment should be sought from health camps / clinics.
* People with diabetes should take an extra precaution about their foot when stepping into flood water because their existing wounds can get infected and new injuries can occur due to cuts etc.
* Wells should be properly cleaned before re-using. Everything required for flood victims such as chlorine, cleaning chemicals, etc are now available with all PHIs and MOHs free of charge.
* People often inhale poisonous fumes while starting generators in order to obtain electricity. They should start generators in open spaces and if anyone inhales a poisonous fume, the patient should be taken into an open space where fresh air is available and seek immediate medical treatment from a hospital.
