Singer Fashion Academy expands branch network

The Singer Fashion Academy, celebrated for teaching the nation the art of sewing and nurturing creative skills among a large number of individuals expanded its branch network recently adding Academies in the towns of Warakapola, Mt. Lavinia, Pilimatalawa and Ruwanwella.
A key arm of the Singer Business School, the Fashion Academy has a proven heritage of over five decades and offers a variety of courses, helping budding entrepreneurs convert their talents and hobbies into establishing their own businesses.
The Fashion Academy conducts classes at 70 Academies located at mainly Singer Plus outlets countrywide offering students’ convenient locations to choose from. As classes are conducted at Singer branches, students attending the courses are assured of a safe and homely environment.
Individual and focused attention is provided to all students to help them develop their skills and create their own imaginative designs. The teaching staff at the Academy are professionals with extensive education and experience and are able to provide current and relevant training to students.
An attractive option for students who have recently completed their Advanced Level Examination and even for housewives, the Singer Fashion Academy offers 25+ courses including two Diploma Programmes. “We believe that anyone who has a desire to learn sewing and acquire new skills can have success in this field and we provide a solid foundation to get started in the industry. Our mission is to give students the skills and knowledge to create and produce their own creations and an opportunity to showcase their work,” said Koshitha Peramunugamage, Head of Singer Business School.
Helping the students showcase their creativity and skills gained from the programmes, the Fashion Academy organises several events. Annually, the Academy hosts a spectacular fashion show, where Diploma Students are afforded fantastic opportunities to showcase their work in a professional setting. At this event students display their own designs categorised into Kandyan, Indian, Sport, Office, Evening and Kids wear.
The Academy’s Needle Painting Exhibition also helps students demonstrate their talent. Regional events such as Mini-Exhibitions are held at Singer Branches where Fashion Academy students can exhibit their creative work.
Organising these platforms the Fashion Academy not only helps the students exhibit their creations but enables them to showcase their talents and build an entrepreneurial mindset paving the way for a successful future.
“The Singer Fashion Academy has been built on a foundation of excellence in training and dedication to the students. We don’t want to simply teach a skill, butalso teach people to be entrepreneurs,” Peramunugamage noted.
