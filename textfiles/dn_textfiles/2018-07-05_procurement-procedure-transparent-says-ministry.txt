LNG plant at Kerawalapitiya:
Procurement procedure transparent, says ministry

The procurement procedure of the proposed 300 megawatt Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant at Kerawalapitiya has been accomplished in a fully transparent manner, the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry stated yesterday.
The statement said the procurement process started for the Kerawalapitiya 300 megawatt LNG plant to be implemented with private sector investment under the ministry policy of introducing LNG plants to the country.
The procurement process had now reached its last stage and a Cabinet paper has been submitted to award the tender to the selected bidder.
However, various parties had been trying to publish false allegations through the electronic and print media in the recent past. In any procurement process, the procurement committee had to take the recommendations of the technical evaluation committee into account before making a decision.
The release said, thereafter, unsuccessful bidders could submit appeals to the procurement appeals committee set up at the Presidential Secretariat. This is the procedure adopted in respect of the 300 megawatt LNG project as well. Unsuccessful bidders had also been notified to submit their appeals to this committee. The procurement appeals committee had accepted the appeal submitted by the institution concerned and reported this matter to the Cabinet on June 12.
The Cabinet paper submitted by the ministry had accepted the recommendations of the procurement appeals committee.
This is the normal procedure adopted in any procurement process and it had been done in a fully transparent manner.
