Do not hold me accountable!

Minister Susil Premajayantha, a seasoned politician who held many important portfolios under two executive presidents has now confined himself to the political activities concerning the SLFP, the main constituent partner of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA). Following his resignation from the post of General Secretary of the UPFA over the National List saga, a dejected Premajayantha now feels he has done enough for the main coalition UPFA to which he served over a decade in the capacity of its General Secretary.
Speaking to the Daily News, he also distanced himself from the allegations of non-payment of money to State-owned media institutions during the last Presidential Election campaign.
Minister Premajyantha holds the Science, Technology and Research ministerial portfolio in the current administration headed by President Maithripala Sirisena after the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP, joined hands to form a National Unity Government.
Q: How do you look back at the last General Election and its results?
A: It was really a close fight between the UPFA and the UNP. However, there had been an unavoidable situation that led to the gap between the UPFA and UNP at the final results. The UPFA as a party did not have a centrally organized campaign, other than the candidates’ individual campaigns. During the past 10 years, of course we have had a strong centrally organized election campaign, but alas, this time I could not see such a campaign taking shape as far as the UPFA is concerned. A huge gap between the two parties was notable concerning election advertising. The clear division in the UPFA took a toll on its vote base, as some of our voters refrained from casting their votes due to this reason. The strategies that we adopted were not sufficient enough to cut a lead figure on the campaign.
Q: Some say that the small parties in the UPFA coalition had been the cause for the erosion in the SLFP vote base. How do you analyse this situation?
A: I don’t agree with that. Other than in the Colombo district, in all other districts the SLFPers led the campaign and they won. Of course in the Colombo district, certain coalition partners had an advantage over SLFPers because of the list. There was no other reason. Five members of the NFF (National Freedom Front) had been accommodated in the list all because of me. As the General Secretary of the UPFA, I wanted to keep all these parties together. Therefore when we prepared the nomination lists for 22 electoral districts we accommodated all these parties and gave them an opportunity.
Q: As the General Secretary of the UPFA since its formation in 2004 until very recently, you had shouldered many national level election campaigns. What was the hardest among them and why?
A: The last two elections were the hardest. The General Election was held on August 17, just seven months after the Presidential election in which the UPFA party candidate lost by 468,000 votes to the Common Candidate. In our country, usually the results of one major election follow through the next election held immediately afterwards. That was the past experience. It happened in 1989, 1994, 2004, 2005 and 2010. In all those instances, the party that won the Presidential Election came to power in the General Election that followed within a couple of months. The same phenomenon followed at this occasion too.
This time there were several intricacies as the Common Candidate, who won the Presidential Election, happened to be the General Secretary of the SLFP for a considerable period and he took over the reins of the party subsequent to his victory as the Common Candidate at the Presidential elections. However, the two camps still remain as it was. That is why the JVP was not successful in their bid. It was a fight between two major camps. Most of the voters did not consider a third force.
Q: Ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa has held the UPFA responsible for the non-payment of bills for advertisements on the ITN during the last Presidential election. How do you respond to this claim?
A: It is true that ex-President Rajapaksa was the candidate of the UPFA. Then the non-payment of bills is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. We have to go into details and comment on it. As I am ready to go before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry tomorrow I do not want to comment on this stage, because I have to make the statement there. (The interview was held a day prior to the minister’s appearance before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry)
However, a similar issue cropped up with regard to the SLTB. I have been sent a letter by the General Manager of the SLTB asking to pay the balance of Rs 140 million for the buses used by the UPFA supporters during the last Presidential election. Then I wrote to them asking as to who placed the order, and whether there was any agreement, and who had paid the advance. They in return stated in a reply that the UPFA had paid a sum of Rs 50 million as an advance. I also received a reply stating that there had been no agreement and the order had been placed by one who heads one of the Election Committees. The orders had been placed not only by that Committee Chairman, but also by several other people from time to time.
The advance of Rs 50 million had been paid in two instalments, Rs 25 million by the Secretary of the SLFP and the balance of Rs 25 million by another person, not by me. I did not have any connection over the placing of order or payment of advance. Accordingly, my lawyers replied to their letter of demand.
Q: Does this imply that the things got out of your hand during the last Presidential election campaign?
A: No, the thing you should know is that usually before we start an election campaign, we have a discussion and then appoint several committees. One committee for advertising, one for media, one for organizing public rallies etc. Once these committees are entrusted with their corresponding jobs, we don’t have any control over them. Those committees were appointed not by me. I have not issued any letter to any committee chairman or member appointing them in those respective positions.
I never touched or approved a cent during both elections on behalf of the party. I was not authorized to do so and I did not get a cent from the party.
We had less than Rs 10,000 in the UPFA bank account until very recent. That money was also deposited by me to open the account at that time. Normally for the Presidential Election, the Elections Commissioner pays 50 cents for each vote received by the major parties. Accordingly, after the election I got a cheque from the commissioner amounting to Rs. 2.9 million for the 5.8 votes received. None of the coalition parties contributed to both our previous election campaigns though they have MPs in Parliament.
Q: If the party cannot bear the responsibility for election expenses, ultimately who should take the blame for the heavy losses incurred by the state institutions due to election-related activities?
A: It is up to those institutions. Speaking with regard to advertisements, the orders were placed not by the individuals. That task was entrusted to one of the advertising companies. It was up to that particular institution to enter into agreement with that advertising company and get the money from them. It is totally a civil transaction.
Q: Do you think the UPFA has the people’s mandate to be a part of the National Unity Government?
A: The people voted us to form a Government. At any election, all the parties, especially the two major parties, contest to form a Government. When none of the parties get absolute majority, what is the next alternative? It is to have a coalition with smaller parties or get a breakaway group from some other party. This time there was a different situation, because the UPFA leader was the President. As the UNP could not get an absolute majority, it could not form a Government without the support of UPFA or a section of it.
On the other hand, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the President has to play a major role forming a Government after the elections. The Prime Minister only nominates the Ministers, but the President has to give the appointment. Therefore, there cannot be a Government without the cohabitation of the both parties led by the President and the Prime Minister.
Q: You were instrumental in giving nominations to ex-President Rajapaksa at the recently concluded election. Now soon after his defeat you have joined with the Government leaving him in the Opposition. Does not this amount to a betrayal?
A: It is a myth. I was not instrumental in giving nomination to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was a collective decision by the entire UPFA with the knowledge of all its leaders.
I should also explain why I resigned. I resigned not before the election, but one week after the election. I was suspended from my position three days before the election, and was prevented from acting as the UPFA General Secretary by the courts. Therefore my hands were tied. From August 14 to 21, until the National List was out, nobody made any comment over the suspension.
Only after releasing the National List, some of the coalition party representatives made some comments. The situation was totally beyond my control, because I was under suspension and I was prevented from making any statements to media. Therefore it was the duty of the coalition parties, especially who were members of the Executive Committee of the UPFA, to go to courts and challenge the suspension and the prohibition. They did not do that.
Not only that, I met all these coalition leaders on August 18. Some coalition partners said they could not trace me. It was absolute falsehood. On the same day, even before counting the preferential votes in the Colombo District, I went to meet the Elections Commissioner with one of the leaders of a constituent party of the UPFA. This discussion was with regard to the National List and placing my signature on it. Therefore they knew very well what our discussion had been with the Commissioner. Knowing all the facts, either they kept silent or allowed their representatives to make allegations against me.
Something similar happened to former parliamentarian Basil Rajapaksa. After the Presidential Election, most of our coalition partners and some political leaders apportioned the blame on him. However my position is that if not for Basil Rajapaksa the gap between the UPFA and the common candidate could have been much more. Then he resigned from his post as the National Organizer. This is not to say that I followed him, but I thought for myself the intricacies coupled with the emerging situation. If somebody wanted to blame me even after seven days of the election, why should I continue in my position? On the one hand there was a suspension and the case was pending, and on the other hand I was blamed publicly without making a proper assessment of the situation and grasping the real facts that led to such a situation.
For the last 10 years, I have handled nomination papers and all the cases against the UPFA by myself for 12 elections including three Presidential Elections, three General Elections, three Provincial Council Elections and three Local Government Elections. There were 173 cases in District Courts, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. None of the coalition partners gave a cent for these cases.
I am sure if not for me and some of our colleagues we would not have got even 95 seats. Therefore, I thought my duty was over for the UPFA and resigned. Thereafter, I decided to confine my politics to the SLFP. Two representatives of two political parties of the UPFA made public accusations against me. They misled the people, especially our supporters. They are still doing it. It may be because every political party or politician has some ambitions. They want to achieve their targets. They may have their own agenda.
Q: Do you think the voters who voted you in the last election expected you to switch allegiances from ex-president Rajapaksa’s camp to President Maithripala Sirisena’s camp?
A: The people voted me because they felt that I have done my job. The SLFP as a party took a decision to have a coalition Government. This is not the first time in our country, where coalition Governments had been made. It is not the SLFPers who criticize us for accepting the positions in the Government.
Q: However, MPs like Bandula Gunawardena, who represent the SLFP, had also severely criticised the move to form a national government. So the criticism also comes from the SLFP members, doesn’t it?
A: Speaking of Bandula Gunawardena, he was first elected to Parliament in 1989 from the MEP. Then he lost in 1994 because the MEP contested separately. Then he was again elected in 2000 representing the MEP, but crossed over to the UNP and held portfolios of Ranil Wickremesinghe’s Government in 2001 until 2004. In 2004, he was elected from the UNP. Then in 2007 while representing the UNP he joined Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Government and accepted portfolios. He contested under the UPFA only in 2010.
In all the occasions I mentioned above, he took his personal decisions. However, today’s situation is far different. We have not taken individual decisions, but a party decision. That is the difference between Bandula Gunawardena and those who accepted ministerial posts of the coalition Government.
Q: Are you satisfied with the ministerial post you received?
A: I never asked for one particular subject. Since 2000, I have held so many portfolios. This is a different field, where I have to work mostly together with academics and professionals. So I like it.
