THE LEGACY OF PROFESSOR E.F.C. LUDOWYK AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROMISE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CEYLON
Intellectual seat of inspiration

The Ludowyk Memorial Lecture delivered by Tissa Jayatilaka at the University of Peradeniya on January 17.
“Elegy for Peradeniya” – Ashley HalpéAh, chaste permitted wilderness below our housecomplete with winding walks and warbling streamdesigned to breed debate and poetrynursery of our love, it has come,the never-expected, unimaginabledate of our departure.

This beautiful and moving elegy, I consider a fitting prelude to my words and thoughts in memory of the magister magistrorum, Evelyn Frederick Charles Ludowyk, Professor of English of the Ceylon University College and the University of Ceylon from 1936 – 1956. I did not have the good fortune of being a student of the great man but nearly all of my teachers at school and University and several of my close senior friends are those who directly benefited from him during what is now nostalgically looked upon as the heyday of our alma mater. Hence I could claim to be a product of the Ludowyk legacy.
Prof. E. F. C. Ludowyk
During the next several minutes I propose to piece together a sketch of the life and career of Professor Ludowyk on the basis of all that I have learnt from some of his students and colleagues, and then explore the impact of Professor Ludowyk on the country as a whole besides nourishing the University of Ceylon and the fortunate few there. In conclusion, this being soon after the 75th anniversary of our University founded by his colleague Sir Ivor Jennings, in the building up of which institution, they both played such invaluable roles, I shall give you an overview of the promise and performance of the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, this ‘. . . dear perpetual place’, that was ‘designed to breed debate and poetry’ to use Ashley Halpe’s apt and expressive words to describe the beloved institution.
Professor Ludowyk was an outstanding product of Richmond College, Galle, where he acquired most of his primary and secondary education. He spent two years at Wesley College, Colombo, prior to entering the Ceylon University College. As my wish is to not let this moment pass without basking in a little bit of reflected glory, I note for the record that I had the better part of my own secondary education at Kingswood College, Kandy, which together with Richmond and Wesley are the three premier boys’ schools in the island established by the Wesleyan Mission.
First Ceylonese Professor of English
Professor Ludowyk entered the Ceylon University College having, as he himself put it in his reminiscences of The English Department, 1921- 1956, ‘had the good fortune of working with the Rev. H. Highfield, a Wordsworthian if ever there was one’. Rev. Highfield known to Wesleyites as ‘The Saint of Karlshrue’ was the legendary 7th principal of Wesley College for three decades (1895 -1925). ‘To have been a student of Highfield’s’, Ludowyk continues to tell us, ‘was to have been conducted almost personally, into the literature of 18th century England which was Wordsworth’s true background’. At University College the young Ludowyk came under the tutelage of Professors Leigh Smith and David Hussey. Having secured a first class from the University of London, he proceeded to Cambridge in 1929 to read for part 11 of the English Tripos, where he achieved a first in English and won the Oldham Prize for Shakespeare in 1931. This was a time of momentous change in English Studies at Cambridge introduced by three scholars of great originality, I.A. Richards, Mansfield Forbes and F.R. Leavis, which in turn had an impact on all university courses in English.
Having come under the influence of these notables, he returned home in 1932, taught briefly at Richmond College before taking up duties as lecturer in English at the University College, Colombo. With the departure of Leigh Smith, David Hussey was now Professor. Later on, having secured his Ph.D. from Cambridge, Ludowyk became, at thirty, the first Ceylonese Professor of English in 1936. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1940. Having served in the post of professor for 20 years, he resigned and left for England in 1956. It is interesting to remember that both Sir Ivor Jennings and Professor Ludowyk left Peradeniya almost around the same time.
Qualities as a teacher
His students have spoken glowingly of Lyn Ludowyk the teacher and the man. The material from his students is plentiful, and I was tempted to let them speak for themselves. I have tried not to resist the temptation. My Principal at Kingswood and later a member of the Council of our University, the late Kenneth de Lanerolle, one of Professor Ludowyk’s earliest students, tells us that,
The arrival of Lyn Ludowyk into this homely scene [of University College of the early 1930s] was an event. As you enter the Arts Block, on the right of the porch is a row of classrooms, whose partitions could be collapsed to make a sizeable hall. Here, you found it easy to get a friend to answer to your name at roll-call. Here J.L.C Rodrigo traced the outlines of Roman History and when this proved dull (as it often did) we would turn our attention to the flocks of sparrows on the window sills and wonder at their unashamed amours. And here it was that Ludowyk made his debut.
David Hussey was good and Hector Passé was correct, but we found Lyn Ludowyk an altogether new experience. When he spoke that day, and on subsequent days to us, Inter-Arts and B.A students, whether it was on Chaucer or Shakespeare, we found his message winged with meaning. He put us on our mettle and gave us undergrads a sense of dignity.
Ashley Halpé has spoken eloquently of the modesty, generosity and civility of the man and testified to Professor Ludowyk’s wonderful qualities as a teacher, who was at one and the same time, ‘the most demanding and the most appreciative of tutors’.
Ian Goonetileke, in his Preface to Ludowyk’s Those Long Afternoons. Childhood in Colonial Ceylon, tells us of his “honesty, compassion, and an attractive, often mischievous, sense of humour—virtues he possessed in abundant measure [that] shine through these pages’. Ludowyk’s sense of humour is aptly demonstrated in two anecdotes that Fred Abeyesekere shares with us. Abeyesekere writes:
Ludo had set us one of his weekly tutorials and we were left to our own devices, to do or perish! A colleague of mine had gone to town, snaring up volume after volume of Scrutiny to the consternation of Librarian Enright! His, had then to be a very comprehensive answer.
There was no doubt about it. A day or two later Ludo, in characteristic style, read out our grades - most of us oscillating between Cs and Bs with a dramatically announced solitary A+! There was much excitement as an A from Ludo meant that one was almost of the calibre of F.R. Leavis! Loaded with drama, he went onto explain that this was truly great, a very excellent effort and continued, as at the climactic point in a play, that he was not aware until then that Mr. Allen Tate was a member of his class! Mr. Allen Tate had scored an A+, and my colleague (the Scrutiny man), naught. (Not even a D-, which usually put us in the dog house).
On one occasion when the dashing Gregory Peck was at the Royal Botanical Gardens, taking part in a film which was being shot there, some feminine admirers decked in their ‘Sunday best’ had dared to cut Ludo’stute class at 8.00 am. They returned around 8.45 am and gingerly tiptoed their way to the back of Ludo’s class, mercifully unseen by him as he was scribbling something on the blackboard. Suddenly he twirled his spectacles, faced the class, smiled a most benevolent smile and merely pronounced: ‘”Ladies! One must choose between Lyn and Peck.”
Godfrey Gunatilleke tells us more about Prof. Ludowyk’s particular style of teaching in which reading out some passage of poetry or creative prose was a crucial part. They were, Gunatilleke tells us, ‘as it were, “moments in and out of time”. . . ‘. ‘Listening to him’, adds Gunatilleke, we participated in the primal sorrow in Hardy’s ‘The Voice’, the irreparable loss of the loved one, “heard no more again far or near”, the infinite sadness at the transience of beauty and self in Hopkins’ ‘Spring and Fall’; the tragic self-realization of Lear “bound upon a wheel of fire”; the mature comedy in a passage from Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Tales’, restoring us to a wholesome sanity, giving us the emotional resilience to face life. . . Through his reading we became intuitively aware that good literature chastened and purified the inner self, that it was life-giving and brought us closer to the well-springs of human experience. It is indeed a great pity that we have no recording of Ludowyk’s readings. Having listened to many readings by world-renowned actors and famous literary personalities –whether they be of Shakespeare or T. S. Eliot or other poets – I still recall Ludowyk’s readings as unrivalled in their capacity to unfold the intricate pattern of meaning and the inner drama of a poem or piece of creative writing.
As fulsome as is the praise of his students, the beneficiaries of Lyn Ludowyk were not just the fortunate few who read English at the time. His influence and reach were University-wide and spilt over to the wider community outside as well. Bernard Soysa, a close associate of his and a notable politician of an earlier period in our country when our parliament was not so full of mediocrities and dishonest men and women as today, has written warmly of Ludowyk’s contribution to the national politics of the day. Ludowyk was too scrupulous and sufficiently fastidious as to not seek membership of any political party but, on available evidence, one could conclude that he contributed to political causes he believed in from his particular vantage point.
South East and South Asian societies
Interesting as this political diversion is, I wish to focus on Ludowyk’s significant contribution to the nourishment of Sinhala Studies in our country, especially to Sinhala literary criticism and Sinhala drama. His contribution to the department of English, English Studies and English drama is too well known and does not require re-telling here. The popular or, more accurately perhaps, the prejudiced view of ill-formed critics of the time was that Professor Ludowyk and those of his background ‘lacked roots in the native soil’ and that they were aloof from anything outside the department of English. This misperceived and undeserved criticism needs to be corrected by situating it in its context.
During the last phase of British colonialism beginning in the 20th century, a militant nationalism was discernible in India in particular and in certain other South East and South Asian societies including our own. Whilst this hostility of the militant nationalists of Ceylon to colonialism was understandable, their inability to distinguish between the different categories of the English educated Ceylonese of the day is lamentable. From all that can be gleaned, some of the English-educated intelligentsia displayed a degree of aloofness. The best of them, however, as exemplified by Professor Ludowyk himself and those of his more sensitively intelligent students – Godfrey Gunatilleke, C. R. (Dick) Hensman, Douglas Walatara, R.C.L. Attygalle, Izeth Hussein, Reggie Siriwardene, Gananath Obeyesekere, Ranjini Ellepola Obeyesekere, Ashley Halpé, Yasmine Gooneratne, G.K. Haththotuwegama, Saratchandra Wickramasuriya and Thiru Kandiah to name but a few– show us that such aloofness was by no means the norm. As to the stimulus given by Ludowyk and some of his products directly or indirectly to writers and critics in Sinhalese, let me first let the great man speak for himself. Here is what Professor Ludowyk tells us in an essay titled ‘The East West Problem in Sinhalese Literature’:
It has often been said of English in Ceylon, that despite the hundred-odd years of its use in schools and by that small class known as the English educated, it has produced hardly anything which could be dignified by the name of literature. This criticism is, however, mistaken. The fruitful results of English have to be sought elsewhere – in the effect it has had on writing in Sinhalese. Within a limited scope it has influenced both the Sinhalese language and its literature. It has done something to create a group of professional writers in Sinhalese, a group which hardly existed before. Imperceptibly, yet none the less definitely, English has made a considerable difference to writing in Sinhalese.
In the cross fertilization of Sinhalese and English Literature, Ludowyk played a pivotal role. As stated above, being at Cambridge at a time of momentous change, he was influenced by the fresh winds then blowing through English Studies at that ancient seat of learning. Modern methods of evaluating literary writing with their emphasis on practical criticism associated with I.A. Richards and the close reading and understanding of a poem, play or novel (criticism as the scrutiny of ‘words on the page’) set in motion by F.R. Leavis and his colleagues replaced the earlier approach with its emphasis on philology, grammar and the socio-economic and historical background of a literary creation. In the decades of the 1930s, 1940s and until the mid- 1950s under the leadership of Robert Marrs at the University College and Doctor (later Sir) Ivor Jennings at the University of Ceylon, our higher education had begun to flourish and move in new directions setting high intellectual standards in the process. This was the period when men like Lyn Ludowyk, Gunapala Malalasekere, Hector Passé, Doric de Souza, Cuthbert Amerasinghe, M.D. Ratnasuriya, O.H. de A. Wijesekere, Ediriwira Sarachchandra, D.E. Hettiarachchi, Ian Goonetileke, K.W. Goonewardene et al made their formidable intellectual presence felt, both in and outside of the university.
Their products began carrying the new knowledge thus acquired, and through it the new ways of seeing the world, into the wider society as teachers in secondary schools spread across the country. Consequently there came into being a new generation of formally educated citizens who began to question existing values and ideas based on conventional wisdom. This was also the period when a segment of our citizens notably Ananda Samarakone, Sunil Shantha, Makaloluwa, Chitrasena and Amaradeva were making an impact on the cultural renaissance of our country having benefited from Rabindranath Tagore and the congenial learning environment he had created at Shanthiniketan and from other Indian institutions of advanced training in Dance and Music. Although on a different plane, this era also saw the emergence of artists like Lionel Wendt, Harry Peiris, George Claessen, Justin Deraniyagala, George Keyt, Manjusri and Richard Gabriel of the ’43 Group. Their work, too, was suffused with a fresh vigour combining meaningfully, as it did, the idioms of the East and West.
Young professors of English and Sinhala
It is in the above-delineated environment that we see the fruitful academic collaboration of the young professors of English and Sinhala, the first Ceylonese to hold these positions, Lyn Ludowyk and Dharmasiri Ratnasuriya, of the University of Ceylon. They both had lived and studied in England in their formative years. Ratnasuriya like Ludowyk, Amaradasa Virasinha tells us, was an unassuming and modest personality who shunned the limelight.
His untimely death before he could make his mark as fully as Ludowyk was able to, may also account for why very few know of the pioneering role Ratnasuriya played in the founding of a modern Sinhala literary critical tradition in Sri Lanka, an enterprise in which both Ludowyk and Ratnasuriya combined so effectively. Their own close academic partnership led to the formation of creative partnerships among their students. Of them, the joint effort of Dharmasiri Ekanayaka, Amaradasa Virasinha and S.G. Samarasinghe who read for Honours degrees in Sinhala, is significant. Of these three Dharmasiri Ekanayake, who read Sinhala (1947-1950) with English as his subsidiary subject stands out.
These were the three students who founded the literary journal Samskriti in 1953 in memory of Professor Dharmasiri Ratnasuriya. Ekanayaka had by now entered the Ceylon Civil Service. Despite his manifold labours as a civil servant, his contribution to Samskriti and to the establishment of a modern Sinhala literary critical tradition was immense. From its founding in 1953, Samskriti had a seminal influence on the local literary scene until about the early 1970s, as Scrutiny founded by F.R. Leavis had in the English-speaking world from 1932-1953 in particular and thereafter as well. Samskriti was a boon to senior school students and undergraduates of the bilingual intelligentsia of our country. Professor K.N.O. Dharmadasa in an essay written in 2004 (cited by Chinataka Ranasinghe in a special issue of Samskriti in April 2011), writes on the significance of Samskriti and its kinship to Scrutiny.
Dharmasiri Ekanayaka’s familiarity with both the Sinhala and English literary critical traditions in combination with Amaradasa Virasinha’s extensive familiarity with the indigenous tradition enabled them to feed off each other’s specialized knowledge as Virasinha tells us in the April 2011 issue of Samskriti. The splendid results of this intellectual bond between Ekanayaka and Virasinha are to be seen in their offerings in Samskriti and in the former’s posthumous book, Sahithyaya Ha Vichara Kalawa (2012).
With the departure of Amaradasa Virasinha to the United States in 1970, Samskriti lost its guiding spirit. After nearly three decades, Virasinha returned to Sri Lanka and sought to revive the journal. Although Ekanayaka gave every possible encouragement to Virasinha and was enthusiastic about a fresh involvement with Samskriti, his ill-health did not permit him to do so. An incurable stomach ailment yet dogged him which, in addition to his own disillusionment with the public service, had compelled him to take leave of his civil service career prematurely in 1979, at the age of 51.
By 2000, Virasinha’s own health had begun to deteriorate. It was at this stage that Dr. G. Usvatte-Aratchi and Susil Sirivardana stepped into the breach and together with a younger group of academics and aficionados of literature came to Virasinha’s assistance. In addition to reviving Samskriti, a key project these revivalists devoutly wished to accomplish was the publication of a book containing all of Dharmasiri Ekanayaka’s most valuable contributions to Samskriti beginning in 1953. Sadly, however, before the publication could see the light of day, Dharmasiri Ekanayaka passed on, on September 22, 2010, aged 82.
Sahithiyaya Ha Vichara Kalawa which finally came off the press in 2012, is a collection of Dharmasiri Ekanayaka’s excellent essays in literary criticism. It contains, among other writings, his reviews of A.P. Gunaratne’s translation of Leonard Woolf’s The Village in the Jungle, titled, Beddegama, Martin Wickramasinghe’s short stories, W.A. Silva’s Avichara Samaya, Siri Gunasinghe’s Hevanella, Ediriwira Sarachchandra’s Malagiya Aththo and Anton Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard that has been rendered into Sinhala as Cherry Watte. In addition there is a notable and insightful essay written in 1963 titled Ingrisi Vichara Kalawa Ha Sinhala Sahithyaya in which Ekanayaka notes that universal human values cut across societies and cultures, and that it is perfectly valid to use English literary critical principles to judge Sinhala literature.
