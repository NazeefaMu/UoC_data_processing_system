Over 1,700 micro-enterprises for North and East

Plans are afoot to establish 1,785 micro-enterprises in the Northern and Eastern Provinces under the Enterprise Based Village Development Project, said National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy. This was initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the National Integration and Reconciliation Minister, with the concurrence of the Cabinet of Ministers on February 28.
The objective of establishing micro-enterprises in the Northern and Eastern Provinces is to improve the socio-economic standards of the conflict-affected communities, and to address poverty and regional disparities in the lagging areas.
It is proposed to establish micro-enterprises in 113 villages in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and the project will be supported by a concessionary micro-finance funding through the Regional Development Bank and SANASA. The total estimated cost is Rs. 446 million. Each Micro enterprise will receive a maximum assistance of Rs. 250,000.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary Mr.V.Sivagnanasothy said that 25% of the estimated cost of each micro-enterprise initiative will be supported through a matching grant whereas 75% will be under loan, and that the interest will also be backed by the Government funds.
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) chaired by former President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will give leadership to implement these projects.
The projects will contribute towards the alleviation of poverty, and serve as a healing and reparation program to empower families affected by war.
