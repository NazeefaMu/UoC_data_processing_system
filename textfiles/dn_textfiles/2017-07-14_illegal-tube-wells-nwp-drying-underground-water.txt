Illegal tube wells in NWP drying up underground water

Private firms have dug deep tube wells in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province illegally.
It has led to the drying up of underground water fountains, residents complain.
It has led to grave destruction of underground water fountains and affected the shortage of drinking water within the province. At present, there are nearly 75,000 tube wells countrywide.
Out of them, only 50,000 tube wells are dug by the Water Resources Board. The rest of the wells are dug illegally by unauthorized firms.
This is prohibited by the government gazette notification dated 16.03.2016.
However, this activity is being carried out countrywide. The government has not given permission to any private firm to dig deep tube wells so far.
“If anyone comes to know of illegal tube wells, inform the nearest police station immediately as it is illegal,” said the Chairman of the Water Resources Board in Kurunegala A. C. M. Sulfikar.
