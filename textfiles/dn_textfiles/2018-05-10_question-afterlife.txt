The question of afterlife

This refers to the letter in the Citizen’s Mail by G. A. D. Sirimal on May 7. For me, Buddhism differs from all other religions. It stresses the utmost urgency in terminating the rebirth process (afterlife) here and now.
The urgency was such that Prince Siddhartha who became the Buddha, could not even wait till the next morning to find the solution to the problem of suffering, for he realized what was in store for him. As such, for me, the question of afterlife is irrelevant and I have devoted my entire life for full time meditation for the single purpose of ending of Samsara (continuation of life) – here and now because there is no choice!
