Legal action against poachers in Udawalawa

‘Stern legal action would be taken against poachers who kill wild animals for meat in the Udawalawe National Park,’ Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said.
She was addressing a meeting attended by heads of provincial local government institutions at the Governor’s Auditorium in Ratnapura on December 19.
Weligapola Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Kelum Helapalla complained that carcasses of elk, deer and porcupine which were killed in the park were being transported in vehicles by poachers through the Balangoda - Handagiriya road while requesting to take quick action against these illegal activities.
Governor Ekanayake said that steps would be taken to set up a police post on the Handagiriya road. Chief Secretary D. M. Malini, Governor's Secretary Herath P. Kularatne, Chief Ministry Secretary Sriyani Padmalatha and other officials were also present on the occasion.
