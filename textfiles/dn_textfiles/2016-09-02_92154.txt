Gammanpila like a parrot clamouring  for attention  - UPFA Gen. Secy.

 
United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila was like a ‘pethappu.’
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the comments made by UPFA MP Gammanpila on late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s policies.
MP Gammanpila had said that the SLFP was created to break up parties.
Minister Amaraweera said MP Gammanpila simply uttered baseless allegations like a parrot with the intention of gaining cheap political advantage.
He questioned as to whether there was any value to the publicity afforded to MP Gammanpila, as he was without any proper party affiliation or adherents.
Preparations have now being finalised to celebrate the 65th Anniversary of the SLFP in Kurunegala on September 4 on a grand scale. This year’s rally would be the most outstanding of all rallies held by the SLFP in terms of mass people participation, said Fisheries Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the preparations of the SLFP anniversary celebrations.
“We have also invited the members of UPFA and also former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to participate at the anniversary celebrations,” he said.
Minister Amaraweera said that all SLFPers at grassroots level, have realized the real political situation in the country and was now rallying around the party.
“This is the nature of the SLFPers and when there is an attempt of dividing the party, they rise and team up with greater strength and vigour whenever sinister attempts are been made by distinguished elements to break up the party,” he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the recent statement by UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila on late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike’s policy, Minister Amaraweera said that he acts like a “Pethappu” and just makes baseless allegations with the intention of gaining political advantage.
