NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM A GREAT VICTORY FOR PEOPLE: PRESIDENT

President Maithripala Sirisena said he would take measures to conduct the forthcoming Local Government elections according to the new electoral system replacing the Preferential System as the new system was a great victory afforded to all sections of the people in the country.
Notwithstanding the objections of certain parties, we took the initiative to hold the next Local Government elections under the Ward System in the interests of the people at large, irrespective of party differences,” the President said.
The President emphasized that he is dedicated to take necessary measures to replace the Preferential System of elections with the new system at the next Parliamentary election too.
President Maithripala Sirisena made this observation when he met SLFP members of the North Central Provincial Council for a discussion at his official residence on Saturday.
The discussion centred on measures to strengthen the SLFP to ensure victory at future elections and finding solutions to existing problems confronting the Provincial Councils.
Speaking further, President Sirisena said due to the current Preferential System of elections, politicians tended to place self before the country and work for personal victory.
“This had prevented the country from achieving the victories envisaged by the people. As such he took the initiative and leadership to ensure that the forthcoming local elections is held according to the ward system in place of the current preferential system,” the President said.
The President said he believed that all elections should be held according to a single system in the country. Necessary steps were also being taken to conduct the future Provincial Council elections too according to the electorate basis.
Replacing the Preferential System with the electorate system was a fundamental pledge offered to the people by him at the 2015 Presidential elections.
The President would take the initiative to introduce a new political culture on behalf of the people by introducing the electoral system of elections in place of the preferential system.
