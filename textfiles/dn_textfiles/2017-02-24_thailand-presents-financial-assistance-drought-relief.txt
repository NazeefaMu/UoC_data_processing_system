Thailand presents financial assistance as drought relief

Nopporn Adchariyavanich, Ambassador of Thailand to Sri Lanka, met with Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, to hand over a cheque for the amount of Rs 8,496,176.72 (or approximately 2,000,000 baht) which is a donation from the Royal Thai Government as disaster relief for the drought in Sri Lanka, particularly the expected shortage of food and water in the next 1-2 months.
On this occasion, Minister Samaraweera extended his heartfelt appreciation to the Royal Thai Government for the kind assistance, which is the first country that rendered financial aid to Sri Lanka for tackling the upcoming drought crisis in Sri Lanka, and said he will inform Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka, of the generous help from Thailand.
Ambassador Nopporn reiterated that Sri Lanka is a very close friend of Thailand, and the two countries have been bound by Buddhism. Ambassador Nopporn hoped Sri Lanka can successfully cope with the drought crisis. In addition, Ambassador Nopporn stated that many decades ago, the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej invented an artificial rain-making technique, which has long been used in many areas in Thailand that were affected by the severe drought condition; although, there are some certain conditions of the weather required before operating such a technique.
In this regard, Ambassador Nopporn suggested that Sri Lanka may seek cooperation from Thailand in this matter.
