Egg imports not needed

Since adequate stocks of locally produced eggs will be available for the avurudu, no permits will be issued for the import of eggs in the immediate future, Department of Animal Production and Health Director Genaral Nihal Wedisinghe said.
This follows a directive from Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison, after he was informed of the availability of locally produced stocks for the festival season, Wedisinghe said.
This decision had been conveyed to the Sri Lanka Ports authority and the Sri Lanka Customs.
