Ready to face NCM against me - Sampanthan

Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said that he was prepared to face a no confidence motion, should one be moved against him by the Joint Opposition.
 Addressing a press conference in Jaffna, Sampanthan said that the Joint Opposition might move a no confidence motion against him, accusing him for voting in favour of the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. “It is neither ethical nor the parliamentary tradition to bring a no confidence motion against an opposition leader. I think that nowhere in the world has an opposition leader faced a no confidence motion”, he said. He further said that if a no confidence motion is brought against him, he was ready to face it.
“If the joint opposition brings a no-confidence motion against me for supporting the Prime Minister, I am ready to face it”, he said. He noted that the national government led by the President and the Prime Minister now should focus on swift constitutional reforms.
