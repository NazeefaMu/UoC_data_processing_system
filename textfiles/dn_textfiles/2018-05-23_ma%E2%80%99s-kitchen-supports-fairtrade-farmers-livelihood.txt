MA’s Kitchen supports Fairtrade Farmers Livelihood

Built and grown based on the values of fairtrade, MA’s Kitchen, one of the country’s most trusted food processor highlighted the importance of continuously supporting and integrating fairtrade practices to create better livelihoods in recognition of World Fair Trade Day.
Fair Trade Day is commemorated annually worldwide in the month of May, as a tangible contribution to sustainable development, especially the economic empowerment of small producers through decent working conditions, responsible production practices and better livelihoods.
For over three decades MA’s Kitchen has been consciously promoting development opportunities for farming communities, improving market access paying fair prices to their products.
As the proud recipient of the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation’s Fairtrade Certification, MA’s Kitchen is certified for processing fairtrade materials and manufactures fairtrade certified coconut milk, curry pastes and other food ingredients for consumers around the globe.
During the past year, MA’s Kitchen had facilitated over Rs 2 million in fair trade premiums to their supplier farmer organisation showcasing the company’s commitment where farmers receive fair prices on their products and a sustainable working environment.
As they have guided the formation of the Sustainable Agri Farm Enterprise Network (SAFENET), a network of over 100 farmers in the South and Central parts of Sri Lanka who are also fairtrade certified and with the company’s assistance carry our fairtrade practices.
The MA’s Foods Factory in Dambulla produces a wide range of spices, processed foods and seasonings.
The company also has an organic certified estate and an animal husbandry farm, trailing sustainable meat production practices in Matale and a recent start-up processing project working with local farmers in the northern districts based in Kilinochchi promoting integrated organic agriculture.
With an aim to improve food security and reduce vulnerability of farmers, MA’s Kitchen supports the development of thriving farming communities in surrounding areas with over 200 registered in their new Northern Project.
Helping the farmers become economically stable and reliable suppliers, MA’s Foods also provides training to the farmers on improving productivity and crop quality.
MA’s Foods has also been successful in mobilising their customers towards the ethos of fairtrade. A long standing customer of the company donated solar panels to spice supplier farmers in Matale district. These solar panels ensure the farmers receive continuous electricity supply reducing their daily costs and reliance on fossil fuels and also providing a safer light source to some hard to reach farmer areas.
These solar panels were donated with the proceeds of sales made from the curry paste product which includes spices grown by these spice famers.
MA’s Kitchen curry pastes was launched in Netherlands in 2016 under the customer’s own brand. Subsequently, the export company also gained support for this project from several supermarkets who stock their products.
