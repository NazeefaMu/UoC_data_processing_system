Lost  in love

Epa yali hamuvanna jeevithe gaman maga
Oben mata uruma vu vedana kandulu ganga
Hiru sinasena lovaka pethum mal deveta langa
Obe jivana suvanda aran ethata yanna
Sansara gaman maga senahasa soya dineka
Aa gamana nima kala obe hadavatha gava
Senahase avasana kandulu binduvaka pahasa
Gala yayi atheethe miyaedunu sohona langa
Oba mavetha thilina kala obe betibara suvanda
Mae mathakaya vasa sadakal rendenu etha
Sansaraye yalindu navathane soya yana
Mage malagamadaata evith yannata enna
Voice: Sunil Edirisinghe
Lyrics: Dishan Nanayakkara
Music: Karunaratne Wijewardena
What could be your honest feeling if you have ever lost in love? What could be the thought-stream of someone who has lost in love like? For most people, a loss in love is end of one whole lifetime. The protagonist of this song hates that painful feeling. He looks forward to no more such painful feelings in times to come. Although his world is gloomy without the presence of even sun and moon, he would not wish the same for his love. He wants all her aspirations to come true. He is quite familiar with her fragrance, but wants her to take that away too.
Recorded in 2006, this song was later included in the CD titled as ‘Mata Mavak Lesin’. The CD contains songs by the veteran vocalists such as Victor Ratnayake, Karunaratne Divulgane, Deepika Priyadarshani, Bandara Athavuda, Nirmala Ranatunga, Samantha Perera and Somasiri Medagedara. At first, this song was broadcast on the national radio service. That drew quite a large response to this song. Then it drew even a larger response with the awakening of the social media in 2007. And today, the song has entered the hearts of millions of fans.
The popularity of the song could be accredited to Sunil Edirisinghe’s soft yet deep and resonant voice. And Karunaratne Wijewardana’s melodious music has also been instrumental in making the song popular.
Sunil Edirisinghe needs no particular introduction among the Sinhala listener base. He has earned a covetous benchmark for his careful selection of songs. That very same reason has led to certain monotony among his music. But he scores in lyrics as well as his voice. He has been fortunate enough to muster the support of classical lyricists such as Karunaratne Saputanthri, Bandara Eheliyagoda and Kularatne Ariyawansa. If someone tends to think that classical generation is fading away, let them cross that thought out for we have Dishan Nanayakkara who is brilliant in metaphor and poetry in the serious business of lyric writing.
Out of lyrics, voice and music, the most difficult part should be the lyrics part. But then the lyricist has to be satisfied with the role of an unsung hero.
Most songwriters will tell you that chorus lyrics often happen rather easily, but it’s the cursed verse lyrics that take forever. And for some, even after spending days, weeks or even months on the verse, it can still sound like a mess. There’s a simple reason for that, and it has to do with the differing nature of verse and chorus lyrics. While the chorus simply needs to express emotions, the verse needs to describe a somewhat coherent story or set of circumstances that all lead to an emotional response.
And getting that story right is the main challenge. For multi-verse songs (which is most songs), it’s often the second verse that presents even bigger problems than verse. How do you split a story up between the first verse and the second verse?
The fact is that even though we often describe lyrics as “telling a story”, in fact it’s really describing a situation more so than telling a story. And in fact, if the song lyrics are telling a story, the job of writing the lyric may not be so hard. It’s pretty clear in those kinds of songs the order of events.
But a large number of songs use the verse to describe a circumstance, so that the verse is saying, “Here’s what I am going through right now.” The chorus that follows that will usually put an emotional response to that front and centre.
