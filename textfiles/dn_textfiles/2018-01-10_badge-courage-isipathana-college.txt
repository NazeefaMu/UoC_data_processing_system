Badge of courage Isipathana College

Those that have worked under Head Boy of Isipathana Janith Pasindu know the kind of boundless energy that he possesses. And the fervor he can inspire in his followers. Perfect Prefects features Janith Pasindu who can rally those under him to pursue any dream no matter how difficult it may seem at first and then lead them to victory. Because your dreams are so special and valuable.
Pasindu points out that he is an admirer of Che Guevara, saying that it is the attitude, determination and bravery of Che that he admires. Possibly it is Che’s capacity to dream that really inspires this love Pasindu has for him. Che had this tremendous youthful vigor that enabled him to pursue his dreams. And as mentioned before chasing after dreams is Pasindu’s specialty. If necessary he will devote his entire life to it!
Magnitude
“As a leader directing a large student body, the first thing I do is take the correct decisions at the right time, by planning the outcome beforehand. Yes it’s a big challenge but I have got a lot of patience. The magnitude of the problem does not bother me. What I do is delegate responsibilities and then lead them to success,” said Pasindu.
Pasindu’s forte is his optimism. Problems do not discourage him. He faces his problems by simply being organized.
“My game plan is very simple but effective. Firstly I try hard to understand the problem as fast as I can. Secondly I try solve it myself. If that fails, I ask elder people such as parents and teachers. Then I examine other angles and look at other ways to solve the problem. Then I choose the best way to solve it,” stated Pasindu.
Isipathana a fiercely competitive school has taught him how to be brave and how to be disciplined. It has brought him to the place where he is now. Sri Lanka is not enough for this youngster. He has set his sights on the world.
Future ambition
“I would like to make a difference in this competitive world by making a considerable change in myself first. I am going to change the attitudes of men because the attitudes of people are the major and the most successful method of changing the world to becoming a better place. My future ambition is to be a biotech engineer and my ultimate goal is to initiate biotech companies using my knowledge and leadership skills and become a worthy citizen to my country,” pointed out Pasindu.
Pasindu sees the world in a crisis. He points out that one major problem in the world is environmental pollution such as garbage problems. He wants to use his leadership skills to address this issue. No doubt his leadership skills are honed through the activities he has taken part in at school.
“Yes of course. I participate in every event at the sports meet because participating is as valuable as winning. And I also participate in the inter school gymnastic tournaments where I have won a lot of trophies. Sports is not just winning it’s a mixture of discipline, courage, leadership and cooperation with others,” argued Pasindu.
Determination
Pasindu believes in overcoming ones problems and not trying to escape from them. He feels that you should fight as strongly as possible and never give up when it comes to achieving your goals. Pasindu believes in facing the challenges with courage and determination while not forgetting to listen to others. He believes in serving his country with honor. Listening to Pasindu talk one sees a lot of Che Guevara in him.
Pasindu’s favorite movies are ‘Never Back Down’ and ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’. ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’ is a story which inspires you to pursue your dreams no matter what others say, and protect it. The best book he has ever read is ‘As a Man Thinketh’. It is a classic which explains how your thoughts mold your personality and how your personality drives you to take actions and determines the kind of choices you take.
He also dreams of traveling to Rome and soak up the culture. Pasindu is a true fan of aesthetics and admires the elegance and artistry of Italy.
He thanks his parents for helping him get over the hardships in his life and also his principal, teachers and friends for standing by him and helping him to get where he is today. Again dream as big as you want!
