The Society of Structural Engineers, Sri Lanka (SSE-SL) held its Annual Sessions 2018 with the patronage of Tokyo Cement Group on August 14 at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.
The event was the platform for key research findings and knowledge sharing and focused the limelight on the highly-coveted field of structural engineering in Sri Lanka at a time when the country is on wave of a ground breaking infrastructural developments.
The Annual Sessions is held with the broader objective of creating a culture of scientific research to spur on innovation in structural engineering. Over 150 delegates of the construction community comprising of civil engineers, project managers, consultants and undergraduates from the engineering faculties of the leading universities in the country were present at the conference.
Tokyo Cement Group as the sole sponsor of this year’s event flew down renowned researcher on Concrete, Dr. Shingo Asamoto, Associate Professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Saitama University of Japan, to address the conference as the keynote speaker.
Dr. Asamoto, who is a very close affiliate among the Sri Lankan Engineering academics, presented his scholarly findings conducted in association with Prof. Anura Nanayakkara of the University of Moratuwa, on “Hot Weather Concreting Issues and Application of Mineral Admixtures”.
His study is part of a Core-to-core research network project being conducted in collaboration between the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the Universities of Moratuwa and Ruhuna. This project focuses on hot weather concreting and the measures for design and construction according to Asian climatic conditions, with Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam as counterparts.
Tokyo Cement Group was delighted to take the lead role on this occasion which aims to uplift our industry to be on par with any other country in the global construction arena. The company with its longstanding ties with Japan, made it an opportunity to facilitate world-class knowledge sharing to inspire our professionals who add impetus to our industry with new thinking.
