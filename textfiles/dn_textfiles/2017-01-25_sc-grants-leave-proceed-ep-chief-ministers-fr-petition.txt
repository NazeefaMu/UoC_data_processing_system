SC grants leave to proceed in EP Chief Minister's FR petition

The Supreme Court yesterday, granted leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan, who is presently held in remand custody in Batticaloa over the killing of former TNA Parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasingham.
The petition was fixed for argument by a two-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan.
The former Chief Minister had filed this petition in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration directing the respondents not to object to the petitioner being enlarged on bail. The former Chief Minister stated that his arrest on October 11, 2015, the petitioner had been produced before a Magistrate on 31 occasions.
Through his petition, he sought a declaration that the petitioner is not held under and in terms of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. In his petition, former Chief Minister cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director, Attorney General and six other parties as respondents.
The petitioner further sought a declaration that the respondents have violated and infringed the petitioner’s Fundamental Rights to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law, as guaranteed to him under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Former Chief Minister Pillayan was arrested by the CID on October 11, 2015 when he arrived at the CID office in Colombo to give a statement. He was arrested by the CID in connection with the killing of former TNA parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasingham who was shot dead on December 25, 2005 at St. Maria’s Church in Batticaloa.
President's Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena appeared for the petitioner. Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General.
