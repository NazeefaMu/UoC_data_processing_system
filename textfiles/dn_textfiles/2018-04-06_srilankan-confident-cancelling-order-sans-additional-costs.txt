New A350 aircraft:
SriLankan confident of cancelling order sans additional costs

SriLankan Airlines is confident that they would be able to cancel the order for four new A350 aircraft from Air Bus international without having to pay additional amounts.
The new Chairman of SriLankan Ranjith Fernando said that the government has hired a top international legal team and aviation experts to discuss with Airbus in a bid to cancel this order.
“The government has also paid some advances for this aircraft order and we are hoping that the matter could be settled by the end of the year.”
He said that these aircraft orders and the lease agreements that were negotiated by the official of the Sri Lanka airlines during the previous government were at least 25% more than the market rates during the time.
The airline has to pay a huge US$ 750 million for the total contact.
“In addition to the terms being far too high during the negotiation the wide bodied aircraft were also not suitable for the airline’s current routes,” Fernando said.
