On Greeks and Romans

Edith Hamilton’s The Greek Way and The Roman Way, originally published in 1930 and 1932, are classics in their own right. Praised for their lucidity and accessibility, her books served as an introduction to classical antiquity for the general American public for much of the twentieth century.
Although less well known in Europe, Hamilton achieved such popularity in the United States that, when I tell people that I study Classics, most people over the age of fifty who are familiar with the subject tell me that Hamilton was their entry point. The Greek Way was a favourite volume of Robert Kennedy, and – he claimed – a text that helped him process his grief after the assassination of his brother. Hamilton’s works underlie one traditional American approach to the Classics. Do they deserve re-publication?
Unapologetically popularizing
Hamilton herself is a figure about whom much has been written lately (for example, the excellent chapter by Judith Hallett in the volume Women Classical Scholars, 2016). She had two distinguished careers, first as headmaster at Bryn Mawr, then as a writer about the ancient Mediterranean. It is tempting to compare Hamilton to her British contemporary Jane Ellen Harrison, but while Harrison’s work on Greek mythology became the foundation of scholarship on the subject, Hamilton’s work on mythology and classical civilization was unapologetically popularizing.
As with most classic works, Hamilton’s books present something of a conundrum to readers today: they are obviously products of a different time. Mary Beard, in her SPQR (2015), has compared studying ancient Rome to “walking on a tightrope, a very careful balancing act. If you look down on one side, everything seems reassuringly familiar . . . on the other side, it seems completely alien territory”. Reading Hamilton is a similar experience.
Much of her analysis is clearly the product of a society very like our own, but occasionally one is forcibly reminded that Hamilton’s world was one in which it was entirely acceptable to highlight how remarkable the Greeks’ freedom was by claiming that “a despot enthroned” and “a great, sub­jugated populace” is “what we know as the Oriental state to-day. It has persisted down from the ancient world through thousands of years, never changing in any essential”.
Ancient Rome
Can and should this reprint of The Greek Way be judged alongside more recent volumes on the same topic, whether Thomas Cahill’s Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks matter (2003) or Edith Hall’s Introducing the Greeks: From Bronze Age seafarers to navigators of the Western mind (2015)? Is The Roman Way as useful an introduction to Ancient Rome as Beard’s SPQR?
In short: certainly not. On almost every account, there are better books that have been written in the past eighty years – particularly about Rome, which inspires markedly less enthusiasm in Hamilton than Greece does. Early on in The Greek Way, she writes, “The classical world is a myth in so far as it is conceived of as marked by the same characteristics.
Athens and Rome had little in common. That which distinguishes the modern world from the ancient, and that which divides the West from the East, is the supremacy of mind in the affairs of men, and this came to birth in Greece and lived in Greece alone of all the ancient world”. Her judgements of Roman writers are typically harsh: Terence’s comedies reflect the Romans’ “love of mediocrity”; Cicero is brilliant only in his orations, and his other prose works “failed and died”; Horace’s thought is “hardly more than sagacious at its best and far oftener commonplace than not”.
Interested ideas
Hamilton’s work concentrates on ancient literary sources – there is little archaeology here. More than that, she analyses texts in order to make judgements about the kind of people their authors were – as, for example, when she writes “What Xenophon was comes through clearly in his writings – a man of good will and good sense, kindly, honest, pious; intelligent too, interested in ideas . . .”. This methodology of reconstructing culture through literature creates something of an interpretive minefield for Hamilton. On the one hand, the texts and authors must be extraordinary to be still worth paying attention to millennia later.
On the other hand, she often stresses that the individuals she writes about are not exceptional: indeed, that they were entirely characteristic of their time. This strategy is clearest in a chapter in The Greek Way about Pericles and Socrates, in which the two men are discovered to be typical, albeit exemplary, avatars of the values of fifth-century Athenian society as a whole – and, of course, her vision of fifth-century Athens rarely extends to include the women, the metics, the slaves.
So what is the value of introductions to ancient Greece and Rome that rely almost exclusively on outmoded forms of literary analysis and are peppered with casual racism (as when she declares, “The miseries of Asia are a fearful page of history”)? The answer, of course, is that these texts have become works of reception, especially important for those curious about women classical scholars, or the history of the popular classical tradition in the years before the Second World War. And as Robert Kennedy’s enthusiasm also shows, Hamilton’s popularity among politicians of the twentieth century is a fascinating subject. But I would be alarmed to hear that present-day politicians were reading her analyses as part of their enthusiasm for Thucydides. (Her chapter on him contains sentences such as “There has never been a war fought for purer motives than the war against Persia”.)
Surprisingly relevant
Inevitably Hamilton’s books suffer by comparison with more recent introductions to ancient Greece and Rome. She is too flowery and imprecise. But her works still have the power to enlighten, particularly as artefacts of a time when what “Europe” meant was in crisis. Hamilton’s project is, self-consciously, an attempt to understand Western culture. Viewed in that light, her books are surprisingly relevant in a world where President Trump is giving speeches about the values of Western Civilization in Warsaw and fascistic fringe movements are an increasing presence in European politics. Hamilton could have been writing for the present day in these lines: “When the world is storm-driven and the bad that happens and the worse that threatens are so urgent as to shut out everything else from view, then we need to know all the strong fortresses of the spirit which men have built through the ages”. Whatever her personal politics, Hamilton’s romantic vision of the West is one that has proven attractive to far-right political groups today; for that reason alone her books are well worth reconsidering.
