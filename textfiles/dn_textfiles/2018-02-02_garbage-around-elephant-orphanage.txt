Garbage around elephant orphanage

The road to the Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawala has become highly polluted. Garbage is dumped at several points at the Kegalle-Karadupana junction in the area.
Residents complain that visitors to the Elephant Orphanage litter the area and request authorities to enforce stricter punishments on visitors in this regard.
At certain places where the local government authority has erected signboards asking people not to throw garbage too, there is garbage strewn about. Non-biodegradable plastics, glass bottles and other waste are found in the area.
Further, the Karadupana stream flows past the main road and as it goes past Pinnawela, the waste material is washed into it. This water ultimately ends up in the Pinnawala drinking water system.
