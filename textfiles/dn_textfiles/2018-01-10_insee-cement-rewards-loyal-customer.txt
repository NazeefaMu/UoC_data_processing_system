INSEE Cement  rewards loyal customer

‘Athek Barata Cementhi’, the last major consumer campaign implemented for 2017 by INSEE Cement saw an overwhelming response from Individual house builders islandwide, with Chandika Rajapaksha from Kaleliya, Meerigama, walking away with the grand prize of Rs. 1 million worth of INSEE Sanstha Cement.
The winning prize was handed over by Jan Kunigk, Executive Vice President and Commercial Director of Siam City Cement, at a ceremony held at the INSEE Cement Colombo Warehouse recently.
A successful contractor with over ten years of practice in the local construction industry, Chandika Rajapaksha’s win is testament to INSEE Sanstha’s standing in the market as the leading cement brand, with proven higher strength and durability compared to any other cement available locally.
“As a contractor I have been using INSEE Sanstha for over 11 years now,” commented Chandika Rajapaksha during the event. “The, higher strength, freshness, quality and workability of INSEE Sanstha makes it the best cement for concrete available in Sri Lanka. I am extremely thrilled to have won the grand prize, and I thank INSEE Cement for introducing such campaigns to reward their loyal customers.”
The Athek Barata Cementhi campaign, designed to reward loyal INSEE Sanstha customers was carried out from October 15 to December 15, where 45 lucky winners walked away with Rs. 50,000 worth of INSEE Sanstha Cement through a daily draw. Dealers and masons were also rewarded through this promotion.
While congratulating the winner, Executive Vice President and Commercial Director of Siam City CementJan Kunigk commented, “INSEE Sanstha is a blended cement with a long-standing legacy. One in every three houses in Sri Lanka is built with INSEE Sanstha, which proves the confidence people have placed on the brand. We are thrilled with the response received on the Athek Barata Cementhi campaign and look forward to a new year that presents more opportunities for us to serve, recognize and reward our loyal customers.”
