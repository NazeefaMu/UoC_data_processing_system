Cocaine case:Colombo Chief Magistrate orders arrest of suspects

Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe yesterday ordered the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) to conduct a comprehensive investigation to arrest the suspects who involved in an incident where a stock of cocaine weighing 928 kg seized from a ship docked at the Colombo Port on December 9.
The PNB informed the Chief Magistrate that they have sought an analytical report from the Government's Analyst regarding the stock of cocaine and still waiting for the report.
This is the biggest stash of cocaine recovered in a South Asian country.
The stock of cocaine was found in a timber container in the ship which was bound to India from Ecuador.
The PNB informed Court that they were conducting investigations to ascertain whether there are any Sri Lankans involved in the racket.
