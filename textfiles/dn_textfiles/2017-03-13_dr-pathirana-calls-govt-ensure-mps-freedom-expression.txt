Dr. Pathirana calls on govt to ensure MPs freedom of expression

Under the so-called Lichchavi type administration of the government, even the freedom of expression of Parliamentarians is deprived in the national assembly, Galle District Parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirana said.
He was speaking at a public gathering of Joint Opposition supporters at Bataduwa in Akmeemana, Galle recently.
“When they came to power, they promised to ensure good governance of Lichchavi model under which all could assemble united, discuss in unity and adjourn peacefully. Nevertheless, in contrast to all such promises, the present government does not allow independent Parliamentarians to express their views freely even in Parliament. This is a strange type of Lichchavi rule where people’s representatives are dragged out of the chamber when they try to enjoy their legitimate right of expression,” he said.
The leader of the Joint Opposition, Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardana was suspended from Parliament with the consent of the Opposition Leader under the Lecchavi method, he added.
“Our political identity could be preserved only if we work as independent members without enjoying luxuries, ministerial perks and privileges. By being ministers of the government, we cannot rightful testify our political forte. Only by acting as independent members can we uphold our usual political courage and strength. The present government is steering the country towards a gloomy and disastrous end through a ruinous economic policy of selling all our precious national assets to foreigners, Dr. Pathirana said.
Galle District Parliamentarian Mohan P. de Silva, Southern Provincial Councillors Krishantha Pushpakumara, Ariyawansa Shammu and Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha former Vice Chairman Milinda Haputantri also participated.
