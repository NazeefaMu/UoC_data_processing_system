Poverty-free Sri Lanka by 2030

Poverty is hunger, loneliness, nowhere to go when the day is over, deprivation, discrimination, abuse and illiteracy. As to my own conviction, poverty is more than an income related issue. From the human development perspective, it is the denial of choices and opportunities for living a tolerable life, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the National Conference on Social Work for Sustainable Development organized by the National Institute for Social Development (NISD) on Wednesday at the BMICH.
He said in achieving a poverty-free empowered Sri Lanka, the National Institute of Social Development has a huge role to play. Therefore, this conference deliberates on poverty reduction strategies through social work interventions.
“Though our headcount poverty index has declined to a level of 4.6 percent in 2016, poverty is still a major social issue which hinders human development. Therefore, eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is a challenge and a necessary requirement for sustainable development,” he said.
“In the contemporary world billions of people in many countries are facing extreme poverty. Eradicating extreme poverty through sustainable development is one of the major goals in Sri Lanka,” he added.
He said: “Our efforts to eradicate poverty through the Samurdhi Programme have shown good results. However, extreme poverty is a major problem the country is encountered with.
The poor comprise disabled and elderly people, chronically sick, substance abusers and abounded children.
The government is mindful of those people and a number of activities have been implemented through government agencies and non-governmental institutions to achieve the vision of the government for a poverty-free Sri Lanka by 2030.”
“In the journey, the effort which the NISD has made is creating an academic forum through the National Conference is commendable. I believe that this conference will be a success and will generate new ideas in creating a poverty-free Sri Lanka.
I hope NISD will organize many more timely and appropriate conferences and other suitable events in future as well,” the minister said.
