From captains to principals

My mango friend from Melbourne, Prasanna de Silva features in this week’s article. His writing talents has always being excellent but luckily for me, he has not seriously thought about writing, may he keep to his lecturing duties at the Royal Melbourne Institute as long as he wishes.
Prasanna has written a splendid article called “From Captains To Principals” on my book called “Saga of the Maroons.” He mentions in the article as follows, “If a schoolboy at either Ananda or Nalanda or for that matter any other school in Sri Lanka, there may not be a greater honor than to captain the School 1st XI cricket team. He is also of the view that nothing prepares one better for future management roles than to be a captain of your school’s cricket team which hones ones leadership skills together with planning and executing operations on a constantly changing scenario.
Prasanna states that Colonel Perusinghe carried his aura of his cricketing prowess as a schoolboy to his days at Ananda as Principal. His mere presence was an inspiration to them. During his time as a student, he was not only a swashbuckling opening batsman, he was an exceptional all round sportsman, excelling in Athletics, Soccer and Hockey and to put the icing on the cake he was brilliant in his studies as well. He and his opening partner wicket- keeper batsman R.W.de Silva was a much feared combination for the opposing teams. Prasanna recalls that he was intimated by the “old timers” that if there was limited over cricket at that time, these two would have walked into any team, the reason being they use to score at a gallop.
Prasanna reminisces that Colonel Perusinghe and P.M. Jayatilake differed in physical stature, P.M. being a broad shouldered six footer against the diminutive Perusinghe; both were passionate about their commitment to excellence and love of cricket. Both were teachers not by choice but by chance. Colonel Perusinghe was a medical student before changing track to a career in Education. Mr P.M. Jayatilake was a brilliant student at Nalanda, from where he entered the University. Prasanna states that joining the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service would have been in his grasp, but he too opted for a career in Teaching.
P.M. Jayatilaka captained the Nalanda team in 1928 and was the first ever centurion of the Ananda-Nalanda series scoring 111 not out. This score was the record for an individual score, until Bandula Warnapura bettered it in 1972. Prasanna recalls an interesting incident about P.M. Jayatilake, when P.M. had his first appointment as an Assistant Teacher at St. Peter’s College. At the time there had been an annual cricket match between the staff and the students.
The boys and even most of the other teachers were not aware of PMJ’s cricketing prowess, and the boys have mockingly asked, “Sir, sir are you also going to play in the match?” and his answer had been “yes why not, we should try everything and see, shouldn’t we?” The boys had found this most amusing as in their eyes “Cricket was played in English!” (Prasanna states that surprisingly this type ‘of aping the Sudda’ attitude or misconception prevailed even up to the early sixties.) The boys have been highly amused and the word went around that the “Sinhalaya was also going to play cricket”. However their amusement has turned to amazement when the “Sinhalaya” walked into bat at no 7 and started pelting fours and sixes right around the ground! From that day onwards the students viewed him with more regard and respect and a subtle message was conveyed that one should not prejudge others on preconceived assumptions states Prasanna.
P.M. Jayatilake and Colonel Perusinghe were two of the finest products of Nalanda and Ananda respectively. They have not only done us proud as excellent cricketers and educationalists. They have left us a legacy to emulate. Prasanna stresses the fact that they have not had even the tiniest speck of improper conduct or blemish in their long and illustrious careers.
The achievements of these two gentlemen are unmatched in the history of the two schools and to cap it all they were the byproducts of our revered former Principal Dr P de S Kularatne, coconcludes Prasanna.
