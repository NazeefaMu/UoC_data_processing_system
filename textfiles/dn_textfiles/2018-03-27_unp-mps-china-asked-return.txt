UNP MPs in China asked to return

Six United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarians on a study tour to China were directed to return to the country on April 1 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
They were recalled to Colombo as a part of party’s strategy to prepare the UNP Parliamentarians in advance to face the No Confidence Motion to be taken up in Parliament against the Prime Minister on April 4.
Fourteen Parliamentarians representing the United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and Tamil National Alliance are on a study tour in China and they were expected to return to the country by April 3.
