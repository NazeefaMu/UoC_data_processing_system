Villagers save peacock’s life

Villagers at Deniyakade in Hemmathagama handed over a peacock with a broken leg, to the Pinnawala Zoo on Friday.
The animal was received by Assistant Director Dinusha of the Pinnawala Zoo. She sent it to the veterinary surgeon where the broken leg had to be amputated to save the animal's life.
The villagers said that they contacted Wildlife officers through the Hemmathagama Grama Niladari and they again had to contact Pinnawala Zoo authorities since the Wildlife officers did not heed. On their instructions, the villagers took the bird to the zoo.
