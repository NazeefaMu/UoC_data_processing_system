Healing world’s future

Muslim Aid Sri Lanka (MASL) organized and celebrated International Children's Day on October 1. This year, MASL decided to dedicate the ICD to the vulnerable children of refugees and asylum-seekers living in Sri Lanka and the event was celebrated at the Refugee Education Centre, Dehiwala.
Various events were organized to make the ICD interactive, fun and fruitful. In fact, through this activity, MASL wanted to contribute in healing the trauma and stress that these refugees and asylum-seeker children and their parents are undergoing and we were extremely delighted to see the smiles on their faces and their active participation. There were more than 100 participants of which 70 were children. Drawing and painting competitions under different themes and different age-groups, cultural activities and experience sharing sessions were organized and every participating child was provided with a gift pack, where the winners of the competition were presented a gift voucher in addition.

Refugees do not have the right to work in Sri Lanka and there is no possibility of local integration. Therefore, UNHCR provides them with core relief items along with other basic assistance on a monthly basis to help them survive during their stay in Sri Lanka till they are able to achieve a durable solution through either voluntary repatriation back to their home lands or resettlement to a third country.
MASL is one of the Implementing Partners of UNHCR and receives support to implement a project for refugees and asylum-seekers including the Refugee Education Centre at Dehiwala. MASL takes all possible efforts to alleviate the sufferings of this vulnerable population irrespective of religion, race, gender, nationality or any other differences.
