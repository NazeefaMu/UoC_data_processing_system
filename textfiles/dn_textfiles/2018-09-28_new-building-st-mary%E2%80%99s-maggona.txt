New building for St. Mary’s Maggona

A new three-storey building costing nearly Rs. 40 million donated to Maggona St. Mary's Vidyalaya by Holy Trinity Foundation Chairman Ranjan Gomes was opened yesterday (27) and named after the late Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody.
Bishop Anthony Jayakody blessed the new building after which Gomes opened the building by cutting a ribbon in the presence of members of the Catholic clergy, dignitaries of other religions, the school's Principal Ajantha Chanaka, staff and students.
The building is equipped with four classrooms, a modern laboratory, computer room, library and an auditorium.
The building was gifted in response to a request made by the school's Principal and Sister Mary Nimashini.
