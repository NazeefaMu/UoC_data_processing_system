University non academic staff resume work today

The non academic staff of all universities will resume work from today (April 4) after ending their 34 day strike.
It was further divulged that the strike had hindered the day to day functions which resulted in a postponement of examinations.
However, after discussions with Minister Kabir Hashim on Monday, the trade union leaders of the university non academic staff had agreed to resume work from today.
However, the union leaders had emphasised that they would resort to strike action again, if the government did not agree to give their demands in writing, as had been agreed at the discussions with Minister Hashim.
