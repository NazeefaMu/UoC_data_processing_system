UAE thrashes Thailand 70-18

The United Arab Emirates convincingly beat Thailand 70 points (10 tries, 10 conversions) to 18 ( 2 Tries , 1 conversion, 2 Penalties) to win the Asia Rugby Championship Division 2 title and promotion to Division 1 next year in Dustlik Stadium, Tashkent, the Uzbekistan capital.
A spectacular game from centre Charlie Sargent who scored Two Tries to go along with his perfect kicking display of five conversions accounted 20 points for him personally and ensured that the UAE were never in danger of losing the game.
Thailand were still in the game until late into the second half thanks to tries from Adithep Keatpattanachai and Chinnoiwont Hirunchai and a generally stubborn performance, but then the floodgates opened and tries scored for UAE through wing Ryno Fourie (Two), fly-half Matthew Hutchings (Two), former St.Anthony's College - Kandy 1st XI cricket and 1st XV rugby captain cum later Trinity College fly half the multitalented UAE full-back Imad Reyal (Two Tries), Philip David Brady (One) and Jaen Botes (One) while Imad Reyal three conversions and Rikus Swar two conversions were the highlights.
Having dispatched hosts Uzbekistan earlier in the week, it was a very satisfying week for the UAE team. Earlier in the day, Uzbekistan were cruelly defeated by a single point as they went down to Guam 23-22 in the same venue. In front of a huge home crowd, the Uzbeks fell behind early and often, finding themselves 17-0 adrift after just half an hour.
But tries from replacement Dostou Arzikulov and their fearsome number eight Sanjar Sadullayev either side of half-time gave them some belief.
Then, a try from wing Abduvoris Karimov together with a penalty from Stanislav Krechun saw them take the lead 22-17 with just 15 minutes to go. But two late penalties from Guam Fijian born scrum-half Ratu Uluiviti were enough to see the men from the Pacific sneak home, much to the disappointment of the inconsolable Uzbeks.
