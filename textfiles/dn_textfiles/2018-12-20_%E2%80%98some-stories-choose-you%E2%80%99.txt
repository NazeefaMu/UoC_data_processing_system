‘Some  stories choose  you’

The tagline of Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kedarnath’, ‘Love is a pilgrimage,’ could well apply to the film itself. The Sara Ali Khan-Sushant Singh Rajput starrer has overcome financial roadblocks, inclement weather and intense litigation to finally secure a December 7 release.
Kapoor’s fifth feature isn’t through yet. Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ajendra Ajay has protested against the film’s inter-faith theme and demanded a ban on its release.
‘Kedarnath’ is a love story that plays out amidst the 2013 deluge in the pilgrimage centre in Uttarakhand. Sushant Singh Rajput plays a Muslim porter who falls for Sara Ali Khan’s Hindu tourist – the point of contention for fundamentalists.
Kapoor has collaborated on the screenplay with Kanika Dhillon (Manmarziyaan and Mental Hai Kya). The film was born out of his fascination with pilgrimages and the harmony they represent.
“If you stick around too much in Bombay and Bollywood, you just end up talking about the same ideas,” Kapoor said.
“If you want to tell stories for the people, you have to go and see them where they are. Instead of going for a holiday abroad, I decided to see where the people were going. A lot of them were going on pilgrimages. On one of these trips to Kedarnath, I saw so many porters carrying people every day. I found that to be really fascinating.”
Faith, self-confidence and the belief that he had been picked by the god Shiva to make the film kept him going, the director said.
“There are some stories you don’t choose, they choose you and ‘Kedarnath’ was one of them,” Kapoor said.
“I truly believe that I have been picked to make this film. I feel like Bholenath has picked me. Even through all the problems, I had faith and I never once thought that I would not be able to complete the movie. Everything is not a project to be trade, and I was making this film with a lot of purity in my heart.”
