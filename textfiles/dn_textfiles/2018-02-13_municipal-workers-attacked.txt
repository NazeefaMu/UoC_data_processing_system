Municipal workers attacked

Two persons attached to the Chilaw Municipal Council who were engaged in duties at a public lavatory were attacked on Saturday evening.
The attackers also damaged a motorbike and some of the doors and commodes in the lavatory. They had also grabbed all the money from the collection box of the lavatory.
According to a statement given to the police by one of the workers, both of whom were injured in the incident, the attackers had come there and asked the workers to hand over the keys to the lavatory. They had threatened them saying they have taken over the Chilaw Municipal Council after the election. Chilaw Police arrested the two persons who are to be produced in the Chilaw Magistrate’s Court. The two are believed to be supporters of a political party which has won the highest number of seats in the municipal council.
