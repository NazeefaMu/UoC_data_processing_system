‘Significant improvement in country’s macroeconomic fundamentals’

There has seen a significant improvement in the macroeconomic fundamentals and a positive shift in the economic narrative for the country, said Rajendra Theagarajah, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, addressing the 179th AGM of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce held in Colombo recently.
“Our hope is that programmes such as ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ and ‘Gamperaliya’ (Village Transformation) will bring up the next generation of entrepreneurs and drive economic development to the village,” he said.
Theagarajah said although last year was a challenging year for the private sector, their members managed in balancing both external and domestic risks. While achieving macro stability to a great extent with higher level of reserves,FDI and exports reaching all-time highs in 2017, he said business confidence has been tepid in the backdrop of political uncertainty.
“We have also seen a semblance of policy congruence in recent policy documents brought out by the government which has been lacking in recent years. As we have highlighted in numerous forums and submissions, the credibility of government policy will solely rest on the effectiveness of its implementation,” he said.
Theagarajah said the economy presently faced numerous challenges with the country’s GDP growth falling below 4% for five consecutive quarters. However there has been a progress in terms of trade and investment facilitation.
The Chairman said his Chamber favors an outward orientation of the economy which involves deeper engagement with countries such as through bi-lateral agreements such as FTA’s. The recently signed FTA with Singapore along with the legislation on Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties and Safeguard Measures are examples of this.
On FTAs, the Chamber facilitated many meetings for the negotiating team to consult with private sector stakeholder groups and is currently studying the text of the Singapore Agreement to provide a responsible view and opinion which is missing in the current discourse in the public domain.
“The discussion while focusing on national interests should also be based on sound facts in the context of the overall development strategy for the country taking into account the trade and investment nexus. Irresponsible statements that are not based on the truth should be avoided,” he cautioned.
