Deadly heat waves

Last week I made reference to the dangers facing Jaffna due to scarcity of water if left unaddressed. This week the big picture for the region is presented.
The risk of human illness and mortality increases in hot and humid weather associated with heat waves. The et-bulb temperature (TW defined as the temperature that an air parcel would attain if cooled at constant pressure by evaporating water within it until saturation is the tool to measure.
According to the global historical reanalysis for the modern record (1979–2015), the largest TWmax rarely exceeds 31°C in the current climate. However, three extensive regions, where values exceed 28°C, are observed: Southwest Asia around the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea, South Asia in the Indus and Ganges river valleys, and Eastern China. To identify the precise reasons for high TW, individual studies need to be performed because of each region’s unique geography and climate. In summer 2015, TW in the Bandar Mahshahr, Iran Persian/Arabian Gulf, reached nearly 35°C, suggesting that the threshold may be breached sooner than projected.
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
On the basis of the simulation results, TWmax is projected to exceed the survivability threshold by the end of the century over most of South Asia, including the Ganges river valley, northeastern India, Bangladesh, the eastern coast of India, Chota Nagpur Plateau, northern Sri Lanka, and the Indus Valley of Pakistan. No regions are projected to exceed 35°C; however, vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience episodes exceeding 31°C, which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans. Less severe conditions, in general, are projected for the Deccan Plateau in India, the Himalayas, and western mountain ranges in Pakistan. The region stands to benefit from significant mitigation efforts, such as those pledged by COP21.
As a river dies: India could be facing its ‘greatest human catastrophe’ ever.
As crops and farmers die, experts blame a man-made “drought of common sense” for the drying up of Southern India’s Cauvery River, once a lifeline to millions.
PEOPLE ARE LOSING HOPE
Years of scanty and inadequate rainfall have led to the drying up of water reservoirs and village water bodies in Southern India, especially the grain-growing regions of Tamil Nadu which is facing its worse drought in 140 years. Water activist Dr Rajendra Singh said: “We have not seen a drought of this intensity before. People have lost hope in life and are committing suicide.”
The once-mighty 800 km Cauvery River, a major lifeline in Southern India on which millions of farmers depend, has turned into dust tracks in several sections before it trickles down to the Bay of Bengal.
Scientist and environmentalist Dr Vandana Shiva pointed out that the region gets only four months of rain during the monsoons, during which in ideal circumstances, the water would be naturally stored in the humus and earth of the forests.
“But if you don’t store it, the rain comes, causes a flood, and you have a drought,” she said. “The second reason is that there is an over extraction (of water) beyond the capacity of the river. That extraction is leaving the river dry.”
SMALL RIVERS DRYING UP
Dr Shiva also blames the government’s ambitious scheme that aims to link Indian rivers by a network of reservoirs and canals, with dams diverting the flow from areas with a water surplus. She said: “There’s this assumption that you can have bigger and bigger cities and you can divert water from hundreds and thousands of miles away.
To take all the rivers in India and divert them to the cities and industrial areas - all rivers will die. Critics argue that damming the rivers will cause coastal erosion, deforestation and the displacement of people, and exacerbate the impact of climate change.
Dr Singh pointed out that the introduction of centralised irrigation systems and large dams have led to serious soil erosion while the over-extraction of underground aquifers depleted the water table.
“There was no more water to be drawn from under the ground, and the water at the top flowed away with the soil, causing erosion and silting,” he said. “All the small rivers are dying.”
DEBT DESPERATION AND SUICIDE
Faced with the water crisis and their crop failures, desperate farmers have turned to money lenders for loans to buy food, seeds, fertiliser and equipment.
These money lenders charge exorbitant interest rates and as debts pile up, farmers often find themselves unable to cope with the pressure. Some think that by killing themselves, they can save their families - but money lenders don’t stop hounding the survivors.
“We still have debts that we haven’t been able to repay. None of our debts has been cancelled,” said Madam Vijayakumari.
FOR NOW, A COMMUNITY SOLUTION?
Dr Singh, also known as India’s Water Man, has been fighting an uphill battle to revive water bodies and rivers in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan for more than 30 years. He has set up more than 8,000 water tanks and revived seven rivers in Rajasthan.
In Alwar district, about 200 km from Delhi, he has used path-breaking water conservation techniques to bring water back to more than 1,000 villages. He believes local water preservation and community-driven water management systems are the only ways to end the “terrible disaster”.
Dr Sunita Narain, Director General of the India-based research institute - the Centre for Science and Environment, believes that Tamil Nadu needs to augment its water supply through a decentralised water harvesting system.
This means building water tanks and going back to the traditions of harvesting water, restoring and recharging every lake and pond in Tamil Nadu. She also thinks that the state needs to move away from water intensive crops such as sugar cane.
“Third, make every industry and city in Tamil Nadu water-wise, so you use less water and you recharge and recharge every drop of water the Singapore way. It has to be a combination of all three,” she said.
