‘Govt will abide by SAITM Court Judgment’

The government and other litigants will abide by the Court Judgment on the SAITM university issue, that is to be delivered on January 30, Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday. He said the government would accept the judgment on the SAITM that was set up by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government even with a loan of Rs. 600 million granted by the government for its construction.
The minister made these observations yesterday in response to two questions raised by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake during round of questions for oral answers.
He said the government accepts the fact that there is a shortage of lecturers of the permanent academic staff in the University of Moratuwa and the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, but cover up lectures with the support of visiting lecturers.
