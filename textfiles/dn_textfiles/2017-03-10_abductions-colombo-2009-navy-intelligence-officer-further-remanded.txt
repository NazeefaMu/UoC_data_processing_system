Abductions in Colombo in 2009: Navy intelligence officer further remanded

Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa, a Navy Intelligence officer attached to the Welisara Navy camp, arrested for allegedly abducting a resident of Kotahena in 2009, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded until March 23 by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky.
The CID informed Court that former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake had directly involved in covering up investigations in connection with two abductions that took place in 2009.
It is alleged that the former Senior DIG covered up evidence of an incident in which two persons had been abducted by an unidentified group from Kotahena and Wellawatte in 2009.
The CID had informed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp while being discarded and broken into 72 pieces.
The Colombo Crimes Division initiated investigations into abductions of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan on the instructions of the IGP following a complaint by then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The CID informed the court that 11 abducted individuals had been detained at the Trincomalee underground detention centre violating their human rights.
