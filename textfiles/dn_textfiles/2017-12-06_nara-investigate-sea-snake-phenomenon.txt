NARA to investigate sea snake phenomenon

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to perform laboratory tests on sea snakes caught in fishing nets in Batticaloa on Monday morning and submit a full report in this regard.
Considering the spreading rumours that this phenomenon is a warning sign of a tsunami, the Minister instructed the NARA scientists to investigate and clarify the reasons behind it.
The Minister said a large number of sea snakes had been caught in the wake of the tsunami in 2004. However, the sea snakes had been caught several times before and after the 2004 tsunami during the months of November and December. Therefore, this could be a result of a transformation of the life cycle of these snakes, he said. The NARA claims that the rise in temperature at sea would be the reason for this and further tests will be conducted by the NARA to find the reason for the rise in temperature, said the Minister.
