Weeping at the Heartbreak Ridge

Love and warmth are the strongest attributes that induce people the passion to live and crave for luxuries in life. Eternal love is the most valuable gift for mortals and Gods alike. It is said in the Greek myths; Gods had descended to this world seeking true love.
Shantha Kumara Vithana (Shakuvi), senior journalist, author and poet has written over 100 lyrics to date that have been sung by popular artistes. Shakuvi’s latest lyric ‘Kandulu Ahawara Vee’ (After the Tears) revolves around the subject of love and heart-break. Karunaratne Divulgane has rendered voice to the song which is bequeathed with an emotional melody and music by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe.
The song will be uploaded to YouTube soon.
“This lyric was originally a poem that I wrote to Sunday Lankadeepa poetry page. Divulgane invited me to make it a lyric and I obliged with pleasure. He has rendered voice to the song in the most emotional and magical manner to highlight the grief of an individual who has lost his love,” says Shakuvi.
“Divulgane is a difficult customer though. He got me to re-write the lyric several times before doing the final recording at the studio. However the ultimate result was very self satisfying,” he added.
Shakuvi writes lyrics with his own experiences and by observing experiences of his peers. He has written lyrics for Visharada Nanda Malini, Lukshman Hewavitharana, Nelu Adhikari, Rohan Shantha Bulegoda and a gamut of other artistes.
Mal Kekulakata sung by Lukshman Hewavitharana became a hit song. “There was a craving period for me when popular artistes looked down on me as a lyricist. At a time like that Saman Pathirana was humble enough to render voice to my lyric; Paarami Puranne Nae Ithin”, says Shakuvi.
Being a senior journalist, Shakuvi was conferred with a Gold Medal when he completed 15 years of service at Wijeya Newspapers. He is on the verge of completing 25 years and celebrating his Silver Jubilee as a journalist.
At present he is the Features Editor of Sunday Lankadeepa. Shakuvi is married to the famed novelist Chandi Kodikara.
