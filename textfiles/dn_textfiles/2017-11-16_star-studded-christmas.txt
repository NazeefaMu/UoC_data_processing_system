Star  studded Christmas

‘Christmas with the star,’ an evening of Christmas melodies will be held on December 12 and 13, at 7 pm, at the Ladies College Auditorium, Colombo 07. With music directed by Soundarie David Rodrigo, the event will feature Dinushka Jayawickrame, Maxie Rozairo, Noeline Honter, Sunil and Piyal Perera, Rukshan Pereira, and Umara, along with the People’s Church Vocal Ensemble, as well as its own award-winning soloists.
The event is held this year in support of the thousands of vulnerable children served by the People’s Church compassion arm ‘Center of Hope’. The programme will include an impactful message of Christmas. Center of Hope was started as a feeding project to meet the needs of a disadvantaged community living in Mattakkuliya in 1979. Over the past 30 odd years of its existence, Center of Hope has grown into a multi-site, multi-service project that reaches up to 4,500 children across Sri Lanka. Center of Hope initiatives include KidzKlubz, Community Centers, and Rays of Hope.
Recognizing the moral deprivation that persists in the poorest communities in and around Colombo, KidzKlubz work to instill good values in children aged between 4 and 14 years of such communities through a specially developed curriculum that is administered on a weekly basis by a network of volunteers.

In order to supplement the holistic development of disadvantaged children between the ages of 3 and 16 years, and in an effort to keep them in school, Community Centers have been set up in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, to run various programmes including daily feeding programmes, after school classes, talent development classes, and medical drives. In the context of the prevalence of child sexual abuse in Sri Lanka, Rays of Hope works with schools and at Community Centers, to deal with situations of child sexual abuse, and to create awareness on the issues surrounding it, with a view of preventing it.
Tickets to ‘Christmas with the star’ are priced at Rs. 3,000, 2,000, 1,000 and 500 and will be available for purchase during office hours every weekday at the People’s Church Office/Resource Centre, No. 160/30 Kirimandala Mawatha, Colombo 05, November 19 onwards. All proceeds of this event will go towards Center of Hope initiatives.
