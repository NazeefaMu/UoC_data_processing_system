SriLankan best Airline in South Asia at South Asian Travel Awards

SriLankan Airlines was chosen as the ‘Leading International Airline’ at the second annual South Asian Travel Awards 2017, convincingly beating out other airlines from several countries, while SriLankan’s Business Class was named the ‘Best in Class’ among all airline cabin classes in the region.
The awards were presented at a gala ceremony at Equator Village Resort in Addu City on Gan Island in the Maldives.
Awards were presented in 50 categories covering the entire travel industry, including full service airlines, low cost airlines, hotels, various types of resorts, conference facilities, travel agencies, tour operators, adventure tourism, wellness centres, airports, travel technology providers, transport providers, and even industry CSR activities.
Siva Ramachandra, SriLankan’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We are delighted to add yet another prestigious award to our collection of global and regional accolades.
It is creditable that our own customers had made their choice.”
Dimuthu Tennakoon, Head of Worldwide Sales Delivery at SriLankan Airlines, said: “These awards demonstrate the high all-round quality of SriLankan Airlines, from the choice of destinations that we provide our passengers, to our superb product and service both in the air and on the ground throughout our global route network.”
SriLankan has won a host of accolades in recent times including ‘World's Leading Airline Operating to the Indian Ocean Region’ and SriLankan Airlines was honoured with a prestigious Four Star Rating by the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) in the first ever global airline industry rating programme based solely on feedback from passengers.
In the quest to be chosen as the ‘Leading Airline in South Asia’ SriLankan Airlines overcame competition from Air India, Indian Airlines, Druk Air, Himalaya Airlines and Nepal Airlines who were the other nominees.
The ‘Best in Class’ category featured competition among various First Class, Business Class and Economy Class products of nominees who included Air Asia, Air India and Jet Airways.
Sri Lanka’s award-winning national carrier, a member of the prestigious oneworld global airline alliance, operates a route network of 106 cities from its hub in Colombo, with a fleet of modern aircraft that feature flatbeds in Business Class and sophisticated in-flight entertainment, in addition to its world class service famed for caring and warmth.
The first South Asian Travel Awards was held in Sri Lanka in 2016 and India will be the host of next year’s awards ceremony.
