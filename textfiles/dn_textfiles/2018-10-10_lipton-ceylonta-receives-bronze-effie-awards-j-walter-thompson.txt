Lipton Ceylonta receives Bronze at Effie  Awards with J. Walter Thompson

Unilever Sri Lanka won the Bronze Award for their ‘Escape with Ceylonta’ campaign along with their creative agency J. Walter Thompson at the recent Effie Awards Sri Lanka held at the Water’s Edge.
Tea and Water Vategory Head at Unilever Sri Lanka, Dinusha Ekanayake said, “We are delighted to win an Effie for this campaign that is built on the insight that for Sri Lankans, the flavor of the tea isn’t just in the ‘Kahata’ but also the comforting experience that comes from the very first sip that transports you to a beautiful world, away from their troubles and routine. We commend our agency partner J. Walter Thompson for translating the brands purpose and vision into an incredibly relevant and successful campaign”.
Asela De Silva, Creative Director for J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka said, “Lipton Ceylonta’s win at the Effie’s is a true testament to the curiosity of the Unilever Marketing Team and J. Walter Thompson. It was probably the most creative research effort I have witnessed for a campaign.
We found inspiration together and made sure we created a very different point of view for a “tea” commercial in this country. A burst of flavor from the very first sip targeted the woman of the household and her most eagerly awaited late morning cup of tea where she can really appreciate some good me time. I am proud that the results speak for themselves and against all odds in a depreciating tea market, we proved that you can’t keep a Sri Lankan away from a good cup of tea.”
The Effie Awards are known by advertisers and agencies globally as the pre-eminent award in the industry, and recognize any and all forms of marketing communication that contribute to a brand’s success. Since 1968, winning an Effie has become a global symbol of achievement. Today, Effie celebrates effectiveness worldwide with the Global Effies and the Positive Change Effies, regional programs in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East / North Africa and Latin America, and more than 45 national Effie programs.
