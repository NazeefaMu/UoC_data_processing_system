Tiny talent

Child artistes often go unnoticed. Blame it on the bigger names or just how the television industry works. Nevertheless, there are a few actors who are really making their mark in the industry. Kaveesh Vihanga of ‘Sidhu’ fame is an example of how an tiny tot can bring enormous talent to flesh up a character.
Surprisingly, the six year old does not come across as a beginner because he is just so believable. He plays the role of a free spirited young Buddhist monk Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo in the teledrama. Though he does not play the title role, Kaveesh has proven that he is someone who can give the biggest names on local TV a run for their money.
Q: Describe yourself.
A: I am quite a mischief maker and a chatterbox. I love playing with toys. I am very attached to my family.
Q: What do you think of your role as Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo in ‘Sidhu’?
A: I got this opportunity after taking part in Derana FM’s ‘Punchi Tharuth Ekka Ayubowan’ program. I did not have much of an idea about what was happening so I was just being myself when I was taken for shooting. The only difference was that I had to wear a saffron robe. I did all that the uncles told me on the sets and they were very happy with the outcome.
Q: What was the first day of the shooting like?
A: Shooting takes place in Kurunegala. I have been acting the role since July, 2016. We are picked up and taken to the location.
I had to pick up the cat, Sarana, in my first scene. He was very heavy for me so I was a little afraid. However he escaped as soon I picked him up. That was the first time that I have picked up a cat in my life.
Q: Everybody loves you and your role. You are one of the key factors behind the teledrama’s success.
A: This is my first experience in acting. I did not imagine that I would become so popular. When I was given the role my parents thought that it must be a normal supporting role but now everywhere I go people recognize me. They want to take photos with me and give me gifts and things to eat.
Even on the sets all the cast and crew adore me. They pick me up in their arms and cuddle me all the time.
Q: Who is your favourite among the cast?
A: I love spending time with all of them but Heenbaba Seeya is my favourite. He plays car games with me on the phone and tells me stories.
Q: What was the most difficult scene you had to do?
A:It was a scene in which I was lost in the forest. I had to run up a cliff and through trees. It was a very painful experience because several thorns pricked my feet.
Q: Did you encounter any memorable incidents while playing the role?
A: Once the director tried to use a helicam to shoot certain scenes. That scared me a lot since I have never seen one before in my life. I thought that it is an alien creature! They had to abandon their efforts because I was crying a lot. They did not use that device for shooting in the end.
In another episode I had to run and jump into the river. I slipped then, fell into the water and got bitten by the fish. That experience too scared me a lot.
Q: Are you an animal lover?
A: Yes, I love animals. I am very fond of Sarana. I even asked my mother if we can take Sarana home recently. However he belongs to a member of the crew so that was not possible.
We do not have any pets at home because we do not have much space in our home. However my hobby is collecting bird’s feathers. I collect feathers wherever I go. I also have a huge collection of bird’s nests at home.
Q: What if you were actually Soratha Podi Hamuduruwo? Would you have been different from him and the things he does?
A: Well… I don’t think so. I am pretty much myself when I play Podi Hamuduruwo. I am even at ease with my robe. So since Podi Hamuduruwo is me I think everything will proceed in the same manner.
Q: Did you get any other teledrama or film role offers?
A:Yes. But we have a contract on not to sign for any other projects till ‘Sidhu’ concludes. Shooting for ‘Sidhu’ keeps me busy. We engage in shooting during the weekends and school holidays. My mother accompanies me when I go for shooting. We are picked up at 6 am and it is past 8 pm when we come home again. Therefore the shooting schedule has not gotten in the way of my studies. There have been days when continuous shooting has tired me. Then I tell my mother that I feel that now it is enough for the day. However I have never tired of acting. I love playing the role!
Apart from ‘Sidhu’ I am also involved in Derana FM’s ‘Punchi Tharu Ekka Ayubowan’ program. I draw and sing during my free time.
Q: Tell us a bit about your background and family.
A: There are four members in my family. I have a younger brother who is a bit over two years. My father, Sampath Madhusanka, is attached to Lanka Tiles. My mother Chathurika Priyangani is a housewife. I live in Hanwella. I went Sri Parakrama Maha Vidyalaya, Panagoda. I joined St Peter’s College, Colombo, this year. I wish to thank Sarani Perera and Roshan Perera who are administrators at the British School for getting me the opportunity to enter St Peter’s College.
Q: What is your ambition?
A: It actually changes from time to time. I want to become a doctor now. Some time back I wanted to become an engineer.
Q: What is your message to other children who wish to excel in their talents?
A: I got this opportunity by chance when I took part in a children’s program on Derana FM. I would like to encourage other children too to take part in such programs and showcase their talents to the world. My mother’s uncle, punchi and Nimesh Kulasinghe who is the music director at Derana helped me a lot throughout this venture. I wish to thank them for all that they have done to support me.
