Yesterday I Hit A Four..!

Just when I thought I was an old man, and couldn’t do any young stuff anymore, I hit a four!
Yes, yesterday I hit a four.
It went right over the bowler’s head, past outstretched hands of fielders and hit the boundary line. The crowd sitting to watch the cricket match, clapped gleefully. I saw my wife giving me a thumbs up sign and the commentator telling the bowler not to get fooled by the white streaks on my beard, but I missed my two children.
It would have been nice if they’d seen their father hit that four, and later another boundary and another, and at each stroke that took the ball to the boundary line, I missed the two yells, “Come on daddy! Show them daddy!”
They were always there, my two girls, not that I’ve received many awards, but when I did, they came and stood and cheered, and for those cheers I tried to win the next and the next. And when they went away across the seas, it was like there was no need to hit those boundaries anymore.
But yesterday I hit a four.
“Why Lord?” I asked. “Why are you renewing my strength, why are you rekindling my enthusiasm? Is there something you’re telling me?”
And as the bowler came to bowl, and I with aged eyes could still see the ball, connect with it, and slam it over the fielders I knew there was a message for me.
The fielders came to me later. The bowlers too: “Uncle,” they said, “We didn’t know you played so well!”
“Neither did I,” I whispered, “Neither did I!”
When my children left it was like a void. I’d lived my life, encouraging them on, lifting their spirits, egging them to realize their goals. I had always thought they would achieve much, and they have, but always assumed it would be around where I was. And when they went away, a part of me, a big part crumpled.
But yesterday I hit a four!
It went right over the bowler’s head, past the outstretched hands of fielder behind and hit the boundary line. The crowd sitting to watch the match, clapped gleefully. I saw my wife giving me a thumbs up sign, the commentator telling the bowler not to get fooled by the white streaks on my beard, but as I missed my two children, I realized the Lord up there was sending me a strong message, hard and fast like the bowler’s ball.
“Keep playing,” the trees around the field seemed to say.
“Win!” shouted my daughters across the seas.
“I have renewed your strength!” whispered a voice above, and with a mighty heave I smashed the next ball to the boundary line and smiled at my wife as she gave me a thumbs up sign.
It’s a message for all of us, who feel life is over when our kids grow up or go away: It’s just the end of an over, so grip your bat and hit a four, and another and another..! [email protected]
