Setting Lankan theatre  on international map

The Colombo International Theatre Festival is an eagerly anticipated event that has been taking place for six consecutive years. The seventh edition will take place from May 23 – 30. Daily News spoke to Festival Director, M. Safeer about what to expect this year.
Safeer points out that there is no great financial remuneration but he does it for the love of it and to put Sri Lanka on the map of world theatre.
“The purpose here is to let the world know that Sri Lankan theatre has a lot to offer and we want the international community to appreciate its richness and diversity,” said Safeer.
Safeer personally feels that holding such a festival should be the duty of the government but since that is not happening, he and some others have taken on this responsibility.
“For the last six years we have received more than 400 applications from around 60 countries. This year itself we have received over 150 applications. From that we have shortlisted five Sri Lankan plays and eight international plays. Although there is international recognition, financially we are not doing well as we have little sponsors and little support. Thus it is with difficulties that we run this festival,” stated Safeer.
“However this time the International Theatre Institute (ITI) is with us. It is one of the world’s biggest theatre organizations under UNESCO. ITI is a patron of our festival. This is a huge honour and achievement,” explained Safeer.
The theatre festival will be held at the Lionel Wendt with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Goethe Institute and the Indian Cultural Center partnering the event.
“In Sri Lanka theatre is not an industry. Theatre practitioners in Sri Lanka do it for the love of it. In USA, Europe and Italy theatre is an industry. In doing this theatre festival we are on the international theatre map. Now we are recognized. This is the reason we have got more than 150 applications from countries like India, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Argentina, Kosovo and Austria,” Safeer pointed out.
“In our country we need good infrastructure for theatre, we need good theatre policies and we need recognition. The first international theatre festival was magical, but over the next few years there were challenges that accompanied it. Now the challenge is sustaining this festival. We need good sponsors. When we did it for the first time we were only amateurs. The first time we only got 16 applications. At that time we did not know anything. It was a miracle! Now we feel the difficulty in sustaining this festival. This is no easy task but now festival work is almost over,” explains Safeer.
Safeer says that when he goes on international tours and conferences he gets a lot of positive feedback and inquiries about the festival.
“They are very keen to come to Sri Lanka. Some groups come well before the fixed date and some groups stay after the festival to enjoy Sri Lanka. The CITF is in four sections.
This year we are felicitating Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, followed by the performances over six days at the Lionel Wendt and then we have the Colombo Theatre Forum (May 24, 25 and 28) which is an international theatre directors meeting point held at Goethe. Here every year we focus on a specified subject. This year we are making a ‘proposed theatre policy for Sri Lanka’. In our theatre forum we are submitting this theatre policy to the global theatre practitioners and we will get feedback from them. This is an exchange of ideas. Finally we have the workshops (May 25 – 30). This time we have 10 workshops over five days, two workshops per day. They are conducted by foreign scholars and theatre practitioners at the Indian Cultural Center,” Safeer added.
