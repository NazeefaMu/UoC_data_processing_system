Hambabtota District Master Plan:
Cabinet nod for Consultancy Service to coordinate work

As the China Harbour Engineering Corporation goes ahead with plans to establish the Industrial Zone in Hambantota, Cabinet yesterday approved a proposal to appoint a Consultancy Service and a special Project Management Unit to coordinate work in the development of a Master Plan for the Hambantota District.
The Industrial Zone is expected to be set up in three stages in the Hambantota and Moneragala districts.
Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka submitting the Cabinet proposal on the above noted that the Master Plan would be to ensure that urban development and other development in Hambantota takes place concurrently with the development of the Chinese Industrial Zone.
In short, it would stress on planned development in Hambantota and that the Chinese investments have a positive impact on the people in the district.
