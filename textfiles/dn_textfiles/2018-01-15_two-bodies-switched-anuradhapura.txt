Two bodies switched in Anuradhapura

Two corpses were mistakenly switched by funeral service providers in Anuradhapura.
The corpses of a retired entomologist and a farmer were sent to wrong houses by the funeral service providers on Saturday (13).
The Colombo-Pannipitiya and Kahatagasdigiliya-Mekichchawa funeral service providers mistakenly brought the wrong bodies to the two houses.
One body was identified as that of H.P Nandasena (63), a farmer of Sippikulama, Mihintale. He was admitted to the Anuradhapura Teaching hospita for a heart ailment.
The other was identified as H.A Jayasinghe (90), an entomologist from Colombo, who was staying with a relative in Anuradhapura and died after he was admitted to the hospital.
The two bodies were brought to the hospital mortuary for post-mortems and after conducting the autopsies, the mortuary staff had handed over the dead bodies. The families and the funeral service providers had taken the bodies homes without checking their identities. Having realised that the corpses were switched, the families brought back the corpses to the hospital to get them legally released.
