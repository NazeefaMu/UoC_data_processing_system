Scherzinger 'dating tennis hunk'

Former Pussycat Doll has started dating another sports star after her split from Lewis Hamilton.
The Sun reports that the 34-year-old is dating Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, who broke off his two-year relationship with Maria Sharapova earlier this year.
Sources tell the paper the Don't Cha singer and the tennis player have been dating since July.
"They're completed besotted with each other. But they've been careful not to be pictured together because they don't want the pressure of the relationship being in the public eye," the source claimed.
Scherzinger dated Formula 1 star Hamilton, 30, for seven years before splitting in February.
They remain close friends however.
For her birthday this year, Hamilton posted a picture of the pair and a friendly note.
"Dear friend, Through the years we shared alot, i wouldn't have changed a thing. All the experiences made me the man i'm proud to be right now. The Memories together will never be taken away no matter how old we get and I'm thankful for the time we had. I'm wishing you the Happiest of Birthdays, and may God continue to Bless you in all that you do.#waayyyupstayblessed"
"Lewis knows and is very unhappy. It's made him realise he isn't over her. He's been desperately trying to talk to Nicole over the last few weeks," the source adds.
Scherzinger also briefly dated Swiss footballer Pajtim Kasami, 23.
Dimitrov previously dated Serena Williams before moving on to her rival Sharapova.
