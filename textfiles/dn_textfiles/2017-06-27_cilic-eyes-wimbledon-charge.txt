Cilic eyes Wimbledon charge

LONDON AFP June 25: Marin Cilic insists he is primed to make a strong run for the Wimbledon title despite the frustration of his Queen's Club final defeat against Feliciano Lopez.
Cilic was denied a second Queen's crown in agonising fashion on Sunday as the world number seven failed to convert a match point in the final set tie-break before losing 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (10/8).
Lifting the trophy at the Wimbledon warm-up event would have been perfect preparation for the Croatian ahead of the grass-court Grand Slam, which starts on July 3.
But Cilic is confident the dominant form he showed for the rest of the tournament will stand him in good stead at Wimbledon, where the former US Open champion has lost in the quarter-finals three years in a row.
“I'm playing really well. Definitely I'm going to get to Wimbledon with good determination, good confidence,” Cilic said.
“I've worked a lot to get to this level. I'm looking forward to the tournament. Definitely hoping that I can go further than the last three years.
“I played a lot of matches on grass. Played high-quality tennis. It's also a matter of executing things well on the court. That's where my focus is going to be.” With Wimbledon champion Andy Murray crashing out of Queen's in the first round, a result that continued the world number one's disappointing 2017, and Novak Djokovic in equally poor form, Cilic acknowledged there is good opportunity for someone outside the big four to take the trophy.
Roger Federer will arrive as tournament favourite after maintaining his superb run by winning the Halle title on Sunday, but French Open champion Rafael Nadal hasn't thrived at Wimbledon for several years.
“All the other guys at the top didn't perform too well, and definitely that opens up a gap,” Cilic said. “Roger didn't play much, so it's tough to know his form. You know, just looking at the results he has on grass, it's obvious that you have to put him up there.
