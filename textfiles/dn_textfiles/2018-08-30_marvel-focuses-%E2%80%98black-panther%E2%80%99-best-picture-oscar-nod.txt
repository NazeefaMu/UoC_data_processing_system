Marvel focuses on a ‘Black Panther’  Best Picture Oscar nod

Looking to nab a Best Picture nomination for ‘Black Panther,’ Disney has hired veteran Oscar strategist Cynthia Swartz to oversee the campaign, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.
Disney and its superhero phenomenon ‘Black Panther’ have been at the heart of much of the conversation surrounding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ addition of a “popular film” category.
Views on the film’s awards potential went from: maybe it could be a best picture nominee, to concern it would be shoehorned into a popular film category created to boost the telecast’s sagging ratings by including more commercial hits. But Marvel Studios still has its eyes set on best picture.
