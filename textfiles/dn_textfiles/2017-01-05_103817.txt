Test of strength

There is never a dull moment in the theatre of Sri Lankan politics, or so it seems, as the government and the opposition continue to lock horns with both camps set for renewed battles in the New Year.
Several interesting developments dominated the political landscape over the past few days, notwithstanding the holiday season. Interestingly, they all appeared to relate to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) camp.
Among the more intriguing developments was the resignation of Piyankara Jayaratne as State Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils. Jayaratne claimed he found it difficult to work in a government in coalition with the United National Party (UNP).
Jayaratne hails from a political family in Chilaw and it is no surprise that he is a staunch SLFPer. His father, S. D. R. Jayaratne also served as a parliamentarian and ended his political career as Minister of Fisheries in the government of Sirima Bandaranaike.
Piyankara Jayaratne himself is no novice to national politics, first entering Parliament in 2000 and also serving as Deputy Speaker from 2008 to 2010 in the government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Following his resignation, Jayaratne was to declare that “some SLFP MPs who are holding Ministerial and State Ministerial posts in the Unity Government were planning to resign their portfolios.” Elaborating further, he said that three of these ministers were from the Galle, Matale and Gampaha districts. He said that “accusations made by some UNP ministers” led them to take this decision.
Jayaratne’s predictions
Jayaratne’s predictions are yet to become a reality but his resignation has certainly led to speculation that there is more to it than meets the eye. The big question in political circles was whether Jayaratne’s resignation was his individual decision or whether it was a move orchestrated in conjunction with the Joint Opposition (JO) to test its strength.
Aiding and abetting this speculation was a pronouncement by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Since his defeat at the presidential election two years ago, Rajapaksa, though frequently entertaining the media with ‘voice cuts’ whenever he attends a public event, has not been keen to hold formal press briefings.
Recently though, he met with foreign correspondents and elaborated on his political strategies, earmarking 2017 as the year when the government would be ‘toppled’. Much was made of the fact that hoppers- the famous meal he shared with President Maithripala Sirisena before the latter defected from the SLFP- were served at the briefing but more serious matters were also discussed.
Though Rajapaksa was expressing thoughts of toppling the government, it was pointed out that the Constitution precludes a premature dissolution of Parliament or an early presidential election. Rajapaksa countered this by saying he was willing to serve as Prime Minister under President Sirisena. It was the first time he had given such an undertaking. Even though it is said that politics is the art of the possible, this is wishful thinking right now. The UNP-SLFP combine presently commands a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The UNP by itself has 106 seats in the legislature while the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) commands only 95 seats.
Enjoying privileges of ministerial office
Any plans to make Rajapaksa Prime Minister would mean that he would need to muster the support of the majority of parliamentarians- at least 113. Even if the UPFA supported him en masse, it would still need to find 18 parliamentarians from other parties to endorse Rajapaksa. With 22 of the 24 seats held by other parties being from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), this is almost impossible.
That leaves Rajapaksa with the prospect of finding 18 parliamentarians from the UNP to support him. Although he has been a past master at wooing MPs from the opposition and engineering their defections, that was when he was in power and called all the shots.
Now a mere backbench MP, Rajapaksa does not have the pulling power to entice all the SLFPers into his camp, let alone seducing UNPers into joining him. Parliamentarians from the UNP are in office after a long lapse of more than two decades- barring a brief interlude in 2001- and are quite content with their lot, most of them enjoying the perks and privileges of ministerial office.
With politics being all about arithmetic and getting the required numbers, Rajapaksa’s claims of ‘toppling’ the government in 2017 appears to be wishful thinking, even if a minister or two were to resign.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said as much. He was to respond to Rajapaksa’s remarks saying that he would be in Switzerland soon and that Rajapaksa was welcome to try his hand at toppling the government then.
Very much the elder statesman in the current Parliament, Wickremesinghe would not have uttered those words lightly, having undergone a similar experience before: in November 2003, then President Chandrika Kumaratunga sacked three ministers- Defence Minister Tilak Marapone, Interior Minister John Ameratunge and Information Minister Imtiaz Bakeer Markar- while Wickremesinghe was on an official visit to the United States.
Adding even more controversy to the political events of the week was the decision by Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Mustapha to refuse accepting the report of the Delimitation Committee for Local Government elections, on the grounds that it had not been signed by two members of the committee. There was indeed some drama attached to the issue.
Minister’s refusal
A press conference was organised at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry and the media informed that Chairman of the Delimitation Committee and former Commissioner-General of Lands Ashoka Peiris would hand over the report to Minister Mustapha then.
However, at the given time, Minister Mustapha refused to accept the report, adding that he would have to look into the legal provisions of accepting the report without the signature of two members in a five member committee. It was reported that the UNP’s A.S.M. Misbar and the UPFA’s Saliya Matthew had not signed the report at the time.
Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris however contradicted the statement made by the Minister, saying that the report can be accepted if it has been signed by a majority in the Committee. The Minister’s refusal could have been prompted by earlier remarks of Committee Chairman Peiris who had taken the unusual step of criticising the minister publicly in an interview with a weekend newspaper, alleging that he received little support in his work.
The matter is however likely to be a storm in a tea cup: a fourth signature has reportedly now been obtained and it would only be a matter of time before the report progresses to the next stage when Local Government election can be called.
Amidst all this controversy, the end of the last year also saw the departure of a onetime political heavy weight, former Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake. Wickremanayake was known as a loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and it was to him that she turned to when her mother Sirima Bandaranaike had to step down from the Premiership due to ill health in 2000.
However, Wickremanayake’s integrity and loyalty to the SLFP came to the fore five years later when Mahinda Rajapaksa, by then at loggerheads with Kumaratunga, entrusted him with the same job which he held for the next five years.
His tenure may have been a low profile one, but it was bereft of scandal as well and he was reputed as incorruptible over five decades of public life- a plaudit that few politicians of the present era can boast of. His demise robs the country of one of its most senior politicians as well, having entered Parliament way back in 1960.
As the old guard makes way for the next generation and the New Year dawns bringing the curtain down on 2016, the year 2017 will surely generate more political heat- although it may not in the manner predicted by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa!
