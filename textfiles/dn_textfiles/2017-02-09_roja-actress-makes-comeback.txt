'Roja'  actress makes a comeback

Remember Madhoo from 'Roja', well the actress might have been missing from the big screen for a long time now but she has been busy doing films down South.
She recently acted in a short film titled 'Sab Theek Hai', directed by Raja Mukherji. Speaking about the short film to a daily she said, "It's a mother-daughter story, where the daughter has been married off to somebody who lives in the United States. Every time she calls her mother back home, she asks how everything is, and she replies 'Sab theek hai' and vice versa. But in reality, they both are facing a lot of problems. It's only at the end that they realise that sab theek nahi hai."
The film is doing the round of film festivals and Madhoo hopes that her fans get to see it here soon.
