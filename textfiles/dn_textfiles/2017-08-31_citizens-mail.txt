DEARTH OF BUDDHIST MONKS
It was reported, the Mahanayaka of Asgiriya Chapter most Ven. Warakagoda Dhammaasiddhi Pagnananda Gunarathana Thera, at a foundation laying ceremony for a building Sri Sumanaramaya temple at Nalanda, Matale had lamented the need to obtain the services of learned Buddhist monks towards the well-being of the country and the Buddha Sasana and the present social degradation is mainly due to the gap between the people and the temple.
In this regard, it is apt to quote a very courageous and bold observation made by an editor of another English daily where he correctly, with no ambiguity has said, referring to the accusation made by Ranjan Ramanayaka, State Minister against the clergy “Certain Buddhist monks today openly engage in business activities, especially those temples in the cities and travel in luxury vehicles. More often than not, they receive political patronage to further their business ends, with some of them even holding important positions in government institutions, an act at complete variance with their primary duty to attend the spiritual needs of the faithful”.
He also says “Several temples in the country had been badly neglected due to the dearth of Buddhist monks”. Could this be true, seeing large number of monks in cities housed in temples. Cannot the Mahanayaka Theras, take a census and appoint the excess to those neglected temples. While Buddhist monks in cities and towns enjoy these luxuries, monks in remote villages undergo untold hardships to serve innocent villagers.
The Mahanayaka speaks of obtaining the services of learned monks, perhaps not knowing what such educated monks have contributed to the destruction of Buddhism as in the case of Buddhist monks taking to politics and neglecting to perform simple religious rites and rituals such as tying a Pirith Noola, considering it as a nuisance and disrupting other work. Politicians have made the Sangha a tool to further their political power and misrule the country for personal gains as is evident. The most hilarious part is that these scheming politicians are given pride of pace at temple functions.
It is high time the Mahanayaka Theras and heads of Nikayas, get together, set up a Sangramaya to stem this rot in the Buddha Sasana for the sake of Buddhism and the country.
