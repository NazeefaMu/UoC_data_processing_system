Sugar Importers  Association states...

Sugar Importers Association Deputy President Hemaka Fernando said the government’s moves will increase sugar prices in the local market.
He said that the retail price of a kilo of sugar will go up to Rs.130 and the wholesale price of a kilo of sugar will also go up to Rs.105.
He said the government has misled the public by the special commodity tax on sugar and instead the import of sugar has been brought under the general tax structure so as the importers have to pay a higher import tax on sugar.
