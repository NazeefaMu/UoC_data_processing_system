Sri Lanka gifts land for Palestine Chancery

Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana handed over the deed for a plot of land at No. 4, Hewa Avenue, Colombo 7, to the Ambassador for Palestine to Sri Lanka, Zuhair M.H. Zaid.
The land is a gift from Sri Lanka to the State of Palestine to build its new Chancery in Colombo.
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Association President Rajitha Senaratne, Sri Lanka-Palestine Friendship Association Secretary MP Bimal Rathnayake and the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, Ambassador Abdulhamid A.K. Al Mulla of the United Arab Emirates was present.
Recalling that Sri Lanka had recognized the State of Palestine in 1988, and had supported Palestine for non-member observer status in the United Nations, Minister Marapana assured Ambassador Zaid that Sri Lanka will continue to support Palestine for full membership in the United Nations.
Ambassador Zaid said this gesture demonstrates Sri Lanka’s conviction in supporting the just cause that the Palestinian issue represents.
