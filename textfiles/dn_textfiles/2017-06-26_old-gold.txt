Old is gold!

Rohini Jayawardena has done Sri Lanka proud by winning a Gold Medal in the Over 70 category in the Singles at the World Masters Games in Badminton and also a bronze in the over 70 Doubles at Badminton. The Daily News sat down with Rohini and discussed her fantastic achievement.
"This is a World Masters Games and it is held once in four years, and the next one will be in Japan. The tournament was held April 22 - 30. I won the gold medal for the over 70 category in Singles in Badminton and the bronze for the over 70 category in Doubles in Badminton. I will be turning seventy in July. At the tournament they calculate it according to what you age would be at the end of 2017. My mentor and the man who made this possible is McLarens Group Managing Director Rohan De Silva. For the last few years he has been encouraging me to take part in different International events. So this is the first time I decided I would," said Jayawardena.
It all happened in the strangest of ways! "It all started because I had to find some way to spend my time while my daughter was in school at the St. Bridget's Montessori. I played at Otter's with a wooden racket and I fell in love with the game. At that time I played at 7.30am in the morning and I played till about 10.00am and then I was so fond of it, I went in the evening at 4.00pm and play till 6.00pm. I started playing of course with a friend of mine. Then some more ladies who were expatriates joined our little group and then they left, and then we locals used to play.
Then I was taking part in tournaments at Otter's. I also used to play in the Otter's club tournaments. Then there was an event for veterans over 40. When I showed some reluctance to play, they prompted me and then I asked them to enter me into all the events over 40. I won the ladies doubles and the singles. At Otters I continued right along. And when there were open events I took part it those," explained Jayawardena
Achievement
Jayawardena was sponsored by McLarens Group setting the incredible events that happened in motion.
"I played during the mornings and evenings and improved my game by playing against very strong men and they used to correct me. I have never played at school level. I have played Badminton in Sri Lanka for the last 40 years and I have never been trained. I was sponsored by the McLarens Group. Rohan de Silva played with me. We all played together at Otter's. He has been playing for many years. He told me that I would do very well internationally! I did not pay much notice to it at that stage.
This time around he wanted me to play in the World Masters but I was reluctant because I was going to London. I go once a year to London to see my brother. I was to return on the 19th but the World Masters was on the 22nd in Auckland, so Rohan De Silva entered me. Of course I could not go for the opening ceremony. So I came back from London, and just changed the suitcases and then I went to Auckland," pointed out Jayawardena.
Challenging
The experience was very challenging for Jayawardena.
"I had just one day's practice and I was initially a little nervous about the cold because the courts are not heated. I was entered for three events - Singles, Doubles and Mixed Doubles.
I had a partner who was going with me for the mixed doubles, but he had a heart condition and could not come. But I wanted to play Mixed Doubles after going all that distance, and asked for a partner. So they gave me a partner, but then again there is no practice, you get onto the court with them and play. I did not go far in the Mixed Doubles so I had to concentrate on the singles.
So in the Semi-finals it was a three setter and I played against a New Zealander and the finals was also against a New Zealander and it was very easy - it was two sets. When I won the final I was so shocked. I just stood in the middle of the court in shock, I didn't move out of the court until I saw people running to congratulate me!," explained Jayawardena
This dramatic moment was made even more special when Jayawardena was told she had won a bronze medal.
"In the Ladies Doubles I had a partner from America who they had paired off with me. When I went to get my gold medal, they told me to accept my gold medal and receive a bronze medal! They told me that I was to receive a bronze as well. Apparently I had won the bronze for the ladies doubles as well! So I ended up with two medals," added Jayawardena
Magnificent experience
It was a magnificent experience for Jayawardena.
"I don't know if I will take part in four years' time! It was a very good experience. Only now do I realize how important it is when everyone tells me how great it was! The people in New Zealand are very friendly and my opponents were very gracious. After it was over they came up to me and praised me and wished me the best. The Indians were full of support! They wanted to take photographs with me! When this came in the papers, my brothers' son wanted me to come to Australia, so I could show the medals to his children as an inspiration to all. When Sri Lankans in Melbourne found out that I had got a gold medal for Sri Lanka, they all wanted to take pics with me!," described Jayawardena
28 countries took part in it, and this is not only for Badminton, but for Netball, Football, Soccer, Swimming at 46 venues. There were all kinds of sports. 28,000 participants were there. Everything was done under tight security with Jayawardena having to get her accreditation badge to enter the courts.
"In the individual events you represent your own country. In the mixed doubles my partner was an Australian. But you just get on to the court with no practicing. You just get up there and play. Having seen me playing in the mixed doubles I had a cheering squad when I played singles! My Doubles partner, an American called Linda and I played four games- Quarter -finals, semi-finals and finals. In the mixed doubles I also played four but the scores were not enough to win a medal," said Jayawardena.
Jayawardena also mentioned how much her daughter, her only child adores her and believes in her (Rohini's) prowess.
"She has been my most ardent supporter. She wished me at 3.00am in the morning and told me - 'mama you are going to win!' it was like a premonition. She was very sure I would win. I would attribute my success to all the years of hard work. Also the confidence I have built up also helped. When I took part in this tournament I was not at all nervous and I am amazed how cool I was. I wanted to do something for the country and myself!," said Jayawardena.
Jayawardena believes to succeed you need to focus your mind.
"You must be really determined. Determination is why I have succeeded. I was determined. You need to set your mind on doing something to achieve something," summed up Jayawardena.
