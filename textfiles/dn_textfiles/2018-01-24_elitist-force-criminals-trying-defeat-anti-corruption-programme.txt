Elitist force of criminals trying to defeat anti-corruption programme- President

An elitist force of criminals are working towards defeating my programme against corruption, theft, fraud and nepotism, said President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
The President added that his programme would not be defeated by these forces.
The President was speaking at a public rally held in Pettah to promote UPFA candidates contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council.
“Today my national campaign on clean politics is being threatened by large scale criminals who have come together from all parts of the island and these people have no party, colour, language, race or limit, the President said.
The occasion was marked with around 500 former UNP members joing the SLFP.
The meeting was organised by Minister and SLFP Chief Organizer for Central Colombo Faiszer Mustapha, the United Pettah Traders Association and the Pavement Traders Association.
Minister Chandima Weerakkody, UPFA Mayoral candidate Azath Sally, Pettah Traders’ Association Secretary, Chaminda Vidanagamage participated in the event.
