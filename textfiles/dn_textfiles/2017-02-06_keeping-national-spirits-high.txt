Keeping national spirits high

National pride is inherent to every nation. Every nation upholds her own national identity with the national flag in the global arena. Sri Lanka is no exception, though comparatively small in size, albeit cognitively, culturally, socially, politically, to top them all intellectually and affectively play no second fiddle to any other nation on earth.
Our pristine glory, international relations and cultural roots that date back to centuries and centuries bear ample testimony for our presence.
Our national anthem and the national flag are definitely two significant columns that hold our spirits high. They are inseparable.
The time is opportune more than ever before to imbibe the quintessence and breathe the fragrance of both for the forward march of the nation to bestow her legacy to the posterity.
The national flag deserves the pride of place at the nation’s Independence Day and it enhances its pride when it goes high to the tune of the national anthem.
They tune up the grace and majesty of the nation that descends from a lion. The fluttering lion flag high above the nation’s rulers injects new blood for the frog leap of the nation to prosperity.
The nuance in the above preamble facilitates us to derive the true essence of the national flag with a renewed spirit today.
British colony
It is associated with nation’s respect. It is the symbolic presence of the nation even at United Nations Office at Geneva. Geneva is gained to the nation when it flutters undulating with other nations.
Following World War II, public pressure for independence increased. The British Colony of Ceylon achieved independence on February 4, 1948, with an amended constitution taking effect on the same date.
Independence was granted under the Ceylon Independence Act 1947. Military treaties with the United Kingdom preserved intact British air and sea bases in the country; British officers also continued to fill most of the upper ranks of the Army.
Don Stephen Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. Later in 1948, when Ceylon applied for United Nations membership, the Soviet Union vetoed the application. This was partly because the Soviet Union believed that the Ceylon was only nominally independent, and the British still exercised control over it because the white, educated elite had control of the government. In 1949, with the concurrence of the leaders of the Sri Lankan Tamils, the UNP government disenfranchised the Indian Tamil plantation workers. In 1950, Ceylon became one of the original members of the Colombo Plan, and remains a member as Sri Lanka.
Issue of national languages
Don Senanayake died in 1952 after a stroke and he was succeeded by his son Dudley. However, in 1953 – following a massive general strike or ‘Hartal’ by the Leftist parties against the UNP – Dudley Senanayake resigned. He was followed by John Kotelawala, a senior politician and an uncle of Dudley. Kotelawala did not have the personal prestige or the political acumen of D. S. Senanayake. He brought to the fore the issue of national languages that D. S. Senanayake had suspended. The Queen of Ceylon, Elizabeth II, toured the island in 1954 from April 10–21.
It is aspirational and inspirational before the nation. Its true effect on the true patriot is felt in the whole blood circulation. One’s shoulders straighten when the auditory effect is felt. The earth feels it. In this sense, attitude formation in the children at their formative years about the national flag is of paramount importance.
My memory compels me to mention here how my father took me to the Independence Day celebrations in the city of Galle and passed on its value to me.
It still remains with me. Proper guidance by parents at tender age regarding national events goes a long way. Parents, teachers, elders and above all, the true patriotic rulers and writers could sow the seeds with the sublime aim of reaping the harvest later. The harvest would certainly be bountiful.
Let’s resolve to put the country before self. It’s the need of the hour. Its echo is heard in every nook and cranny in our cherished soil. Let’s shun all the differences and march as one nation.
