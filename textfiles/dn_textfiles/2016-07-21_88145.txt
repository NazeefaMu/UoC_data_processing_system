Lankan team leaves for U18 Asian Schools Rugby Sevens today   : Adjusting from 15s rugby to 7s is not easy – coach Mushtaq

 
 The selection panel of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) headed by chairman-Michael Jayasekara (S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia) ably assisted by Hisham Abdeen (Isipathana College), Kapila Knowlton (Mahanama College) and L.V. Ekanayake (St. Anthony’s College Kandy) has selected the final 12-member squad for the upcoming Under 18 Asian Schools’ Rugby Sevens Championship.
The squad along with head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq and manager K.S.P. Karunaratne are due to leave for Hong Kong tonight.
Three players each from Isipathana College and Trinity College Kandy, two players each from S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia and St. Joseph’s College Maradana and one player each from St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya and St. Anthony’s College Kandy have secured a place in the Sri Lanka Under-18 Asian Schools’ Rugby Sevens squad.
The Championship is scheduled to take place in Hong Kong from July 22-26 at Kings grounds.
The national selectors finalized the 12-member touring squad yesterday. The team will be led by S. Thomas’ College wing three quarter Henakankanamge Naveen, the son of former Isipathana College and Navy SC centre three quarter H.K. Sisira. Sumudu Rankothge the Isipathana vice-captain cum centre will be his deputy.
Head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq in his first assignment as head coach of a national rugby team said, “With the coaching staff we have made every effort to change the mindset of the players to face the tough opponents and go for victory against the likes of Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, who have registered wins against us in the recent past.
“We have a good set of forwards as well as three quarters. The players are in a good frame of mind and are hoping for a positive result. My only worry is that we did not have much time to practice as a team together. It’s only a mere one week we did practice together. The boys were after the schools’ 15-a-side tournament, hence to get adjusted to playing style of Sevens all of a sudden is a very difficult task and definitely not that easy," said Mushtaq. "But with these talented players we will give our best shot.”
Touring squad of 12:
Henakankanamage Naveen (Captain) – S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia, Sumudu Rankothge (Vice Captain) – Isipathana College, Chamod Fernando – Isipathana College, Harith Bandara – Isipathana College, Diyath Fernando – St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya, Avishka Shiek – Trinity College Kandy, Diluksha Dange – Trinity College Kandy, Anuka Boyagoda – Trinity College Kandy, Christian De Lile – S.
