Somerset in danger after loss to Surrey

LONDON, Friday - Surrey secured their Division One status with a six-wicket victory over Somerset at The Oval, leaving the visitors in serious relegation trouble.
Somerset moved from 113-4 to 306 all out in their second innings with Steve Davies (58) and Peter Trego (68) hitting final-day half-centuries. That left 143 to win for the hosts, which they knocked off in 32.4 overs.
Surrey are up to second, while Somerset must win their last game against Middlesex for a chance of staying up.
Somerset started the day still 51 behind Surrey's first-innings total but half-centuries Trego and Davies’ resistance as well as a 48-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jack Leach and Dominic Bess set up the possibility of an unlikely victory.
They gave themselves a slim chance when Rory Burns, England opener Mark Stoneman and Ryan Patel were all dismissed to leave Surrey 73-3, but a 44-ball 42 not out from Ben Foakes took the hosts to 146-4.
Foakes hit six fours and a six while Kumar Sangakkara also made an important 35 in his final first-class innings at The Oval. The 39-year-old Sri Lankan has scored 1,442 Championship runs this season at an average of more than 110.
 “I can't ask for any more. Forget the hundred, but to win, that was outstanding. I never really planned a farewell like this. But to walk off with a win, I can't describe how special that is,” Sangakkara told BBC.
“The atmosphere in the dressing room has been fantastic all season, but especially in this game. I've been made to feel so welcome, to feel part of the family. I'm just happy I could repay them with some performances.
“It has rekindled that passion that I thought I'd lost. When I get on a stretch where I'm scoring runs, I've been able to repeat that process over and over again.
“Coming here I wanted to see an improvement as me in a player, but also in Surrey as a side and what's giving me the most satisfaction is watching how the senior players have led this group from being in the second division to being a force in the first division.” “When you are playing against Sanga you can see the genius of the man. It looks like he is playing a different game at times. It's not nice being on the wrong end of things against him,” said Somerset captain Tom Abell.
“It was a real battle today and I think we've bowled as well as we have all season in this game. Things just didn't seem to fall our way, but you couldn't fault the effort of our guys. Next week is a cup final now.
If we beat Middlesex we have a chance of staying up.”
Champions Essex bowled out Hampshire for 76 to seal a incredible win, having followed on at the Ageas Bowl.
New-ball pair Sam Cook (5-18) and Jamie Porter (2-21) starred as Hampshire, chasing 185 for victory, collapsed in 29.4 overs to lose by 108 runs.
Hampshire, who started the game third in Division One, are still not safe.
Essex - who remain unbeaten - had battled back after being bowled out for 76 themselves in their first innings, with Dan Lawrence's century and brisk lower-order runs in their second innings giving them hope of an unlikely win.
Yorkshire gave a massive boost to their hopes of staying in Division One of the County Championship by hanging on to beat already relegated Warwickshire by two wickets at Headingley.
Steve Patterson's unbeaten 44 was the key as Yorks picked up 21 points from their fourth win of the season.
Northamptonshire threw the Division Two promotion race wide open with a 124-run home win over Nottinghamshire.
Victory against Leicestershire in their final game of the season could send them up, providing Notts earn no more than 11 points against Sussex.
Resuming on 107-3, the visitors lost their last seven wickets for 82 as they were all out for 189.
Notts remain second in the table on 210 points with Northants 13 points behind, with the final round of games starting on Monday.
Sussex bowled Durham out for 131 to complete a 132-run victory on day four at Chester-le-Street.
Durham started the day 5-0 needing 259 more runs for victory but were bowled out in 42.2 overs. Glamorgan and Gloucestershire settled for a tame draw on a lifeless pitch as Nick Selman and Andrew Salter hit career-best scores.
Glamorgan were 353-3 when bad light intervened.
Selman made an assured 142 not out, while Salter's 88 was his second career-best of the game.
The Division Two game between Derbyshire and Kent was abandoned as a draw without a ball bowled on any of the four days at Chesterfield.
A wet outfield prevented any play on Tuesday or Wednesday, while heavy rain fell on Thursday.
