Autobiography: ‘Crazy: My Road to Redemption’

The first night in prison was the hardest time – Chris Lewis:
‘I remember going into jail the first time,” Chris Lewis says in a plush hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair. Coffee cups chink and, in the lounge across the marble lobby, a lonely pianist plays tinkling old standards to himself. But Lewis, the former England cricketer who served half of the 13-year prison sentence he received after being arrested for trying to smuggle cocaine worth £140,000 from St Lucia into Britain in December 2008, is back inside.
“Talk about acute fear,” the 49 year old says more intently than if he is describing his Test debut in 1990 or opening the bowling in the World Cup final two years later in front of a crowd of 100,000. “My mind is trying to find any information I have about jail and it all comes from films. You’re scaring yourself and the first night you don’t know whether you can stand it. That was the hardest time. You don’t know how you’re going to survive.”
Lewis survived and, six and a half years later, in June 2015, he was released. But the stigma of jail and the complications shrouding the life of any former prisoner remain. Over the next two hours Lewis is a compelling witness to his own incarceration. “Once the worst happened you either face it or bail out. At first I thought I’d absolutely fall apart but when I got sentenced I had the strength to deal with it. There was more fortitude than you’d imagine. There was also a cathartic experience because at first you think: ‘It’s their fault.’ But the truth dawns: ‘The constant here, mate, is you.’ The person to blame is just you.”
Lewis’s autobiography Crazy echoes this tone and strives to explain why an England cricketer, who played 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals, ended up thinking he could carry three cans of liquid cocaine through security and customs without hitting trouble. The suggestion is that lack of money at the end of a sporting career was only one reason. An angry and disillusioned Lewis had fallen into a pattern of bad decisions.
The book captures the twists and turns of his life – from a childhood in Guyana, to moving to England aged 10, to discovering a new life in a strange country through cricket. It also depicts him as being often misunderstood and unfairly stereotyped – and draws a link between his fateful offence and the hurt he suffered after reporting an approach made to him by a match fixing gambler in the summer of 1999. Lewis refused and the next morning he met the England and Wales Cricket Board to divulge this information. He also went to the police.
It was the following summer that the story turned sour. “This was the start of the dark times,” Lewis writes. “The general feeling was I had maliciously made-up stories about England players being involved in match-fixing for financial gain.”
Lewis looks hurt as he revisits a chaotic saga in which he believes the ECB let him down. “All my dreams blew up in flames. No part of the dream involved being booed or perceived as somebody lying about my team-mates. It was the end. Cricket was a tainted space. I was angry. I was upset. I’d been unfairly treated. But if you lift your head above the parapet, and talk about match-fixing, you’re unlikely to come off well.”
Lewis was often regarded as aloof or arrogant, especially during his fractious time at Nottinghamshire, which was so different to playing for Leicestershire and Surrey. “People asked: ‘Why do you have to have a fancy car? Are you trying to show you’re better than us?’ The answer was: ‘No – it’s because I want it. It’s not that deep.”
He laughs before becoming contrite again. “With hindsight, in their position, I would’ve had those same thoughts about me. We’re all in our sponsored cars but that’s not enough for you? From their perspective, it was me being a poseur and showing off.”
A thoughtful Lewis appears the opposite of a show-off today. Jail has also rubbed away at his identity. Under the rules of his early release his passport has been confiscated and now “I can’t call up my pension company and request the details of my pension. Unless I offer the relevant identity documents it seems that, essentially, I don’t exist.
The travel ban is four years so we’re halfway through. It’s not a moan – it’s a realisation. I hear that nice saying: ‘You’ve done your time so move on.’ But doing the time doesn’t end the consequences.”
Lewis is upset more by his belief that, having always fought against stereotypes, “I walked into the worst one of the black man ending up in jail. But I put myself there. If you wanted to get deep, I’d say it’s the pain of disappointing a whole race. I’m 100% sure every black person that knew me cringed when they heard about me in prison. The black community feels it’s judged as a whole because other people say: ‘See? We were right.’”
He is also pained by another racial stereotype which suggested he was “naturally athletic” but devoid of dedication. “That still prevails. I’m sensitive to the language and flippancy I still hear. Years ago people said: ‘These West Indians are so athletic, they’re natural fielders.’ But where are the great West Indies fielders now? Has God suddenly stopped giving that athleticism to the West Indies and passed it to everybody else? Other cricketers are just working harder. Back then black players felt it. You’re saying I haven’t had to put in any work? And then later you tell me how lazy I am?
“It ate away at me because there wasn’t space for an argument. People were 100% sure and you could only talk about it with other black athletes. If I bowled fast I would sometimes read I was like a ‘gangster’. But I put myself in a position where everybody who wrote those pieces can now say: ‘I told you so.’”
Lewis was a fine player and he worked hard to find his way as an immigrant into the heart of English cricket. “I wouldn’t necessarily use the word ‘consistent’,” he says of his Test career. “I had my days but I needed to develop consistency. I scored one Test hundred. Wouldn’t it have been nice if it was four?”
He was mainly a bowler who could bat and so he remembers his century, in India, with amusement. “It was one of those anomalies. I was compromised. I’d been out the night before because it was my birthday and I was dehydrated and didn’t feel 100%. I walked out with a lazy thought process: ‘I got out in the first innings for a duck. I’m not in the mood to muck around. My head is hurting so if he pitches it up I’m whacking him.’ I whacked him, it worked and I carried on. I wouldn’t call that perfect preparation.
“There were other days where you see the ball really well and you’re so disappointed not to have scored more. You think: ‘I need to apply myself, I need more mental strength. I didn’t play the ball. I played Shane Warne.’ As a bowler I’d say anything to a batsman – to give him more luggage to carry. The trick as a batsman is to stay light and focus on yourself. Over the course of my career the person who nailed that was Sachin Tendulkar. He never engaged in your shenanigans. I got him out a few times but he would not let me into his head.
“But we have to talk about Brian Lara. Brian was so greedy for runs. Who dreams of beating Garry Sobers’ [1958] record [of 365 runs in a Test innings]? Who wakes up and says: ‘Today I’m beating it’ [as Lara did against England when scoring 375 in 1994].
When it got beaten [by Matthew Hayden who scored 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003] Brian showed a different mindset to everybody on the planet: ‘I’ll score 400 in a Test and take back that world record.”
England suffered again in 2004 when Lara hit 400no. Lewis had been out of international cricket for six years but he was still remembered for bowling the ball in 1994 which allowed Lara to pass the Sobers landmark. “Everyone claimed I bowled a gimme but he actually stepped on his stumps [while hitting Lewis for four]. The bails flew up but dropped back in place. He could have been out for 362 but Brian’s will got him there.”
How did Lewis feel when, last week, West Indies beat England – after losing the series opener disastrously and being derided as the worst Test team in 50 years. “Everybody’s in shock,” Lewis says, grinning. “It’s great. I represented England but I’m of West Indian descent, so the last 20 years have been painful. You want West Indies performing to a standard we became accustomed to for so long. It was so nice watching this team perform to that level, especially as I’d been making jokes about the fact I’ve got a book signing on Saturday at Lord’s. I was wondering if the Test [starting on Thursday] would last that long. But they were tremendous. This wasn’t just a lucky win. Their challenge now is to do it again.”
Would he have enjoyed playing cricket today? “The IPL would have been made for me. Many of my issues were with fitting in and behaviour. That goes away if I’m self-employed. But here’s the flipside. I would love the IPL but everything is micro-managed and going out for a boogie at night would definitely be a no-no. How would I survive?”
Lewis laughs. “Maybe the 1980s and 90s were ideal for me. You were still allowed a good time. Now the perception in sport seems to be that, as I’m paying you so much money, your arse is mine. I’m not sure that would have worked with my mentality.”
He now plays club cricket in Bromley, south-east London – “the most challenging parts are the umpires and wickets but I’m enjoying playing again” – and away from the game Lewis is “trying lots of bits and bobs”, adding: “I coach when I can and I’ve been working in the office at a construction company in Nottingham.
I hope I can help younger people and I’ve got an interview coming up with the national prison agency and I’m also involved with my friend Colin Salmon , the actor, and his Cage Cricket scheme.”
In the meantime, there is lingering remorse he ended up in prison. “I’m not sure that ever goes away – until this becomes a happy story.
I would like to one day say: ‘Actually, I’m glad these things happened because, without it, I wouldn’t have reached X, Y, Z.’ I’m not at that point yet and I don’t know if you ever get there. Going to jail is never a blessing because it’s uncomfortable but perhaps those lessons could help you and everybody around you. So I hope, one day, to get rid of that stigma. But until then all you can do is keep moving, keep trying.” - theguardian
