Ex-soldier held for attempted murder

Pannala Police recently arrested an ex-soldier possessing firearms at Kurunegala. It is suspected that he had planned to assassinate an Urban Councillor in the district.
The suspect is a 37-year-old resident of Horana with underworld affiliations. He had previously been arrested for homicide as well, police said.
The suspect was produced before the Kuliyapitiya Magistrate last Sunday. Investigations are continuing.
