Reconstruct the commuter shelters

With the development of the A6 road, 15 commuter shelters which were erected between Dambulla and Galewela were removed by the Road Development Authority causing inconveniences to the public.
Part of these shelters were set up to commemorate the fallen war heroes by their relatives during the war.
Relatives of the war heroes charged that by removing these shelters erected, the authorities have disrespected these fallen war heroes who sacrificed their lives to protect the sovereignty of the country.
However, due to the removal of these shelters, commuters waiting for buses are facing many difficulties.
They urge the government to reconstruct these commuter shelters in suitable places along this road.
