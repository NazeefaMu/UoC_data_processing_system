Pharmacy owners’ issues will be solved soon: Rajitha

The problems faced by pharmacy owners due to price reduction of 48 drugs will be solved soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister, some pharmacy owners say they are making losses due to the price reduction.
“I will intervene to solve the issue of receiving commissions and the loss making issues, he said. He was addressing the Galle District Pharmacy Entrepreneurs Association Annual General Meeting in Galle recently.
Minister Senaratne said the prices were reduced after 45 years, and the sales of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has gone up by 20 percent after the reduction. The government annually spends Rs. 72 billion to treat patients who fall sick by smoking. Therefore, the tax on tobacco was increased by 90 percent, he said.
Fifty five percent of the population obtain medical treatment from the state sector while only 45 percent visit the private sector. More people visit the state sector because free health service is fully implemented now, he said.
