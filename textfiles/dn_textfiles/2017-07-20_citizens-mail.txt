Citizens' Mail

CHILDREN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO BASIC THINGS
As parents, it is difficult for parents to let children do their own things. Children want to have fun. But as parents we want them to be safe, polite and clean.
However, children really need to have their own space if they are going to be successful in life.
They need to learn how to perform tasks for themselves.
Rules should be part of every child’s life. But too many rules can limit their creativity and growth.
We must allow children to do following basic things.
We must allow them to eat by themselves. This will help them to learn important skills that they will need for the rest of their lives. They will also gain confidence from knowing they can use a spoon.
Parents should let kids help with household tasks. As children get older, helping with work allows them to learn responsibility and how to take care of themselves.
We must allow children to express their creativity. We must allow children to paint whatever they want.
So allow children to do creative things like painting or handcraft.
We must allow them to say what they think. Children need be able to say what they think about certain situations. By learning how to express their feelings about certain situations, they will be able to grow up into better prepared adults with good communication skills.
We must allow children to have fun and get dirty. Kids need to have fun in order to learn. Much of what kids learn happens during playtime. They explore the world around them, develop social skills and develop emotionally.
Many children who are not allowed to play freely when they are younger will have harder time adjusting when they are older.
These things children should be able to do. So do not try to control children too much.
