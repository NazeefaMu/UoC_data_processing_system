‘SLFP should contest LG polls with JO’

Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera yesterday stated that the SLFP should contest upcoming local government election with Joint Opposition for the betterment of the country and the general public.
“We won’t oppose two parties contesting together at the local government election if the President agrees not to bring new constitution, not to sell public property and uncover the real culprits of the bond issue and take strict legal action against them,” the Thera said.
The statement was made yesterday during the ‘Mawbima Surakime Jathika Balawegaya’s media briefing held at the Abayaramaya Temple in Narahenpita.The Thera said the members of the Mawbima Surakime Jathika Balawegaya met the President twice to discuss the matter, but he has not yet expressed his views.
“Abhayaramaya has a history of uniting the SLFP. Even during the period of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike, we united the party. So we continue discussing the matter with the President,” the Thera said.
Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera said the government was trying to bring a new constitution not essential to the country.
"The Country needs peace among all communities, not a new constitution.
A document cannot build unity among nations. The unity will come in the conversion of our heart. The unity comes with love and faith," the Thera said.
Ravana Balaya General Secretary Ven. Ittekande Saddhatissa Thera spoke.
