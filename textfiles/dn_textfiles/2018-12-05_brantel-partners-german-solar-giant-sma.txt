Brantel partners with German solar giant SMA

Brantel Lanka Limited has announced its appointment as an authorised distributor in Sri Lanka for SMA Solar Technology AG of Germany, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of solar power inverters, strengthening the company’s status as a provider of technology solutions from global brands.
Solar inverters are a vital element in the harnessing and use of renewable energy from the sun, converting direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC) that can be fed into the national grid.
As authorised distributor for SMA, the brand that is believed to already have a 30 to 40 per cent market share in the solar power industry in Sri Lanka, Brantel said it would play a vital role in expediting solar power installations by maintaining stocks of inverters and providing replacement units for those undergoing servicing.
The company’s offering would encompass inverters for single as well as three-phase power supply ranging from 3kW to 60kW with a five-year manufacturer’s warranty extendable to 20 years, catering to small domestic systems and large commercial or industrial systems in the Megawatt range.
“There are about 300 solar power providers in Sri Lanka that need quick access to inverters to respond to the growing demand for solar power in our country,” a spokesman for Brantel Lanka said. “This is the market that we will serve with SMA.”
Among the popular models of SMA solar inverters Brantel will offer is the ‘Sunny Boy’ 3.0 and 5.0 ideal for solar power generation in homes. This inverter offers ease and comfort for photovoltaic (PV) system operators and installers. The automatic inverter monitoring by SMA analyses inverter operation and immediately informs the installer of irregularities, ensuring optimum service and maximum system availability.
The ‘Sunny Tripower’ 6000TL and 10000TL are three-phase inverters suited for homes as well as the higher power outage range. Highly flexible with their proven Optiflex technology, they deliver maximum yields with a 98% efficiency rating and offer shade management with OptiTrac Global Peak. These devices are communicative and offer the benefit of a direct Sunny Portal connection via SMA Webconnect.
The ‘Sunny Tripower’ 15000TL, 20000TL and 25000TL are the ideal inverters for large-scale commercial and industrial plants. Not only do they deliver extraordinary high yields with an efficiency of 98.4 %, they also offer design flexibility and compatibility with many PV modules, thanks to their multistring capabilities and wide input voltage range. They come with cutting-edge grid management functions such as Integrated Plant Control, which allow the inverters to regulate reactive power at the point of common coupling.
Another revolutionary SMA product offered by Brantel Lanka is the ‘Sunny Tripower Core1’ which is the world’s first free-standing string inverter for decentralised rooftop and ground-based PV systems as well as covered parking spaces. Its groundbreaking new design allows reductions in installation time by up to 60%, while also lowering the total cost of ownership.

The Group has subsidiaries in four continents by 20 sales subsidiaries and service subsidiaries or service partners.
