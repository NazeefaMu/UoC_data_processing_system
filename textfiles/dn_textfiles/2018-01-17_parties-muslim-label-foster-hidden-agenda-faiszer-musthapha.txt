Parties with Muslim label foster hidden agenda: Faiszer Musthapha

“Certain parties with a Muslim label tell one thing to the public while having a hidden agenda and they were trying to mislead the public.
The racist parties were selling the Muslim religion and was involved in a massive fraud on the innocent population and would finally join the government after obtaining money,” Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He was addressing a meeting in support of Former Pradeshiya Sabha member of Malwana Anwer to assure the victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in the Local Government elections in Malwana of the Gampaha District yesterday.
“Such politics was of no use and religion was purely personal,” he said. The Minister said Sinhala people elected him during the last two elections.
“If you do not want to vote for us, vote for any other national party other than the racist parties. The Sinhalese Muslims and Tamils are all living together and the Muslims will get destroyed by voting for the racist Muslim parties,” the Minister said.
“Some people say Biyagama is a UNP stronghold. This was Ranil Wickremasinghe’s electorate,” he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has proved that he was protecting all the races. “Your valuable vote will usher in a powerful United People’s Freedom Alliance,” the Minister said.
“We can develop the district further. Therefore, I request you to support Anwer in this election,” he said.
The Minister spoke at many SLFP meetings in Malwana on the day.
