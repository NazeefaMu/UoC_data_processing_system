Sri Lankan living in Sharjah  jumps off building, family commits suicide

 
A Sri Lankan man jumped to his death while his wife and their son committed suicide in a hotel apartment in Sharjah, police said.
The incident, which police described as a “planned group suicide”, happened on August 29 in the hotel apartment that they have occupied for more than a year.
Police identified the deceased Sri Lankans as J.K., 55, who was a gold designer in Dubai, his wife B.S., 54, and their son J.N., 19. Their bodies have been transferred to the Al Kuwaiti hospital for autopsy.
Two women in the group survived the suicide attempt. Police identified them as the woman’s 17-year-old niece, D.I., and her 27-year-old sister, P.I.
The Sri Lankan women were treated at Al Kuwaiti hospital before being transferred to Obaidallah Hospital in Ras Al Khaimah for psychological assessment.
Police said that on August 29, they received a call from a witness that a man had jumped off the 7th floor of the building at 2:30am.
Police and forensic experts who responded to the call said the man’s body had landed on the bonnet of a parked car.
Inside the apartment, police found B.S., D.I. and P.I. lying in a pool of blood, with their wrists slashed. On the ground, covered in white sheet, lay the young man’s body.
Police also found various kinds of medicines and cups containing red liquid and small white balls on the table.
Initial investigation suggests that the young man died first, followed by the women’s suicide attempts. The father of the family was the last to commit suicide.
According to reports, the family had stayed in the apartment for more than a year on a monthly rent of Dh6,250.
The woman reportedly approached the hotel apartment owner for a rent reduction and was given a new rate of Dh5,750. She reportedly told the building owner that her husband has not received his salary for three months and that he was also conned by a foreigner.
Investigations into the incident are continuing
