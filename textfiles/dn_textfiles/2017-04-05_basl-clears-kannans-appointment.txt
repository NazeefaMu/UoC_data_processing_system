BASL clears Kannan's appointment

An expert committee appointed to look into the controversial appointment of High Court Judge R.Kannan has informed the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) that there was no just cause in asking for the removal of the judge under the Constitution.
BASL Secretary, Attorney-at-Law Amal Randeniya speaking to the Daily News said the BASL could only intervene if the appointment was unconstitutional.
“The expert committee consisting of past presidents pointed out that there was no point in us asking for his removal as the High Court Judge had not violated any conditions set out in Article 111 (2) of the Constitution which outlines the reasons upon which a High Court Judge could be removed,” he said. He added that if the President was to remove Kannan without due cause, it would set a bad precedence.
In accordance with the Constitution, a disciplinary committee would need to be appointed to investigate into the Judge and his actions before any recommendations for his removal are made.
The Judicial Services Association (JSA) in the meantime on April 1 unanimously adopted five resolutions seeking the removal of Kannan from the position of High Court Judge.
The expert committee however has asked that in future, there be set criteria when appointing members of the Private Bar to the High Court.
“They have given us some recommendations on that and we expect to table it at our Executive Committee meeting on 5 April”, said Randeniya.
The expert committee consisted of; Upul Jaysuriya, Ikram Mohamed, Romesh de Silva, Upali Gunaratna, Nihal Jayamanne, Ajitha Athukorale,W.Dayaratna, Faiz Musthapha and K. Kanageeswaran.
