I am sure both teams will play positive cricket to bring excitement for both young and old Peterites and Josephians. I wish both schools the best of luck.”

I wish both the schools the very best to deliver two days of exhilarating cricket” said Rev. Father Travis Gabriel, rector of St. Joseph’s College.
