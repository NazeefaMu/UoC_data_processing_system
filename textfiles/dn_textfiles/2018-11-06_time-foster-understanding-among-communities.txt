Deepavali messages
Time to foster understanding among communities

Today marks Deepavali – the festival of lights. Deepavali underscores the great spiritual values of Hinduism, and is an occasion for Hindus to strive for greater spirituality, foster understanding among communities, and promote harmony among people.
According to the Hindu tradition, this day commemorates the triumph of Lord Krishna over the demon Naraksura and the bringing of light and blessings to this world.
Hindu devotees in Sri Lanka celebrate Deepavali by engaging in religious observances. The festival of Deepavali symbolises the victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.
I convey my warmest felicitations to all Hindu devotees in Sri Lanka on this joyous occasion.
