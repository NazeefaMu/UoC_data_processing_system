GMOA continues strike even as dengue patients increase

 
The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to continue until further notice the strike begun this morning, even as hospitals struggle to deal with the increase in dengue patients.
The GMOA launched a strike this morning in protest of Police action against university students protesting the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) at the Ministry of Health premises yesterday.
Over 90 university students were injured in the clash with the Special Task Force (STF) and the Police, in a tussle that saw water cannons used in force against the protesting students, attached to the Inter University Students’ Union (IUSF).
Sri Lanka has seen a spike in dengue cases in the first six months of the year with over 65, 987 contracting, and over 200 people dying of the viral fever, against the figures for last year, which stood at 54, 727 and 78 deaths.
