NARA refutes fishing community allegations

A scientific research carried out by NARA into allegations levelled by the fishing community that there is a natural rock reef in the deep sea, from where sand is taken for the earth filling of the Colombo International Financial City, has revealed that there was no such rock reef.
The sea sand is acquired for the Colombo International Financial City project from a deep sea area nearly 10 kilometres off the Negombo coastal area.
The fishing community of the Negombo area, had been claiming that the natural rock reef at the place where sand was taken, could be damaged when sucking in sea sand.
The Western Province and Mega Polis Development Ministry sought the assistance of NARA to launch a scientific research into the issue and ascertain whether there was a natural rock reef in the said sea area.
The scientific research report in this regard was issued by NARA two weeks ago and the report has clearly mentioned that there was no rock reef in that particular sea area.
