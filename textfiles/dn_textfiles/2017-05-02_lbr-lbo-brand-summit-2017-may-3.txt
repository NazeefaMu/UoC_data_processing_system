LBR LBO Brand Summit 2017 on May 3

Lanka Business Online, LBO, will be hosting the fifth consecutive annual edition of LBR LBO Brand Summit on May 3, Wednesday at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
“LBO has earned a fine reputation as Sri Lanka’s foremost conference host on technology, marketing, management, infrastructure and economy. LBR LBO Brand Summit, over a period of five years, has now become the most sought after thought leadership engagement on transforming marketing through technology and analytics. The LBR LBO Brand Summit provides a forum for corporate executives from all branches of industry, business and academia to gain insights to how digital could be leveraged to redefine, re-imagine, and reinvent the relationship between brands and consumers,” said Lakshaman Bandaranayake, Founder & Director of Lanka Business Online (LBO) and Summit Curator.
Bandaranayake further added, “This year’s edition of LBR LBO Brand Summit will provoke participants to rethink marketing, both as a business philosophy and a business function. In today’s context, is the obsession with customer satisfaction a sound business philosophy, if it creates collateral damage to other stakeholders and to the nature?” The summit will also question whether the 20th century practices of marketing are capable of delivering business results, today and tomorrow”
