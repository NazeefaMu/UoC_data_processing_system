School canteens close due to unsuitable food

Government health authorities of Galagamuwa, Kurunegala have taken steps to close two school canteens as they were violating rules and regulations of the Ministry of Education for canteen owners over the safety of students.
The school canteens at Galagamuwa U. B. Wanninayake National School and Ehetuwewa Bandaranaike Navodya School were ordered to be closed down as they sold unfit food items to students.
Chandana Herath, the Administrative PHI of Galagamuwa, Kurunegala confirmed this and added that more raids will be conducted in Kurunegala District schools within the next two weeks.
All school principals in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts have been instructed by the Ministry of Education to ensure the quality of food at school canteens as 15 percent of students are reported to be suffering from diabetics and other ailments due to the consumption of junk food and unfit food items, he said.
He added that owners of canteens at Ehetuwewa and Galagamuwa Divisional Secretariats of the Kurunegala District too were nabbed by PHIs over the sale of unfit food items.
