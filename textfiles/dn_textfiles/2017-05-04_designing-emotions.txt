Designing Emotions!

Over the centuries, the builder has been partnering with the client to create something uniquely fitted to the lifestyle of the client. However there is much more to architecture. It affects the lives of other users as well. Arch World features Archt. Priyan Hettipathirana who revealed that it is indeed multi- dimensional.
“Architects should address issues of global warming. As we know construction industry contributes more than 50% of the CO2 emission in the world. This happens during the construction and then by the energy consumed in running buildings. So this shows that correct design decisions can help reduce energy wastage. This same thing applies to rapid urbanization. Urbanization demands new architecturally designed buildings and therefore the architect has a main role to play,” explained Hettipathirana.

Messenger of hope
Indeed the builder is in many ways a messenger of hope.
“There was a project which involved designing 12 schools for the tsunami affected children island-wide. Most of these schools had to be re-built from scratch and the architectural designs had to be finalized for the schools to be started for construction within a short span of time as the children did not have a place to study and they were housed in temporary arrangements. The schools were spread over 8 districts and a few were located in the east in the war affected areas at that time. I visited all of these schools with my project team and spoke to each and every school with the teachers, students, local people and the education authorities before designing what I felt is best suited for them.

Even though Sri Lanka is a small country we have diversity in culture, religion and ethnicity. It was interesting to deal with a wide range of diversity in one project and design to make each school unique,” said Hettipathirana
Architecture is a creative process. A creative process always makes you see things in a completely different way, in a new form or understanding. The outcome can be unique which you may want to refer to as “out of the box”.
Wide subject
“There is a lot to learn in architecture. It is a very wide subject being one of the oldest professions. One of the most valuable lessons I have learnt in the field of architecture is to understand that there has to be a certain composition, balance and proportion for things to ideally fit in place. This is a qualitative aspect which I try to apply in a design at different levels. These levels can be at urban scale, group of buildings, individual building or even at building element level,” pointed out Hettipathirana.
Sri Lanka has been called - ‘Pearl of the Orient’ and pearl it is!
“Sri Lanka is a tropical country and also an island. We have abundant sunshine right through out. We also have monsoon wind patterns which are seasonal. Architectural designs have to respond to both sun and wind in order to provide an environment that is comfortable. A good design can handle sun light and wind inside and outside the building, concentrating on the positive aspects and protect against the negative aspects. This can be done by adding different elements to a design that can also modify or shape it,” stated Hettipathirana.
Memorable experience
An architectural design can use a wall and even the color of the wall to give the user a memorable experience when they are using a space.
“In a tropical country for example a wall as a design element can act as a protective element against sun or wind by being solid and thick, or be more friendly by way of having openings that permit it. The color of the wall can also help by giving your eye some comfort by cutting glare.
Trees are very important to the environment. We must try to protect and grow trees where ever possible. When we plan an architectural design we must try to work around the trees and at the same time do the design in such way it will allow growing of more trees,” added Hettipathirana.
Students in architecture must always be observant about the man made and the natural environment. There is always a lot to learn from both.
“Every individual person or place has an identity. The identity is gained through their association with art, sculpture, culture, religion, career but architecture is what glorifies them. That is why the history or heritage of a place, is showcased through its tangible heritage out of which one is architecture,” informed Hettipathirana As humans, we address deeper human needs, such as the need for rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security. But we can also pursue prestigious images and symbols of a consumerist culture.
“Architecture is not always cheap. It is about quality and a value addition to life. It makes places better and allow for social development. But it can also be simple and bold giving comfort and a wonderful experience for those who are using it,” shared Hettipathirana.
Every architectural creation has a life span. This can apply to both the architecturally designed building and also the purpose for it was built. Both of these can be regenerated or conserved for future generations. If not it can give life for the new creation and activity.
“Every architectural creation deals with emotions of the user. One of the basic things people are sensitive is to protection -essentially from the external elements of sun, wind and rain. That how shelter began and it developed into architecture. There are more things like security and privacy, that a person would be sensitive to, and architecturally these things are addressed to make the designs more functional,” pointed out Hettipathirana.
Balance
An architect needs to balance so many factors. He must address - how you create a work of timeless beauty, making it timeless while making it a joy to live in and while satisfying the client’s requirements and at the same time being practical and logical and also keeping to regulations. “Architectural designs with correct proportion, balance and composition, will remain timeless in its beauty. A good architectural design should be functional as it is designed for human use based on their activity needs. There are also regulations and standards followed in an architectural design process to make it function better,” explained Hettipathirana
“I follow a style which is modern and that suits the tropical. In a tropical environment we need a combination of indoor and outdoor spaces. These spaces are comfortable to live and spend time. Open verandahs and court yards and long eves and tiled roofs are mainly suitable for our environments. Yet the way we approach a design also will depend on the site we are given and the challenges we face accordingly. Each site is a different exercise.”
Sri Lanka has a heritage and culture second to none.
“I think social development is a main outcome of good architecture. Spiritual development is also part of social development. Spiritual development takes place in religious buildings.
There are many examples in our great heritage. There is a lot of importance given to these religious places in the past and I feel that this same importance has to be there and continued in the same way suiting today’s context,” summed up Hettipathirana.
