Square44 the International Branding and Packaging Design Agency, once again partnered another important Brand from the Hemas Holdings FMCG portfolio, with their re-launch.

Square44 is no stranger to our company as they have played an instrumental role in several other major brand relaunches, we have undertaken in the recent past. We are happy with the outcome of this challenging project and are confident it will have a great impact. The team from Square44 has integrated with our Brand team extensively, ensuring they understand the Brand, the consumer and the market context fully, before embarking on the design journey and delivering solutions that create impact”

However, the detailed approach we follow always adds value to large portfolio re-launches such as these and ensures results are delivered that win in the market place. We are happy to have been a part of this really important revamp of the Baby Cheramy brand
