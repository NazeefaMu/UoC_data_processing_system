Money laundering case against Namal and others fixed for further trial

The case filed against Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others under the Money Laundering Act was yesterday fixed for further trial on November 30 by Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon.
The defence counsel concluded the cross-examination of main witness Rohan Abey Iriyagolla, Chairman of Boston Capital Pvt Ltd.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against six accused for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs. 30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited.
Four accused Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation (Pvt) Ltd were present in court when the case was taken up before the Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused Indika Karunajeewa was not present in Court but was represented by his attorneys.
On a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed with the trial in absentia of the second and sixth accused in the case in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
On another occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs. 30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to SriLankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa, while being an MP, had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited, from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana, and Jayantha Weerasinghe, PC, appeared for Namal Rajapaksa. President's Counsel Anil de Silva appeared for the third accused.
