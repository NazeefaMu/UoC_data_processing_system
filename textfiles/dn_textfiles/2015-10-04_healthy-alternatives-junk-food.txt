Healthy alternatives to junk food

Here are a few healthy alternatives that you can use to make tasty tidbits at home
CORN
Corn is rich in carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and other minerals. Sweet or baby corn can be used in salads, soups as well as in sandwiches. Mix it with chaat for a lip-smacking treat with loved ones.
MULTIGRAIN BREAD
These can be good and wholesome food for your kids as well as elderly people at home. Low-calorie and sugar-free baked items like wheat biscuits and high-fibre cookies could be yummy alternatives to bakery products, which contain more sugar.
FRESH JUICE
Ditch artificially sweetened drinks for freshly made fruit and vegetable juices at home to maintain good healthy and supple skin. Lassi and tender coconut could also work wonders for your skin and ease digestion.
RICE NOODLES, WHOLE-WHEAT PASTA
A plate of thin rice noodles, peppered by your favourite vegetables can taste better than the ones you eat at restaurants.
Try home-made pasta and wheat pizza crust without butter or cheese to give a tasty surprise to your taste buds.
MASALA PAPAD
Everyone can have their own recipe when it comes to eat masala papad. The choice of salads and spices to spread on this thin crust is yours. Different types of khakras could be a perfect combination with your evening tea or coffeee.
STARTERS OR APPETIZERS
Get rid of packaged frozen ready-to-cook snack items like French fries, nuggets, corns and opt for home-made crispies like potato chips, onion rings and different varieties of salads.
PUFFED RICE
Plain or roasted puffed rice could be a delightful evening treat. Spice it up with crushed papri, sprouts, mint and tamarind chutney at home.
HOME-MADE SWEETS
Puddings made at home with nuts and dry fruits like almonds and pistachios as toppings could be your sweet somethings at home -Times of India
