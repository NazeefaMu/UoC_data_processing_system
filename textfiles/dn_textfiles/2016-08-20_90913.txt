Only 2 ‘A’ division schools from Kandy
With Kandy Sports Club dominating rugby in the country, Kandy schools failed to do well last season, only two teams have now qualified to play in the next “A” division, Trinity and St. Anthony’s. Schools like Kingswood, Vidyartha, Dharmaraja and St. Sylvester’s are in the lower division. Where has things gone gone wrong for the other schools Today more than any sport rugby has a good following, at school level it is the biggest spectator game. Rugby is one of the most popular ball games in schools, but today most of the schools are finding it difficult to keep it going. The Schools Rugby Association has apparently no control and it has become necessary for the Education Ministry to step into the scrum.
