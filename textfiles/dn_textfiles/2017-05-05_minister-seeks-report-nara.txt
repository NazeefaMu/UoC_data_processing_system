Minister seeks report from NARA

High voltage bulbs rot fish sooner:
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Development Mahinda Amaraweera on Tuesday directed the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to conduct research on high voltage bulbs affecting fish kept for sale by making them rot earlier than scheduled and submit a report to him.
It has been revealed that high voltage bulbs used at fish stalls and sales centres adversely affected fish kept for sale by making them rot earlier than scheduled
The minister issued this directive at a ministry progress review meeting held at the ministry premises. It was revealed that the brightness of these high voltage bulbs fixed at fish stalls obscured the view making it difficult for customers to see the condition of the fish kept for sale.
