Govt. must declare stand on SAITM to SC: GMOA

There is only one option left for President Maithripala Sirisena if the current Health Minister does not extend his support to solve the SAITM issue by accepting the Government’s stand on SAITM and acting on it. That is the appointment of a new Health Minister as requested by the Mahanayake Theras, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said the Government has failed to present its declared stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court yesterday (November 13) and the Government should definitely present its declared stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court on November 21.
“This should be done through the Attorney General’s Department but the current Lawyer who has been assigned for the job does not do it purposely,” the GMOA Secretary alleged.
According to Dr. Aluthge, if the Government fails to do so for the second time on November 21, the SAITM issue will affect the country. The Government should inform the Supreme Court through the Attorney General’s Department that it abolished the SAITM and the rest of of the proposals declared to the country. “President Maithripala Sirisena should have the power to overpower Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Lakshman Kiriella who always have a pro-SAITM stand which is now completely opposite to the Government’s stand. Former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake clearly violated both the Medical Council Ordinance No.24 of 1924 and the University Act No.16 of 1978,” Dr. Aluthge alleged.
