I love this meows-ic!

This kitten may be young, but it seems she’s ready to hit a nightclub.
The very cute pet has been filmed bopping her head perfectly in time to techno music as she hangs out in her living room on a red checkered blanket.
Winnie is one of six abandoned kittens fostered by the same family, and luckily, they are only too happy to nurture her love for music. Feline funky? Kitten never misses a beat listening to dance music

In the footage she tips her head back and turns her head from side to side as she matches the beat with her moves.
The effect is highly comical as she appears to instinctively know how to boogie with the techno tune.
She lies down at one point but as the beat picks up she soon gets to her feet and bobs enthusiastically.
A highlight of her dancing performance is when the moggy lifts a paw up and pumps the air with it, just like an energised disco dancer.
Viewers have loved the footage, which is believed to have been filmed in America, and uploaded to Facebook by Shelter Cats and Kittens - a community which shares photos and videos of shelter cats and kittens in order to promote fostering and adoption.

‘This baby is so smart, full of rhythm, cute and precious!! Glad you posted; it’s a pleasure to watch!!! I love the song too,’ one said of Winnie’s talents.
‘Too cute! Just sooo adorable. Had me laughing, encouraging her,’ another wrote.
However many people have pointed out that it is far more likely that the cat is following a laser or toy operated by their owner behind the camera.
One viewer said: ‘Obviously done with some sort of cat toy.... but... she’s freaking adorable.’ ‘Someone is waving an object over the kitty’s head. still cute,’ another conceded. - Daily Mail
