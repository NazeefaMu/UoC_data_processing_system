Pulse Light Festival illuminates Hong Kong

The Hong Kong Pulse Light Festival is showcasing 18 creative light art installations and an enhanced version of ‘A Symphony of Lights’.
The festival is bringing to residents and visitors the “International Lighting Art Dispaly”, including 14 creative light art installations from around the world, and four creations by Hong Kong-based artists. The artworks are divided into three categories: technology and communication, childhood dreams and connections and romance.
The festival, co-organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) and the Tourism Commission, will run until 24 February 2019.
