Painter in a  retrospective plain

 
Born in 1947 at Weligama, Matara, S H Sarath is one of the remarkable painters who emerged in Sri Lanka. His works of art are unique and extremely meaningful. Sarath belongs to the post-independent generation of Sri Lankan artists. After completing a five-year course in painting at the Government School of Fine Arts (1968-1973) he followed postgraduate studies in art at the Silpakon University in Thailand under a UNESCO fellowship. Thereafter he completed a course in printmaking at the University of South Australia, Adelaide, in 1995.
Sarath's art is impressive. He reflects thousands of thoughts through a single painting. Once again he is going to exhibit his talents. Sarath has come up with a new collection of his paintings which carries out some provisional social themes and issues. Sarath's drawings are full of social consciousness, satire, sarcasm, irony and multi-religious philosophy. Each and every drawing portrays a thematic content which is very topical. He tries to highlight aspects of the prevailing society through his paintings. He has held a large number of both international and local painting exhibitions.
Sarath's inborn talent is marvellous and very unique. His art ranges from 18th century's traditional Sinhala art as well as those of contemporary Western art. At the beginning of his career, he has worked as a costume designer and a make-up artist as well.
Sarath’s latest painting exhibition titled ‘Retrospective’ will be held at the JDA Perera Gallery on July 4 and 5. The painting exhibition marks 50 years of Sarath’s career as a painter.
