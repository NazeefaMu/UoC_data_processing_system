Minister resolves foreign tennis coach’s issue, for now

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara called upon a meeting with the Sri Lanka Tennis Association officials at the Sports Ministry yesterday to sort out the controversial sacking of Dutch coach Eric Pietersz by SLTA before his contract termination.
Pietersz was contracted for two years by SLTA and his contract is due to expire at the end of December 2017.
Pietersz was contracted for a national level program by SLTA and the problems erupted when SLTA decided to terminate his service midway citing that he failed to meet their expectations and also on a disciplinary matter.
The Minister made several recommendations to sort out this dragging problem between the SLTA and a group of parents whose children are training under Pietersz.
The Minister requested SLTA to extend Pietersz’s services for another two-three months and evaluate his progress.
He also appointed a ministry representative to coordinate issues between parents and SLTA. The Sports Minister assured SLTA that his Ministry would continuously fund Rs 200,000 per month for Pietersz’s coaching and recommended an increase of 25 percent on players’ fee to be borne by the parents to continue the coaching program. The Minister also met some parents who were present soon after the meeting and apprised them of the decisions taken.
After the meeting SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick said, on the request of Sports Minister, SLTA will sign a new contract with Pietersz for the evaluation period and continuation of the program will depend on how successful his coaching will be as there has been a gradual decline of students over a period.
“We thank the Minister for reducing SLTA’s burden by increasing parents’ share of the fees and help us reach an amicable settlement on this issue,” said Patrick.
