WITHER ENGLISH LITERATURE FROM RURAL LANDSCAPE?

Great many students, parents, teachers and other literary enthusiasts who came to me the other day wanted me to air their views in the national press on the above matter of national importance without delay due to many a reason. Immediately after my return from Australia after my sojourn there, they were troubling my life out to register their protest against an injustice they had had to endure in silence as most of the English teachers who handle the subject at the school level seem to be unable to write to a national newspaper on behalf of their children. Therefore the writer thought of writing to the newspaper with the largest readership to take this crucial matter for discussion across the country. In a sense, I have the right to do so as I have perpetually pointed out many a defect in question paper methodology since the new syllabus came into effect in 2011.
One such article written by me is on sidelining of John Dryden and Alexander Pope in the A/L question paper since the beginning of the syllabus, because of that they had given a context question on Dryden’s poem for eight marks where they could easily do justice to the above poets by setting an essay type question. They had given Shakespeare a number of times, the same question projected in round about ways.
I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities would wake up from their slumber and come forward for a national debate on this matter giving an opportunity to the victimized parties to submit their diatribe to have a redress. The million dollar question is that why the veteran teachers are keeping silence when their students are getting deprived of the opportunity of entering the university in an age the country needs more and more English graduates and anglophiles.
English writers
In the wake of the colonial rule Queen’s lingo became very popular among the locals for many a reason. The first and the foremost was that it was the passport for white collar jobs. The administrative machinery demanded efficient administrators with a sound knowledge in English. English language became the lingua franca in the postmodern Sri Lanka in course of time. English literature acquired its due place in the national curriculum with the passage of time. Passage to India became our constant reader and thus English Literature enjoyed pride of place in the society even though it took some time to come to the rural schools.
The results of English Literature at the G.C.E. (O/L) examination marked a steady progress through the years and the newly passed out English trained teacher from the teachers’ colleges and the few graduates from the universities took the task as their national responsibility paving the way for a new set of writers in English.
I personally feel unhappy about the tragedy of the low past rate of students as the rural students seem to have been affected deplorably. It seems a sudden phenomenon. Galle and Matara districts which could boast of a number of A passes during the last decade have not scored a single A pass this time. Why is the sudden downfall? Have those veteran teachers who had been leaving no stone unturned to guide their students to score A passes been suddenly transferred to Colombo and Kandy districts? I heard on the school grapevine that the marking panels had been consisted of only university dons, not the practicing A/L classroom teachers. I do not have the slightest hesitation that their standard of English could have been lower, they are the masters. There are some veteran professors that even by reading the prescribed texts before one week could produce marking with surgical accuracy. Yet, new brooms sweep well, old ones know the corners! The sudden downward trend of the results away from the capital and salubrious Kandy spontaneously raises our eyebrows.
Equal opportunities in education
The tragic fall would compel the students to go to other subjects. The number of ordinary passes at the periphery would not augur well for the future of the subject. Under these circumstances a fair and impartial investigation into this matter would encourage the rural children to learn English literaturefor their degree at the university.
Teaching and learning English literature gathered momentum during the last decade as it took the children’s future to dizzy heights. Most of the students who offered English literature became attorneys at law, diplomats, writers, critics and good translators to meet the demand of the nation. Equal opportunities in education are a fundamental right in a just society.
I wonder how the curve of the unusual behaviour of the A/L English literature results been given in the final analysis of the data for future purposes. It seems the time is ripen to reconsider the question paper methodology and marking pattern of this subject for the good of the students, leniency towards them is not unjustifiable.
