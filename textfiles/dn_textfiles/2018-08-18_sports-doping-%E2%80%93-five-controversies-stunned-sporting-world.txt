Sports Doping – Five Controversies that Stunned the Sporting World

The plethora of sports that people watch keeps them entertained. The thrills at times are so suspenseful that they send our blood rate soaring high.
Sports of different kinds produce legends and create legacies that are hard-earned, setting an example for the next generation to follow.
However, every sporting event has another side to it that leaves lasting blemishes not just on the sportsperson, but on its religious followers, too.
Doping in sports, otherwise referred to as use of performance enhancing drugs, has created numerous controversies.
Earlier in November 2014, world’s top badminton player Lee Chong Wei failing a dope test sent out a clear message – no sport is free of drugs.
In the light of this incident, we take a look at major doping controversies that left a lifelong scar on the sport in picture as well as its fans –
1. DIEGO MARADONA-(FOOTBALL)
Diego Maradona is renowned for being one of the best football players in the game’s history. His ‘Hand of God’ incident during the 1986 FIFA World Cup is not the only story that generated controversy. At a later stage, in 1994, he was tested positive for ephedrine, a performance enhancer and a banned substance, at the same time. After the game against Nigeria, where he lasted full 90 minutes, Maradona was asked to provide a urine sample. Five days later, when the reports came, it was declared that the Argentine had failed the test.
2. SHANE WARNE-(CRICKET)
Cricket is another sport that has been marred with doping controversies. It was during the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup when Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne was sent home from the tournament for failing a dope test. The drugs responsible for his fate were hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Following the scandal, Warne was suspended from all forms of cricket over the next year. The player, in turn, claimed himself as being a victim of anti-doping hysteria, suggesting that his mother had given him the pills.
3. MARION JONES-(SPRINTING)
Marion Jones of the United States is a track and field athlete, who won five medals at the Sydney Summer Olympics, including three gold medals. In late 2004, the International Olympic Committee carried out research concerning Jones on whether she used steroids. Considered the world’s greatest female athlete at the time, she strongly denied all allegations, but eventually admitted to using steroids for two years starting 1999. As a result, she was stripped of all the hard-earned titles.
4. ALEX RODRIGUEZ-(BASEBALL)
One of the most popular Major League Baseball players, Alex Rodriguez, was involved in a doping scandal in 2014. Apparently, the New York Yankees star admitted to the same, as a result of which he was banned from the 2014 MLB season. Getting an insight into the same led the anti-doping boss calling Rodriguez’s substance use the most potent example ever.
5. LANCE ARMSTRONG-(CYCLING)
Lance Armstrong has been a role model to many youngsters around the world. Well, not anymore. The legendary cyclist admitting to using performance enhancing drugs is seen as one of the darkest moments in sports history.
Apparently, he had a very capable racket that assisted him in cheating any form of drug test resulting in him appearing free of drugs at all times. Nevertheless, after constant grilling by the officials and the media, he admitted to taking banned substances during an interview with Oprah Winfrey.
