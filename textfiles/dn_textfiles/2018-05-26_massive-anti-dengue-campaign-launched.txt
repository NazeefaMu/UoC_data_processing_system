Massive anti-dengue campaign launched

Due to the inclement weather in Batticaloa, the MOH has informed that the threat of Dengue has risen. The Batticaloa Municipality has begun a massive anti-dengue shramadhana campaign in Periya Uppodai from yesterday (25).
12 groups including the Batticaloa Municipality Mayor T. Saravanapavan, respective councilors, Commissioner N. Manivannan, Deputy Commissioner N. Thananjeyan, Municipal officers, health labourers and PHIs have begun the shramadhana work. It was started in this area because, according to the Epidemiologist report, Sinna Uppodai was the most vulnerable for the spread of dengue.
During their campaign, lands where dengue mosquitos were liable to breed were detected and the owners of those lands prosecuted.
After inspections carried out in the areas of Thamaraikerny, Eruthayapuram West, Punnaichcholai, 54 positive cases have been identified, said MOH Batticaloa Dr. K. Kirisuthan. Fogging operations were launched by the PHIs in those areas under the guidance of the MOH Batticaloa. They have decided to make frequent inspections of these potential dengue sites.
The Mayor Saravanapavan remarked that despite all the propaganda and education about dengue to students and the public, it is saddening to note that they have not acted adequately to prevent the spread of dengue.
