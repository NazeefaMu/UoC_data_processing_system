Selena Gomez breaks social media silence with heartfelt Instagram post

The woman is nothing, if not raw and honest.
Selena Gomez’s willingness to show the world her vulnerability continues, with the 24-year-old artist returning to social media after a 14-week absence to discuss “being enough.”
After her heartfelt acceptance speech at the AMAs less than a week ago saw the singer discussing how her struggle with anxiety and depression left her “absolutely broken inside,” her return to Instagram took a similarly sincere approach.
Gomez chose Thanksgiving to return to Instagram, posting a photo with fans, alongside an emotional caption dedicated to her fans.
Offering a message of self care and hopefulness, she wrote “My year has been the hardest yet most rewarding one yet. I’ve finally fought the fight of not ‘being enough.’ I have only wanted to reflect the love you guys have given me for years and show how important it is to take care of YOU.”
Back in August, Gomez made the decision to cancel the remainder of her Revival World Tour after revealing she’d been suffering lupus.
