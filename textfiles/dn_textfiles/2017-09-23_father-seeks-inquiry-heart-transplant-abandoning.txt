Father seeks inquiry into heart transplant abandoning

The father of girl on whom a heart transplant was to be carried out at the Kandy General Hospital made a request to Health Minister Dr,. Rajitha Senaratne to conduct an impartial inquiry over this incident.
He said that his daughter’s life is in danger after doctors abandoned the planned surgery on her on Thursday due to a tug-o-war between two groups of specialists.
Her father in a letter to the Health Minister added that the anastheticians had refused to assist the surgery at the last minute putting the life of his daughter at risk.
