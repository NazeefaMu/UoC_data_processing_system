Rajans stretch defending champs Isipathana

Defending champions had to fight hard to beat a determined Dharmaraja College outfit by 18 points (3 tries and a penalty) to 12 (1 goal, 1 try) in their Singer inter-school rugby match played at Bogambara Stadium yesterday.
At half time Dharmaraja led 7-3 but could not sustain the lead. As usual Isipathana played to their traditional strength in the forward play.
Kingswood beat Maliyadeva 53/8
Kingswood College went on a try fest scoring a total of ten as they demolished Maliyadeva College by 53 points to 8 in another Singer inter-school rugby match played at the Pallekelle rugby stadium yesterday. Kingswood led 15-3 at the breather.
