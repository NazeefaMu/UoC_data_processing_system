Elderly man planning to sell three tiger teeth for Rs. 144,000 nabbed

A 70-year-old man who had three tiger teeth in his possession, was arrested at Kalpitiya Town by Kalpitiya Police yesterday.
The man who had been resettled in Marichchakattuwa, Silawathura after languishing in a camp for displaced in Kalpitiya earlier, on interrogation had said that he had come to the town to sell the tiger teeth at Rs. 45,000 each to a prospective buyer. Police said since the tiger is a protected species and the possession of tiger body parts was a contravention of the Fauna and Flora Ordinance, the suspect would be produced before the Kalpitiya Magistrate.
