‘JO using public to cover up misdeeds’

Just as the LTTE used innocent civilians as a human shields during the war, the JO is also using the public as shields to achieve their ulterior motive, UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
The UNP has organized many protest rallies in the past, but with a certain purpose, he added.
But the JO does not have a purpose or an objective for this protest rally and it has made the public into a shield to hide the charges against leaders and JO members, he said.
But, no one can mislead the public today. It was the public who should react if any violence broke out as the Joint Opposition protest progressed, he added. Kariyawasam addressing the media at the Sirikotha yesterday said JO members are now tense with the special high courts proceeding progressing against culprits responsible for misuse of public funds and properties, killing of journalists and abductions.”They are now trying to incite the public against the government,”he said.
But, none of these can frighten us, the government and the judiciary.We have been accused of not taking action against corrupt people of the previous government. But, we did not want to interfere with the Judiciary as the previous government has done.
People launch anti-government protests when they lack freedom and their democratic rights are violated. But we have already restored democracy, freedom of expression and right to information.Since we have established unlimited freedom in the country and not engaged in crimes and corruption as previously done, they label us as an weak government,” he added.
“We want to hold all the forthcoming elections in due time.The Pohottuwa Party only obtained 40 percent of the votes at the previous Local Government election which means that 60 percent of votes were anti-Rajapaksa votes.We want to gain the victory at the forthcoming elections by obtaining the support of those 60 percent of votes from the anti Rajapaksa elements,” he added.
