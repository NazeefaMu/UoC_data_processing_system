Spring sprung!

British artist Rebecca Louise Law uses real flowers as her medium to create stunning, immersive installation art. Suspended with copper wire, her floating indoor gardens transform art galleries and “cocoon” the viewer in a world of mesmerizing color.
For her largest installation to date, titled Community, Law had the help of local volunteers from Toledo, Ohio to install 500,000 dried and fresh flowers inside the Toledo Art Museum.
An advocate for sustainability, Law reused dried flowers from her previous exhibitions from around the world, as well as over 150,000 locally sourced native plants. The colossal project required 1,650 hours of volunteer assistance provided by northwest Ohio community members. The result is an immersive experience that explores the relationship between humanity and nature, where each visitor can walk through the myriad of cascading plant life and appreciate their beauty up-close.
“We hope this installation will offer visitors a sensory experience, evocative of the people and places, natural history and landscapes of northwest Ohio,” said Brian Kennedy, Toledo Art Museum’s Edward Drummond and Florence Scott Libbey director. “Law’s transporting vision wonderfully reflects the spirit and textures of our local and global communities.”
The exhibit is on view at the Toledo Art Museum through January 13, 2019.
