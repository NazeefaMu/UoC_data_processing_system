Ranaviru Seva Authority continues to assist war heroes' children

The Ranaviru Seva Authority continues to provide more facilities to children of the war heroes who were killed or injured during operations, to continue with their studies, Ranaviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka said.
She said that had not those heroes made sacrifices on behalf of the nation, there would not have been a country today.
Fonseka made these observations at a ceremony yesterday to grant scholarships to children of war heroes who passed the grade five scholarship examination in 2015.
At the second phase of the ceremony held yesterday, 45 children of war heroes of tri-forces and Police were granted a scholarship of Rs 20,000 each.
The ceremony organised by the Ranaviru Seva Authority was held at the auditorium of the Navy headquarters.
Fonseka said the same dignity entertained by war heroes should be entertained by their children too.
She said the Ranaviru Seva Authority accepted that it was the Authority's responsibility to provide facilities for the children to continue studies.
She added that the Authority provides scholarships to children following the Grade five scholarship examination, Ordinary Level Examination, Advanced Level Examination and during the university studies and even for foreign courses after the degree.
"It is the responsibility of children of war heroes to make the maximum use of facilities granted by the Ranaviru Seva Authority and the government and continue with their studies," Fonseka said.
"That is the greatest tribute they can pay to their parents or brothers who sacrificed at the battle front."
Ranaviru Seva Authority Director Donald Kumarasiri Jayawardena also spoke at the occasion.
