CPC strike creates panic

The queues for petrol increased with the midday sun, as the public responded to the latest fuel shortage. This time, rather than a decrease in fuel supply, workers attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) protested against an impending deal between India and Sri Lanka in the island’s East.
India is set to finalise agreements on co-managing with Sri Lanka the remaining 84 tanks at a WW II storage facility in Trincomalee. The Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) currently manages fifteen of the 99 storage tanks and workers protested against the deal, alleging that it will give India an unfair advantage.
As the disagreement looms between the government and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions, which organised the strike that came into effect at midnight on Sunday, the public has to face the consequences.
Daily News spoke to several consumers queuing up for fuel at petrol sheds in Colombo, to find out their varied views on the matter.
