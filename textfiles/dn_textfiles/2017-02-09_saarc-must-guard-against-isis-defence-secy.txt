SAARC must guard against ISIS: Defence Secy.

The severity of the issue of ISIS terrorism itself is enough for SAARC countries to strengthen its ties, Defence Secreatry Karunasena Hettiarchchi said at a panel discussion on SAARC, Its Impediments and Way forward.
Other panelists were Ex Secretary General of SAARC Nihal Rodrigo, Pakistan High Commissioner Major General Syed Shakeel Hussain, senior Anaysts from Pakistan Ikram Sehgal and Riffat Hussain, Director General of Institute of National Security Studies of Sri Lanka (INSSSL) Asanga Abeygoonasekara.
The event was held at Galadari Hotel, Colombo organised by INSSSL and the High Commission of Pakistan.
Hettiarachchi said, “Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are the most afflicted victims of terrorism in South Asia. It is essential for the member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to strengthen the association to combat terrorism.”
During recent past South Asia has experienced numerous incidents of violence and extremism. The region turns out to be an epicenter of terrorism, he said.
“The terrorist outfits, such as ISIS, have become a global threat with ability to cause violence transcending borders. It is disturbing that this began in the Middle East and spread to Europe and the United States. The United States is affecting our region as a result of this,” he noted.
The Government of Sri Lanka believes that regional corporation is vital if terrorism is to be eliminated from the region, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena has often emphasized the importance of building trust and unity among the members of SAARC, he said.
SAARC must also address challenges such as improving sustainable development and bilateral trade. Hettiarachchi said, “The combined efforts of SAARC countries achieved commendable progress in all areas during the past thirty-one years owing to mutual trust the member states held in each other.
“These achievements are a testament to the significance of our Regional Corporation.”
“However, there have been instances showing declination of that mutual respect, and the result was that the Association could not achieve its full potential,” he pointed out. .
Speaking on the poverty alleviation programs in the region, Hettiarchchi said in spite of numerous such programs being launched targeting poor people , a very high number of people still live below poverty line without access to drinking water and education.
“Countries such as Korea, South Korea and Singapore have come out of poverty not through special programs targeted at poor people, but because of economic development achieved by them,” he added.
