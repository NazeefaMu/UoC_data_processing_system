Social surplus, public policy and development

Sri Lanka's post independence economic and social policies facilitated the emergence and expansion of the rural lower middle class. Redistribution of state land through progressive land legislation, establishment of new agricultural settlements and village expansion schemes and the creation of a pervasive state sector prepared the ground for the above development. Introduction of free education up to university level through Swabhasha medium enabled the offspring of the expanding class of land owning peasants to aspire for upward social mobility through education.
In the absence of a vibrant private sector, their aspirations were mostly fulfilled by the state sector. As a result, most of these upwardly mobile youth, after completing their education returned to their villages of origin as school teachers, minor state officials, etc. This pattern continued until the demand for such employment opportunities outstripped supply resulting in widespread unrest among educated youth leading to violent revolt since the early 1970's onwards. The rest is well known history.
Economy was liberalized in the late 1970's to bring an end to state monopolies and create employment opportunities outside the state sector. The post-1977 government placed greater emphasis on the private sector but the significance of the state sector remained as important as ever. Public funds had to be allocated to maintain an excessively large state sector and offer various subsidies to the members of the rural lower middle class such as the fertilizer subsidy, income support, free health, education and other services. Given their relatively low incomes, these subsidies were critically important for them to cope with increasing economic and social pressures.
Public funds
Popular democracies can ignore the hardships and aspirations of a large Lower middle class at their own peril. Sri Lanka has enough experience in this regard. On the other hand, sustaining an expanding lower middle class largely at public expense can be counterproductive in a number of ways. Firstly, state cannot invest enough public funds to raise the standards of public services to make them attractive to all classes. This encourages the well to do to have their own private services in such fields as health, transport and education. Secondly, a dependent, low skilled lower middle class could be hardly expected to play a catalytic role in knowledge driven development. And, finally, in a popular democracy, the members of a largely inward oriented, lower middle class can have a decisive influence on the electoral process with significant political implications.
As is well known, increasing incomes of a sizable segment of the population following economic liberalization led to a steady increase in the demand for private education, both local and overseas. The result was a proliferation of private educational institutions at all levels providing educational credentials sought after by employers in the private corporate sector. Meanwhile, the products of the state sector educational institutions by and large had to rely on the state sector for employment. Given the widening gap between public and private sectors in terms of lucrative employment opportunities, the chances of the members of the rural lower middle class achieving rapid upward social mobility became slim. This of course does not mean that there are no exceptions to the above general pattern.
As is well known, the largest share of the social surplus today is generated by the private sector. On the other hand, the state sector controls only a small proportion of the national wealth. As a result, private consumption far outstrips public consumption. This is the main reason why quality of public services remains much to be desired. So, those who depend on such services are often not satisfied with their quality or adequacy. Widespread use of private tuition even by poor students is illustrative of this reality. What is noteworthy however, is that, even with such additional expenditure, their educational attainments and skills do not reach the standards demanded by corporate sector employers when they recruit managerial staff. So, the youth from a rural lower middle class background are compelled to look for employment in the state sector.
This is the main reason why the Sri Lankan state has come under social and political pressure to absorb educated rural youth into the state sector. This practice has become increasingly more difficult in recent years due to increasing numbers of graduates passing out from state universities. There was a serious graduate unemployment problem even in the early 1970's when the number of universities was just six in comparison to sixteen today. Though many talk about the need to accommodate more undergraduates within the public university system, hardly anyone talks about their employment prospects. As is well known, unemployed graduates usually expect the state institutions to absorb them, irrespective of whether they can be given some useful work or not.
Post-liberalization economy
In the post-liberalization economy of Sri Lanka, the state sector became almost exclusively confined to the service sector. Many productive industrial and agricultural ventures that were part of the state sector from the 1950's to the early 1970's were later privatized. Given the increasing participation of private capital even in such service sector activities as education, health, transport and telecommunications, there are no state monopolies even in these areas today. In other words, the role of the state sector has been drastically cut back in the new liberal economic environment, making it difficult for the governments to create productive employment in the state sector. However, when unproductive employment is created due to social and political pressure, without paving the way for a corresponding expansion of productive employment elsewhere through other state interventions, adequate public funds cannot be generated to be used for improving public services and critical income support programmes. In such a situation, it is the low income groups who suffer most. Many of the latter leave the country looking for more lucrative employment elsewhere.
So, the policy choices that the governments have to make against the above background are complex and are certainly not straight forward. Moreover, ideologically driven public discourses do not help focus attention on critical issues. One of these is the widening gap between productive and unproductive sectors of the economy, leading to monetary expansion, inflation and growing income inequality. Another is the highly inequitable access to the social surplus irrespective of one's actual contribution to it. There is an urgent need to find an optimal, just and rational way to allocate and invest the social surplus to achieve the twin objectives of development and social welfare.
There is obviously a major crisis in the local education system today. On the one hand, there are serious inequities within it. As a result, public education does not provide equal opportunities to all. This situation encourages many to leave the system prematurely and find less optimal solutions to their livelihood problems. Since these youth leave school without any useful skills, most of them either end up in the informal sector or leave the country looking for more lucrative employment overseas. Either way, most of them do not have a stable future. On the other hand, those few who reach the tertiary level are also highly deferentially placed.
A large majority of secondary schools do not have facilities to offer all academic streams of education and, as a result many end up in non- professional streams by default. So, those few who offer professionally oriented courses in Medicine, Engineering, etc. secure lucrative employment in state and private sectors. The vast majority of students with non-professional qualifications end up in lower rung positions in state institutions with few opportunities for upward mobility.
Another major drawback of the education system is that it does not develop the full intellectual potential of children and youth. School children are prepared for memory testing examinations and the efforts of everybody are aimed at best examination results, often impeding the achievement of wider goals of education. As a result, many school leavers and university graduates lack essential life skills, much needed soft skills and other attributes that help youth to make the transition from school to work. This situation naturally has very serious implications for the development of the country. In short, education system helps perpetuate the above situation rather than helping the country to break away from it.
Structural problems
Sri Lanka made a significant transition at the beginning of this year from a semi-authoritarian rule to a more liberally oriented regime. The transition is certainly not without problems. There are many challenges that the country is yet to overcome. First is the economic crisis. Structural problems of the economy are serious and these cannot be easily overcome, unless sound policies are formulated and implemented. But vested interests prevent the implementation of such policies. The recent reversal of many budgetary proposals is indicative of this. The media institutions are not well equipped or informed to handle complex issues and facilitate balanced decisions by the government and other institutions. One fundamental question that the media should have raised and discussed was whether public funds should be given to various interest groups such as Medical doctors, government servants and people's representatives to enjoy private transport at public expense.
In the past, public subsidies were given to such groups to encourage them to use public transport. There were no public agitations against duty concessions on imported cars and the government became increasingly isolated forcing it to give in on an important public policy issue. If this is the way the media, political parties, trade unions and others handle public policy issues, it will not be long before we slide back to very poor governance again with serious consequences for the country and the wider public.
