First Man Giant step in Retrospect

Karen Armstrong dies, leaving her father in an ineffable agony. Her death following fast-declining health brought some kind of halt to the smooth-sailing lifestyle of her father. Stunned by his daughter’s sudden death, Neil Armstrong draws himself almost obsessively to his career as an astronaut.
Damien Chazelle’s First Man then careens around the core lifestyle of the eminent astronaut. Very much an introvert, Armstrong is nevertheless surrounded by a team of extrovert associates. Most of his colleagues undergo the inevitable perils during the space mission stretched between 1961 and 1969. Which is to say how the space conquest was not accomplished overnight.
That single step placed on the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System was considered one giant step back then. The news fed the global press machine including this very newspaper, Ceylon Daily News, which covered the first moon landing for seven consecutive days on front page. A few decades later, however, that euphoria paled into insignificance with technological progress taking place in a sophisticated pace. Although the world has mach more to indulge in than the first moon landing, the event has stirred interest in James R. Hansen who authored First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong. Chazelle’s cinematic work is based on Hansen’s work.
The movie is notable on several grounds. Chazelle throws us back to the sixties when no smart device was available. That was a period when television entered the household as new media and the supersonic plane was the focal point of the science discussions. On the other hand, we are made privy to most sensitive episodes in the lifestyle of a world-renowned scientist – especially his relationship with his deceased daughter.
Moon is the connecting factor between any parent and a child at night. Karen’s father shows her the moon and shares many narratives. It does not take so long for Karen to develop an attachment with the planet perched so afar. The moment Armstrong sets his foot on the moon, he remembers his daughter and the talks they had over the moon. Then the camera pans to his hand to show what he had been holding in his hand. The keepsake he had kept in memory of his daughter with the letters of her name. Before turning back, Armstrong leaves the keepsake on the moon – a respect no other father has been privileged with.
The biopic also reveals rare events of the era. The fact that the three astronauts were kept quarantined upon their return remains a fact little known. Taking a decision to be onboard for the historic mission was not easy for Armstrong. Some of his colleagues had to compensate with their life during the experimental mission.
His wife would not simply let him go. She offers him the challenge probably much tougher than landing on the moon: enlighten his children about the risk of his mission and the fact that he might never be back.
The cinematography has dominated the work with its organic quality. In fact more cinematographic prominence is given to the technical aspect of the space mission than the astronaut’s private life. As the rocket propels, the process is shown in many angles. The shaky nature of the interior is very much felt.
Ryan Gosling’s portrayal as the titular role comes to the fore as natural. We naturally fall in love with the young and energetic version of Neil Armstrong thanks to Gosling’s subtle performance. Breathing life to the celebrated astronaut looks like no rocket science for Gosling of course as we are already familiar with his mature performance as Noah in The Notebook.
