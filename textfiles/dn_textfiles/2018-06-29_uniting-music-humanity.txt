Uniting with music for humanity

‘Eka Ahasak Yata’ is an iconic musical extravaganza organized by International Movement for Community Development (IMCD) to present one of a kind musical experience which focuses around the idea of bringing together artists of different genres under one roof to raise funds to facilitate for a worthy cause. IMCD is a non-for-profit organization spearheaded by a group of passionate youth intending to encourage community development in Sri Lanka, Eka Ahasak Yata is one such an initiative spearheaded in 2017. This year “Eka Ahasak Yata” is focusing on raising funds to eradicate Chronic Kidney Diseases of unknown etiology (CKDu) from Sri Lanka through distribution of water purification systems - RO plants (Reverse Osmosis Plants).
Eka Ahasak Yata is a well curated show with finely tuned pieces by talented pool of artists, set to indulge the audience in music while contributing towards a worthy cause. This magical evening will take place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) on the June 30 from 6.30pm onwards.
Lahiru Perera ‘La Signore’, Raini Charuka Goonathillake, Mihindu Ariyaratne, Ridma Weerawardena and Supun Perera will perform on the day with DADDY Band to create a scintillating atmosphere at ‘Eka Ahasak Yata’.
With “Eka Ahasak Yata” - ‘Everyone Deserves Clean Water’ IMCD is looking to provide a solution to the growing rate of Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka. Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) has become a major health issue in Sri Lanka for the past two decades and it has caused more than 23,000 deaths within the period. The probable cause for CKDu is the consumption of water that is exposed to agrochemicals that contain heavy metals such as Arsenic and Cadmium. Drinking water sources such as tube wells and irrigation tanks in North Central Province and other affected Provinces are contaminated by these heavy metals.
Beside water being a primary requisite for survival, it is unfortunate that a considerable population of Sri Lanka doesn’t have access to clean drinking water even today, thus causing over 2,000 number of deaths per year. Recognizing the urgency for support, IMCD spearheaded this initiative ‘Everyone Deserves Clean Water’ to provide RO (Remote Osmosis) Plants to inflicted areas in Northern Central Province.
