Let them go

The SLFP rebels were adamant that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe be replaced and told President Sirisena that they would quit the government if he did not take action in this regard. This is despite the SLFP coming a distant third at the LG polls, behind the pohottuwa and the UNP. Giving no answer to this, the rebels started foisting the blame for the SLFP's electoral debacle to the economic policies pursued by the Prime Minister. Having not succeeded in their bid they pounced on the opportunity presented by the Joint Opposition which sponsored a No Confidence Motion against the Premier and voted with the JO to oust their bete noire cocksure that they would see the Motion through with the support of the remainder in the SLFP group and some rebels within the UNP.
When this did not come to pass (even two of the signatories to the NCM abstained from voting) they demanded that they would be quitting the government if the SLFP did not sever connections with the UNP and sit in the Opposition, though not being part of the Joint Opposition. The 16 members of the SLFP who voted for the NCM have now declared that they would cross the floor on May 8 when parliament will be commencing its new session.
Now comes the news report that the rebels are demanding a change in the office bearers of the SLFP, read General Secretary (SLFP) Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera (UPFA), failing which they have threatened to boycott the SLFP May Day rally and go it alone. The former Ministers in the SLFP who quit the government is reported to have said that the party would have no future if such individuals were retained.
It is natural that the rebels are still smarting by the defeat of the NCM and are openly blaming the two General Secretaries for scuttling the bid. Hence, it is only natural that they want the duo removed.
But they are hardly in a position to take up cudgels on behalf of the SLFP after some of its members were seen openly consorting with the Joint Opposition only moments after they walked out of the Government jointly formed by the UNP and the SLFP with the President's blessings. There was Dilan Pererea and Dayasiri Jayasekera, dutifully present at the Fort Magistrate’s court premises, to wrap their arms around Mahindananda Aluthgamage who was released on bail in the case involving the alleged misuse of public funds to the tune of Rs. 39 million to purchase sports goods, during the Presidential Election, for distribution among Sports Clubs. Not only that, a beaming Dayasiri Jayasekera went on to exonerated the JO stalwart from blame, although as a lawyer, himself, he ought to have kept his counsel on a proceeding matter.
In any event this was hardly the kind of conduct that constitutes loyalty towards the SLFP, which the rebels openly profess and for which they claim they have the best interest at heart in calling for the removal of the two General Secretaries by which they hope to cleanse the party.
It was no secret that the likes of Dayasiri Jayasekera, Dilan Perera and Susil Premajayantha were playing footsies with the JO all along and only a moron will believe that their loyalties still remain with the SLFP. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the other day, stated that the group of 16 who voted for the NCM was part of the conspiracy hatched by Mahinda Rajapaksa to break up the government and cause divisions between the President and the Prime Minister, for the last three years.
Both, the President and PM, have reiterated that the unity government will run its full course, and the swearing-in of the new Cabinet is due before the opening of the new parliament session. Hence, the deal is already sealed and the SLFP rebels are therefore welcome to go their merry way with holding their May Day rally on their own, or, jointly with the JO.
The likes of Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekera have demonstrated umpteen times by their speeches and actions as to where their loyalties lay, even without the open welcome by Jayasekera of his JO colleague Aluthgamage, at the Fort Magistrate's court premises, the other day, as proof. While in government, holding important ministerial posts, and, enjoying the perks of office, the duo were always talking at cross purposes and trying to trip the President and the PM, at every turn.
Their conduct during the recent oil distribution fiasco too left much to be desired, at a time when all ministers in the government were expected to unite in resolving a crisis. They constantly failed to live by the accepted tenets of collective Cabinet responsibility. Their remaining in the SLFP can only further foul up the atmosphere and be nothing but an impediment to the progress of the unity government. Hence, they should not muddy the waters further by continuing to remain within the SLFP, even as a separate Opposition group, but join the political formation they are more comfortable with.
