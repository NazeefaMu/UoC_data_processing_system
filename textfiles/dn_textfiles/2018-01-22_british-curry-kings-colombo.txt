BRITISH CURRY KINGS IN COLOMBO!

Sri Lankan diners can whet their appetites by tucking into British curry, as the Taste of Britain Curry Festival sets up a base at the five star luxury Hilton Colombo from 24-28 January 2018.
A team of British chefs will be in Colombo to showcase their talent at this British food promotion, which is organised by the UK trade magazine, Curry Life. Hot, mild, creamy or dry, any way you like it, the fact still remains: CURRY has come to be the UK’s number one national food.
The curry, which originates from the Indian Sub-Continent, now outsells even fish and chips. Some twelve thousand curry restaurants in the UK cater to ever-increasing love of British curry cuisine. Rupert Rowley, one of the most experienced and celebrated Michelin Starred chefs in the UK, heads the Taste of Britain team to Colombo.
Accompanying Rupert, award wining British curry chefs’ team are also here, who will be producing a range of new dishes giving a spicy twist to traditional British meals as well as classic high street favourites like Chicken Tikka Masala, Balti and Ceylon dishes. The aim of the festival is to showcase the best of British Cuisine and the work of some of the UK's most creative chefs.
The festival team will also be going on a food trail to taste local cuisine in Colombo and get inspiration from the famous Sri Lankan dishes for their menu back home in Britain. During this festival chef Rupert, will be showcasing Sri Lankan seafood inspired British menu, while his curry chef colleagues will offer a classic British curry menu during the festival.
The British curry chef’s contingent includes Vijay Singh Panwar from London, AbulMonsur from Chatham, Kent and Syeduz Zaman Kamran from Warrington, Cheshire and Mr Shamsul Islam, Food Hygiene Specialist, who provides food safety and quality compliance.
In a message of support for the festival, the UK minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office responsible for Asia and Pacific, Rt Hon Mark Field MP, said: “I send my best wishes to everyone at Curry Life Magazine and to all those participating at ‘Taste of Britain Curry Festival’ in Colombo for organising this marvellous event in Sri Lanka.
I would also like to extend thanks to the Hilton Colombo for hosting the Festival.”
Festival organiser and the editor of Curry Life Magazine, Syed Belal Ahmed added: “British food is enjoying a renaissance period after many years and curry has played a major role in helping put us back in the world kitchen.
“Curry Life festival team all over India with British curry, but this is our first British curry promotion in Sri Lanka. Hopefully this will create the opportunity not only to showcase the best of British but also help our chefs to bring fresh ideas to their own menus by working alongside the culinary masters of Sri Lanka.
