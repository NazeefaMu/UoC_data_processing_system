Nearly 76 percent decrease in dengue patients

A 76 percent decrease in dengue patients is reported compared to the same period last year, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the decrease shows from January to July. In 2017, a total of 128,077 dengue patients were reported from all parts of the country from January to July while only 30,786 dengue patients were reported during the same period this year.
Several special dengue control programmes implemented countrywide under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had helped in achieving such success. The programmes were implemented after accurately identifying dengue mosquito breeding locations such as construction sites.
Meanwhile, the Epidemiology Unit sources said by August 3, a total of 32,605 dengue patients were reported from all parts of the country while the highest number of dengue patients - 6136 – was reported from the Colombo district and in the Western Province the number was 11,322.
