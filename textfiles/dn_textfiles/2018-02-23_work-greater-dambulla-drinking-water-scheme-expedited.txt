The Board has been able to improve the services of water supply to the Dambulla city and the surrounding areas by providing water purified by the new water purification plant and thereby water shortage for about 5,000 connections that came under the old water supply scheme.
It will become possible to provide pure drinking water through the new service reservoirs to the people very soon in Talakiriyagama, Habrana, and Tittawellagolla.
