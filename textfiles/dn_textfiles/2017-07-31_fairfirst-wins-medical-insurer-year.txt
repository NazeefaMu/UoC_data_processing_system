Supported by a strong underwriting team and leading customer servicing team, Fairfirst continues to deliver market beating growth and exceptional service standards.
Providing protection for employees of large corporates and individuals alike, Fairfirst is today among the top general insurance companies of Sri Lanka.

Driven by disciplined underwriting and streamlined claim operations, Fairfirst have displayed consistent and healthy growth in revenues, client base and segment profitability for the financial year 2016.
“With an ageing population and a rise in non-communicable diseases we are seeing an increase in demand for inpatient and outpatient care services as well as laboratory services,” said Thushara Edirisooriya – Head of Surgical Insurance. “And now with medical costs on the rise, people are beginning to understand the value of having a medical coverage to counter their health contingencies”
Fairfirst is continuously re-inventing themselves in terms of product offerings and strategic partnerships. This was confirmed, with their recent tie up with the Sri Lanka Pensions Department and the subsequent launch of Buhuman - a unique health insurance policy specifically aligned with the evolving insurance needs of pensioners. Also, the company has successfully secured partnerships with leading financial institutions and telecommunications partners as the insurer of choice in order to further their reach.
“We are thrilled to win this award that recognizes the efforts of our sales, underwriting and claims teams who have been working tirelessly to service our customers” saidd Dr. Sanjeev Jha, CEO and Managing Director of Fairfirst Insurance.
