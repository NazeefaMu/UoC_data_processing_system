C’wealth LG Reps’ Meeting 2019 to be held here

A decision to hold the next Commonwealth Local Government Representatives Meeting in Sri Lanka in 2019 was taken by the working committee of the Local Government Forum, recently, in London.
This decision was conveyed to Minister Faiszer Musthapha, who participated in the Local Government Representatives’ Forum, which commenced on April 13 in London.
The decision to hold the meeting in Sri Lanka was taken on a proposal made by Minister Musthapha during the Local Government Representatives’ Meeting held in Malta in 2017.
This is the first time that this meeting is being held in an Asian country. It will cover 10 zones in the world.
