Hush! It’s ‘Kumbi Talk’

Chitrasena School of Dance is ready to present a ballet called ‘Kumbi Kathawa’, that may appear to be simple and childlike, but is tremendously meaningful in the sense that it not only captures the state of the world we live in and its politics but it also brings out values and ethics taught through religion and philosophy through personification. The Daily News recently visited Chitrasena School of Dance to rediscover the simple lessons in life such as the power of unity and family and the virtue of courage, compassion and perseverance.
Kumbi Kathawa tells the story of an ant colony that faces immense hardship as they are chased away by an evil force (a mosquito.) The main ant family perseveres and rebuilds their home and it becomes a place of joy, where many different insects gather to celebrate. When all the insects are threatened by a flood, the ants stand strong and rescue all those who are struggling, including their former enemy the mosquito.
The ballet is choreographed by Anjalika Melvani and directed by Heshma Wignaraja and the ballet is based on the Russian Children’s story “The Brave Ant” by Tatiana Makarova When this dance drama premiered in 2007 and restaged in 2009, audiences were captivated by the simple yet powerful story that was conveyed through incredible dance and choreography, costumes, music and lighting. The ballet had been honed to perfection over a period of five years.
“Most of what Seeya and Achchi (Chitrasena and Vajira) have done have had longevity and have been produced many times. ‘Karadiya’ has been performed 200 times with many different generations. We have a repository of Adult Ballets and Children’s ballets. We can pick these productions whenever we want and reproduce it with the current students we have. Hopefully if they are with us as seniors, they would probably get the chance to participate in adult ballets.

Heshma
We put in so much effort and every ballet is groundbreaking every time it was produced. Every time we have done a production we have tried to do something unique in a way not done before. And it has worked so far,” said Heshma
Heshma feels that unlike the past, things are more challenging these days as these days children are much busier than adults. “It is very taxing for a private organization to ask them to come her and work the way we do. But we never give up because what we offer is three generations of teachers, who work at the same time. They are my grandmother Vajira, my aunt, my mom, Thaji and me. I don’t think there is another dance school in this country with three generations of teaching under one roof. It is beyond just generations of teaching. We find our dance language to be very unique and we are proud of it. Training young ones to become ambassadors of this language is a great joy to us.”
There was a time when they were like gypsies going from one place to another without a permanent place. But then former President Chandrika Kumaratunga gave them the land where they are now and they have been there for nine years. They moved in January 2007. “We have many Ballets in our repository and when we have talented students and depending on the body of students we will decide what we want to reproduce.
This is amongst working on new things in between. Kumbi is a very special ballet because it was the first one we did after coming to these premises after it was built. At that time my mother had been working on this Ballet for five years. I was abroad for most of the time. Every time I came I saw her working with these kids. The cast changed like twice over because kids were outgrowing their parts. As soon as we moved here, we decided that we had to put this together and make it happen. So it holds a very special place in our hearts.”
The restaging of Kumbi Kathawa in October provides an opportunity for those who missed it the previous times and those who want to see it again, a chance to enjoy this wonderful production.
Tickets are priced at Rs. 2500, Rs. 2000, Rs. 1500, Rs. 1000, Rs. 750 and Rs. 500 (balcony). Tickets can be purchased from the Chitrasena Kalayathanaya, 590 Elvitigala Mawatha Colombo 5 and through ticketslk.com from September 28.
