Parliament

Only field officers will be deprived from contesting LG polls: Musthapa
The government decided that only field officers from the public service would be prevented from contesting Local Authorities Elections, despite the proposal made by the Election Commission to prevent all public servants contesting, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, when the Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena proposed that the same section of preventing field officers contesting polls be removed.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding to the joint opposition, said only field officers such as Samurdhi Officers, Development Officers and Grama Seva Niladaris from the public service are restricted from contesting. He said others such as teachers could contest.
During the confusion, MP Wimal Weerawansa asked for a vote on the same section which the government side won with a majority of 76 votes. 120 members voted against MP Dinesh Gunawardena's amendment, while 44 voted for. However, Minister John Seneviratne abstained from voting.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena came up with the suggestion that public servants should be allowed to contest polls. "Not allowing public servants to contest elections is a violation of their rights," MP Gunawardena said. "That is a right of the public servants."
However, Leader of the Opposition R Sampanthan also stated that there was no issue in allowing public servants to contest, as they would obviously resign from their posts if elected to office.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the concept of Public Servant came up during the late Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike's period and it could not be affected under a government which the SLFP is a part of.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding, said only field officers in the public service are restricted from contesting. He said others such as teachers could contest. However, 120 members voted against the proposal, while 44 voted for it.
Minister Faizer Mustapha said that government officers who are prohibited from contesting, had been defined in the draft as field officers such as Samurdhi officials, Grama Niladhari officials and Development officials. The Chairman of the Elections Commission had proposed to prohibit all government officers, but the government decide to confine only field officers.
When MP Gunawardena said that the Election Commission should be summoned before Parliament, Minister Musthapa further said that the government would not agree with the amendment forwarded by MP Gunawardena. The government had reached a decision on the instructions of the Election Commission.
 
Amendment seeking public servants to contest elections: Labour Minister abstains
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne, abstained from voting against an amendment sponsored by the Joint Opposition seeking to permit public servants to contest elections, while all government ministers and MPs voted against. According to the provisions of the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, public servants were required to resign from government service, one year prior to contesting elections for local government bodies.
The Joint Opposition proposed an amendment that the clause be removed from the Draft Bill. The government rejected the amendment, while the House was moved to a vote. In that vote Minister Seneviratne abstained, but voted for at the vote on the Bill.
The minister told the media that depriving field officers of their democratic rights to contest elections amounted to violating their fundamental rights and his conscience did not permit him to vote with the government members. "As the party had not taken any prior standpoint over the issue, it would not create any problem from the party to him," Minister Seneviratne said.
Inland Revenue Bill put off for next date of sitting
The debate on the Inland Revenue Bill, which was scheduled to be taken up yesterday, was put off till the next Parliamentary sitting date.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella informed Parliament that the Bill would not be moved for debate as scheduled as the third reading of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill had consumed more time than expected.
The Government presented the Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament for first reading on July 5. The Bill is to provide for the imposition of Income Tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017.
The Bill, among others, introduces a new income tax structure, aimed at closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.
The Inland Revenue Bill is also to undergo a large number of amendments at its Committee stage.
