Hoarding collapse creates traffic in Peliyagoda

Heavy traffic prevailed in Kelaniya, Peliyagoda and adjacent areas when a large hoarding collapsed across the road at Peliyagoda blocking traffic movement to and fro from the Colombo city yesterday.
Thousands of people particularly office staff entering the Colombo city were inconvenienced as traffic movement came to a standstill for over an hour following the incident.
The CCTV Division of Sri Lanka Police has monitored reckless driving of the lorry driver that caused the incident after scrutinizing camera footage. He was later remanded on being produced before the Magistrate’s courts in Hulftsdorp.
