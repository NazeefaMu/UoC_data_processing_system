Why challenge President who represents people’s sovereignty?
The dismissal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe following the withdrawal of the SLFP headed by President Maithripala Sirisena from the government alliance kind of stabilized the political climate within the polity.
Those who question the validity of the recently appointed government must look at the Yahapalana government elected in 2015. That government stands as Sri Lanka’s very first puppet government. Analysts were quick to spot this, but not the incumbent critics of the recently appointed government. Lasanda Kurukulasuriya asked in 2015 ‘is Lanka being micro managed from afar? In 2016, the media said, ‘Yahapalana is acting on a preplanned scenario.’ Government is following a foreign agenda, - the public agreed vehemently. What actually transpired was that a host of countries had explored every possible political avenue, by hook or crook, to topple Mahinda Rajapaksa and to install a puppet regime to achieve their goals. The ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was acting according to the dictates of the Western masters as Vasudeva Nanayakkara MP rightly pointed out.
It is now pertinent to ask why these camps challenge the president who they fought tooth and nail to install. Why? Over to you those who installed Maithripala Sirisena at the helm of the country’s political administration to answer why they act as if they have never done any such thing now. After all, is he not the only person who represents the majority semblance of sovereignty?
