The gift of blood is the gift of life!

Wednesday was World Blood Donor Day (WBDD). Every year on June 14, countries around the world celebrate the occasion. The event, established in 2004, serves to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products and to thank donors for their voluntary life-saving gifts of blood.
This year’s campaign will focus on blood donation in emergencies. In crisis or emergency situation, the natural human response is “What can I do? How can I help?” The slogan for the 2017 campaign is: ‘What can you do?, with the secondary message: ‘Give blood. Give now. Give often.’
Wider activities
Blood is the lifeline of every animal living on the earth. Today, the world is facing deficiency of blood stock and that is causing threat to life. The only way one can see for health care is through blood transfusion. The increasing need for blood globally requires everyone to contribute by donating blood and motivating others for the cause.
The first World Blood Donor Day was observed in 2004, which was followed by its designation as an annual global event by the fifty-eighth World Health Assembly in 2005.
The date is also the birthday of Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943), an Austrian biologist and physician, considered to be the ‘founder’ of modern blood transfusion. Landsteiner discovered the ABO blood groups in 1901, developed the modern system of classification of blood groups, and identified, in 1937, together with Alexander S. Wiener, the Rhesus factor, thus enabling physicians to transfuse blood without endangering a patient’s life.
World Blood Donor Day provides a springboard for blood safety programs and campaigns throughout the year, as well as wider activities to strengthen blood transfusion services. It is designed to complement rather than replace the national blood donor days or weeks that are organised in a number of countries. Some are held at the same time as World Blood Donor Day while others take place at different times of the year.
Transfusion of blood and blood products helps save millions of lives every year. It can help patients suffering from life-threatening conditions live longer and with higher quality of life, and supports complex medical and surgical procedures. It also has an essential, life-saving role in maternal and perinatal care. Access to safe and sufficient blood and blood products can help reduce rates of death and disability due to severe bleeding during delivery and after childbirth.
Remarkable success
Three years ago Sri Lanka was the host country for the global event of World Blood Donor Day. The day also coincides with Poson Poya month, an annual religious holiday that marks the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and is a time for generosity and celebration.
Sri Lanka has already established a tradition of encouraging people to give blood every month when the moon is full. Social groups organise blood donation sessions on this day on their own premises – often in temples, schools or universities. Some 85 per cent of all donations are collected at these mobile sessions.
In just 12 years, Sri Lanka has achieved remarkable success in reaching a self-sufficient blood supply. Yet sadly in many countries, there is not an adequate supply of safe blood, and blood services face the challenge of making sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and safety.
An adequate supply can only be assured through regular donations by voluntary unpaid blood donors. The WHO’s goal is for all countries to obtain all their blood supplies from voluntary unpaid donors by 2020. In 2014, 60 countries have their national blood supplies based on 99-100 percent voluntary unpaid blood donations, with 73 countries still largely dependent on family and paid donors.
Giving blood is the simplest way to do good. Becoming a blood donor doesn’t take very much time and energy, but it does allow us to give the greatest gift of all – saving someone’s life. Each day, tens of thousands of patients at hospitals around the world need blood from donors. Anyone – people we know, our friends, loved ones – can find themselves needing help due to an accident or illness. Our own lives could someday depend on donated blood. Blood cannot be produced industrially – the only source is a voluntary donor. By giving blood, we can be sure that our medical facilities have the supplies needed to save the lives of all who need blood, as no one can be certain they won’t be involved in an accident or other misfortune.
A special present
Donor blood is used for difficult operations and complicated births, and in treating patients suffering from cancer, liver disease, haemorrhage, severe injury, anaemia, leukaemia, burns and many other diseases and conditions. Donor blood also makes it possible to carry out many planned surgeries that would not otherwise be possible due to excessive blood loss.
Volunteer blood donors give the greatest gift of all to patients in need at area hospitals – the gift of life! Without their blood donation, patients needing life-saving surgeries would not survive, people fighting cancer and blood ailments would not have platelets and burn victims would not have plasma to heal their wounds.
In most countries, blood donations are voluntary and not compensated. The donor’s intentions must be without selfish motives and come out of a sincere desire to help others. Giving blood gives that priceless feeling of having really helped others.
That is a special present that could come only from you. You may not have given this much thought. But the greatest gift you can give another human is, literally, life. Donating blood even once can help save the lives of three people -- whether they are newborns needing heart surgery, adults badly injured in car crashes or people of any age suffering from cancer. For you, it's just a few moments out of your day but for patients in need, it may save their life.
Don't worry about donating blood, it is a completely safe procedure! Everything is cleaned and sterilised and there are plenty of trained medical professionals on hand to carry this out. They will only take about one pint of blood which your body can replace in a flash. One of the main components of your blood is plasma. This provides proteins, nutrients and a clotting agent that is necessary to stop bleeding and provides a world of nutrients. So rest assured - nothing is ever wasted. It also helps people in their fight against cancer
Platelets are tiny cells that can help people undergoing cancer treatment regain their strength, fight infections and make a quick and smooth recovery. Give them a helping hand.
