[APPRECIATIONS - (06-02-2017)]

Alhaj S.M.A.M. Muzammil
He was respected by all
A light has gone out without as much as a flicker. All that was left is the precious memory how brightly it burnt and the warmth it gave us while alive.
With much respect and affection, I write this appreciation for an untold icon of the Southern Sri Lanka and a moral scholar of Panadura, Kaleefathushazuli S.M.A.M. Muzammil (Gafoori) on his 24th year of demise.
Born on February 18, 1926 to Sheikh Madhar Aalim and Hajiyani Azeezumma at Thotawatta, Kaleefathushazuli. Muzammil had showed early brilliance in his primary studies at Al-Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya. He completed his moral education (1939-47) at Maharagama Ghafooriyya Arabic College and graduated as a Moulavi. His outstanding skills created a pathway where he was invited as a teacher from the Arabic College.
As a teacher, his journey covered Arabic College (1947-49), Colombo Zahira College (1949-55), Dharga Town Zahira College (1958-59) and again Colombo Zahira College (1959-60).
He also graduated from the University of Peradeniya (1955-58) and received the “Al-Aalim” award at a young age.
Between 1960-61, he was employed at the Ceylon Labour Department changing his career flow. He was also a Deputy Principal at Panadura, Thotawatta, Al-Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya from 1961 to four years. For his excellence in the education field, he was inducted to the Education Ministry’s Textbook Production Crew. Later, he completed the Diploma in Education at the University of Peradeniya and served Weligama, Arafa Maha Vidyalaya (1966-70) as a deputy principal.
He served Panadura, Henamulla, Jeelan Muslim Vidyalaya (1970-72) as a principal.
He was later promoted and served the community as the Tamil Education officer at Kalutara, Pelmadulla Educational division for many years until his retirement. His efforts in establishing Sunnat-wal-Jamath policies and effectively initiating Shazuliya Thareeqa concerns are commendable.
Khalifa as he was fondly called, ws a remarkable mentor for the Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjids Administrative Committee aka Annadvathul Fasiyathush Shazuliya Committee. He authoured many books but not limited to Masjid and Islam – A Law as his literal outcomes. More over, he was the deputy president of the All Ceylon Jammiyathul Ulama Association. He was honoured and appointed as a member of the Wakf board.
His service continued as he excelled as a director at Bahjathul Ibrahimiyya Arabic College, Galle. A straight forward personality, he was the founder creator of the current law policies and implied terms of Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjid Administrative Committee. He also upgraded Al Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya to the state of Central College.
His achievement as the winner at the all island research article competition on “the presence of living beings in other planets” do resemble his excellence in literature. He served the Muslim community of Thotawatta, by heading masjid's administrative society for nearly 30 years.
It is noteworthy that his elder son, a Registrar of Muslim Marriages and former Panadura Alhaj. S.MA.M. Muzammil (Ghafoori) who served the community and the country from different aspects left this world on February 4, 1993.
Innalillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi Rajiyun.
May the almighty grant him Jannath-Ul-Firdawz.

Randolph Gomes and Anthea Gomes
Their memories will never fade
February 4, 2017 marked another death anniversary of Randolph Gomes. He was lovingly called, Bagi by his family members and friends.
A teenager riding a motorcycle without a license crashed into him outside his house at Mattakkuliya. His head hit the parapet wall. He was taken to hospital, but died at the ICU on February 4, as the nation celebrated 65 years of Independence. His tragic death shocked his family and friends.
During his younger days, automobiles were his passions and in his later life, he was interested in various types of clocks. He had a spacious garden, and enjoyed every moment with his collection of clocks.
I got to know him, because we worshiped at St. John's Church. Mattakkuliya. Later, my children Patricia Jerome and Lester became members of St. John's Church. Cynthia and Anthea were my friends, and Baji and his family took part in all the church activities. I was shocked to hear that Anthea passed away on February 6. Bagi and she were twins.
It was a shock when I heard of Anthea's death. This shows how much she loved Bagi, and how she couldn't bear his sudden parting. She was the live wire of the family.
As Christians we belive that we will meet our loved ones, on the heavenly shore and that there won't be any parting.
