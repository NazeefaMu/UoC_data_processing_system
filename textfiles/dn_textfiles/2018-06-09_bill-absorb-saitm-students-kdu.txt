Bill to absorb SAITM students to KDU

The Government presented a Bill to provide for the absorption of medical students registered with the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.
The Bill was presented for the first reading by Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
According to the Bill, students registered with the SAITM between September 15, 2009 and May 15, 2017, will be absorbed to the Kotelawala University to follow the MBBS Degree programme if they have obtained basic qualifications.As per the Bill the ‘basic qualifications’ mean 3 ‘Simple’ passes for Chemistry, Physics and Biology at the Advanced Level Examination or an equivalent foreign qualification.
The absorbed students will be awarded the MBBS Degree (KDU) if they successfully complete the study programme.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena objected to the presentation of Bill stating that the relevant stakeholders have not agreed to it. The minister said the Bill was discussed with all relevant stakeholders and all of them agreed to it except a certain Student’s Union. The minister insisted that justice must be meted out to 980 students registered with SAITM, and asked as to why the JO is opposed to it.
