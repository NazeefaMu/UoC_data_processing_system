[Cross Currents]
Flight of conscience


During the general election in August the JVP campaigned on the basis of a document they called "The Consent of Conscience". They wanted to awaken the conscience of the people. In particular they did so to make them reject corrupt politicians and ensure a clean Parliament. However, the election results demonstrated that there were few who heeded the advice of the JVP. It looked as if many have lost not only their conscience but also their hearts and thoughts too.
Several developments since then also show that the ilk of the latter creed is not so rare. It would not surprise us if one arrives at such a conclusion in view of the brutal killing of Seya Sadewmi and the tragic end of schoolgirl Vindya as well as the daily recurrence of such abominable crimes both reported and not reported.
As a group many politicians also belong to the same group whose conscience has fled from their souls. Let us look at a few news recent items: 1) Members of Parliament and Ministers of the former regime have not yet returned 167 official vehicles and living quarters given to them when they held office.
Some politicians behave like infants or toddlers. MPs and Ministers should have known that they are obliged to return the vehicles and residential quarters once they lost their positions in office. It is almost four months since the dissolution of last Parliament and two months since the resignation of the former Cabinet of Ministers. Yet they continue to enjoy benefits to which they are not entitled. Where is their conscience? The same goes for the man who played havoc at BMICH. As for the naïve statements of the former President they are hardly worth comment. Should we need to say anything about his media freedom than to point towards the brutal murder of Lasantha Wickrematunga, Editor of Sunday Leader?
Presidential election
These and other politicians of the same ilk are saints, if one goes by their talk. However, if one takes into consideration their deeds they turn out to be villains. One has to judge them not by their words but by their deeds.
Politicians are not alone among those who have lost or sold their conscience. There is another lot happily enjoying unearned wealth and positions. They come from among the bureaucracy, especially from its top rungs. Few news items would again illuminate this point. See for example, the following: 1) Top Customs officials nabbed while taking millions in bribes. 2) A top Police Official is in custody for aiding treasure hunters. 3) Prison officials have taken millions as bribes from the noted drug dealer Wele Suda.
In this situation people are helpless. They are perplexed as to what should be done when they see the comedies and tragedies played on the political stage by politicians. They are at a loss whether to cry or laugh.
Just take one example. The ITN television channel has lost several million rupees due to the non-payment of advertising costs of candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential election and non-acceptance of advertisements from his rival Maithripala Sirisena. At the inquiry into this incident both the former President and the UPFA Secretary at the time denied responsibility and behaved like babies who did not know anything. Probably they may have lost both their memories along with their conscience. It looks as if none of them but the people are to blame.
Legal remedies
Very often legal remedies are not resorted to even when laws are violated openly and blatantly by politicians. During the last Presidential election the President in office then distributed various gift items to induce the voters to vote him into power again. There were also instances when such distribution was spotted and goods confiscated. Yet no legal action has been taken so far against any offenders. One cannot conclude that the former President did not know the law. He or anyone of his agents must have ordered the production and distribution of such goods including those that carried the picture of him. This is a deliberate act of violating the election law. This violation was ignored.
Similarly MPs and Ministers were aware that use of State vehicles for election purposes of candidates was wrong. Yet the practice continues.
A Presidential candidate distributed various gift items among the voters in an effort to promote himself. It was a deliberate act that violated the law. When the law is violated at such high level voters become victims.
Even in the single case of the distribution of white cloth in temples among the faithful as a campaign tool, which came before the Courts there are certain developments that create anxiety among the public as to the role of the prosecution. All these developments show that the Sri Lankan judicial system has been so far unable to recover fully from the trauma experienced during the last regime.
The breakdown of Law and Order creates anarchy in society. It harms discipline. Many talk about the loss of discipline but it is only one aspect of a bigger social problem. That is the breakdown of discipline throughout society in all its spheres. Lack of discipline among teachers and students is also a part of the bigger problem. When discipline breaks down efficiency suffers in all spheres of human activity including the vital sphere of the economy. Hence development too is endangered. It creates a situation in which corruption and misuse of public property prevails. Criminal activities become daily occurrences and stablishes new norms of conduct.
Another point is that certain groups tend to take the law into their own hands. A classic example is the action of enraged mobs following a fatal road accident. However, there the action is spontaneous and not pre-planned. Though it cannot be condoned worse still is re-meditated taking over of the Law into one's own hands by groups vested with certain powers, be they economic or political. Thus many MPS and Ministers have become goons in their own right by virtue of the position they hold in society. Even their henchmen oppress the innocent and power-less citizens.
Bribery and misuse of public property
Good governance is said to be the remedy for this situation. It implies the establishment of the Rule of Law and thereby end corruption, bribery and misuse of public property, the guaranteeing of the independence of the judiciary and the public service.
It is no mean task to establish good governance. It requires time as well as arduous struggle. A beginning in this direction has been already made with the establishment of independent commissions envisaged by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. However, problems still remain. For example, there are instances of nepotism in the new administration which runs contrary to the pledges given to the people in public. Let us hope that they will remain exceptions and not become the norm once again.
Hence, vigilance of the people is required to ensure the progress of good governance. It is up to the civil society and its leaders to make the people aware of the need for mass action to win a better life for themselves and their children. It is not a simple task that could be entrusted to those that have the privilege of being members of the House by the Diyawanna for a substantial number of such persons have no conscience as shown at the beginning of this essay.
