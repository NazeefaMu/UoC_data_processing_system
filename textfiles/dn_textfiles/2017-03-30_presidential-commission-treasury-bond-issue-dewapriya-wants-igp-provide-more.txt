Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue: Dewapriya wants IGP to provide more security

The lethargic attitude of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to deploy the required number of Police officers for the protection of the Special Presidential Commission investigating into the Treasury Bond issue, cannot be accepted, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said.
He said that despite the request made by the Presidential Commission, the IGP has failed to provide protection for the commissioners and the witnesses of the commission.
“The IGP should know that this is a Special Commission appointed by the President to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue,” he said.
