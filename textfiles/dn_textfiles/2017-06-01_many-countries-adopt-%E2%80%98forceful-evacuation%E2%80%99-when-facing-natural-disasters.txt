Many countries adopt ‘forceful evacuation’ when facing natural disasters: Yapa

Many countries have adopted ‘forceful evacuation’ as a safety measure when facing natural disasters. Sri Lankans are usually not very responsive to warnings issued by the responsible officials. It is high time we bring in new legislation as to fill such gaps, for the safety of our own people.” Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said yesterday.
“All the deaths caused by this disaster were unfortunate and unnecessary. While we grieve these deaths, we should establish a firm framework regarding evacuation methods followed in a disaster situation. We can compensate any property damage happened in a natural disaster,but, we cannot compensate human lives,” Minister Yapa further said.
“A Cabinet proposal will soon be presented to bring in new legislation for disaster management, he said. The planned new legislation will be similar to the laws adopted by foreign countries on disaster management,” the Minister said.
Minister Yapa said that new legislation will have to include ‘forceful evacuation’ as a measure to minimize deaths caused by natural disasters.He pointed out the lack of adherence, from the part of the public, to evacuation warnings issued by the government, is a main cause behind the high death toll.
“Stern measures will also be taken against illegal constructions,” Minister Yapa also said. He also said Sri Lanka should minimise human activities that compromise natural habitats.
“We may not be able to stop natural disasters, but we can refrain from activities such as constructing houses on river basins, cultivating on mountains and causing rain water blockages.” Minister Yapa pointed out.
“If you take the Samasara landslide for example,there were no landslides reported in the area where there are forests.But, a number of landslides were report from the area where there were a number of human activities,” Minister Yapa pointed out.
The Minister requested the public to pay more attention to weather reports and warnings as a measure to minimise the damage caused by disaster situations.
