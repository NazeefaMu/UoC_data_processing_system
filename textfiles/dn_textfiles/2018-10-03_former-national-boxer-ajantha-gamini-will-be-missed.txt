Former National Boxer Ajantha Gamini will be missed

IP Ajantha Gamini Perera has had a long illustrious career in boxing from young days. During his school days at St, Johns Collage Nugegoda, he participated at most Inter – School tournaments including the Stubbs shield Championship winning them convincingly. His first coach was UAT Sumanapala, a former Feather weight National Champion of the Army.
Soon after leaving school he was drawn in to the police boxing squad by the Police sports officer Dharmasiri Weerakoon SP under whom Ajantha Gamini trained. Dharmasiri Weerakoon boxed at 1960 Rome Olympics.
Earlier Ajantha was taken in as a reserve Sub Inspector and later was made permanent. Ajantha was kept in the Police Field Force HQ Thimbirigasyaya for training. Possessing a strong heavy body he kept on winning regularly at the major tournaments, the Layton cup, Clifford Cup and National Championship. Earlier he boxed in the Light Middle weight under 71 Kg and latter Middle Weight under 75 Kg. He was fortunate to represent the National Boxing team at SAF Games held in Kathmandu 1999 and Adijaniya International Boxing Championship held in India coached by Capt. (Rtd) RK Indrasena then National Coach. He also represented Junior National team at Asian Junior Championship held in Bangkok in 1985.
Later he took over training the police boxing team initially making them absolutely fit. He ran and did exercises with them setting an example to all. Apart from men, he trained the Police women boxers too and some of them were able to represent the country.
He qualified as a National Referee and Judge in April 2006. He further qualified as a one Star International Referee and Judge in February 2011. In the Boxing field or outside he had no enemies. He was friendly with everyone and everybody loved him. His habit was to help anyone who needed assistance.
It is most unfortunate that he met with an untimely death, succumbing after an unexpected motor car accident in the early hours of 1st October 2018. A drunken lady driver in a jeep crashed head on to his car at Pepiliyana causing fatal injuries. During this accident his family members had been in his car. As a hero, he was able to rush his family to Kalubowila hospital and got immediate attention. However, he succumbed to severe injuries two hours later.
Three School boys have lost their beloved father. Faithfull wife has lost her husband. Sri Lanka Police has lost an able Inspector and their competent Boxing Coach. Boxing world has lost an experienced Referee and Judge. Everyone have lost a very dear friend. We pray that his loving wife and two sons recover soon. He was only 51 years old
May Ajantha Gamini attain Nibbana.
