Anantaya festive season begins with traditions

Anantaya Resorts and Spa, Chilaw, part of LAUGFS Leisure, started the festive season with the traditional Christmas cake mixing ceremony, amidst much enthusiasm and merriment.
“This ceremony is a great opportunity to share delightful memories with both guests and staff alike. For our staff, the hotel is a home away from home and it is important that the sense of family and togetherness is shared, especially in the festive season. For our guests too these simple moments are memories they would cherish on their stay with us,” Roshan R. Perera, CEO of LAUGFS Leisure said.
Led by the Resident Manager, Dev George, the guests and staff gathered at the Resort restaurant where heaps of chopped and dried fruits, nuts and spices were laid out. Dozens of eager hands joined in as ingredients including cherries, plums, sweet ginger, orange peel, and cashews were mixed along with brandy, red wine and rum.
The delicious aromas were a potent promise of the celebrations to come. The fruit was set aside in casks to mature before being used for the 200 kilos of cakes, puddings and other scrumptious delicacies to be made for the season.
Anantaya Resort and Spa, Chilaw is the first of a chain of resorts under LAUGFS Leisure, a subsidiary of LAUGFS Holdings. The hotel offers ‘infinite’ luxury and tranquility coupled with breathtaking views of the lagoon and sea, making Anantaya the ideal getaway during the festive season. Having commenced operations in 2014, the hotel has already been recognized internationally with various awards and accolades including the TripAdvisor Travelers’ Choice ofTop 25 Luxury Hotels in Sri Lanka and the Booking.com 2014 Award of Excellence.
