Shifting Agriculture Ministry to previous location
Committee to study legal procedure

A six-member expert committee, headed by President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando, has been appointed by the Agriculture Minister to study the legal procedure of shifting the Agriculture Ministry to its previous location.
The committee consists of six members - President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando, Attorney-at-Law Jagath Wickremanayake, Attorney-at-Law Ashoka Weerasuriya, former Assistant Auditor General D. L. P. Dias, Civil Engineer Chandana Edirisuriya and Agriculture Ministry Legal Officer L. G. Hector.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera charged that the use of the DPJ building for the Agriculture Ministry is a national crime.
“The DPJ Tower building is not suitable for the Agriculture Ministry and more than Rs. 21 million needs to be paid per month as the building rent,” he said.
The lease agreement for the building has been signed for five years and the ministry will have to pay more than Rs. 950 million by then.
Considering these facts, the minister has appointed the expert committee to find out the legal validity of the lease agreement, building rent that has been already spent and other expences, etc.
The minister has instructed the committee to hand over the final report and recommendations within two months.
The minister has handed over a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to give the former building of the Agriculture Ministry - Govijana Mandiraya - back to the ministry.
