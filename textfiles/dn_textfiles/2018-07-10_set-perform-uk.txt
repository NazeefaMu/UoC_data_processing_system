Set to perform in the U.K.

Paul McCartney will be returning to Britain in December with his first U.K. live tour dates in over three years.
The former Beatles star announced his eagerly-anticipated return to the road earlier this week, with news of his Freshen Up 2018 Tour and on July 5, delighted fans by confirming there would be a U.K. leg.
The singer released details of three live shows set to be held in his hometown Liverpool, London and Glasgow, Scotland, this December.
They mark the hitmaker's first series of U.K. live dates since his Out There Tour in May 2015. His most recent trek, the One on One Tour, that played to some two million fans over the course of 2016 and 2017, failed to take in the European island.
Speaking of the upcoming dates, Paul told NME he is excited about returning to his home country after such a long time away. "There's nothing like performing in front of your home crowd, especially when it's been a while," he gushed to the music magazine. Music News
