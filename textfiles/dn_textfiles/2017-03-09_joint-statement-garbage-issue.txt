Joint statement on garbage issue

Anunayake Thera of Amarapura Maha Nikaya and Chief Incumbent of Dharmapalaramaya, Mount Lavinia, Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera and Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith issued a joint statement on the garbage issue yesterday.
They requested the government to adhere to the decision of President Maithripala Sirisena and avoid dumping garbage collected from the Colombo city at Othekelle in Ja Ela.
The Anunayake Thera and the Colombo Archbishop stressed the need to make a long term plan to get over the problems of garbage without causing environmental pollution.
They said that they do not condone dumping garbage in Meeotamulla.
The statement: "In the first place, we wish to express our gratitude to President Maithripala Sirisena, for having personally informed us through telephone that the plan to dump garbage collected from the city of Colombo at Othekelle in the Ja-Ela area will not be implemented. We are happy that the President has responded to the voice of the people.
"As religious leaders, we made this intervention of behalf of the people of this area solely because, they appealed to us and also in consideration of the negative effects of this move on them. We have never had any political motive or have been influenced politically in making this appeal.
"The main reasons for our acceptance of the peoples’ plea was because of the fact that the Athanagalu Oya which flows through this area supplies drinking water for thousands of families in the Seeduwa-Katana area, drawing water from this river close to where the dumping was to take place. If the garbage from Colombo is dumped in that area, the water would be polluted and will bring adverse effects on the life of all these families.
"Besides, at present 11,000 families are on the Social Services Department's dole due to frequent floods that occur in the area. Dumping the garbage would intensify this problem further and more people will be rendered destitute during flooding. We are aware that most of the people in this area drink well-water and there are many paddy fields around. All of that would be heavily polluted.
"We do not condone dumping garbage in Meetotamulla either. We are sure that the President is well aware of the need to make a long standing plan to get over the problem of garbage without causing environmental pollution. We are grateful to the President for his decision and all praise is due to him.
"In line with that thinking, we request the government to adhere to the decision of the President and to avoid dumping garbage in Othekelle, Ja-Ela and request them to plan a recycling project for garbage to seek a permanent solution to these problems. We are sure that the Prime Minister too would stand by the people in the matter. We expect a positive response from the government to our request."
