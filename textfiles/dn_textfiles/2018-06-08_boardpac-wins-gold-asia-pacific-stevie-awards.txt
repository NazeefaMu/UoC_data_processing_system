BoardPAC wins Gold at Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards

BoardPAC, the Sri Lankan multinational software developer, won the Gold for ‘Innovation in Technology Development’ at the Asia-Pacific Stevie Awards for its award-winning iPad-enabled paperless board communication and meetings solution, bringing further recognition to the country’s capabilities in this sphere.
The Gold was awarded to BoardPAC after a stringent assessment by some of the world’s most respected executives, entrepreneurs, innovators, and business educators.
CEO Ms Lakmini Wijesundera said: “The BoardPAC software was developed as an innovative, efficient and highly secure platform that eliminates paper and facilitates decision-making within boardrooms; a tool that transforms how information is shared and used. To be recognised as the best in this category in a huge region is an extremely valuable endorsement for the company and its employees.”
“BoardPAC has competed with giants in ICT in the Asia Pacific region and emerged a winner,” Kuruppumulle added. “To have achieved this recognition for a Sri Lanka-developed software solution brings global attention to the potential for our country to be a major force in innovation, and motivates us to continue to push the boundaries in our field.”
The Stevie Awards are the world’s premier business awards. They were created in 2002 to honour and generate public recognition of the achievements and positive contributions of organisations and working professionals worldwide.
