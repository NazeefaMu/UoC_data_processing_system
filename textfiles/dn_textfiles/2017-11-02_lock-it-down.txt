Lock  it down!

Getting your foundation just right is tougher than it seems. From finding the best shade for your skin tone to applying the product evenly, achieving a flawless foundation base takes skill. Known as the base of beauty handiwork, foundation is the all-important canvas for the rest of your make up. Applying foundation and powder is seemingly simple to master if you are armed with the right tricks. Here is the why and how of it to get a flawless finish.
Types of foundation
Stick foundations are best for normal to dry skin. The coverage tends to be heavier, making them perfect for covering up blemishes, scars, reddened areas, and dark under-eye circles.
Mousse foundation is typically good for all skin types. However I think that it is best for mature skin because of its tendency to go on smoothly instead of caking up.
Powder foundation comes in compact form. Hence it makes a great foundation for women who want on-the-go portability. It is basically a powder and foundation in one.
For women interested in natural, organic makeup - mineral foundation is your absolute best bet. Mineral makeup is made up almost always primarily of minerals, which come from nature.
It is a great bet for women with sensitive skin or allergies. Waterproof foundation is made to stay on for a long time, which makes it perfect for humid areas and hot days. It also means you may not be able to remove it with just cleanser and water, you may need to use makeup remover.

Liquid foundation is a basic term for foundations that come in liquid form.
This is suited for dry skin and for mature skins and if not, for all skin types.
Choosing your foundation
When making your foundation choice there are things to consider. The first step is to match your skin tone and depth so that your foundation looks natural.
It is important to match your skin type with the correct foundation.
The real goal of your foundation is for it to look as if you are not wearing any at all. You simply give the illusion of having healthy, beautiful skin.
Matching your skin colour and foundation
The color of the foundation should match your natural skin tone. A good trick for finding the right shade of foundation is to test the foundation on your jaw line or forehead. Through this means you can find the correct shade for you.
Tinted moisturizer vs light foundation
The amount of colour pigment used in tinted moisturizer is usually less than foundation. Also, tinted moisturizers are actually a moisturizer with a little colour added. Therefore they should hydrate your skin better. A tinted moisturizer hydrates and evens out the complexion. A foundation covers the skin with a layer of colour and gives it a flawless finish.
Concealer or foundation first?
If the skin under the eye area is dry or wrinkled, it helps to apply a lightweight moisturizer first and then apply the concealer. Concealers like this should always be applied before foundation.
Wear powder with foundation
You need to wear a powder with foundation as the powder helps the foundation to set. It helps to polish your look and adds smooth velvety softness to your skin.
Avoiding cakey, flaking patches of foundation
Let’s be honest. The majority of us weren’t blessed with perfectly flawless skin, so foundation and/or concealer are a must for covering acne, age spots, and other imperfections that are part of being, well…HUMAN! The trick though is to not go overboard. Too much foundation and concealer will begin building up, and there you have it…cake face!
Instead of applying multiple layers of light/medium-coverage face product to achieve your desired finish, use a Beauty Blender or foundation stippling brush to apply a THIN layer of FULL coverage foundation. If you don’t need foundation (lucky you!), apply concealer ONLY on the areas you’d like to smooth out and use your ring finger to gently blend into your natural skin.
Conceal a blemish without accentuating it
Dot thin coats of concealer directly onto the scar with your fingers, feathering out to just beyond its parameters. Don't over apply. Too many layers will make scars more noticeable. Gently, so as not to disturb the concealer, apply foundation and loose powder to keep everything in place.
Set your concealer
It is best to use the powder to set your concealer. The powder helps to set the concealer. Then you can use your foundation over it.
Going orange
Play it safe and choose a foundation that is one shade lighter than your skin tone. You can always add depth with bronzer. There are three possible skin undertones - warm, cool, or a mixture of the two, neutral. A foundation with too much warmth for your skin can cause your face makeup to appear orange.
