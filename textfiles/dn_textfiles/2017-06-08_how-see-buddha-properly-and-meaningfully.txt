How to see the Buddha properly and meaningfully

One of the disciples of the Buddha named Vakkali had a habit of gazing upon Him every day with much attachment.
The Buddha having noticed this asked, “what are you doing here?” Vakkali’s reply was “Venerable Sir, when I look at the serene features and good complexion of your body, that itself gives me a lot of satisfaction.”
The Buddha then asked, “what do you expect to gain by admiring this body which is dirty, impure, ugly, smelly and impermanent? One who sees the Dharma sees the Buddha perfectly.”
This helps us to understand how to see the real Buddha. If we indeed want to see the real Buddha, then we must reflect on that Buddha in our minds through the realisation of His Noble Teachings.
The voice of the Buddha is the most powerful voice that has been heard in human history in support of the dignity of man and of the principle that man is the maker of his own destiny, and that man is not for religion but that religion must serve man.
That means: without becoming a slave to any religion or faith, man must attempt to make use of religion for his own betterment and liberation. Bertrand Russell, a well-known philosopher once said,
“Among the founders of all religions in this world, I respect only one man – the Gautama Buddha. The main reason was that He did not make statements regarding the origin of the world. The Buddha was the only teacher who realised the true nature of the world.
But, while many others made unjustifiable claims based on rather simplistic logic on how the world originated, the Buddha did not commit himself to any statement about a beginning. This was because he knew his listeners did not have proper intellectual training and understanding of the physical world to comprehend what He himself had discovered.”
The Buddha’s noble example was a source of inspiration to all his iron will, profound wisdom, universal love, boundless compassion, selfless service, historic renunciation, perfect purity and magnetic personality have inspired people of the present world to respect Him as the world – honoured Supreme Teacher.
Buddha says, “There may be many disciples who stay with me, follow me by holding my hand or clinging to my robes, thereby, thinking that they are close to me.
On the other hand, there may be some other disciples who are far away from me and who have not even see me, but if their minds are pure, even though they are staying far away, they are indeed very close to me. Those who stay with me but exist only with polluted minds are in fact not at all close to me.”
Under these circumstances, as shown by the doctrine of the Buddha, we all should make every effort to see the Buddha by practising His Noble Teachings wholeheartedly in order to be liberated from the bonds of the Samsaric journey which has no end.
