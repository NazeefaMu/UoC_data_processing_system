US, South Korea ready to negotiate nuclear deal with North Korea

US: US President Barack Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye said they were open to negotiations with North Korea on sanctions but Pyongyang needed to show it was serious about abandoning its nuclear weapons program.
Asked if he saw the possibility of a deal with North Korea like that reached with Iran, Mr Obama told a joint news conference after talks with Ms Park in Washington on Friday that he saw no indication that North Korea envisioned a future without nuclear weapons.
“At the point where Pyongyang says we are interested in seeing relief from sanctions and improved relations and we are prepared to have a serious conversation about denuclearisation, I think it’s fair to say that we’ll be right there at the table,” he said.
“We haven’t even gotten to that point yet, because there has been no indication on the part of the North Koreans as there was with the Iranians that they could foresee a future in which they did not possess or were not pursuing nuclear weapons.”
Kim Jong-un’s nuclear arsenal consists of about 20 warheads – twice as many as had been thought, according to Chinese experts.
Ms Park said it was important to have concerted international efforts towards a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue and said she had agreed with Mr Obama on the need to strengthen diplomatic efforts.
However, she said in language certain to infuriate North Korea: “There is a saying: You can take a horse to the trough, but you can’t make it drink water.”
North Korea said in June its nuclear weapons are an “essential deterrence” and it has no interest in a deal like that reached with Iran.
Mr Park said she would seek to strengthen co-operation on the North Korean issue at a three-way summit with China and Japan that she will host in Seoul early next month.
The United States has been keen to encourage better relations between South Korea and Japan, its two biggest allies in Asia, given concerns about North Korea and an increasingly assertive China.
Ms Park has worked to warm up ties with China and raised some eyebrows in Washington when she attended Beijing’s military parade to mark the end of World War II last month.
Mr Obama said the US wanted to see a strong South Korean relationship with China, just as it wanted such a relationship itself, but Washington wanted to see Seoul speak out when Beijing did things that weakened international rules.
