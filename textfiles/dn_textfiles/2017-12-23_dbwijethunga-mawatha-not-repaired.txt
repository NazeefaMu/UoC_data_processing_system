D.B.Wijethunga Mawatha not repaired

Residents of Pilimathalawa engaged in a protest campaign demanding the carpeting of the Pilimathalawa D.B. Wijethunga Mawatha blocking the Kandy - Colombo main road yesterday (22). The protest ended after a town engineer arrived and promised to renovate the road by next year. The road has been named after third Executive President of Sri Lanka, D. B. Wijethunga.
