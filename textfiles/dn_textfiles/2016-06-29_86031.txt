Gammanpila cannot use patriotism as a cloak to hide his frauds: Warnasinghe

MP Udaya Gammanpila cannot cover up his frauds and corrupt acts by hiding behind patriotism, politics and the Sinhala Buddhist ideology, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) national organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He was addressing a press conference at the JHU Office at Battaramulla yesterday. He said some groups were trying to misinterpret the arrest of Gammanpila as a political witch-hunt.
“Let the law take its own course. This matter is devoid of politics. It involves an Australian business partner whom Gammanpila worked with. Even some print media are backing Gammanpila in a shameless manner without giving fair coverage to both parties,” he said.
Warnasinghe said according to details received by the JHU office, there was evidence to prove Gammanpila had been jailed on a previous occasion too.
“Gammanpila had been in Welikada prison for three days after he was produced before the Fort Magistrate on December 5, 1997 over a financial fraud at Delta Consolidated Pvt Ltd. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Media Spokesman Thushara Dissanayake had told a newspaper that he would unconditionally beg pardon from the nation if it was proved that Gammanpila had been in jail before. Now it is time for him to do what he said and we ask him to resign from his post too,” he said.
Warnasinghe said certain groups were trying to tarnish the image of Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka by using this matter, adding that he has no connection whatsoever in the arrest of Gammanpila.
Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera said they had written to the IGP asking for a fair investigation over the statement by Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera during a press conference held by Pevidi Handa Organisation recently, that Minister Ranawaka had leveled death threats to a certain individual who had defected to the other side.
