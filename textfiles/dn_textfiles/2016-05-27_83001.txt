No-Confidence Motion against Finance Minister to be taken up on 8 June

 
Parliament has decided to take up the vote on the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on 8 June.
Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake told the Daily News, the debate on the NCM would be held from 2pm to 6.30pm. The NCM was submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by the Joint Opposition on March 24.
 It carries the signatures of 37 Joint Opposition MPs. Dasanayake said the Party Leaders presided by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who met last Wednesday agreed to schedule the NCM on June 8. The vote will be taken at 6.30pm.
The no-faith motion stated the Minister had misled the House with inaccurate information on the economy and the finance of the country. It stated the faith on the Minister had been lost, as he had put the country in an economic crisis.
The Joint Opposition handed over another NCM against Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to the Speaker on April 5. It carries the signatures of 42 MPs. The Speaker had not taken a decision on it yet. The UPFA MPs handed over a NCM against Minister Karunanayake to the Speaker on May 18 last year too, but it was not taken up as the House was dissolved on June 29.
