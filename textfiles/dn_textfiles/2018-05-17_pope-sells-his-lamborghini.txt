Pope sells his Lamborghini

VATICAN CITY: A Lamborghini supercar owned by Pope Francis has been sold for nearly four times its original asking price. The 198 mph two-seater Hurrican, which would typically be worth around £155,000, was donated to the Pope in November last year.
But with a speed limit of just 9 mph in the Vatican City there would be little use for the Pope to have such a powerful supercar. So he decided to sell it and donated the proceeds to charitable causes – but only after he signed and blessed the bonnet.
The car was entered into RM Sotheby’s Monte Carlo sale over the weekend, where it ended-up selling for an eye-watering £615,000.
The Iraqi city of Nineveh, which was besieged by ISIS, will get £430,000 from the sale, with the remaining £185,000 split equally among three other charities.
RM Sotheby’s described the Lamborghini as being in ‘as-new condition’ having remained in static storage since it was built late last year. The car is finished in Bianco Monocerus white paint with contrasting gold Giallo Tiberino stripes in homage to the colours of the flag of the Vatican City.
It has been fitted with 20-inch alloy wheels and has leather seats and features as 5.2-litre V10 engine which generates a staggering 570 bhp. This gives the Italian supercar a 0-62 mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 198mph. Augustin Sabatié-Garat, auction manager, RM Sotheby’s Europe, said: ‘We are honoured to have hosted such a hotly contested bidding war for this unique Lamborghini Huracan.
‘We give thanks to His Holiness Pope Francis for donating the sale fee to charity, and for Automobili Lamborghini for gifting the car, as we are pleased to have played a part in sourcing money for good causes.
‘The fact that this car sold for nearly three times’ worth its estimate, and much higher than the model’s standard retail price, is telling of how much interest it attracted.’
