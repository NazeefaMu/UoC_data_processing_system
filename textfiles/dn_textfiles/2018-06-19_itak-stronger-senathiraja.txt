ITAK stronger than before: Senathiraja

The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) had been re-organised under nine major lines as a strong political party which could face any future election in a successful manner, ITAK Party Leader Mavai Senathiraja said.
He said the re-organisation was effected at a conference held at Mullaitivu on June 16, which was attended by all members of the party’s central committee, including Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader Parliamentarian R. Sampanthan.
He said the great political setback suffered by the TNA at the recent local government election was discussed at length and it was decided that the setback was not due to any fault on the part of the party, but due to the nature of the electoral system itself.
He said that during the discussions, an effective plan for development work to be undertaken with decentralised budget funds of parliamentarians, was also finalised laying employers on funds received by members elected to local government institutions as well.
ITAK, as the main component of the TNA, appealed to all Tamil parties which left the TNA to regroup under the TNA banner once again for the welfare of the Tamil community.
Asked whether a decision was taken to field C. V. Vigneswaran as the chief ministerial candidate once again at the future Provincial Council Elections, Senathiraja said it was not so. The decision not to field Vigneswaran as the TNA candidate for the chief minister post once again, was taken three months ago at the central committee meeting of the party. He said no decision was taken to field either himself or M. A. Sumanthiran as a candidate.
Senathiraja further said there were many suitable candidates in the party, adding that to select a person prematurely, was politically inexpedient.
