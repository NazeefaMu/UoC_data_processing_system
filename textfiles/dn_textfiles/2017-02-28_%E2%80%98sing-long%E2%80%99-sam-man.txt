‘Sing a long’ with Sam the Man

A ‘Sing a long’ party will come alive with ‘Sam the Man’ at the Lotus Ballroom of the Grand Oriental Hotel, on March 4 at 7.30 pm.
This ‘Sing a long’ party is a presentation of the Centenary Group of the Old Boys Association of S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia.
The Centenary Group comprises students who were in College in the year 1951, when the school celebrated its 100th Anniversary. It is the most vibrant group of the Old Boys Association which has undertaken many projects for the Development of the College.
Sam – when he was performing at the Royal-Thomian Dance in London was invited to the Royal Albert Hall for a sing along conducted by ‘Max By graves’. It was here that he got the idea of having a similar show here in Colombo.
The very first Sing Along was conducted by Sam at the Galle Face Hotel in 1997. It was a resounding success and thereafter the sing a longs became the order of the day.
Sam in his own inimitable style has developed the sing along to suit international standards. Perhaps this is one reason his presentation has an appeal both here and the international arena.
