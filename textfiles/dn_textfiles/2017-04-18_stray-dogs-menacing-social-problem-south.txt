Stray dogs - a menacing social problem in South

Rise in the stray dog population poses a severe health hazard to the public of the Southern Province and at present it has turned into a grave social issue, Rabies Control Unit of the Galle, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital said.
Rabies which is considered deadlier than AIDS is a viral disease transmitted from dogs and other similar mammals such as cats and rodents etc. As per statistics available at the Rabies Control Unit of KTH in 2015, there were 147,530 domesticated and stray dogs in the South out of which 27,575 were wandering animals.
Rabies is most commonly transmitted from stray dogs to other animals. However, if a dog with rabies bites a human, he or she would be infected with the deadly viral disease. The government spends massive sums of money on vaccines given to patients with dog bites. As some sources reveal, the state had to spend about Rs. 400 million on vaccines for dog bites.
During last year, 9,685 people with mammal bites were admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital for treatment. An aggregate of 3,233 people were administered with Anti Rabies Vaccine (ARV) and Anti Rabies Serum (ARS). During January and February of this year alone 1,176 people were treated for dog bites at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital out of which 421 were given the Anti Rabies Vaccine.
About 90 percent of such victims came to hospital with stray and pet dog bites while 5 percent of them had been bitten by cats. The remaining 5 percent of sufferers were treated for squirrel, bats, mongoose and cattle bites, the Rabies Control Unit of KHT disclosed further.
Particularly, health authorities point out that stray dogs abundantly survive at public and religious places alone the coastal belt of the province.
The Rabies Control Unit of the hospital had referred brain parts and skulls of 98 mammals including those of dogs, cats and squirrels etc. to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) and 67 of them were found to be infected with Rabies. Moreover, during the first three months of this year 36 skulls of suspected mammals were sent to the MRI for medical tests and 23 of them were identified as rabies positive.
Patients with mammal bites from all three districts of the Southern Province namely Galle, Matara and Hambantota come to the unit for treatment. This is the only unit for such treatment. About 50 people with mammal bites come daily to this unit for treatment, Senior Medical Officer of the Rabies Control Unit of KTH Dr. Geethanjali Gunarathne told the media.
Making a public appeal Dr. Geethanjanli urged the people to make swift arrangements to dispatch the head of the dog to the Rabies Unit of KTH if it dies soon after it bites a human.
The skull should be delivered to the medical research unit within 24 hours following the incident. This is the only medical research unit for the whole Southern Province. In dispatching the head of the animal its skull should not come directly in contact with ice. Before it is put into an ice bag it should be safely deposited in a separate polythene bag first to avoid water absorption to the dog’s head, Dr. Gunarathne further explained. When contacted, Southern Province Health Services Director Dr. P. Wijesuriya said continued preventive measures were being launched to control the stray dog population of the province. Provincial Health Ministry has allocated Rs. 3 million for a dog sterile project in 2017. Some organizers object to the killing of stray dogs. “However we are trying our best to address the issue for the benefit of the people of the South,” Dr. Wijesuriya further said.
