Muslim Ministers call for justice

Nearly 20 Muslim parliamentarians handed over a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting his intervention on the ‘continued hate campaign’, adding that those who have been arrested on charges of spreading hate and inciting violence have been granted bail when they can be tried under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
The document signed by Ministers A. H. M. Fowzie, Rauff Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen, Faizer Musthapa, M. H. A. Haleem and Mujibur Rahman among others have requested the President to provide a permanent solution to the protracted problem within a period of 30 days.
“The recent incidents in Ampara, Digana, Teldeniya and Kandy are not spontaneous reactions to any particular issue, but an organized strategy to destroy the Muslim morale and economy,” the letter reads. “We suspect there are bigger forces handling these perpetrators of violence.”
The Ministers added that “violence was unleashed in the presence of the police and armed forces, allowing mobs to move freely even when curfew was enforced and the country was in a state of emergency.’
Adding that there is ample evidence to convict the extremists, the Ministers state that many of those who were initially arrested have been released on conditional bail leading to a continued hate campaign and mayhem across the country.
