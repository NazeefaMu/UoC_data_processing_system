Speaker cannot challenge  President’s powers - NFF

National Freedom Front (NFF) Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said yesterday that Speaker Karu Jayauriya does not have any powers to challenge the President’s Executive powers.
He said the Speaker has made various statements about the prorogation of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President has special powers to prologue Parliament for two months under extraordinary circumstances, but so far he has prorogued Parliament by only 11 days.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Muzammil said if the Speaker tries to convene a Parliament that has been prorogued by President Sirisena, he too becomes a part of an anti-government conspiracy.
We hope that he will not tarnish his image by getting involved in this matter. Even on earlier occasions, several former Presidents did not inform the former Speakers when they prorogued Parliament. There is no legal requirement to inform the Speaker. If the Speaker has any problem with regard to this, he should consult the Attorney-General. Otherwise, he can obtain a determination from the Supreme Court, Muzammil said.
The Speaker cannot challenge the President’s decision which is consistent with the Constitution. The AG has in fact ruled that the President’s decision is legal and lawful, he said.
People again have hope of a new journey for the country as a result of the President’s brave decision taken last Friday. The UNP-JVP coalition is obstructing the new journey of the government. Although they acted as separate parties, various comments made by these party members show that they have a connection with each other. All of them want the reconvening of Parliament, he said.
The powers belonging to the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary are enshrined in theConstitution. Parliament cannot challenge the Executive powers of the President. There is no provision that the Prime Minister should be appointed with the approval of Parliament, Muzammil said.
NFF MP Padma Udaya Shantha said the UNP wants to destabilise the country by organising protests in Colombo with the participation of underworld gangs and extremists. They want to show the international community that this country is unstable.
But we have strong patriotic forces to defeat all these efforts, he said.
Former Minister Sajith Premadasa brings crowds to the protest to show his ability to become the next leader, while former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe brings crowds to consolidate his leadership in the party, Udaya Shantha said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the assassination plot on the President and the former Defence Secretary, he said an investigation should be conducted to probe how former Minister Rajitha Senaratne has the voice recordings of Namal Kumara and DIG Nalaka Silva while the investigation is being conducted by the CID.
