Moragahakanda evacuees return to live on road

Thirty members of families whose houses were submerged by the Moragahakanda project in Elagamuwa, Naula, have returned to the area on Wednesday to live on the road. The people who are all men said they returned to their old village since the Mahaweli Authority had failed to keep its promise and pay compensation to the families who lost their abodes to the waters of Moragahakanda.
When Naula Divisional Secretary Nishantha Karunaratne visited the scene through a jungle pathway, they complained that they had been evicted without paying compensation.
They have returned to the place to live on the road, they said.
