KPMG clears out South African bosses amid Gupta scandal

Accountancy firm KPMG has removed the leadership team of its South African arm after an internal investigation into work it did for the Gupta family. Chief executive Trevor Hoole, chairman Ahmed Jaffer, chief operating officer Steven Louw and five other senior partners have all left the firm.
No evidence of corruption or illegal action by staff was found, KPMG said.
But KPMG said work done for the Guptas, who have close links to President Jacob Zuma, "fell short of our standards".
The new chief executive of KPMG's South African arm, Nhlamu Dlomu, said: "This has been a painful period and the firm has fallen short of the standards we set for ourselves and that the public rightly expects from us."
