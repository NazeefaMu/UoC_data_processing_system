Former OIC in illegal affair attacked

A former OIC of the Suriyawewa Police has been attacked with a weapon on December 28 by occupants of a house in Suriyawewa when the former visited the house to meet a woman who allegedly had an illegal affair with him, Suriyawewa police said.
The injured is a resident of Udakiriella, Ratnapura and he has been interdicted from the service of the Suriyawewa Police. Earlier he had worked (2008-2009) as the OIC of the police station.
He had started the affair while he had been the OIC of the Suriyawewa Police. The husband of the woman had been shot dead by an unidentified person at the time.
The couple had stopped their affair about a year ago, but they have been in disagreement over a monetary issue thereafter. The woman has been evading him and the man was pursing her for many months to get his money back, police said.
He had visited the house recently and inquired about the woman from the occupants. When they responded negatively, the interdicted police officer had clashed with them. In the ensuing clash, the woman’s father and brother had attached the police officer.
Thereafter, the man had lodged a complaint in the Suriyawewa Police and admitted to the Suriyawewa Hospital. But he had fled the hospital and gone to the woman’s place again. Then they had attacked him with a sharp implement. Suriyawewa police, on a tip off that the former police officer had fallen near a house in the town bleeding, had arrived at the location and admitted him to the Hambantota Hospital.
The woman’s father, Dikowita Kakanamge Somadasa (60) and her brother Dikowita Kakanamge Ramesh (22), were arrested and produced before the Suriyawea Magistrate. They were released on Rs. 1 lakh bail each.
Two other court cases against the former OIC that he had deceived a woman promising her to marry her and taking Rs. 31,400 from her and that he had misappropriated a jeep of the police are ongoing at the Hambantota Magistrate Court, police said.
Suriyawewa police are investigating.
