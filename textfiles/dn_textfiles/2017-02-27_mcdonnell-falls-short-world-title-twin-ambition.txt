McDonnell falls short in world title twin ambition

KINGSTON UPON HULL, UK,| Sunday – Britain's Gavin McDonnell missed out on joining twin brother Jamie as a world champion after losing on points to Mexico's Rey Vargas for the vacant World Boxing Council super-bantamweight belt.
Had the previously undefeated McDonnell, 30, won he and Jamie, the World Boxing Association bantamweight champion, would have become the first British twins to both hold world titles simultaneously.
But although Saturday's fight took place in Hull, not far from McDonnell's base in Doncaster, northern England, there was no denying Vargas was a worthy winner after landing the better punches. McDonnell, however, was adamant he would bounce back from losing his maiden world title bout after going the distance with Vargas.
“My feet were a little bit slow and I just couldn't pin him. I was a little bit too eager at times and credit to Rey, he beat me fair and square,” McDonnell told Sky Sports.
“I gave it everything and I just hope everyone enjoyed it. I feel as though I've let everybody down. The support's been fantastic, my first time topping the bill and I just fell short this time.
“I've gone the distance there with a great fighter and I've shown I belong at the level, I just need to start tweaking things.
“No doubt I'll be a world champion, it's just a few more fights to get another crack.” AFP
