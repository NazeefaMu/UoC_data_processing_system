Seven stuck in hospital elevator

Seven people had to spend nearly one hour inside an elevator which was stuck due to a technical failure at the Vavuniya hospital.
The elevator carrying seven people had suddenly stopped between two floors of the hospital, and they were rescued after about an hour by the hospital staff.
Those who stuck in the lift were heading to a ward in the fourth floor.
They said they asked for assistance via the emergency phone of the lift but they were answered by an elevator company in Colombo.
The company had informed the hospital authorities about the incident. Two people of the seven had suffered breathing difficulties.
Officer in charge of the maintenance at the hospital was accused by the rescued of failing to respond to their calls for help.
They urged the hospital authorities to conduct a probe into the incident.
