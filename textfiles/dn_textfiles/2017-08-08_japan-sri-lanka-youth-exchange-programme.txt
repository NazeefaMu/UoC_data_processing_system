Japan - Sri Lanka Youth Exchange programme

Around 16 Japanese students from Kosei Gakuen Girls High School Tokyo will visit Sri Lanka from August 21 to 28 to take part in a Youth Exchange programme. This program has been on from 2011 as youth delegations from both countries visited each other’s counties and resided there, taking part in a number of activities.
The Japanese youth will take part in a home-stay programme in the houses of Sri Lankan students of different ethnicity and religions.
The students will visit Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Sigiriya and Pinnawela. The programme consists of three chapters: peace building through religions, sports and arts programmes which will be held from August 5 to 7, Japan - Sri lanka Youth Exchange Programme which will unfold from August 21 to 28 and the AMDA-Suganami Scholarship Awards.
