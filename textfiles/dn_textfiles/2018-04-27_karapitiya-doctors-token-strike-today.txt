Karapitiya doctors on token strike today

 
Doctors attached to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital will launch a 24-hour token strike today (27).
Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the strike is to protest the commencement of heart surgeries by the British doctor who is now investigated for his credentials to conduct heart surgeries.
Hospital sources said that the British surgeon (67) had been performing heart surgeries at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital since 2015 without a valid licence from Britain.
“He did not have the practising licence in the United Kingdom (UK) that was needed to be renewed regularly. He only had the registration of the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK, and not practising rights. He was deprived of practising rights in the UK in 2015 for some reasons and he had concealed it while producing his documents to the SLMC,” the GMOA said.
