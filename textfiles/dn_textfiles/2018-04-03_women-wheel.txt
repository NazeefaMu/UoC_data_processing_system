Women at the wheel

March is known as the month which empowers women as the International Women’s Day falls on this month. Popular taxi hailing app Pick Me has commemorated the month by launching ‘Pick Me Sri Liya Abhinandan’ which allows Sri Lankan women to gain an income as taxi drivers.
Women taxi drivers are a rare sight in the city. However if it is introduced in the correct manner with safety rules and regulations this behind the wheels profession can be a lucrative initiative for women.
Pick Me has picked up on this idea and come up with a novel way of making job opportunities available for women in this arena.
“Female labour participation serves as a significant component of labour utilization in an economy. Women have always played a leading role in bringing income to the nation. Our aim is to give them an hand in becoming successful entrepreneurs without necessarily being part of the corporate workforce,” said Pick Me Chief Executive Officer Zulfer Jiffry.
He notes that the Pick Me female drivers they have employed so far have shown extraordinary skills in time and finance management. Being mothers and juggling household chores with a multiple professions, they also drive the taxis full time. Some of them are even single mothers yet they manage to face the trials in life single handedly and with courage.
“They inspire positive change in the community. We provide them with an environment in which they can work without fear of being undermined, underappreciated and undervalued,” he added.
One of the main reasons women do not get into the driving profession is because of the safety concerns related to the job. However the Pick Me teams assures that since the drivers are equipped with the information of their customers they would not be facing issues concerning their safety.
Pick Me currently has around 30 female drivers driving all types of vehicles from three wheelers to sedans. Pick Me hosts the largest organised taxi fleet in the country with over 12,000 three wheelers, mini cars, cars, vans and luxury sedans. Their passenger base is over one million. Pick Me also provides corporate travelling solutions to businesses and organisations with the Pick Me Business Portal, the benefits of which is currently enjoyed by over 150 corporates in the country.
Speaking to the media 33-year-old Lasanda Deepthi, the driver of a tuk-tuk and a mother with one school-going child, says that this profession provides her with the ideal opportunity to make a living whilst multi tasking with her duties as a mother.
“I have enough time to drop my daughter at school and take her to classes. I run hires in my three-wheeler during my spare time so that I can make a few pennies on the side,” she said.
Senani de Silva joined PickMe as a lady driver in October 2015. She says that it began as a part time profession for her. However later she decided to do it full time since she could earn more from the job.
“I gave up on my Government job and started driving the taxi. Sometimes I have worked for 24 hours. Usually by the time I finish my work it is 3 or 4 am. I have never faced any embarrassing or difficult situations,” she expressed. For Sunethra Jayaweera being behind the wheel is a stress reviver. She terms it as a convenient female centric profession.
“We can manage this job while attending to our family commitments. We can engage in this profession without depending on others to bring the money home,” she noted. Deepthi notes that respect is an important factor to her. The passengers have been very understanding towards her and had even given her helpful advice like on safer roads to take.
“Many of my passengers have told me that it was their first experience with a female three-wheeler driver. Overall I am very happy with the response I have got so far,” she said.
