Cops escort lost monk

A 17-year-old novice monk who was stranded at the Badulla bus stand while on his way from a temple in Matara to Welimada was escorted by police to the Badulla Police Station. Police said the monk who is a resident of Welimada had felt homesick and had boarded a bus from Galle to visit his home without informing anyone at the Galle temple.
Badulla Police Acting OIC Inspector Jayantha de Silva said the monk would be handed over to his parents.
