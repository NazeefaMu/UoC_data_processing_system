WB Country Director Idah Riddihough appreciating the Sri Lanka’s economic performance said that despite significant challenges, it remained broadly satisfactory in 2016 and early 2017. The WB recognizes the corrective policy measures taken in 2016 following expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented in the previous year as early signs of stabilization

A combination of increase in revenues and rationalization of expenditures helped reducing the fiscal deficit from a reported 7.6 percent in 2015 to a 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016. While the boost received from increased profits and dividend income from State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) played a key role in increasing revenues; the changes to the VAT Act implemented late 2016 and improved revenue administration helped strengthen the tax collection.
The World Bank predicts that fiscal deficit in Sri Lanka is projected to fall to 5.2 percent of GDP for 2017. This is thanks to the impact of VAT changes in its first full year.
In outer years, the new Inland Revenue Act is expected to expand the tax base for corporate and personal income tax while shifting from tax holidays to a performance-based incentive regime, where the incentives depend on actual rather than promised investment.
On the expenditure side, WB projects the increased fiscal space will benefit primarily public investment, assuming no major additional recurrent expenditure commitments.
Under this baseline, the fiscal deficit to narrow the deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. The primary fiscal balance is projected to become marginally positive in 2017.
