EBONY LUSTER IN HIS PAINTINGS

African art has always inspired Swansea-based Sri Lankan artist, Britisher, Ricky Weerarackoon ever since he grabbed his brush to paint which he took up to after early retirement as a hobby and presently a thriving artist who is self-taught. A wide traveler, it was African art that caught his imagination. The gloss refulgence, shining surface of brilliance and the radiant beauty of the black skin of men and women was there to stay at his art.
Weerarackoon went to UK a teenager for studies and met up with his future wife at college, the beautiful Welsh Lynn Williams. After the completion of studies in London, he decided to settle down in Wales where Lynn's parents lived, Swansea.
South Wales has always remained beautiful with all her wide roads and pavements dotted with giant sprawling trees always in bloom during the seasons rural and fresh blowing in fragrances and an artist's paradise, removed from traffic and rush hours, speeding across busy towns, schools, high-rising buildings that the artist was used during his study time in London.
Gleams where he lives is so fresh and clean with their main Anglican Church, St. Peter's Cathedral a stone throw away with her regular worshippers who gather to venerate and pray to Jesus Christ and fellowship where the artist play a main role in raising sponsorship management for the distress. Infect, during the Tsunami is Sri Lanka, he collected and sent a container load of dry food, canned items and blankets along with generous funding cheque to SL Red Cross for the victims of Tsunami. The parishioners gladly responded. This was the human side of the artist who still loves his country. He is also a volunteer in the Cancer Hospital in Swansea; feed the hungry and homeless who are huddled in the open or around buildings at night, with soups and bread atleast three times a week. God-fearing, the church is his second how. The almost-beggars around his vicinity are his concern.
Apart from his fascination for the black skinned tall, slim figures, he adores the ocean. The sea in shades of aquamarine, frothy rising waves thrashing the helpless boats that are sent tossing in every direction. The flaming horizon, dark nights at times with intensity, achieved with what crashes in his mind to put on board. Despite his wonderful technique, he never appears to be a nature artist with so much greener, lush burgeon and blooming flowers over which butterflies sail from one to another or the droning bees, collecting honey to suck. It is an unusual approach to an artist who is a keen observer of nature around his home garden which he maintains.
His painting reveal the inner depth of an artist in search of a subject outside African art but still find at difficult to turn to nature painting when it is so abundantly around him. May be it is so when like in many post-Impressionists who could not step outside their chosen subjects. Ricky Weerachoon is true to form and his exhibits/collection prove where his art is focused.
