A blot on the escutcheon of good governance
It is with deep regret that the Muslim citizens of Sri Lanka have to complain about Ven Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera’s mocking at Allah and Koran in public to right thinking intellectuals and honest politicians who belong to the majority community-mostly Buddhists.
All followers of the Buddha will agree with the main tenet of Buddhism as tolerance to other religions. Then, why is the learned monk alone intolerant to Muslims and their religion, Islam? Is he a communalist, an atheist or an agnostic? However, the Buddhist monk is a lawbreaker without any respect to law and justice. It has been amply proved without any legal action.
As a spokesman of the affected Muslims living in Sri Lanka, I sincerely appeal to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the promoters of Yahapalanaya to deal with this unruly behaviour in order to maintain the discipline imposed by Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
