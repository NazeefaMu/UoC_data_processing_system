One third of Lankans suffer from or prone to diabetes

One third of Sri Lankans (30 to 35 percent of the total population) suffer from diabetes or are prone to developing diabetes.
The percentage suffering from hypertension is 30 to 35 percent, Consultant Physician attached to the National Hospital Dr. Priyankara Jayawardena said.
Addressing a media seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said only around 20 or 25 percent of the people who suffer from diabetes and hypertension know that they have the issue while others live without knowing their health condition. When the two health conditions are combined, it often leads to strokes, he said.
Prof. Pujitha Wickramasinghe attached to the Department of Pediatrics of the Faculty of Medicine in the Colombo University said 10 to 15 urban children are overweight and three to four percent of the urban children are obese. The excessive intake of sugar in various forms leads to these two conditions.
Most parts of their necks (around the neck) become dark which is one of the first signs of developing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes etc. Zero calorie beverages have the risk of developing strokes, dementia etc. People become addicted to sugar and it can be prevented by not introducing sugar to them from the point of conceiving a child. Then they do not crave for sugar, he said.
