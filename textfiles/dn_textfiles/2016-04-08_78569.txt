Wedding Season: Deals hard to refuse

 
With the wedding season beginning months away, couples are already busy running around getting everything they need for their Big Day ready. And planning a wedding can be very hectic. Luckily now you got Wedding Planners to lend you a hand...but then there are the people who like to take care of their wedding all on their own. For those people, all they need is go to the their preferred venue and give their details.
Now restored and given a face lift yet keeping the original charm of the hotel, the Galle Face Hotel has unveiled a great line up of amazing wedding packages, a hopeful couple to be should check out.
Spoilt for choice
"Our packages are highest in the market but we have a lot of value additions that go with them and something which people are not talking about or know about", Galle Face Hotel Catering & Conventions Director Thakshila Galappaththy said. We are providing drummers, dancers, ashtaka, poruwa additions, jayamangala gatha, including the choice of transportation - horse carriage or BMW Six series, which are given at no additional cost. On top of that we are providing the Scottish Bagpipers as well which is something very new.
"At Buddhist weddings, people have to go here, there, everywhere looking for an ashtaka person, to get the nakath time, travelling back and forth which is a big force. If you are getting married all you have to do is give us your contact details. We give the information to him and he will be there at your doorstep - be it your home or office or the hotel at the time convenient to you. We are the only hotel providing this facility. With people having a hectic life this is a relief for them", Thakshila added.
"When someone is planning their wedding, they call all the hotels and ask how much a plate is. We don't sell plates - we are selling an Experience", he stressed.

They are also giving out amazing discounts for the couples and the bridal party too. There is a 15 percent discounts for weddings until March 2017. Bridesmaid's who plan to get married next year will get a 15 percent off as well if they provide a picture of themselves at the Galle Face Hotel until March 2017 and a 10 percent if they have scheduled their weddings for December 2017. Even Graduate professionals (doctors, lawyers, engineers) are eligible for the 15 percent discount till March 2017. Then there are deals for generation weddings, such as if your grandparents or parents got married at the Galle Face Hotel, then you are entitled to a 10 percent discount. The hotel has also partnered with some of the leading entrepreneurs when it comes to weddings and their package deal allows the prospective couple special discounts at these selected partners.
Complimentary wedding
Also, if you are lucky, you might just stand a chance to win a complimentary wedding courtesy the hotel. All you got to do is, pay an advance, fill up a card and enter their raffle draw and who knows...you might just walk away with a free wedding of a lifetime that includes the food, flower arrangements, vehicle, room and special discounts for jewellery.

When it comes to Muslim weddings, seating won't be an issue as they can facilitate up to 1000 guests in their ballroom. Plus they do serve Halal food. And for the Catholic weddings, where the main ceremony usually takes place in the church, the Galle Face Hotel will provide canapés for 150 guests. The wedding party will have to come pick it up from the hotel and then take it to the church. For the menu, guests can choose from their Jubilee experience and Imperial experience. The couple can also meet up with Executive Chef and fine tune the menu if they want.
"We are planning to organize a wedding show in a couple of months to come. From photographers to flower people to jewelers and hotel event coordinators - they will be there. Plus we like to let the people know that we are ready to provide the same facilities and services with a dedicated manager for every couple to look after all their needs. There is no discrimination here. Plus they are no hidden charges. You pay one price and you get everything for that price. You can choose from 10 varieties of Welcome drinks. We will provide one suite for the overnight stay and a changing room. Recently we launched a new deal where if a couple has their wedding here, they will be given a six pax dinner - (groom's parents, bride's parents and the couple) - creating the unity amongst the families. And we will give a 2 pax dinner on their anniversary", Thakshila stated.
Speaking about the venues, they have the Grand Ballroom, Jubilee Ballroom and also do outdoor venues such as the South Lawn and the Sea Lawn (edge of the beach) for the Poruwa ceremony. One of their highlights was their Destination wedding where they had people coming from all around the world. They had booked 130 rooms for four nights with ceremonies such as Sangeeth, Mehendi and Mandap and the Galle Face Hotel took care of everything.
It's an iconic heritage and one of the oldest hotels and so far, after the relaunch of the hotel, they have had around 80 weddings with amazing positive feedback. So I guess planning your wedding for 2017 will be just a breeze.
