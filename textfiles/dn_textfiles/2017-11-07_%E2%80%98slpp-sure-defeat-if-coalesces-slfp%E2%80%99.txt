‘SLPP sure to defeat if coalesces with SLFP’

People will not cast their votes in favour of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa if the SLPP decided to contest the forthcoming Local Council elections by coalescing with the SLFP, former NCP Chief Minister S. M. Ranjith Samarakoon said.
Addressing a meeting of SLPP activists at the Kurundankulama residence of Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena on November 4, Samarakoon said inviting the SLPP to join hands with leaders who brought defeat to the SLFP at the last General Elections amounted to a big conspiracy. Such an invitation to join hands could be adduced as another conspiracy to stifle people power.
He said people today had no confidence in the people who held positions in the SLFP. He said the SLPP would capture power in almost 75 percent of the local council institutions, totalling nearly 286. The UNP and the SLFP would face an ignominious defeat at the forthcoming local elections whether the two parties contested it jointly or separately, he said.
