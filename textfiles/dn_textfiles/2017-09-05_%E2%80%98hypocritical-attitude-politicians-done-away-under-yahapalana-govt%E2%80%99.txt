‘Hypocritical attitude of politicians done away with under Yahapalana govt’

All necessary steps were taken to eliminate the hypocritical attitude of politicians soon after establishing the ‘Yahapalana Government ‘ on the mandate of the people, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalata Athukorale said.
She said so at a reception accorded to her by the United National Party supporters and citizens in the Eheliyagoda area at a reception held at the Eheliyagoda PS auditorium.
Prior to the reception, Minister Athukorale received blessings of the Maha Sangha at Eheliyagoda Sri Madarasingharamaya Temple.
Minister Athukorale said although she has to handle two different ministries, she will try to perform her duties honestly for the well-being of the people.
“A group of narrow-minded persons says that the present government did nothing for the past two years. However, the establishment of peace and harmony throughout the country and taking steps to rebuild the nation by our government is admired by the critically-thinking citizens,” she pointed out.
She added that during the period of the previous regime, their henchmen were allowed to cheat the people and earn money under the so-called development. “We have already finalized arrangements to provide 10,000 land deeds for the landless, pave the way to create more employment opportunities and to supply electricity for the needy,” Minister Athukorale said.
She said in order to end the Eheliyagoda town garbage disposal problem, another plot of land from Beruwana Estate will be allocated for the Pradeshiya Sabha.
Iddamalgoda Denagamuwa Viharadhipathi Ven Pohorabawe Wimalatissa Thera, Sabargamuwa Provincial Councillors Siripala Kiriella, Nimal Wijenaike and K. L. Ratnaike also spoke.
