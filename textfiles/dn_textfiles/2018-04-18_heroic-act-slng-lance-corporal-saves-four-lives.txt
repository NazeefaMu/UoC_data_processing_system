Heroic act of SLNG Lance Corporal saves four lives

The timely heroic act of a brave soldier of the 3 Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) of the Kawantissapura camp at Kataragama who fought at the risk of his own life miraculously saved the lives of four three-wheeler passengers, trapped in a raging inferno after the three-wheeler had a head-on-collision with a bus near the 'Aluth Para' junction on Colombo - Kataragama main road, close to Ambalantota on Monday (16).
Four members of one family, including one toddler and a child on their own three-wheeler were returning from Kataragama when a speeding passenger bus from the opposite direction collided head on, igniting a blazing fire in the three-wheeler while all the passengers remained trapped under the bus screaming for help.
Alert to the tragedy, Lance Corporal M.G. Chandana of 3 SLNG on board the Kataragama-bound bus, without giving any second thought to his own safety, started fighting against the blazing three-wheeler fire while simultaneously striving to rescue the children at first amidst outbursts of raging fire. He went on pleading for help from other passengers watching and finally managed to rescue both weeping children at first while his own shirt was affected with fire. Others on standby extended their support to the Army rescuer and brought water from all directions to douse the fire. They effectively managed to extinguish the fire and saved the lives of all four victims after pushing the bus to a side, although they were badly injured.
However, Lance Corporal Chandana with the assistance of his fellow-Army personnel who showed up, managed to send the injured to the Hambantota hospital. All four victims are out of danger and the Police are conducting investigations.
The Ambalantota Police station as well as the SLNG are planning to felicitate this heroic soldier for his timely intervention and the rescue of four lives, risking his own life.
