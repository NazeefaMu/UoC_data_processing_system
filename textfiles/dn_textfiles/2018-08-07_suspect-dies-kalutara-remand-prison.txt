Suspect dies in Kalutara remand prison

A suspect taken into custody by the Crime Branch of the Panadura South Police on August 2 died at the Kalutara Remand Prison after he had been remanded by the Panadura Chief Magistrate.
The remand order followed a B report submitted to court in connection with the robbery of a gold chain allegedly by the suspect and another.
The Kalutara North Police conducted investigations into the death of the suspect Mandadige Chaminda Fernando on receipt of a complaint made to police by the Kalutara Remand Prison Superintendent.
The Kalutara Acting Magistrate held the inquest into the death of the suspect.
Meanwhile the suspect’s mother Lora Nelan Jayatilleke made a statement to the police that a police party had arrested her son on August 2.
The Kalutara Acting Magistrate directed the AJMO of the Kalutara Nagoda Base Hospital to perform the autopsy on the body which is lying at the Nagoda Base Hospital.
The AJMO held the autopsy and certified that he is not in a position to give the cause of the death of the deceased. He directed police to forward the specimen of the stomach to the Government Analyst for further examination.
When the case in which the deceased suspect Chaminda Fernando and Dinesh Manjula were was called before the Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage on August 6, the Kalutara Prison produced the first suspect Dinesh Mangula before court and informed that the second suspect Chaminda Fernando had died while he was in the custody of the remand prison.
