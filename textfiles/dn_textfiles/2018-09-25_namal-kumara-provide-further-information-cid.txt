Namal Kumara to provide further information to CID

Namal Kumara of the Anti-Corruption Force said he intends to report to the CID tomorrow (26) to notify the CID on some further information regarding the revelations he made.
“I intend to report to the CID around 10.00 am on Wednesday to give them further information,” he said.
The CID is currently investigating the allegations made by Namal Kumara recently that DIG Nalaka de Silva had been allegedly conspiring to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Meanwhile, Namal Kumara denied reports that he had been requested to appear before the Government Analyst’s Department tomorrow (26). When contacted by the Daily News yesterday afternoon, he said until that point in time, he had not received any request to appear before the Government Analyst’s Department.
The said controversial telephone conversation recording has been handed over to the Government Analyst’s Department for further verification on its authenticity.
Meanwhile, commenting on the Indian who had visited his home last week, Namal Kumara said, “An Indian person had come to my home last Wednesday wanting to meet me, but I did not want to meet anyone regarding this matter as I did not want to jeopardise the ongoing investigations.
Hence, I notified the Warakapola Police and the CID regarding his visit. However, this person had visited my home the next day as well and wanted to meet me. Again I notified the Warakapola police and the CID and the Police officers came and wanted to question him. Later they took him for further questioning. However, I don’t know this person and have never met him before,” he said.
Namal Kumara said that he had given his fullest support to the CID with regard to their investigations, adding that he had been summoned to the CID on two occasions for questioning regarding the incident.
