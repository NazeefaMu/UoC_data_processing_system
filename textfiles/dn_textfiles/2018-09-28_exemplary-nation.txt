In view of the National Day of Republic of Korea:
An exemplary nation

The war between South Korea and North Korea from 1950 to 1953 happened after the World War II. This war destroyed millions of lives. After this conflict, both countries did not take long to resurrect. The Republic of Korea became famous as South Korea. Over 25 years, South Korean Capital, Seoul, progressed towards development. I was fortunate enough to see with my own eyes the speedy progress of South Korea while I was engaged in postgraduate research attached to Seoul National University and Dongguk University.
The Republic of Korea has become a developed country today. It took them only 25 years to acquire the technical development aggregated by the Great Britain for 100 years. They competed with the technically advanced countries and are now the leaders in production of electronic and computer accessories. The foreign exchange revenue has gone up, strengthening the economy.
Industrial development
The industrial development began with small industries. The garment and textile industry have now expanded into the steel, petrochemical, heavy machinery, and rigs for oil exploration.
The country has acquired a significant progress. It had also gained the honour of being the leading producers of ships and motor vehicles in cities such as Ulsan, Pohang and Seoul. A prominent status has been granted by Japan and the United States. Hyundai, KIA and Ssangyong have become the leaders in the world motor vehicle market going beyond the contemporary production capacities. They have gained a remarkable access to the refrigerator, TV and mobile phone market, a coveted position earlier held by Japan, the United States and other European countries.
Now their trademark Samsung & Gold Star have been entered to the list of world consumers The research centres of the leading companies have been established not only in South Korea but also in other countries like China and India. The researchers explore nanotechnology, communication technology and animation.
Olympic Games
Now the Republic of Korea claims ownership for many modern inventions in the world. The Republic hosted the 1988 Olympic Games. In many fields of sports, they have excelled. They became world champion in fields such as boxing, football, volleyball, rugby, golf and basketball. They also lead in music, art, dance and architecture. Korea that competes with the leading countries in the world in the fields has surprised the world K- POP music and songs. They were also included in a delegation that went to Pyongyang. They have also equated great fame in Sri Lanka, Japan, China, and China. The world spectator must have been surprised by the famous songs of Kangnam genre.
Andri Kim has earned repute in the world fashion market. Seoul has been named as one of the fashion centres of the world. The electronic train and underground train are a treasure to the Korean people.
The state-level relationship between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea is very strong. Over 25,000 Sri Lankan youth are employed in South Korea, drawing handsome salaries. Therefore the relationship between our two countries is beneficial to all of us. The relation between South and North Korea improved strongly since recently. President Moon Jay in of South Korea and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un have initiated friendly relations in Pyongyang. It was agreed to stop nuclear missile research and lead a joint Korean team for 2032 summer Olympic Games. It was also proposed to avoid using nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula and to make the Young Byon Nuclear Plant defunct.
The wish of the world is that they maintain peace between these two countries. It will also contribute to the build-up of peace in the whole world. The Republic of Korea has provided fine practical solutions to the economic department. It continues to provide an example for the whole third world. It is commendable how South Korea despite the shortage of natural resources built up their economy based on human resources and knowledge.
