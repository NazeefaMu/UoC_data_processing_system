Kapruka and Grasshoppers to tie up with Amazon to facilitate SL producers

Sri Lanka’s pioneering e-commerce organization Kapruka.com has reached principle agreements to become an Amazon Master Seller with the global giant enabling local producers to sell to export market using amazon.com.
Once the agreement is finalized, Sri Lankan producers will have access to US, Europe and other markets through Amazon.com.
‘This means any handicraft maker or tea trader or even a shoe designer can sell their creations on Amazon.com for the very first time. The link will enable Sri Lankan SMEs and high-end producers to showcase their products to a global market,” said Kapruka.com Founding Chairman Dulith Herath.
The link fills a much felt void in the country’s e-commerce market, where Sri Lankan SMEs will gain complete access to full range of turn-key solutions provided by Amazon.
Opening an Amazon seller account, shipping the products and accepting online transactions are key barriers for Sri Lankan sellers to date.
The agreement reached between Amazon.com and Kapruka.com and Grasshoppers will seek to eliminate these challenges for the Sri Lankan suppliers.
Amazon.com, the global e-commerce giant, is visited by over 160 million online customers in a quarter and open to markets in 180 countries. Third party sellers (eg. SMEs) can sell their products to these markets.
According to Herath, this agreement enables Sri Lankan products to be listed on Amazon USA, reaching the organization’s customer base in 180 countries.
The stocks, on-demand, will be exported to US Amazon fulfilment centres by Kapruka.com and Grasshoppers, the sister company specialising in last mile delivery, will enable small producers in rural Sri Lanka to connect to this end-to-end channel from anywhere in the country. Kapruka.com will also facilitate local merchants to receive payments by-passing the barrier posed by absence of PayPal in the country.
Herath met with head of ‘Fulfilment by Amazon’ team in the USA Kirsty Carey, during his on-going Eisenhower Scholarship program. Herath, who was selected for the prestigious Eisenhower Fellowship for the promises embodied by Grasshoppers and his pioneering achievements of Kapruka.com, is currently visiting global technology giants in USA under this scholarship. Grasshoppers is a start up co-founded by Dulith Herath and Dr Harsha Liyanage, that specialising in delivery fulfilment for e-commerce companies in Sri Lanka.
