Indian Prime Minister Modi meets Upcountry Tamil community : Unrelenting upkeep

The meeting of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Upcountry Tamil community at the Norwood Sports Complex in the Nuwara Eliya District on May 12 is historical.
Several Indian political leaders have visited Sri Lanka and made it a point to meet the Upcountry Tamil Community. However, Prime Minister Modi’s visit deserves special mention.
The visit of Jawarhallal Nehru in 1939, the then leader of the Indian Congress party, who later became the first Prime Minister of India, is very often remembered. In 1939, several social organisations based on several trade and caste were representing the Indians.

It was Nehru, who advised them to form one organisation, which resulted in the formation of the Ceylon Indian Congress, which later became Ceylon Workers’ Congress. If compared with the visit of Nehru in 1939 with the present visit of Prime Minister Modi, the political and social environment of the country in general and the Up-Country Tamil Community in particular, has changed significantly.
Although the Indian Tamils enjoyed voting rights, after the independence, the citizenship rights was deprived. Thereafter, the citizenship of the community was the major issue between the two countries until an agreement was reached between the two Prime Ministers Sirima and Shastri in 1964, whereby half of the population was made to repatriate to India.
With the repatriation of over 500,000 persons and resolving the citizenship issue in 2003, the political stability of the country was achieved. Majority of the Upcountry Tamils who were confined to the tea and rubber plantation in economic and social isolation entered the mainstream. This development process has to be accelerated. Modi’s visit should be a landmark in the acceleration process.
At present, Sri Lanka is drafting a new constitution in which demand of this community to safeguard their political and civil rights should be met, so that their due representation at the various political levels, will be ensured. There should be political arrangement in the event of power devolution and electoral reforms that ensure that these people could enjoy the political rights in relation to other communities. The community has to be recognised as a district ethnic community which has separate cultural and social economic identities different from other communities. It is the wish of the community that the concerns of the people should be taken up with the leaders of the government by the visiting Prime Minister. Moreover, there is a demand to ensure economic, social and cultural rights. The community is yet to enjoy the land and housing ownership rights. In the development arena, social development indicators reveal that the community lags behind particularly in terms of poverty level, nutrition and educational attainment and health status. Due to lack of educational attainment, participation of the community in the public service at the higher level is nil. University admission is less than 1 percent of the total intake of the national universities. Large scale migration from the plantation sector to unskilled occupations in the urban sector is commonly observed. Leavers of the secondary and upper secondary schools do not have proper facilities to advance their academic, vocational, or technical skills.
Past assistance
In this scenario, assistance and interventions by India is viewed by the community as a moral obligation since it is historically linked to India and continued to maintain cultural links.
In the past, Indian assistance to the community is noteworthy. Specific mention can be made in five areas; education, housing, vocational training, transport, and health. As far as education is concerned, the Ceylon Estate Workers’ Education Trust (CEWET) was instituted in 1947 on the initiative taken by M.S. Aney, the representative of India in Ceylon.
It started with financial assistance to four students in 1947. It is remarkable that the Trust continues to provide assistance to the students who aspire to pursue their higher studies. At present, the CEWET offers financial assistance for 350 students who qualify at the GCE O/L to follow A/L classes (225 students) and others at the national universities and colleges. The funds for the Trust are mobilised by its members and supplemented by the GOI. It should be noted that to obtain the benefit from the scheme, the students should be estate workers’ children. Through this scheme, a few hundred students have become graduates, which includes graduates of medicine and engineering. At present, the number who qualify for A/L is on the increase, so the expansion of assistance by the Trust should be considered.Related to vocational training, the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre (TVTC) established in Hatton under NORAD’s assistance is the only centre providing the vocational training needs for the community. Major issue is the non-availability of Tamil medium instructors. In order to overcome this issue, from 2011 to 2017, several Tamil instructors were provided to the TVTC.
An MOU is to be signed with Cabinet approval between the governments of Sri Lanka and India to upgrade the centre, providing equipment and building at a cost of Rs. 199 million.
With the assistance of Indian Government, training programmes have been undertaken for teachers in specific subjects such as Mathematics and Science. A number of teachers have undergone training in India and master trainers have come to Sri Lanka to train the teachers. A one-year graduation programme for Science teachers was conducted in which selected teachers were given training and sent for graduation in India.
In order to overcome the transport difficulties in the plantation region, the Indian government gave around 40 mini buses to commute between the estates and the nearby towns. These buses were distributed in the Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and Ratnapura districts. However, the effectiveness of this assistance has to be assessed.
Another important area is the health sector. A base hospital at Glencairn, Dikoya was constructed at a cost of Rs.1200 million with funding from India. Although the construction commenced in 2011 and completed in 2015, due to the delays in the procurement of equipment and sharing responsibility between the central government and the provincial council, the commencement of the hospital was postponed. Finally, Prime minister Modi is to open it on May 12.
Housing is another area where Indian assistance was provided for. India provided 50,000 houses to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPS) in the Northern Province. Later, plantation sector was also included in this programme where 4,000 houses at a cost of Rs 1 million on grant basis were provided. At present, constructing these houses is in progress, and they are expected to be completed within the next two years.
Request for future assistance
Housing requirements in the plantation amounts to over 160,000. Local funding is not enough to meet this huge demand. A proposal to construct another 20,000 houses was submitted in 2015 and it awaits response from the GOI with the Cabinet approval. The community eagerly awaits a response from Indian Government. Another important area is education. With the expansion of higher secondary education, Upcountry Tamil students who qualify for the entrance to university have increased significantly. However, the admission to the national universities is limited. The CEWET has given scholarships to only around 100 students. In order to provide facilities to deserving students to pursue their higher studies, a fully funded scholarship for 100 Upcountry Tamil students on various degree courses in India should be considered on an urgent basis.
All other communities except the Upcountry Tamils have a university. Establishing a separate university for the community is a long-standing demand to promote research in the history as well as cultural and social issues of the community. A separate university is essential. The GOI should assist in conducting a feasibility study to fulfil this demand.
Those who are unable to enter universities should have access to technical colleges. Here again, admission to the technical colleges is not feasible due to language and other difficulties. Therefore, a separate technical college to cater the needs of the Indian Origin Tamils is a very essential.Training to teachers have been provided earlier and has not been continued. Training for teachers in key subjects - Mathematics, IT, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, English and Management is considered as a necessary intervention to provide quality education. Selected teachers should be provided with short and long-erm training.
Upgrading plantation schools have been undertaken by the SIDA and the GTZ in the past and the Government of Sri Lanka continues this activity providing limited funds. Over 100 Tamil schools need upgrading in terms of physical facilities to provide quality education on a priority basis. This requirement should be considered by the GOI.Modi’s visit has provided an opportunity for the community to put forward the concerns in relation to their rights and development requirements where Indian Government could assist. It has provided assistance in various fields in the past as explained. Several other countries particularly Norway (NORAD), Sweden (SIDA), Germany (GTZ) have made notable contributions to the Social Development of the plantation community. It is the wish of the community that India should do more as it has a moral obligation towards the well-being of the community.
