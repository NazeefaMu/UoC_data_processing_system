Maheepala against GOVT usurping PC powers

Former Sabaragamuwa Province Chief Minister Maheepala Herath yesterday said that he is against the policy of usurping the powers given to provincial councils.
Addressing the last session of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, Herath said that he likes to be a provincial councillor than a parliamentarian.
The tenure of the sixth Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council expired yesterday.
The UPFA won the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council in 2012 gaining 28 seats. The United National Party gained 14 seats while Ceylon Workers Congress won two seats. “We will not allow to bring any proposals that would undermine the powers of Provincial Councils.
We are in a quandary whether we can go with the elements who want to find out the assets of journalists”, he said.
