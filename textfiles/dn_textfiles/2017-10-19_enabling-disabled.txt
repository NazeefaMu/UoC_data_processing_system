Enabling the disabled

She is someone who breaks stereotypes and defines stigma. Together with her colleague Janitha Rukmal, Krystle Reid formed Enabled Lanka, an organisation which works towards helping the needy by enabling them to become abled citizens. Her work gained recognition as she was named as the Commonwealth Young Person of the Year 2017. She was picked from over 200 entries for the title. This was the first time a Sri Lankan has won the overall prestigious award. It was also the first time an organization working with the mission of mainstreaming inclusion for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) has won the award.
“Winning this award for our work at Enable Lanka meant that we have done something right and impactful. It also opened many doors for us to partner with other organizations/ individuals and to create an even bigger impact and to influence others to join in this mission,” Krystle said.
The Commonwealth Youth Awards for Excellence in Development Work, an initiative of the Commonwealth Secretariat’s youth program, celebrates outstanding young adults aged under 30 who are leading initiatives ranging from poverty alleviation to peace-building. Charles Lipenga from Malawi (Commonwealth Africa Young Person of the Year), Jacqueline Joseph from Papua New Guinea (Commonwealth Pacific Young Person of the Year) and Tricia Teekah from Guyana (Commonwealth Caribbean Young Person of the Year) received the regional awards this year.
“One of my biggest honours and privileges were to meet these three trailblazers in person, to share our common ideologies and to learn about the different innovative approaches in achieving our missions. I felt even more empowered when I met them for the first time. I was amazed by Charles’ ability to connect with anyone with his humor and style, Tricia’s strategic thinking patterns, and Jackie’s innovative ground-breaking ideas. I have still have a lot to learn from them,” Krystle mused.
The award ceremony was held in March 2017 at the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. The awards were presented by Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland.
An old girl of Good Shepherd Convent, Colombo, Krystle was the school’s English debate team captain and a member of the school athletics team - track and field events. She studied Finance/ Financial Analysis at the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment. She is currently doing her M. Sc. in Applied Finance at Sri Jayewardenepura University.
“When I met Janitha we had one thing that was mutual for both of us. We were from two different minorities which are still regarded by the society in very negative ways most of the time. I come from an ethnic group called Burgher. I always felt that I don’t belong with the overall social fabric in the country from some experiences I’ve faced. Janitha is from the largest minority in this country as well as the world at large which is the minority of persons living with disabilities. This mutual factor helped us to discover the social exclusion that’s faced by many minorities. We worked together to empower persons with disabilities and ensure equality for them,” Krystle recalled how it all began.
Krystle comes from a middle-class family. This moulded her to recognize the challenges and insecurities around her and helped her discover the inner potential in her to help another who has been facing many difficulties growing up as she did.
“I am one of those girls that could have been stuck behind inequality. Most days I struggle but I try to be brave because I know at the end of the day, it always feels great knowing that I’m able to make a difference in someone’s life. That is a blissful happiness that can never be bought by money. Every single person who stands up for injustice and inequality and doing it for the right reasons inspires me,” she said.
Enable Lanka Foundation has been striving to mainstream disability inclusion. They have also been focusing on the 22 percent of older persons who would be in existence by 2030. The foundation has many successful projects to its name. The Enabled Election campaign was launched during the 2015 General Election under the guidance of the National Coordinator, of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence in Sri Lanka Manjula Gajanayake. This initiative helped to make a tangible change by availing the entire minority of Sri Lankans to realize their political and voting rights. Enabled Election campaign was one of the largest civil rights campaigns conducted in the country to provide sensitization and advocacy for the political and electoral rights of persons with disabilities in the nation. Senarath Attanayake was the first person with a disability in Sri Lanka to be an elected representative, a lawyer and the only person with a disability to hold a ministerial portfolio. He was a key driving force behind the campaign.
Another campaign titled Comic For Cause was designed and launched over a period of seven days starting from December 3, 2017. This was the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
“Since the event was a success we extended the #ComicForCause and published an ‘Autism’ toolkit. This toolkit is available online and in print, as a collaborative effort of the Foundation and the Inclusion and Engagement Committee of the Commonwealth Youth Council. The inspiration and guidance for this toolkit was gleaned from the publication known as ‘Autism in the Commonwealth’ which has been created by Jonathan Andrews from the UK. The said publication has been published by the Commonwealth Youth Council in tandem with the #iamABLE campaign. We are now looking in to translating this toolkit into Tamil. We are currently working on a similar project through this campaign and targeting to launch it on March 2018,” Krystle said.
The team also launched a mobile application of audio books in 2016. Once again the Center for Monitoring Election Violence joined hands with the foundation to give life to this project. Around 200 out of 800,000 visually impaired persons in Sri Lanka get the opportunity enroll in state universities and obtain higher education annually. Even then, most of them could not perform up to their full potential and excel in their respective academic fields because information can only be accessed through books. Enable Lanka Foundation together with Samsung Sri Lanka, LISN the first mobile audio book production company in Sri Lanka and the America Centre introduced ‘LISN Revolution’, a fully accessible mobile application specifically designed to read audio books to local universities. The undergraduates were also provided with smartphones to access this assistive software.
“We had about 10 passionate, young change-makers and zero funds with us when we started the project. 125Mn smartphones are disposed every year and only 14 to17 percent of those phones are recycled. We saw an opportunity to change someone’s’ life with another’s trash. We approached the right people at the right time we managed to pull off this large-scale project to provide these students with their basic requirements to fulfill their education. That’s how we managed to execute almost LKR three to four Mn project having absolutely no funding in hand. For me that is one of the most memorable and proud moments of Enable Lanka and the team behind it,” Krystle said.
She says that Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries have a long tradition of treating PWDs as ‘charity’ and looking at them with a sympathetic eye.
“We need to break these existing attitudes and physical barriers and empower them to be self-sustaining and economically independent and not make them anyone’s social service. The other biggest challenge is ‘accessibility’. This does not mean only having ramps. There are people with neurological conditions, vision and hearing loss, psychiatric disabilities, and cognitive or learning problems. The lack of having accessibility to education, employment, on-line and off-line media, surrounding/ physical environment is another massive challenge we see as a country that has an aging population. Sri Lanka could quite possibly be one of the countries with a faster increase in aging population before it emerges as a developed country. This also means the number of people with disabilities would increase. We feel that the government or the respective authorities are not subtle enough to realize the urgent need to have sound policies and to take the required measurements to address this socio-economic challenge. We must realize that disability is a part of life. It is inevitable. This is not about “us and them” this is about “us and us,” she stressed.
The 28 year old is employed at Brandix Apparel Solutions Limited. She is the curator of the Global Shapers Colombo Hub - an initiative of the World Economic Forum. She is also the past President of the Chartered Accountants Students Society. Her parents are Michael Reid and D. B. A. Shilani Swarnamali. She has two sisters who are working in the field of marketing.
“There are few projects in the pipeline for us at Enable Lanka. We will be looking at partnering with organizations working in different areas to make their programs, workshops and projects more inclusive to ensure no one if left behind in the process. I wish to continue in the field of finance and eventually be a part of the core business managing economic activities and efficiency in operations and hopefully become an influential person who would advocate for more women participation in the labor market,” Krystle noted.Queried about her message to other youth and she quotes ‘Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.’ “You will not see the benefit today but if your heart says that it’s the right thing to do, then do it now and leave no one behind!” she concluded with a smile.
