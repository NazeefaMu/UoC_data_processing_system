Lanka’s immigration laws need reform - Prof Hausmann

In a drive to spur growth and drive innovation, Sri Lanka needs to adopt progressive immigration policies to encourage foreign expertise through immigration, particularly to access the expertise of Sri Lankan diaspora.
These sentiments were expressed by Prof. Ricardo Hausmann, Director of Harvard’s Center for International Development and Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at the Kennedy School of Government at the second edition of Future of Business - Innovation in Action’, conference held at the Galle Face Hotel Colombo, yesterday.
“Sri Lanka has restricted its ability to attract talent outside owing to multiple reasons when compared to other dynamic economies like India, Vietnam and Singapore.”
Prof. Ricardo suggested that Sri Lanka needs to provide a path to residency and allow highly skilled foreign nationals to become citizens, not only by simplifying cumbersome visa procedures, also creating more visa categories. “Many companies in Sri Lanka were started by immigrants with connections made while living abroad.”
Noting that low growth of GDP and export, balance of payment crisis, low transformation of export basket, low immigration and foreign direct investment have significantly hampered the country’s growth prospects to a great extent over the recent decades, Prof. Hausmann added that more importantly, Sri Lanka has failed to add new products to its exports basket.
“This has clearly led to low FDI, and recurrent balance of payment crisis. Reforming immigration laws could be a proper solution to rectify this issue.”
Ganaka Herath Partner, McKinsey & Company speaking at the event stated that Sri Lanka is in a unique position on the digitization front given its proximity to many highly competitive, dynamic economies in the region.
Stressing the need to create an enabling environment to drive innovation, digital capabilities and to develop local talent, Herath pointed out that issues relating to the gaps in best practices and relevance on demand side on this front need to be addressed in a speedy manner to better garner set targets of the economy.
However, despite the fact that Sri Lanka lags behind in terms of aggregated digital maturity when compared to other countries in the region, the country has been able to outperform several Asian pillars in certain categories, Herath said.
Underscoring the need to recognise the usage of consumers, build capabilities and retain existing talent to unleash the Sri Lanka’s digital potential, Herath added that it is also essential to create revenue streams to figure out how to monetize the growing consumer supply.
