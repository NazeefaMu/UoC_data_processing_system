Antique Buddha statue stolen from Sri Sumangalaramaya

A valuable antique Buddha statue has been stolen from the Sri Sumangalaramaya ancient temple of Wariyapola in Kurunegala. Prof. Thumbulle Seelankanda Nayake Thera, the Chief Incumbent of this temple, has complained to the Wariyapola Police regarding this theft. 
The stolen statue had been donated to this temple by a past king of the Kandyan era. Ven. Seelakandha Nayaka Thera had complained to the Police authorities that security had been provided to this ancient temple in the past, but the present government had now removed the security from the temple.
