JVP protest campaign

Ishara Mudugamuwa
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has organised a series of protests against the government’s unfair tax and Cost of Living increases and the burden it has caused the people.
JVP Leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said that his party will begin a series of protests on October 23 from Colombo.
Speaking at a press conference at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla, Dissanayake said that the country is currently experiencing an economic recession due to the present government’s economic policy.
“The government which came into power on January 8, 2015 pledged to create a people friendly economy. It also pledged to enhance the income level of the people and generate 10 million jobs,” he said.
“But, during the past three years, the government has led the country towards an economic downturn. As a result of this, the people are currently experiencing a huge economic crisis. The government has no proper plan to rescue the country from the debt trap,” the JVP Leader said.
“Since 1978, the UNP government followed the policy of selling public properties. Therefore, the present government is also following the same policy,” he added. The JVP leader questioned whether the government has an ethical right to reduce imports.
He charged that the leaders of this country spending large amounts of money for their personal comfort. At the same time they are asking the public to tighten their belts to face the economic downturn.
“We will not let the government play with the people’s intelligence anymore,” he added.
