Spring is in the air

Isn’t it strange that many years ago, in a far off land, a poet called Chaucer wrote these famous lines in his Canterbury Tales “Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote/The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,” capturing the very essence of what we are experiencing at this very moment, in our island nation in the 21st century.
The heat of March is thankfully over. For most of us, the best days of our lives lie ahead; Sunshine and showers, laughter and presents. April, undoubtedly is the most beautiful month of the year and therefore the best time to pay homage to the natural elements; the sun, the moon and the rain gods.
“Spring is in the air,” the Koha, keeps reminding us every few seconds. The long, red petals of Erabadu make you wonder if they are the proverbial fires of spring. The kaju and jambu trees are heavy with fruits. Butterflies waltz to the orchestra of the magpies. Jasmines invite the two-winged dancers to a feast. The whole world seems to be rejuvenated making you mutter to yourself Chaucer’s lines, over and over.
New Year customs
Closer to home, Martin Wickramasinghe described in vivid details in Gamperaliya (the extract is from the English translation titled Uprooted) the New Year customs in the South during the early 20th century. Not so long ago, at the beginning of the 20th century, a few days before the New Year the village potter used to bring “a pingo load of clay pots and pans to each of the three or four leading families in the village, so wrote the sage of Koggala. On New Year’s day as the auspicious time drew near the members of the family “sat on reed mats, round a white cloth spread on the floor of the hall. The servants, male and female, knelt on the floor beside them. Each had his serving of milk rice on a square of singed plantain leaf, placed before him on the white cloth. When the auspicious moment arrived they all started to eat.”
Celebrations
Elsewhere, in the country too there were preparations to celebrate the transition of the sun from the sign of Pisces to the sign of Aries beginning a new solar year. The villagers in the Eastern province would get ready to welcome the new year from as early as February when the best vegetables in the Chena like the largest pumpkin and the best brinjals were kept aside till April.
The beginning of April would find the villagers going in search of the clay needed to apply on the floor and stacking up mountains of firewood to be used during the New Year.
It is said, that on New Year’s day, observing auspicious times would differ from province to province. Unlike the villagers in the southern province villagers in the Eastern province did not observe specific auspicious times on the day of the New Year. To them the entire day was auspicious. On New Year’s day the women would wake up early in the morning and make their way to the well, sprinkle a handful of flowers on the water, worship the well three times and worship the earth three times before drawing the first bucket of water. When they filled the kettle to boil the water, they would fill it to the brim unlike on other days when only the necessary amount of water was put into the kettle. All the kitchen utensils would be washed and stacked in one corner of the kitchen, covered with a white cloth; on this day the pots and pans were given a well-earned rest.
The most popular places in the village during April are the trees which have massive swings hanging from their boughs. But the swings too differ from village to village. Some villagers built massive swings, wide enough to carry at least four or five adults at a time which would be hung on the branches of a tree with leather straps. After finishing their daily chores the women would gather at the swing as the sunlight faded from the sky, and take turns to sway too and fro to the rhythm of the Onchili Waram, till the early hours of the morning.
The women also spend many an enjoyable hour playing age old rhymes like “Dontha Babakkata Denna Deyak Natha...” on the raban. They even enjoy the strenuous task of pounding the rice to make sweetmeats by bringing the pestles and the mortars into one house and taking turns to pound the rice into flour. Soon the time comes to watch the white mixtures of flour turn into delicious kevum, kokis, aluwa and athiraha.
In the past, these sweetmeats were made using the rice from the newly harvested paddy fields. According to the writer and journalist Thimbiriyagama Bandara, in the past, before the New Year celebrations our ancestors had observed the harvest festival (Aluth Sahal Mangallaya). It was only after the newly harvested rice was offered to the deity, to the priests at the temple, and distributed among the neighbours that the rice was used for making sweetmeats for the New Year. “The New Year, therefore, is a celebration of joy after the harvest is reaped”, observes Bandara.
Not too late
Even though these farming traditions are no longer with us, it is surely not too late yet to find some cowries and an old coconut shell to begin playing that ancient game of chance called Panchi or to throw a rope over a rafter in the roof to make a swing and to wonder if they too have symbolic meanings attached to them. Yes, as with almost everything associated with the New Year, according to Prof. Vinnie Vitharana the cowrie is a symbol of procreation; the swing represents the sun, which also swings from the east to the west, and the hearth, which is lit at an auspicious time, by the woman of the house, facing a prescribed direction, symbolizes the centre of life and nourishment in the household.
Today, we may indeed not be farmers, we may not be able to interact with Mother Nature in the same way our ancestors did, but we cannot deny the spirit of spring. It is still with us. It is still there in the warmth of the early morning sun, in the azure skies, in the orchestra of the birds, and in the dew drops on a petal of jasmine. So, let the spirits of spring enter your heart.
May the year ahead be filled with joy and good health and dreams that come true.
