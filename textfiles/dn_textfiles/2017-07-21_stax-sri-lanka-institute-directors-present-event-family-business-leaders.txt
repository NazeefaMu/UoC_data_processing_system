STAX, Sri Lanka Institute of Directors present event for family business leaders

Global strategy consulting firm STAX in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID), presents ‘Taking Over the Mantle’, an event to unveil the results from the first-ever survey of Sri Lankan family firms and a vibrant panel discussion with some of Sri Lanka’s finest family business leaders across generations.
Moderated by Director of STAX Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera, the session will have Chairman, Laugfs Holdings W.K.H. Wegapitiya, Managing Director Jetwing Travels, Shiromal Cooray and Director/CEO of SAIG and Orion Jeevan Gnanam as panelists.
Keynote speaker Ruwindhu Peries, Managing Director of STAX will speak on ‘Insights from the 2017 Family Business Survey Findings.
‘Taking Over the Mantle’ will take place from 5 p.m to 7 p.m. on Wednesday August 2, 2017 at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand. It is aimed at those second- and third generation leaders who are at the helm of family businesses and who want to ensure an impactful transition in ownership and management. The conversation will evolve around planning and management for business continuity while eliciting best practice from family business leaders.
In 2016, PricewaterhouseCoopers reported that 43% of global family businesses did not have a succession plan in place, with only 12% making it to a third generation.
In Stax’s 2017 survey of Sri Lankan family firms, 32% similarly revealed that they do not have a succession plan.
Moreover, 1 out of 2 firms in the second generation (Sibling Partnerships) reported that they do not currently have a long-term strategy.
