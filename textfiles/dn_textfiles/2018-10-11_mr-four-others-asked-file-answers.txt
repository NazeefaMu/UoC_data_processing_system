Defaulting Rs. 142 mn to SLTB:
MR, four others asked to file answers

The Colombo Commercial High Court yesterday ordered all parties including five defendants that included former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to file their answers in respect of a law suit filed for allegedly defaulting a sum of Rs.142 million owed to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) by utilizing SLTB buses to transport people to election rallies of former President during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign.
Accordingly, the Colombo Commercial High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe directed both defendant and plaintiff parties to file their answers regarding the lawsuit on February 6.
The Commercial High Court had decided to accept the amended petition filed by the plaintiff party, the SLTB regarding this incident.
On a previous occasion, the plaintiff SLTB had decided to exclude former Minister Susil Premajayantha and former Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from the defendants list.
According to the amended plaint SLTB has named five UPFA 20015-presidential election committee members, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara as respondents.
The SLTB had earlier named seven parties including SLFP former general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha as defendants.
The plaintiff said the UPFA had hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8th, 2015 Presidential Election rallies but had failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.
Counsel Athula de Silva appeared for the defendants.
