Over 10 people die daily in road accidents

About 10 to 12 people die daily in Sri Lanka due to various road traffic accidents.
About 45 to 50 severe road traffic accidents take place in Sri Lanka every day. In addition, 100 to 125 road traffic accidents take place in the country, Traffic Police Division ASP W.D.A. Dhananjaya said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said in the past, only seven or eight died due to road traffic accidents but now this number has increased to about10 to 12. Over 90 percent of road traffic accidents are connected to motorcycles.
The second highest number of accidents is related to three wheelers.
Most accident victims are between the ages of 15 and 40. The most number of accidental deaths occur between the ages 40 and 70.
There are 3.8 million motorcycles and 1.1 million three wheelers in the country.
In addition, there are seven million registered vehicles in the country and six million run on the roads which are 98,000 kilometers long, Dhananjaya said. Around 40,000 road traffic accidents take place annually in Sri Lanka and between 2,500 and 3,000 persons die from them.
Last year, a total of 3,020 deaths were reported due to road traffic accidents.
Ignorance, carelessness, not paying attention and not having the required knowledge are the four main reasons for road traffic accidents, Dhananjaya added.
