MR wallows in family politics - Shan Wijayalal

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has no option other than a member of his family for the candidate at the next Presidential election, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He was responding to question by the media at his office on Wednesday.
“I read an interview he had with The Hindu in his stay in India. He had stated that his brother would certainly be the contender at the next Presidential Election as his son could not contest it owing to the minimum age limit to contest a Presidential election. He does not wish for a new face outside his family which shows his ambition to keep the Presidency as an inheritance of the Rajapaksa family,” the Chief Minister said.
He does not say which brother, Gotabhaya, Basil or Chamal, he said.
“The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has already opted for one selection. The next SLFP Presidential Candidate will be President Maithripala Sirisena. He was elected an independent candidate at the previous presidential election after he became the party leader. We, the party members, solicited him to be the next presidential candidate of the party to which he responded positively.
The SLFP next Presidential contender will be President Maithripala Sirisena,” he said.
