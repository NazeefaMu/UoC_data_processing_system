UTE Engineering, Pin Fernando Grand-Prix:
Sachin De Silva takes an early lead

UTE Engineering Pin Fernando Grand-Prix March edition got off to a great start once again with a 4 under par round from RCGC Club champion Sachin De Silva leading the field with a 4 under par 67 and par 71 to total 138 after first two rounds at the Royal Colombo Golf Club yesterday.
The lush fairways on the course after the recent rains has encouraged the top amateurs to make full use of the near perfect golfing conditions. It’s great to see four golfers with under par scores in first two rounds. The old war horse Amarapadma, and 2017 Top ranked B.A.Sanjeewa breathing down Sachin’s neck with 139 total, while strongman Ranga is following one stroke behind. Keeping pace with the leaders, is the in-form Sisira Kumara and young M.U.Chanaka Perera on 142 total.
With plenty of golf to be played, there is no sure winner emerging at this stage and lots of excitement and drama to come over the next 2 days. The leader board at the cut-off stage is below.
