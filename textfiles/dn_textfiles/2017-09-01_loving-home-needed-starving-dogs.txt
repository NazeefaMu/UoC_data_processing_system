A loving home needed for starving dogs

The principal of a certain school has made a huge fuss about a particular teacher who feeds three female harmless dogs that live inside the school premises. (There was a request not to disclose the name of the relevant school and principal)
Unfortunately the cleaner/worker at this school has also made a complaint to the principal about these dogs and regarding the teacher who feeds them. This eventually led to a staff meeting in which the principal declared that, no food should be given to these three dogs, as they are a “nuisance.”
Yet in spite of the difficulties and complications faced, this compassionate kind teacher continued to feed these dogs secretly outside the relevant school premises. She was very concerned as these dogs had no other source of food and depended on her for their only meal.
However this secretive feeding resulted in bigger problems as more complaints were made to the principal by other staff members and students. Thereafter the security guards were requested by the said principal to prevent and or discourage anyone from feeding these dogs outside and or even near the school premises.
Therefore this plea is on behalf of these three dogs who are currently starving and have not had any food the past couple of days.
The said teacher is unable to adopt them as she does not have a garden and she is currently prevented and obstructed in school from feeding them as well.
The three dogs have been sterilized and vaccinated and are extremely lovable and friendly.
If you can adopt even one of them or need more info PLEASE call on 112913980 or 0777567122.
Transport will be arranged when rehoming the dog.
