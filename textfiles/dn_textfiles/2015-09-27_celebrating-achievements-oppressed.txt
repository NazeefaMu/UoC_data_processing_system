Celebrating the achievements of the Oppressed

At the end of the report on Lanka in the section named Conclusions and Recommendations UNHR Commissioner states “OHCHR investigation contained in this report was born out of the past failure of the Government of Sri Lanka to address accountability for the most serious human rights violations and crimes. Ending the impunity enjoyed by the security forces and associated paramilitary groups, as well as holding to account surviving members of the LTTE, will require political will and concerted efforts to ensure the non-recurrence of these violations and crimes.”
Clearly he is speaking about the past of Lanka when country was submerged within a fascistic matrix where rule of law was violated. Certainly it was a period where all democratic forces were repressed with white vans and state terror in general.
Those who stood for a solution based on equality, autonomy and the right of self-determination, were mercilessly hunted down.
Media was suppressed and many media people were killed; some in broad day light. Military power handled by fascistic elements was ruling many areas. All that happened in the past. That we could agree, but then Prince Hussein says, “The new Government’s commitments in this respect are welcome, but it needs to convince a very skeptical audience – Sri Lankan and international – that it is determined to show results. Prosecuting a few emblematic cases will not be sufficient; Sri Lanka needs to address the patterns of serious human rights violations and other international crimes that have caused such suffering for all communities over decades if it is to prevent them haunting its future.” We certainly agree to that observation while reminding that the new government came into power only a week ago.
January 8 victory
January 8 victory only started the change; that was just the beginning. There was a dual power situation with the Parliament dominated by fascistic elements. Though there was a semblance of majority with Maithri taking over the leadership of the SLFP, Mahinda group was able to arrest the programme of the interim government. Even the budget proposals were not implemented; hindrance appeared every where. The truth was Mahinda had an underground government through a network, with the support of loyal Buddhist temples and other centres. This latent fascistic power claimed to represent the wishes of 5.8 million voters and intimidated officials, professionals and other influential citizens. Only after the parliamentary elections their power network collapsed and new government could asset itself. Therefore the High Commissioner cannot look for results now; because the government is only two weeks old!
Anti-racist democratic revolution
The report then says “The High Commissioner remains convinced that for accountability to be achieved in Sri Lanka, it will require more than a domestic mechanism. Sri Lanka should draw on the lessons learnt and good practices of other countries that have succeeded with hybrid special courts, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators. Such a mechanism will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans, in particular the victims, in the independence and impartiality of the process, particularly given the politicization and highly polarized environment in Sri Lanka. OHCHR stands ready to continue providing its advice and technical assistance in the design of such a mechanism.” Clearly this suggestion is premature.
People in Lanka were locked in a battle with a fascistic organization that had genocidal aims and cruel racist attitudes. Struggle came into open in January 8. Though substantial victory is achieved by august 17 struggle is continuing. Commissioner has failed to recognize the anti-racist democratic revolution that is taking place. Also he has missed the steps taken to go beyond prosecuting a few emblematic cases and preparations to address the patterns of serious human rights violations. Furthermore, he has missed the solutions in preparation to the Tamil national problem. Latter led to international crimes that have caused such suffering for all communities over decades.
The masses that came out to defeat and overthrow the fascistic regime accused of genocidal mania and inhuman repression, are still active. All over the country, including Tamil speaking areas, people are prepared to come out and show their opposition to such actions.
Provincial Councils are functioning that includes such councils in Tamil speaking areas. Recently leader of the Tamil National Alliance and the Federal party R. Sampanthan became the Leader of Opposition defeating the conspiracy hatched by the fascistic elements.
International community must recognize these achievements of the poor oppressed people of Lanka.
