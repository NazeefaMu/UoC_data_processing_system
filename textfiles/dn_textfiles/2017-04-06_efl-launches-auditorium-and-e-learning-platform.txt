EFL launches auditorium and e-learning platform

Global logistics provider, Expolanka Freight (EFL), announced a significant improvement to the company’s training capabilities with the opening of a dedicated auditorium facility together with the launch of a new cloud based e-learning platform.
Situated at its state-of-the-art EFL Campus in Orugodawatte, the new auditorium will provide space for training programmes being carried out by EFL as part of a strategy to equip the next generation of logistics experts to take the industry forward over the medium-long term.
In addition to the expansion of its physical capacity, EFL also announced that it would be launching a new cloud-based e-learning platform and social collaboration tool known as ‘Layup’ with a view to developing more effective, streamlined, and ultimately cost-effective training programmes for its employees.
Combining e-learning with concepts like game dynamics and social collaboration, Layup is an enterprise-level software solution designed to empower users, while making education more engaging and accessible, features which EFL aims to leverage towards augmenting the technical skills and expertise of its team.
“Our investments into training are part of a firm commitment towards developing the next generation of supply chain specialists. With the continued success of EFL’s international expansion we are confident that these investments will be beneficial both for our local operations and placements abroad,” Saif Yusoof, Managing Director of EFL said.
EFL is a prominent logistics company and one of the largest freight forwarders in Asia, with operations in 18 countries and business in four continents. It is a member of Expolanka PLC and now a part of the larger SG Holdings Group, a leading logistics group in Japan.
