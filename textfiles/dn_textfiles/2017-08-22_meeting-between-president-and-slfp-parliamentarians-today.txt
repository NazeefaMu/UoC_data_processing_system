Meeting between President and SLFP Parliamentarians today

A meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and SLFP Parliamentarians will take place today at 5 p.m. at the Parliamentary complex.
The SLFP Parliamentary group in the government has been asked to make their presence at the meeting which will focus on the issues within the government and the future activities of the party.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake when inquired as to why a special meeting has been called, said the SLFP group in the government meets the President on regular basis to discuss issues of the country. He said the meeting is not an extraordinary meeting.
“A meeting between the SLFP MPs representing the government and the President did not take place for sometimes. That’s why a meeting has been called,” he said.
