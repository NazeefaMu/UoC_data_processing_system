Cabinet reshuffle likely today

The proposed Cabinet reshuffle is likely to take place today, informed political sources said.
All Cabinet Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers have been invited for a special meeting chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat at 8.30 am today.
Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake speaking to the Daily News yesterday confirmed the meeting.
He said this was a special meeting convened by the President in addition to the regular Cabinet meeting which would be held on Tuesday morning before the President leaves for Australia.
The speculation was rife that the much talked-about Cabinet reshuffle will take place today. The talk on a Cabinet reshuffle had been continuing since early this year. The President also hinted that the much-awaited Cabinet reshuffle would take place in May.
