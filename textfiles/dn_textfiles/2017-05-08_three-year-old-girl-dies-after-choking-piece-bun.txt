Three-year-old girl dies after choking on piece of bun

A three-year-old girl who choked on a piece of bun given for breakfast by her mother, died of suffocation on admission to Chilaw Hospital on May 6 morning.
Chilaw Police said she was identified as Lankahaluge Ameli Vithara Nethkini Fernando of Melpura, Kurunegala road, Chilaw.
At the inquest held by S M Jauffer at the hospital morgue, the girl’s mother Kathaluwa Vithanage Aranika Prabhakumari said her daughter, born through the Caesarean section, suffered from speech loss and walking disability and had to be hand fed. While she was feeding her daughter a bun for breakfast, a piece of bun had stuck in her throat and she could not relieve her despite all efforts. As such, they rushed the daughter to the hospital in her husband’s three-wheeler and she died on admission despite all efforts made by doctors and nurses to save her.
The inquirer returned a verdict of death due to asphyxiation.
Chilaw Police led evidence.
