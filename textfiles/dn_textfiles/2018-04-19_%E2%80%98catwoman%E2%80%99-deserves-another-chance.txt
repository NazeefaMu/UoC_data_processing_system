‘Catwoman’ deserves another chance

Actor Halle Berry said after the success of 'Black Panther', the superhero character of Catwoman deserves a second "chance". The actor, who played the character in 2004 film 'Catwoman', was massively criticised for her performance. She famously accepted a Razzie for Best Actress in 2005 and in her speech she called the film "god-awful movie".
According to a report, 'Black Panther', fronted by Chadwick Boseman, has renewed Berry's hopes and she said she deserves another opportunity as the Catwoman.
"Each story builds on the next. It's like that old saying goes: behind every 'Black Panther' is a great black 'Catwoman'! You know, I've gotten a really bad rap for this role, and I think Catwoman deserves another goddamn chance, don't you?" she said. Besides Berry, actors Michelle Pfeiffer and Anne Hathaway are among who have played the character. PTI
