Prof. Vitarana dreams of Government collapse

Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) General Secretary Prof. Tissa Vitarana said that the signs of the collapse of the ‘Yaha Palana’ Government can be seen.
“Contradictions between the UNP and SLFPers in the Government have emerged. The people have realised that the Government has entered into a path of betraying the country and the people,” Prof. Vitarana said.
He was addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters yesterday.
Prof. Vitharana said public protests in the country have shown disagreements with decisions taken by the Government. Appreciating the trade union action by CPC trade unions against the Government decision to handover the oil tanks in Trincomalee to India, among several other demands, Prof Vitarana said the LSSP is with them to win their demands.
He said the Prime Minister has taken over a contract on behalf of the international imperialists. He condemned the Wednesday’s attack on CPC trade union activists by a group of thugs.
