People cautioned over food poisoning during Vesak festivities

People who fall sick after consuming food items from dansals/food outlets should inform in this regard to the nearest Public Health Inspector (PHI) or the MOH, Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Consultant Epidemiologist Dr. Thilanga Ruwanpathirana said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, Ruwanpathirana said persons who undergo symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain after consuming food items from a dansala/food outlet should seek treatment. “Until then they should take `Jeevani’” he said..
“They must inform the situation they undergo to the nearest PHI or the MOH as well since it can be a food poisoning and a large number of people may be in danger,” he said.
Food poisoning can put a large number of people in danger within a few minutes. Therefore, dansal organisers should be very careful that they provide hygienic food and drinks to people during Vesak festivities, he warned.
