Mustapha's proposal to have new mixed electoral system for all elections approved

 
The policy document presented by Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Faizer Musthapha to have a mixed electoral system for all elections was approved today.
Minister Musthapha speaking to Daily News said that Cabinet had asked that a committee be appointed to look into the preparation of draft legislation. The committee will look to views from all party leaders and the Elections commissioner.
The proposal was approved without objection.
It is only Local Government bodies at present which follow a mixed system which consists of 60 percent from the First-Past-the-Post (FPP) system and 40 percent from the Proportional Representation (PR) system.
The Minister has stated that the introduction of the same system to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections would ensure a uniform system of elections throughout.
The special Cabinet meeting which was convened today was reportedly a short one and had only discussed the above proposal. The usual Cabinet meeting scheduled on Tuesdays has been postponed to next week.
