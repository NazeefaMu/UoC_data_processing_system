Upali Tennekoon assault case: Six Army personnel granted bail

 Six Army personnel including an officer attached to the Military Intelligence Unit allegedly involved in the assualt of former Rivira Editor Upali Tennekoon were ordered to be released on bail by Gampaha Chief Magistrate D.A.Ruwanpathirana yesterday.
The Magistrate made this order after three witnesses in the case failed to recognise the suspects who had allegedly carried out the assault.
Tennakoon was on his way to office when four men on motorcycles stopped him, smashed his car windows and proceeded to beat him and his wife with metal bars in January 2009.
