Honouring a master

Ananda Padmasiri is a man for all seasons. Taking the life serenely, this remarkable man evolves with time naturally to constantly be in the limelight. Being a senior journalist and a lyricist Ananda over the decades has bequeathed the field of art with valuable material.
As the editor of Sathsara tabloid he has offered a helping hand to a gamut of budding singers and musicians to consolidate themselves in the sphere. Yet he never has asked anything in return from them except for warmth and long lasting friendship.
Gala musical event, Gee Anande 39 was held at the New Town hall, Colombo to felicitate Padmasiri on his 39 years stint in the art field.
The event was organized by Facebook friends of Ananda Padmasiri. Heartthrob of 1970s, Tissa Wijesurendra graced the occasion as the Chief Guest. The show was compeered by Mahesh Nissanka of SLRC’s Sihinayaki Rae fame.
To mark the event, ‘Gee Anande’ CD containing a non-stop version of songs penned by Ananda Padmasiri was launched along with a book dedicated to Ananda’s lifelong friend H R Jothipla.
The book Jothi Mathaka Ru contains 72 rare pictures of Jothipala with interesting stories revolving around them.
A host of popular artistes sang 39 songs penned by Padmasiri and the musical event was backed by veteran musician Sarath de Alwis and his band. The musical show began with the song ‘Sanda Obai Piyanani’ written by Ananda to pay his gratitude to his demised father.
Speaking to the Daily News, TnC Ananda Padmasiri said, “I once visited H R Jothipala as a fan and told him, I want to become a lyricist. He offered me a chance to pen the song ‘Ape Adaraye Rasa Geethika’ in 1979. This was the very first lyric I wrote. This song voiced by Jothi and Latha came in the film ‘Yugayen Yugayata’. Vijaya Kumarathunga performed for the song in the film”.
He continued, “I have compiled this book on Jothipala as a mark of gratitude. I wanted to present it to Presidents’ Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya, who was Jothi’s brother-in-law, at this event. On his sudden demise, we decided to present the book today to his beloved wife, Irangani”.
Being a senior lyricist and a journalist Padmasiri felicitating his friend at his own felicitation was a rare happening and a touching one. The serious looking and light hearted lyric composer now works closely with the new generation of singers.
