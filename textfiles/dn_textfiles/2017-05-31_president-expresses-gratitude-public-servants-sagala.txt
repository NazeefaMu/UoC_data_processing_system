President expresses gratitude to public servants: Sagala

President Maithripala Sirisena has expressed his admiration of all the public servants, for executing their responsibilities to the highest degree while responding to the calamitous events caused by the adverse weather conditions, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said. The Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Disaster Management Ministry premises yesterday.
Minister Ratnayaka said it is unfair by the public servants, to say they were inefficient in responding to the disaster situation.
Minister Ratnayaka pointed out that the government is faced with severe difficulties at the initial stage of assessing and responding to the situation following a power failure, loss of land access to affected areas and a loss of communication due to mobile-signal towers being out of service.
“The most prompt response to the disaster situation was given by the Sri Lanka Police,” Minister Ratnayaka said. “By 12 midnight on day one of the disaster, Sri Lanka Navy boats started rescue missions from Pitabeddara,”the Minister said.
“An Air Force officer dedicated his life rescuing affected citizens,” Minister Ratnayaka pointed out.
“All these officers representing the government of Sri Lanka, we should not forget, Minister Ratnayaka pointed out.
“I saw an officer from the Ceylon Electricity Board stationed at a tower working in the dead of night while his family was displaced and taken to relief camps. That was the dedication shown by public servants during this natural calamity,” Minister Ratnayaka added.
