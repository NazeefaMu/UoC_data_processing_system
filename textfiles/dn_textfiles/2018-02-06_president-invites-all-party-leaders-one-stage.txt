Discussion on bribery, corruption, waste, homicide
President invites all party leaders on one stage

President Maithripala Sirisena asked all party leaders to come for a face-to-face meeting to discuss bribery, corruption, waste and murders.
He was addressing a political rally held at Aralaganwila, Polonnaruwa on Sunday
“The people should decide whether they have to protect robbers or punish them, the President said. He asked the people to vote for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to fight against bribery and corruption. The plans to develop the country can be accelerated then within a clean political background, the President said.
This rally was organised to ensure the victory of the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha SLFP candidates led by the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Former Chief Minister of the North Central Province Peshala Jayarathna, former Provincial Councillor Jayantha Marasinghe and others participated.
