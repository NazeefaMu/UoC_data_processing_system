Childhood, a short season

Titled as Childhood in Contemporary Cultures, the compendium of essays edited by Margaret Mead, the well-known anthropologist, and Martha Wolfenstein, the reputed folklorist, first appeared in the field of cultural anthropology as a pioneer reader in 1955. Gradually as the field of studies extended to the interlinked areas of sociology and communication like collection had to be reprinted several times in keeping with the demand.
In all the subject areas of childhood in contemporary cultures are subdivided into eight segments.
1. Cultural approaches to the study of childhood.
2. Observational studies (on childhood)
3. Child rearing literature
4. Fantasies for and about children
5. Children’s imaginative productions
6. Interviews with parents and children
7. Clinical studies (on children)
8. The epilogue (to the findings) by the two compilers.
The collection of findings is supplemented with photos, illustrations and a bibliography of their books referred to in the text. Though the compilation could be classified as a study in social and cultural anthropology, the essays embedded could be of interest to all nations, transcending the geographical and cultural barriers. The compilers tell us at the outset that children are newcomers in the social sciences.
Living conditions
The findings encircle countries of around the globe giving emphasis on the broad insight into culture and living conditions. The intention of the team of researchers is to find the ways in which children can be studied and interpret how the materials made by, for or about children, can be utilised for the betterment of the living conditions of the children in all cultures.
This book, which consists of a series of findings on children, is stated as grown out of the Columbia University Research in contemporary cultures and inaugurated by Ruth Benedict as far back as 1947. As a byproduct, the leader of the team, Margaret Mead, who worked as the chief researcher attached to American Museum of Natural History, brought out a work titled The Study of Culture at a Distance (1953). This work centred around quite a number of areas which later broadened the study horizons of cultural anthropology which in turn gave way to the broad perspectives of social sciences at the university level of education.
Today, one finds the study of childhood is not emphasised as a broad-based area in social sciences. Instead, its findings are vaguely centred around the studies in childcare and child psychology. In the theoretical setting to the work, Mead emphasises the fact that children are newcomers as a subject of literature, newcomers in the study of human physiology and anatomy, newcomers in the social sciences.
Interested reader
In the volume of learned essays of varying types, the editors do not propose to present and exhaustive study of ways of studying children within a particular cultural context, but rather to give the student and the interested reader some idea of the kinds of research which may truthfully be explored from the standpoint both of method and of results.
The editors have taken care to include several kinds of studies on the same culture so that the student or the reader can see for example what it looks like to study French films, French drawings of children, French children playing in a park, books read by French children, the songs sung by them, the story completion on the part of children etc.
One significant point laid down by the editors is to note that there should be gaps that should be left out in the areas linked to childhood. Social conditions tend to change. The changing patterns of children too have to be noted.
On looking out for sources of material on childhood, the factors such as child training, literature, child in fiction and drama, observations on child behaviour interviews with children and adults, games and toys and children’s story books, the insights on the part of the adult ought to be productive as well as sensitive. Today, the emphasis has gone into the mass media materials as utilised in press, radio and television.
Fears and resonances
Special units have been carved out in order to bring better results and better awards. Margaret Mead states that because of the recurrent biological similarities of growth of parent-child relationships of needs and fears and resonances, it is possible to compare childhood of one society with that of another. How many readers may agree with the notion, I wonder.
But the fact remains that the common elements and the uniformities are the basics of the comparisons, according to Mead. She adds that when we look at behaviour culturally, it means what we look at it comparatively.
As further interpreted by Mead, when the anthropologist says children take father’s surname, the culturally naïve answer will be ‘of course who else’s name would they take?’ But the culturally sophisticated - whether that comes from reading, travel or study from the knowledge of other periods of history or from knowledge of other cultures - will realise that in many societies there are no surnames, wherein other children take their mother’s surname or take the surname of both the parents. This gives the situation that taking the father’s surname is a particular type of cultural behaviour, neither natural to the human race nor a predictable occurrence for a given part of the week.
With this example, Mead tries to drive at a conclusion which goes as ‘every single statement that an anthropologist makes a comparative statement.’
The segment on the areas pertaining to fantasies far and above children looks quite fascinating for the modern reader interested in fairytales and allied studies. The study on Jack and the Beanstalk by Martha Wolfenstein and the study of the Chinese Children’s classic Monkey give insights to the type of fables and legends that could make children think and understand about their living conditions.
All in all, this is a gift for all times, resourceful for all cultures, especially in search of reconciliation.
