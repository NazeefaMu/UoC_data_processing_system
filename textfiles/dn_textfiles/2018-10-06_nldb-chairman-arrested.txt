NLDB CHAIRMAN ARRESTED

National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Chairman M.K. Muthuvinayagam was arrested yesterday for allegedly demanding a bribe from a businessman.
A Bribery Commission source told the Daily News that the NLDB Chairman had allegedly demanded Rs.1.2 million from a businessman to expedite the lease of a restaurant at the Malsiripura NLDB Farm. However, it was later negotiated for Rs.600,000.
The Chairman had done this deal through another person known as Kadiresu Sivanesan.
Sivanesan was sent to collect the bribe from the businessman and based on a complaint made by the said businessman, the Bribery Commission officers had observed the whole incident. Sivanesan, having obtained the cash had called the NLDB Chairman to confirm that he had received the money.
Thereafter, the Bribery Commission officers had arrested both suspects.
Later, the NLDB Chairman had admitted to having solicited the bribe.
The two suspects were scheduled to be produced before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
