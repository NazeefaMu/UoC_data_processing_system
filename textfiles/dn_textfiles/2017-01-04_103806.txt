Magisterial inquiry into Panadura mother, infant death begins

 
Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage issued notice on the Panadura Medical Superintendent and surgeon of  ‘Kethumathi’ P. C. H. Dias Memorial Women’s Hospital to appear before Court to record their statements on the deaths of W. P. Marian Chathurani Perera and her new born infant in the labour room of the Hospital on October 16, 2016.
Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage had decided to hold a magisterial inquiry into the mysterious deaths of the mother and her new born infant after the woman’s husband W. P. Chathuranga Perera complained to the Panadura Police Crime Branch asking for an inquiry into the deaths of his wife and baby.
Police Sergeant Samanlal Edirisinghe of the Panadura Police Crime Branch submitted an investigations report to the Court and moved the Court to summon the Panadura Medical Superintendent and the surgeon of the Kethumathi Hospital to record their statements regarding the deaths of the mother and her infant before the Court.
Police Sergeant Edirisinghe informed the Chief Magistrate that the Panadura AJMO had held postmortem examinations on the two bodies and that the specimens had been forwarded to the Government Analyst for examination and report.
