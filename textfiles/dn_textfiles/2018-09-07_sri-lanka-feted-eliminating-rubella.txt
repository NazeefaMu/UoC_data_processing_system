Sri Lanka feted for eliminating Rubella

The World Health Organization (WHO) named Sri Lanka as a country that eliminated Rubella and awarded a certificate, Health Ministry Spokesman said.
The certificate was awarded to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne by WHO Regional Director for South - East Asia Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh in India during the 72st Session of the Regional Committee.
Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. Rubella virus causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults. Infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or infants with congenital malformations, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
