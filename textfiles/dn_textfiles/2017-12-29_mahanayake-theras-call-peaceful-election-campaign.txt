Mahanayake Theras call for peaceful election campaign

The various political parties and candidates are responsible in assisting the Elections Commission to hold a peaceful election devoid of violence, the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera said.
“The candidates should also conduct a campaign which respects election laws and does not pollute the environment,” the Asgiriya Chief Prelate said.
The Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera was speaking when former Kandy Mayor Raja Pushpakumara visited the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters yesterday.
Both Mahanayakes pointed out that since the elections are being held under the First Past the Post System, it gives a candidate a limited area to campaign in. They could go house to house campaigning or conduct small meetings instead of pasting posters all over and polluting the environment.
The Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter Venerable Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said the two main parties had shown by example how they can work together at the national level and thus party supporters and candidates should not create problems and fight each other at the local elections.
The Asgiriya Mahanayake Thera further observed that election violence not only impacted political candidates but also the public.
Therefore, party leaders should take the responsibility to ensure that their candidates contest a peaceful and fair election without violence and intimidation.
