Police hunt Paris gunman - but are there others?

FRANCE: Police on Tuesday stepped up a Europe-wide hunt for the Paris attackers after video confirmed a ninth man may also have taken part in the worst attacks in French history.
Investigators are hunting the suspect for his part in the carnage that left 129 people dead, after footage showed a third man in a car used in one of the attacks on bars and cafes in central Paris.
He could be one of two suspects being held in Belgium or on the run -- possibly with 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, who carried out the shootings along with his suicide-bomber brother Brahim.
Belgian police failed to find Abdeslam during a raid in Brussels on Monday, while a subsequent sighting of him in Germany turned out to be a wild goose chase.
In claiming responsibility for the attacks, the Islamic State group said eight men were involved.
As the manhunt continues, investigators are seeking to pinpoint when, where and how France's worst-ever attacks were organised, and whether more accomplices are running free.
How the gunmen communicated, where they travelled and how they planned Friday's attacks is key to the probe.
On Tuesday, police found a black Renault Clio rented under Abdeslam's name in a northern district of the French capital. It had been spotted on the A1 motorway that heads north from Paris.
His bank card was also used to rent two hotel rooms in the northern suburbs days before Friday's attacks at the national stadium, a concert hall and restaurants and cafes, police sources said.
But it remains unclear how one of the gunmen, French national Samy Amimour, returned to Europe from Syria without being detected given he is wanted under an international warrant.
Or why Belgian police failed to notify their French counterparts that the Abdeslam brothers, who had been living in Brussels, had been flagged as radical Islamists.
Two of the three suicide bombers whose bodies were found at the Bataclan concert hall, the site of the worst carnage where 89 people were killed, grew up in France.
Amimour, 28, grew up in Drancy, a poor immigrant area northeast of Paris, and worked as a suburban bus driver. He was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism in October 2012, but violated his bail, leaving for Syria almost a year later.
