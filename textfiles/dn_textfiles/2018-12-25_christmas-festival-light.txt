CHRISTMAS MESSAGES
Christmas: The Festival of Light

If we ask any non Christian to name one festival so closely linked to a particular religion and which has now become universal; the answer would he Christmas without an:, competition. For Christians, Christmas is but one of several feasts they observe throughout the year and which are sometimes more significant than this feast in December which has become more vibrant due to commercial purposes in the modern times. Why do people celebrate Christmas? A straightforward answer to this question is that Christmas is the birthday of Christ. Does this mean that Jesus was born on the 25th December? No, it does not mean that f le was born on December 25th. The truth is that nobody knows the day on which Jesus was horn. Then one may ask the reason for celebrating Christmas on the 25th December every year. This is a complex and complicated story, which needs to be investigated to have a sound understanding of Christmas.
According to the Bible
It is clear that the early Christians did not celebrate the birthday of Christ. In the New, Testament of the Bible, apart from the records of the birth of Christ we do not find any record of these early followers of Jesus Christ celebrating the birthday of their leader and master. This is not something surprising as Jesus was a Jew and most of the early followers of Jesus were Jewish people. Fut Jews birthdays were not very important as for the Romans or Greeks. In this background the only clear birthday recorded in the New Testament is the birthday celebration of King Herod, after which event John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus. was beheaded.
When Christmas began to be celebrated on the 25th December this festival became meanin2ful to people as it was able to enrich the birth of Christ by absorbing the meaningful festivals already celebrated in society. This is the core factor that has made Christmas so important for people all over the world. In this particular context it is clear that Christmas is not a mere birthday part) for Jesus Christ. It is a festival of light and life. This is clear in the following Bible verses taken from the traditional Bible passage read for Christmas from St. John's Gospel (St. John I .1-14). “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him. and without him not one thin2 came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people.
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.....” Let us see how Christmas became a rich mixture or a colourful tapestry thouh many sociological, religious and ethical influences.
The Historical landscape
According to the generally accepted history of the Christian Church Christmas has been celebrated on 25th December 354CE. Before this time, and after the New Testament period, this festival was celebrated on 6th January
It is necessary to understand the context of January 6th to comprehend the festival that was celebrated on this date. In pagan antiquity 6th January was the east of Dionysus the Greek vegetarian god of wine. It was the belief of the followers of this god that by transforming water into wine HIV god revealed his divine power.
Very probably, when the early Christians gradually initiated the celebration of the incarnation or God in Jesus the established legend of Dionysus, would have created a significant ground to make the nativity of Jesus effective and meaning. “This is clear in the way in which they celebrated the Epiphany on the 6th January by commemorating the feast of the power of revelation of their God in a way by displacing die least of We epiphany of Dionysus.
On the other hand the gradual development of 25th December as the nativity of Christ from the mid 4th century cannot be understood without a sound understanding of the mid winter festivals of the ancient world. These festivals were especially prominent in ancient Babylon and Egypt. At the same time Germanic fertility festivals were also held during this winter season. Along with the winter festivals the birth of the sun god was particularly associated with 25th December. For instance, the births of the ancient sun god Attis in Phrygia and the Persian sun god Mithras were celebrated on December 25th. The Roman Festival of Saturn (Saturnalia), the god of peace and plenty, was from 17th to 24th December. These festivals were held with great festivity along with public gatherings, exchange of gifts and candles, etc.
Cultural Influences
Apart from these origins there are many other customs and traditions from other cultures which are embedded with Christmas. For instance the custom of decorating homes and altars with evergreen leaves of holly and mistletoe during the Christmas season came from the ancient Celtic culture of the British Isles where they revered all green plants as important symbols of fertility.
The tradition of calling Christmas Yule tide in many countries is derived from an ancient ritual of burning Yule logs as part of a pagan ceremony associated with vegetation and fire. This community act was performed with the expectation of magical and spiritual powers. It is believed that the widely venerated Saint Francis of Assisi introduced the practice or making cribs by making a model of the scenes of nativity to re-enact the birth of Christ in order to bring spiritual revival to the laity. As is common knowledge, singing is part and parcel of a 1 all cultures of the world.
In the background of this “cultural universal” singing of this carols for Christmas appeared in the Middle Ages and by the 14th century this custom became part of the religious observances of the birth of Christ. Apart From these customs, rituals and ceremonies there are many other traditions such as the Christmas tree d the observance of saint days that are intertwined with the celebration of Christmas.
What Christmas means for us today
Christmas has the power to bring many cultures, traditions and symbols together to uplift humanity to divinity and bring down the divine to humanity. It is the responsibility of Christians and others concerned to make this festival meaningful by adsorbing all life affirming and light ueneratin2 festivals and activities to this festival. We can see that already this has happened commercially. It is our responsibility to make this happen ethically, morally, and spiritually.
The necessity for this responsibility springs up in the post war contexts of many countries as there are people who still exist in bleak Mc threatening situations. Here the message of Christmas is not to look into their caste, code. class, ethnicity or religion, but to accept and honour them by respecting them and making them understand that their liberation and redemption is tied up with the salvation of whole humanity.
While celebrations will continue this Christmas as well, let us direct our minds to understand those that are unable to celebrate not religiously but in any practical manner according to hardship. non recognition. discrimination, fear and loneliness. 1 he message of Clod who becomes a human being in order to know humanity and to save humanity cannot resonate at all if we are unable to bring this joyful news of light and life into the lives of the above. Let this he a season where we share this light and life with them and many others. May the peace of Christmas be with you all..
