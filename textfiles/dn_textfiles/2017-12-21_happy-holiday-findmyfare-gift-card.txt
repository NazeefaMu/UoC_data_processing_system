Available on www.findmyfare.com, as a physical Gift Card, or as an online E-Gift Card, Findmyfare's exceptional range is very unique and attractive looking, allowing these to be gifted for as many as six different occasions. These include the “Happy Holidays” card, which is ideal for wishing loved ones a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and Season's Greeting.Findmyfare also offers variations for wishing friends, family and business associates a “Happy Birthday”, a “Happy Wedding”, a “Happy Anniversary” and a “Happy Sinhala and Tamil New Year” (Avurudu), as well as one with a more generalized,”Best Wishes” greeting, which is appropriate for any occasion.
