In order to guide them in the right direction, we need to equip them with necessary infrastructural support, so they may reach their fullest potential at school. We are humbled to support this program which has allowed us to repair and provide essential facilities to rural schools that are often neglected or overlooked from the authorities due to budget constraints,” Gamika De Silva Head of Marketing and Sales of Seylan Bank PLC commented.
Further elaborating on Seylan’s focus on fortifying the future of Children through education, De Silva said; “Providing access to knowledge sources can fast track the sustainable development of the country. Having said that Seylan Bank understands the value of enabling the children of Sri Lanka with the right tools to gain access to a sea of information which is readily available; be it through a fully equipped library that has print as well as online material or by creating conducive environment for them to be educated.”
The project was implemented considering the alarming number of requests Derana TV received during its CSR activities carried out in North Central province in the past months.
