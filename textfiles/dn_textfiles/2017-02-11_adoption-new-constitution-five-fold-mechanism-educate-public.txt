Adoption of new Constitution: Five fold mechanism to educate public

The Public Representation Committee on Constitutional Reforms yesterday said that the public will be enlightened about the process of drafting a new Constitution through a five fold mechanism.
According to Committee Secretary Winston Pathiraja, a secretariat headed by an Additional Secretary has been established at the Parliamentary complex with the aim of obtaining official level support for the Constitutional drafting process.
“We will make elaborate arrangements to make youths aware of this process through islandwide Youth organisations,” he said.
Pathiraja added that school children and government officials at grassroots level will also be educated on this process in the future.
“An awareness campaign will be launched at grassroots level with the support of the Sarvodaya organisation,”he said.
Pathiraja said that his committee operating from Visumpaya will oversee these activities to ensure that people are well educated aboutthis programme.
“We have already implemented an awareness programme in coordination with the National Youth Services Council in Colombo, Kalutara, Ratnapura and oneragala,”he said.
