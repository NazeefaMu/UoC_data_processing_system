Australia supports tourism skills development in the East and NCP

Australian High Commissioner, Bryce Hutchesson, together with Skills Development and Vocational Training, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe officially opened the project office for the Skills for Inclusive Growth Program in Batticaloa on February 8. Eastern Province, Chief Minister Nazeer Ahamed participated.
Under the Skills for Inclusive Growth programme, Australia will provide around Rs. 1.6 billion in aid and technical assistance, to strengthen Sri Lanka’s tourism sector – through training and mentoring for employees and small businesses.
The programme will prioritise the under employed, particularly local women, youth and people with disability.
The office in Batticaloa will act as the central hub for the project and will house a team of international and national vocational training experts. District coordinators will be appointed to work with communities, businesses and officials in Ampara, Trincomalee and Polonnaruwa, the target districts for the first four years.
Speaking at the event, the High Commissioner said: “A profitable and sustainable tourism industry requires more than natural and cultural assets, which Sri Lanka has in abundance, it requires high-level hospitality skills. Skills for Inclusive Growth will train and mentor those already employed in tourism; as well as future employees in the tourism industry, as the sector evolves to meet the needs of local and international visitors.”
Minister Samarasinghe added: “I express my gratitude to the Australian High Commissioner, and the Australian Government for committing such a large sum for the future development of Sri Lanka not as a loan but as a 100 percent grant, which is very rare to see in this day and age. This underscores the very special historic bilateral relationship that exists between the people of Australia and the people of Sri Lanka.”
The programme will support the full value chain of the tourism sector, for example, food suppliers, hospitality trainers, artisans, surf instructors, spa owners, accommodation providers, taxi drivers, as well as district planners, park rangers, industry regulators and business chambers, he said.
