Home Lands illuminates Diyawannawa Vesak Zone

Home Lands Group, a leading skyline changer in Colombo, joined hands with the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and UN Committee in lighting up the Diyatha area and Diyawannawa vesak zone, for the Vesak season.

Vesak Poya day commemorates the birth, the Enlightenment and the demise of the Lord Buddha. In remembrance of this important day, people re-embrace and pay tribute to the lord Buddha who taught the world of Humanity, compassion, kindness, wisdom, peace and so many other virtues, not only through teaching but also being an extraordinary human being.
The UN Vesak zone was held around Diyatha Uyana, the area surrounding the Parliamentary Complex, Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Road and DiyawannaOya. Giving a modern touch to the traditional Vesak decorations, Diyawannaoya and its surrounded area was a city of lights, with thousands of Vesak decorations illustrating the beauty of cultural richness of the country.
It has been an honor for Home Lands, for partnering with the celebration of United Nation Vesak Day, by being a humble contributor to exhibits the official Logo of the UN day of Vesak at ParliamentJunction and by placing 400 lotus shaped lanterns along the Parliament road Junction and Diyatha Uyana to light up the environment creating illuminated displays. It has also been a privileged to the company, to add a cultural value to the neighborhood city of which the foundation of the Home Lands was initially built on.
The company with its heartfelt willingness, decided to collaborate with the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLR&DC) and UN Committee to stand beside the entire nation to unveil the generations of Sri Lankan Art and Crafts blend with Vesak Decorations in front of the whole world.
