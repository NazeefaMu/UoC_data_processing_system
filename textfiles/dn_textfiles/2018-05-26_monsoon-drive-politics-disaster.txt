Monsoon drive into politics of disaster

The South West Monsoon has lashed into the country with sixteen persons already dead and thousands displaced from their homes, undergoing considerable suffering and facing untold hardship. The Disaster Management and other government authorities, with the Army, Navy and Air Force are carrying out necessary and valuable services, with private, religious, and volunteer organizations also joining to help the needy.
The reports show that certain areas and those living near some major rivers and waterways– the Kalu Ganga, Gin Ganga, Nilwala Ganga, Kelani Ganga and Attanagalu Oya, are facing the most hardship with this monsoon blast, as in earlier monsoon seasons and other situations of heavy downfalls, winds and storms. What is most regrettable about the situation, affecting the lives of so many Sri Lankans and even the limited economic development in the country, is the reality of this monsoonal and wider environmental tragedy being forgotten very soon, pushed back by the politics of unreality that is rapidly enveloping the people.
A study of the continuing and emerging trends of national and regional disaster from the weather shows that 70 years after independence very little has been done to address this increasingly disturbing situation facing many parts of the island; although it must be conceded that important and valuable measures to address the needs of water for irrigation have been taken in the post-independence decades. What stands out today is the absence of any serious political discussion, and proposals to seriously address the repeated disasters – of minor and major proportions – taking place every year, and the lack of initiatives to deal with the impact of climate and weather in a context of national importance.
The two major political parties in the country – the UNP and SLFP, and the now emerging SLPP, as well as the regional and minority related parties such as the TNA and SLMC, have paid very little attention to dealing with the repeated ‘weather crises’ the country is facing, with increasing frequency.
Cheap politics
Much of the hardships faced by the people due to rain and the threat of landslides are clearly seen to be the result of cheap politics. People encouraged by government, provincial or local government permits to build houses on the banks of rivers, smaller waterways and canals (just as it is done near urban railway lines), and in areas clearly identified as prone to landslides. There are no signs whatever that the politics and politicians of today are ready to move away from this misuse of questionable political authority, to gather votes, with no attention whatever to the overall needs of social progress. A country with such a valuable and proud history of preserving, managing and harnessing water is showing signs of rapidly moving away from the necessities of protecting and properly managing nature, amidst the politics of a majoritarian thrust in all aspects of governance and social organisation.
The tragedies faced by the people in the latest monsoon crisis is a call for all political leaders to pay serious attention to these repetitive disasters, and come up with solutions that could be discussed by all sections of the population, irrespective of ethnicity, religion and geographical location, to carry out major flood relief, landslide prevention, and overall anti-disaster actions necessary for the progress of Sri Lankan society. Those already drawing up manifestos for the coming presidential poll already warming up to be candidates, should give due importance to this aspect of necessary national thinking, beyond the confines of the ethnic and divisive politics they are now engaged in.
Presidential pull
The recent Shangri-La move into the politics of the presidency is the stuff of much discussion in the political world, with the Gotabhaya factor playing an increasing role in manoeuvering of political alignments, especially in the context of the divisions within the SLFP. The Viyathmaga Convention at the Shangri-La has the emergence of an academic, professional, uniformed, and business line up emerging as the new base of the SLPP – which does not want to abandon its original and historic links to the SLFP. The theme of the Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka being shown as the new elevation of political thinking in the country, shows a major departure from the founding support of the SLFP.
It is useful to remember that the SLFP, founded by SWRD Bandaranaike, went to the people in 1956 with the slogan of ‘Sangha – Veda – Guru – Govi – Kamkaru’ – the Sangha, Physicians, Teachers, Cultivators and Workers – that brought together the vast sections of the rural population of this country. The move now is to present Gotabhaya as the voice of the urban power sector, having nothing to do with the rural and working classes. It is certainly a major shift in the political thinking of the Viyathmaga strategists, who are ready to move towards western inspired and influenced sections of society, while shouting slogans of ethnic and religious differences, but thinking instead of the Intellectual Inspirations of today caught in the mould of the West. These are the forces making the biggest noises about Western manipulation of the government today.
That is the crowd that filled the largest hall of the six-star luxury Shangri-La Hotel, that did get its land from what was the former property of the Defence Ministry of Sri Lanka, pushing the Army away from its headquarters, and where Gotabhaya Rajapaksa played his main role of Secretary, Ministry of Defence. The luxury space of the Shangri-La was certainly not the place for large numbers of the 'Sangha-Veda-Guru-Govi-Kamkaru' of the past or their social and political descendants of today, to find any place of congenial comfort. It is the buildup of a wholly new social strata – embracing supporters of JR Jayewardene’s right wing politics that brought the authoritarian Executive Presidency, moving to the near dictatorial Mahinda Rajapaksa; bringing to it academics of limited depth in social analysis and understanding, with the uniformed ranks who cheered at the imprisonment of the Army Commander who led the battle to defeat the LTTE, and the business people of green and blue tints, the key movers in the manipulation of corrupt politics today.
The call for Gotabhaya as the Executive President and Head of State, brings the possibility of the first ever Head of Government in electoral politics, and the Head of State, too, who has never been elected to any office of service to the people. He was never a member of parliament or even a local authority. There are good reasons to look down on today’s members of parliament and local bodies. But there is some background of association with people, in the search for election, no doubt spoilt by the corruption that Gotabhaya supported from 2005 to 2014.
There is a clarification needed, because Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was first appointed Prime Minister without an election in 1960. But she was appointed a member of the Senate – the 2nd Chamber of Parliament, - and did her work as Head of Government as a Member of Parliament. Her coming into politics and power was due to the assassination of her husband, certainly a shocking and tragic entry into politics and power.
There is no such shocking background for the possibility of the first non-elected Executive President of the country. The background is that of leaving the Army, when the war against the LTTE was very much on, and yes, leaving to the United States, where he obtained citizenship, and remained away from the politics of this country, until his elder brother Mahinda, was elected President in 2005, or was chosen Prime Minister in 2004.
There is much being pushed around about his role in Urban Development. Yes, there are some colonial era buildings well renovated and provided for business around Independence Square, and the Race Course in Colombo has been brought back from wasteful misuse. Some shanty towns in the city, have been removed, and high rise buildings provided for those displaced. But, that is not the stuff of Urban Development, in a major scale.
The current monsoon rains, and the quick flooding of many of the major roads in the city, and the hardships faced by many in the suburban towns in the country are certainly no show for any major contribution to Urban Development, with any inspirational drive. The rapid covering of potholes and carpeting of main roads look good, but the flaws come out when the flooding comes with any major showers, and washes away the false claims of Urban Development.
These are some of the realities of the Viyathmaga figure that do not strike the academics, ex-uniform staff, professionals, and business forces of the corrupt, pushing ahead the flower drums of Shangri-La. They will have to look deeper at the ownership of two elephants and fish that must be cared for by sailors in the official residence of a former secretary of a ministry of government. If that is the stuff of intellectual inspiration, we need to worry about both intellect and inspiration.
