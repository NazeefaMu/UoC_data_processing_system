Asalanka, Vandersay injured, Ashan to captain

Sri Lanka Emerging team suffered two casualties in their opening match of the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup match against Oman at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday when skipper Charith Asalanka suffered a knee injury and leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay dislocated his right shoulder and were both ruled out from taking further part in the tournament.
Asalanka suffered a knee injury while batting and had to retire hurt at 10. He was taken to hospital and had an MRI scan taken which ruled him out of the tournament.
Vandersay was also injured when he dislocated his right shoulder while fielding and was taken to hospital and subsequently ruled out. Shehan Jayasuriya and Wanindu Hasaranga will come in as replacements for Asalanka and Vandersay. Shammu Ashan will lead Sri Lanka for the remainder of the tournament.
