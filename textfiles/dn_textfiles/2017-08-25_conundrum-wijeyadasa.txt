Conundrum that is Wijeyadasa

The factors spelled out by former Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that led to his ouster from the Cabinet, is curious, if not contradictory. One of the reasons adduced by Rajapakshe for his dismissal was the Bond scam. He told journalist that since he had given a free hand to the AG's Department, those involved in the scam was in fear of being exposed. He also said that the Bond scam was the biggest ever swindle in the country since the time of King Pandukabhaya, though he does not elaborate on this, leaving the public in the dark if there were Central Banks and governors, three millenea ago.
This is the first time that Rajapakshe had come out on the Bond scam, when he had not been averse to making many controversial statements against the government prior to this. Perhaps, this is an afterthought on the part of Rajapakshe who is presently coming out with fantastic revelations which he had chosen to keep under the wraps all this time, after his ouster from Cabinet. Never once had he provided an inkling or drop a hint on the alleged Bond scam or the involvement of government personages, when he had been making sweeping statements about the government's attitude towards the Sangha and inaction on the part of the government to the alleged destruction of places of Buddhist heritage and archeological sites in the North and East. Now, out of the blue, the former minister has thought it fit to compromise his colleagues in the UNP after being shown the door.
Rajapakshe, while denying any wrongdoing on his part, says the Hambantota Port deal was agreed to by the Cabinet of ministers in violation of the constitution and that the agreement was null and void in law. This is curious indeed. All this time we understood Rajapakshe to be a member of the Cabinet in the Unity Government and an influential one at that, prior to his dismissal. Is he now saying that he too raised his hands along with his Cabinet colleagues, granting the stamp of approval for the Hambantota deal to go ahead? Did he, or, did he not, know at the time, that the agreement was in violation of the constitution? Did it take his dismissal from the Cabinet for it to dawn on him that this indeed was the case? Rajapakshe is already on record stating that there was no more collective Cabinet responsibility, with all the ministers shooting off with their mouths, giving the impression that they (ministers) were free to speak their minds independently. This was all the more reason for him to come clean on this matter and declare that the agreement was, indeed, in violation of the constitution, especially as Justice Minister, instead of doing so now, after losing his portfolio. Didn't this demonstrate that Rajapakshe too was just a garden politician, as the rest of them, although given to pious pronouncements and taking moral high ground on issues.
But the piece de resistance is Rajapakshe claiming that he was a shame to remain in a Cabinet that was "selling national assets". "According to my conscience, there is nothing more shameful than staying in a Cabinet, when the assets are being sold". Well, the Hambantota Port agreement was signed on July 29, nearly one month ago, and to our knowledge nobody in government prevented Rajapakshe from tendering his resignation, on that very day itself, protesting against the 'sale of national assets'. He was also nowhere among the protesters at the inaugural ceremony of the Sri Lanka- China Logistics and Industrial Zone, in Hambantota where it was alleged that some 15,000 acres of land encompassing Hambantota and Moneragala were to be handed over to the Chinese, in January this year.
One would have expected Rajapakshe to have been in the forefront of the protesters agitating against the give-away of an extent of real estate of the country, which, some said was equal to the landmass of Singapore. In hindsight, given the sentiments currently being expressed by Rajapakshe on the “sale of national assets" a resignation should have been on the cards. Far from it, he (Rajapaskhe) continued to stay put and in fact was in a defiant mood vowing not to step down when the UNP back benchers were baying for his blood over the breach of collective Cabinet responsibility and the foot dragging on the cases against members of the former regime. On the contrary, Rajapakshe said he would not quit, come hell or high water, and it is only the President who can decide on his fate. This, by an individual who claimed he was ashamed to remain in a Cabinet that “sells national assets". Surely he did not need any encouragement to step down. He had all the reasons to take that decision himself.
The former minister says he will reveal his future political journey in due course. He was non committal when asked by journalists if he would be joining the Joint Opposition. Silence, they say, speaks a lot.
