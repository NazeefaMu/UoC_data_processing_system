I was not intimidated - Deshapriya

Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday, rejected claims that he was threatened on election night to delay the results by a certain political party.
Addressing a media briefing at the Election Secretariat, Deshapriya explained that there was no political influence exerted on him to release or not to release results.
“We asked two representatives to be sent by each party. MP Ashu Marasinghe representated the UNP, Champani Padmasiri from the SLFP and Sagala Kariyawasam and Renuka Perera from the SLPP. These representatives were there since 7 pm while the SLPP representatives stayed on till the end,” the Elections Commission Chairman said.
He stressed that the Election Commission has always functioned independently without fear and that he would not have allowed any party to intimidate him.
“I ask that such rumours not be spread. I was a man who went without Police security to monitor the elections in Jaffna.We prevented Rs.2,500 from being distributed during the Uva Province election and we visited Rupavahini to stop them from telecasting biased propaganda. I am not afraid,” Deshapriya said.
