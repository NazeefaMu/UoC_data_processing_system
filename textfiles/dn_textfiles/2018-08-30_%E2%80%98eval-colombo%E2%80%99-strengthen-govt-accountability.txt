‘Eval Colombo’ to strengthen govt. accountability

Hundred Parliamentarians from around the world will visit Sri Lanka to participate in ‘Eval Colombo 2018’.
Representatives from India, Malaysia, South Africa, the United States, World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and USAID among others, will discuss strengthening internal government accountability structures to help reach Sustainable Development Goals.
‘Eval Colombo 2018’ will include panel discussions, keynote speeches in evaluation strategies and launch of the National Evaluation Policy of Sri Lanka at Temple Trees.
‘Eval Colombo 2018’ will be held from September 17 to 19 at the Hilton Colombo and Parliament.
The Cabinet earlier, approved a proposal embracing government evaluations. The proposal, according to Kandy District Minister Mayantha Dissanayake, would mean that “before any government spending is allocated, evaluation would be taken to determine whether the project is viable.”
The proposed Evaluation Act would receive its mandate from the 19th Amendment.
“Parliamentarians are accountable for the money,” said Secretary to the Tourism Ministry V. Sivagnanasothy. The implementation of the kinds of evaluations that the government envisions will bring a new culture to the country, he said.
