UPFA Gen.Sec.invites all Leftist parties to join SLFP

United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic and Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera invited all Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members and all Leftist political parties to join hands with the SLFP to form a strong SLFP-led government in the future.
“With the successful completion of the SLFP’s 65th Convention,it is obvious that the SLFP is marching forward as a strong political movement regardless of those minor obstacles.At this juncture, all our supporters and leftist parties are invited to work within the party to form a SLFP led government,” he said.
He was addressing a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
“The SLFP will contest the forthcoming elections under the traditional ‘Hand’ symbol,” he said.
“Come under the shadow of the Hand symbol and let’s strengthen the SLFP so as to form a SLFP led government. Join the Hand symbol and join the blue colour to empower the SLFP,”he said.
Speaking about the recently held SLFP 65th Convention, Amaraweera said it was the largest ever convention held by a political party in the country.
He added it has been reported that the convention was attended by supporters from all parts of the country.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the SLFP was able to showcase its strength and political power at the recent Convention. Moreover, it was significant that Party leader President Maithripala Sirisena clearly mentioned that he would take up the responsibility of steering the party towards forming a SLFP- led government.
“President Sirisena pointed out a way-plan to prosperity and how the party will be driven forward while protecting its internal harmony and unity. With the success of the Convention, we were able to strengthen party unity,” he said.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Senevirathne noted that the recent Convention was definitely the biggest ever convention held by the SLFP since its founding. He refuted certain allegations levelled especially by Joint Opposition members that a large number of UNP activists participated in the SLFP Convention as the SLFP leaders were unable to bring their supporters to the Convention.
“That was an utter lie.No UNP supporters were seen at the Convention except UNP General Secretory Kabir Hashim,” he said.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said thet SLFP is not anybody’s personal property and it belongs to every SLFP supporter.
He added that Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa are not SLFPers.
“Gammanpila does not have any moral or ethical right to talk or comment on the SLFP. He does not have any connection with the SLFP. Actually, I feel sorry for him,” he said,
He further added that it is a great mistake if anyone thinks that the party can be defeated if one resigns from a post. The party cannot be defeated by resigning or criticising it.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama said the large crowds at the Convention is considered as a turning point for the SLFP.
He added that Gammanpila and Weerrawansa are now past their expiry date. They have nothing to market now other than levelling baseless allegations and slinging mud at the SLFP.
“The ‘shelf-life’of Gammanpila and Weerawansa is over and therefore they are expired now,” he said.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that Gammanpila is talking about the 65-year-old SLFP when his party has still not been born. Weerawansa’s party is born but is handicapped.
“They want to create problems within the SLFP aiming to achieve cheap political mileage. Weerawansa and Gammanpila are in Parliament today because of the SLFP.
Minister Perera added that there is no danger for small political parties which are with the SLFP eventhough the SLFP goes to elections under the Hand symbol.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissnayake said the party has now come under the leadership by the right person and therefore the party is now going in the right direction.
The SLFP is in government without losing its identity. He also invited Leftist parties to join with the SLFP.
