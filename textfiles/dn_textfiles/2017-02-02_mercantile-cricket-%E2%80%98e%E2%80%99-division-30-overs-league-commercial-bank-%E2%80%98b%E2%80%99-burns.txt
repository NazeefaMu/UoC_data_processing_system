Mercantile Cricket ‘E’ Division 30 Overs League: Commercial Bank ‘B’ burns Tobacco to ashes in opener

A blistering century by young stylish right hand batsman/wicket keeper Chamila Daminda (138* in 71 balls including 15 sixes and 4 fours ) saw Commercial Bank ‘B’ loading up 235 runs for six wickets in just 24 overs and beat Ceylon Tobacco by 115 runs, thus giving a winning start to the on-going Mercantile Cricket ‘E’ Division 30 Overs League tournament last weekend at Wesley grounds.
Due to heavy overnight downpour the play was restricted for 24 overs a side. Having invited to bat first in a slow pitch, Commercial Bank was greatly supported by Amal Kolinda and Chamila Daminda who put up a solid partnership of 74 runs for the 2nd wicket and Captain Dilshan Silva with Chamila in another good 78-run partnership for the 5th wicket.
Chasing a challenging target of 235 runs, Ceylon Tobacco batsmen could only managed to reach 120 sparing just a one wicket in their alloted 24 overs. Combank pace attack along with the spinners left no room for a single batsman to settle down.
Commercial Bank ‘B’ - 235/6 (Chamila Daminda 138 not out, Amal Kolinda 39, Dilshan Silva 21)
Ceylon Tobacco - 120/9 in (Indika Konara 2/17, Shantha Fonseka 2/17, Manjula Liyanage 2/18, Bojith Chamara, Tharindu Nirmala and Bhagya Abeysekara shared a wicket each)
