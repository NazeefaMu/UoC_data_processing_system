Case against H’tota Mayor, four others postponed

The case against Hambantota Mayor Eraj Fernando and four others for having intimidated five UNP MPs who were on a tour of the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport on April 17, 2014, was postponed to June 13, after recording evidence at the Hambantota High Court yesterday.
Hambantota High Court Judge Thamara Tennekoon was presiding over the case.
Evidence was recorded from UNP MPs Eran Wickremaratne, Ajith Mannapperuma and Nalin Bandara.
Wickremaratne informed court that if his security personnel and the media were not present, his life would have been in very serious danger.
Evidence from UNP MPs Ajith P Perera and R.Yogarajan had been recorded when the case was previously heard on March 26.
However, the court needs to further record evidence from 52 witnesses with regard to this case.
In addition, many media personnel were present when the incident took place but the evidence of only four have been recorded.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilip Peiris appeared on behalf of the Attorney General’s Department whilst President’s Counsel U.R.de Silva appeared on behalf of the accused.
“We have come here to give evidence about an attack that happened while we were on an inspection tour of the Magampura Port in 2014. People came and threatened us. After our complaint in 2014, it is in 2018 that the case has come before court. It has taken four years. If it takes four years for MPs like us, we can imagine the suffering the average man undergoes to have his case heard in court,” said MP Wickremaratne, speaking to the media after the case.
MP Bandara said he hoped that justice would be served to the MPs and media personnel who suffered by the attack in 2014.
