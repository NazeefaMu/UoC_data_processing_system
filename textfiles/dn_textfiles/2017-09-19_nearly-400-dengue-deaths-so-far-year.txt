Nearly 400 dengue deaths so far this year

A total of 390 dengue deaths and 151,975 dengue patients had been reported this year as at September 15.
About 68 percent of deaths are female dengue patients, the National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme Dr. Hasitha Tissera said.
The National Mosquito Control Week will take place island-wide from September 20 to 26.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said only 32 percent of the total dengue deaths are male patients.
“This is a new trend that should be studied. Out of the 390 dengue deaths, 197 had been reported from the Western Province. Over 50 percent of dengue deaths and patients had been reported from the Western Province,” he said.
According to Dr. Tissera, in 2016, there were 98 dengue deaths and in 2015 there were 56 dengue deaths reported from Sri Lanka. About 85 percent of dengue deaths are those above the age of 15. A fever patient does not need to seek hospital admission during the first six hours of fever.
However, pregnant mothers need to consult their doctor on the first day, conduct a blood test and seek hospital admission if recommended by the doctor.
A seven-day mosquito control programme will be implemented in 44 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in 14 districts while a four-day mosquito control programme will be implemented in 144 Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
September 24, Sunday, will be allocated for cleaning campaigns and selling discarded items. A total of 3,000 teams will be deployed to inspect premises and they will be in uniforms carrying their official identity cards.
Three to five days will be given to clean mosquito breeding sites after issuing red notices, he added.
