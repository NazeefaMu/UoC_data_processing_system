Stability of Markets: Beware of Volatilities and Asset Bubbles

Hard on the heels of present global currency depreciation tensions, the world financial markets confronted a turbulence during last week 3rd-11th. It started from the Wall Street, New York, and quickly spread across the world. Unlike normal market volatilities, this turmoil was sudden, disruptive and fast-spread. Some investors lost billions of their net worth overnight.
The Wall Street panic started on 3rd with a sudden rise in Treasuries yields waiting auctions of new Treasuries around US$ 230 bn during the week. By next day, it spread as a heavy stock market sell-off (inclusive of derivatives and other products) that led the world’s globalized markets to be turbulent and tumbling for 11 days, despite macro-prudential and monetary models in central banks available to tract such markets turmoil. The 11th was the worst day. The Chinese stock market fell four years-low. The stock sell-off caused nearly 6-9% fall of stock indices in major markets. The fall during last Thursday (11th) alone was more than 2%. Although markets showed some signs of stabilizing on Friday, tensions resumed on Monday (15th) with alerts for further turmoil.
Immediate Cause of the Turmoil
Financial turbulences invariably hit due to monetary policy decisions and confusing policy statements made in forward guidance models of central banks. Before the last global financial crisis 2007/09, the monetary policy in all central banks was a confidential activity where interest rates, reserve requirements, credit limits, etc., were communicated to banks in circulars. The general public neither required nor had access to details.
* Monetary Policy Forward Guidance
However, central banks in the west commenced informing the public of their policy targets, i.e., inflation and unemployment, to ensure the policy consistency and public support to recover from the recession caused by the financial crisis, despite monetary policies and regulations.
The US Fed announced targets of 2% inflation and 6% unemployment to drive its ultra-lose monetary policy and started publishing forecasts of key macroeconomic variables along with a press release and a press briefing after each policy decision to explain the policy rationale and performance as compared to pre-announced targets. As their languages have become highly technical to give different connotations (see press releases of the US Fed and other central banks) as central banks do not have adequate data on the present economy and future performances and shocks.
* Interest rates spillovers
Interest rate decisions of central banks immediately affect market interest rates, Treasuries yields and prices of assets/investments such as stocks, bonds and mortgages. Therefore, markets before and after central bank policy meetings drive enormous speculations to seek profits out of policy decisions by interpreting all communications of central banks diversely.
The present US Fed’s monetary tightening phase since December 2015 towards its normalization and neutral interest rates has been under constant speculations by markets world over along with Fed’s economic forecasts, current developments and experts’ comments. The Fed interprets neutral interest rates as rates that neither overheat nor restraint the economy. Immediately after the Fed’s latest rate hike (September 29, 2018) by 0.25% to 2.00-2.25%, the Fed Chairman Jeremey Powell made a comment as below at a forum on October 2, 2018.
“Interest rates are still accommodative. We are gradually moving to a place where they are neutral, but not that we are restraining the economy. We may go past the neutral, but we are a long away from the neutral at this point, probably.”
* Immediate Market Reactions
Above comment was not a model-based monetary policy forecast, but a blunt view of the Fed Chairman, similar to statements by Governors of other central banks. Up to this point, markets were speculating the Fed’s neutral rate to be around 3.5% at the end of 2019 at the current speed of rate hikes. Therefore, the comment became a surprise and markets started speculating of faster rate hikes beyond 3.5% as the Fed says the point of neutral rate is dependent on up-coming data and views of the FOMC.
Next day (last 3rd), financial media repeatedly displayed the Powell’s comment. Immediately, the Wall Street became turbulent with rising Treasury yields (benchmark 10 year-yield rose from 3.06% to 3.32%) when investors attempted to sell Treasuries to cut capital losses interim as securities prices would decline with rate hikes in anticipation to buy them back later when prices are lower. This is the bearish market behaviour. Next day (4th-Thursday), stock market confronted a sudden sell-off to buy Treasuries at lower prices pushing down yields (10 year to 3.12%). This is normal arbitrage activity in markets. However, such excessive arbitrage is quite rare.
Market analysts commented that the usual correlation between Treasury yields and stock market (changes in few basis points in Treasury yields generally go with few points changes in stock market indices) broke as stock indices involved in falls as high as 400 points a day (DJIA) as compared to few-basis-points-change in Treasury yields. In the sell-off, investors also re-profiled their portfolios of certain asset classes to suit new speculations.
* Views of Ben Bernanke and Mervyn King
Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote on two similar instances of market turbulence caused in April 2016 consequent to his statements, what he described as rookie mistakes, that caught him with heavy public criticism. He wrote that he learned an important lesson about the power his words carried in his public capacity.
Mervyn King, former Bank of England Governor and a veteran central banker, wrote “…To retain credibility, it is important that central banks do not claim to know more than they in fact do. And it is clear that central banks are not able to provide accurate forecasts of their own actions. Policy must confront the fact that ‘stuff happens’. Making forecasts is inherently difficult. They always turn out to be wrong. The most egregious example of wrong forecasts by central banks was the prediction before the crisis that the Great Stability would continue.” He concludes that central banks are using forecasting models that ignore the lessons learned in the past.
The present exchange rate forecasts of Sri Lankan central bank have failed as the currency tensions continue to prevail. Therefore, despite so-called macro-forecasting model-based policy decisions of central banks, markets suffer if they bet on or rely too much on central bank decisions and confusing communications as they are not angels to know more than markets do.
 
Immediate Public Response to Powell’s Comment
* Market Response
All market analysts started criticizing the Fed for its faster tightening phase of the policy cycle, initially expected to be 3 to 4 years as against the ultra-lose relaxing phase of nearly a decade of 2007-2016 at around zero interest rates. Markets in the world are now built on high US Dollar liquidity being the most popular global reserve currency. Therefore, the US monetary tightening so fast under the guise of unknown neutral interest rates has started causing immense disruptions to both the US economy and global economy. The IMF before its annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, 12th-14th last week, cut the global growth forecast for the year from 3.9 % to 3.7% and alerted that world trade tensions and tight monetary policies could fracture global value chain of trade and cause biggest risks to emerging market economies and there is not time for complacency as near-term financial turmoil risks have elevated.
* President Donald Trump
The president Trump who had been publicly critical since June 2018 on the Fed’s fast monetary tightening criticized again several times on 10th-11thas he became furious of sudden market sell-off where he boasted earlier of his new domestic economic policy for high market activity and strong economy. His critical remarks were “The Fed is too aggressive and far too stringent and it is making a big mistake…The Fed is going loco. There is no reason for them to do so. I am not happy about it. The economy is about to crash. I know the monetary policy more than the Fed, believe me. The central bank is out of control. I will not fire Powell...Blame the Fed for sell-off, don’t blame trade wars or China.” His economic team clarified that the Fed was independent and it could consider views of the President. The whole world has shown similar views on the Fed on the heels of prevailing currency turmoil that has caused world-wide economic disruptions. Views of the Fed and others are quite diverse on intellectual grounds as nobody has a universally accepted forecasting model or economic theory.
Central banks, if they do not listen to democratic views of public because of their money printing power and intellectual model-based dogma, can confront public protests in the event markets become turbulent causing bankruptcies and losses, despite the stability duties of central banks. Therefore, markets have to find own market mechanisms innovatively to protect their interests. The panic is not the solution.
Monetary Policy and Financial Turbulences
Modern monetary policies carried on through overnight interest rates and open market operations in the inter-bank markets follow cycles. Each cycle constitutes a tightening part followed by a relaxing part and vice versa. Durations of cycles are not identical and may vary from 5 to 15 years depending on the macroeconomic conditions of respective countries.
* Lose Monetary Part and Bubbles
On the relaxing part of the cycle, credit expansion, asset market boom and market value of wealth rise faster. Such wealth gets into credit collaterals for further lending where bank balance sheets and profit start booming. As a result, banks tend to lower their prudential credit standards in pursuit of sugar high profit while the regulators become complacent of improved performances of banks and the economy. Accordingly, an asset price bubble/boom fueled by a credit bubble develops where everybody lives on too much credit in all corners.
* Tight Monetary Part and Bursts
After few years of monetary relaxation, central banks suddenly wake up and start yelling at markets on too much credit expansion and potential risks to inflation in the unidentified medium to long term. They talk about the need to anchor inflation expectations of the public to be within their inflation targets, fixed or flexible, which they never have a track-record other than lengthy macroeconomic reports. Accordingly, they start tightening money by raising interest rates and lowering credit. Depending on its magnitude and speed, credit and asset bubbles start prinking. If the bubbles are too blown, they start bursting with asset prices tumbling.

At the beginning of the bubble-pricking, always-complacent markets and central banks state that it is a market correction although they never commented ex ante on over-growth of markets. The last week’s stock market sell-off, although markets commented as a correction, could be an early warning of an asset bubble already blown during the last ultra-lose monetary decade waiting to burst in the current phase of monetary tightening. Nobody could predict it until it hit.
No central bank monetary policy or macro-prudential models have ever predicted them. Frederick Mishkin, Columbia University Economics Professor and former Fed Governor, described the last global financial crisis as a kind of a burst of an asset bubble fueled by a credit bubble which required monetary policy intervention. Although he was in the Fed Board at that time, he also could not predict it.
The bursts or collapses of asset prices and credit lead to business bankruptcies and non-performing loans due to liquidity and credit crunch. Banks confront big holes in collateral values available to recover non-performing loans in rise. This raises bank vulnerabilities including bank runs. Meantime, non-banking financial institutions/shadow banks which normally operate in different degrees of regulatory arbitrages confront immediate vulnerabilities and runs, given the excessively risky nature of their businesses. Then, once the horse left, central banks start monetary relaxing to boost credit and economic recovery (Econ 101). By this time, central banks have new staff as the staff who did the monetary tightening earlier have left.
Therefore, banks, other financial institutions, businesses and public have to be mindful of live risks of monetary policy cycles on their sustainability if they bet too much on monetary policy decisions as central banks are not accountable in the event of crises. Central banks invariably blame the markets for crises. Governments can’t bailout markets and economy as they also live on credit and may even confront bankruptcies due to difficulties to service and roll-over debt, given the huge debt pile they are sitting on, whoever manages it.
Therefore, market participants need to beware of market volatilities frequently and follow a stable and moderate growth path (e.g., around annual 10%) of businesses with quality assets and capital to prevent build-ups of unhealthy risky assets and business bubbles and to ensure long-term sustainability.
