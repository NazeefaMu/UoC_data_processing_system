Ampara low-lying areas submerged

The Ampara district still records heavy rain falls. Its low-lying areas submerged now and hundreds of families undergo untold hardships.
Rains hit badly their Maha season paddy cultivation and destroyed tiny paddy plants.
Many roads are still under water and Kittanki causeway in Kalmunai-Navithanveli main road is water logged with two and half feet of water. A long line of vehicles were held up on either side of the Kittanki bridge to cross it.
People in the central camp, 13th colony, Navithanvely, Annamalai and in many other villages have to walk several kilo metres to reach the nearest town.
