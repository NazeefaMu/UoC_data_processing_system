AG’s Dept. fails to respond regarding 97 files - FCID

Sources within the Financial Crimes Investigations Department (FCID), report that 97 files sent to the Attorney General’s (AG) Department for advice on further action had not returned with a reply. As a result many officers many complain that they are wasting their time with nothing to do.
Officers remarked that if a response from the AG’s Department had been given, they would have been able to take all necessary legal action against those responsible.
The FCID has received over 500 complaints regarding large scale fraud and of that number, 300 are being investigated into.
Among these cases, the cases regarding the assets of certain individuals have been handed over to the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) or other relevant agencies.
CIABOC however has no authority to investigate cases regarding money laundering and thus these cases were sent to the FCID. These are among the files completed and handed over to the AG’s Department, it was learnt. The officers hoped that they would receive a reply regarding these files by at least early next year.
