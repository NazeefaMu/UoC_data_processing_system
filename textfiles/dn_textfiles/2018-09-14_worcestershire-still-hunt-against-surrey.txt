Worcestershire still  in hunt against Surrey

LONDON, Wednesday: Tom Fell hit his second half-century of the game to give Worcestershire a chance of victory over champions-in-waiting Surrey at New Road.
Fell’s 89 was his highest score of the summer, but superb bowling by Morne Morkel saw the home side subside from 181-4 to 203 all out in 13 overs.
It left the Division One leaders with a victory target of 272.
And they were 70-0 at stumps, with Rory Burns 33 not out, having made 122 in their first-innings total of 268.
Following Somerset’s two-day defeat by Hampshire, Burns’ side only need to avoid defeat to win the title for the first time since 2002 and 19th time in all - but they would like to do so in style by clinching a ninth successive Championship win.
Yorkshire require three more wickets on the final day of the Roses match to beat rivals Lancashire, who slipped to 109-7, chasing 230 at Headingley.
The game was finely poised at 81-3, but Jack Brooks bowled Liam Livingstone before two wickets in three balls from Ben Coad swung it in the hosts’ favour. Josh Bohannon and Keshav Maharaj will resume needing 121 more runs to win.
Gary Ballance (83) and Tom Kohler-Cadmore (63) earlier put on 148 to drag Yorkshire towards 272 all out.
Victory for Yorkshire would see them leapfrog Lancashire and move out of the relegation places.
Essex performed well with bat and ball to give them a chance of beating Nottinghamshire on the final day.
Notts captain Steven Mullaney hit his fourth half-century of the season to extend the hosts’ advantage. Simon Harmer took six wickets as Notts were bowled out for 337, leaving the visitors a target of 282 for victory.
After losing Nick Browne for 11 early on, Murali Vijay and Tom Westley put on a 130-run second-wicket stand to leave Essex needing 135 runs to win.
Sussex’s hopes of promotion from Division Two suffered a major setback as Durham beat them by 186 runs. Chasing 321 to win, Sussex started poorly, losing Philip Salt for a duck to Chris Rushworth in the first over.
And Rushworth claimed 4-49 for match figures of 12-100 as they fell well short of their target, with Tom Haines’ 40 the top score in their 135 all out. Earlier, Cameron Steel reached 160 before he was caught off Haines as Durham were bowled out for 340.
The result means that Sussex must win their home game against leaders Warwickshire next week if they are to have any chance of going up this season.
Warwickshire beat Leicestershire by an innings and 104 runs, while Kent are second and 21 points ahead of Sussex after their win over Middlesex at Lord’s.
