Roshen Silva leads fight back with 85

PALLEKELE, Thursday – Roshen Silva led Sri Lanka’s fight back in the second Test with a characteristic innings of 85 to give his team a crucial 46 runs lead on the first innings over England on a turning Pallekele International Stadium pitch.
Thanks to half-centuries from Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva and Roshen Silva who received excellent support from the tail Sri Lanka reached a total of 336 in reply to England’s 290. England survived one over before the close of the second day of the second Test to be nought for no loss and trail by 46 runs.
Silva was also involved in an unusual incident that resulted in England gaining five penalty runs (which was added to their first innings total) when he failed to ground his bat at the non-striker’s end and umpire Marais Erasmus of South Africa handed over five penalty runs, which could prove decisive in a close game.

Silva came to the wicket with Sri Lanka five down for 146 and was last man out for 336 holing out to mid-on after defying the England spinners for 217 minutes and 174 balls during which period he struck four fours and a six.
More importantly his presence in the middle blunted England’s three-prong spin attack as they managed to give back to England a taste of their own medicine when the last four Lankan wickets contributed a valuable 171 runs to the total.
Silva who was left out of the first Test but was included for the ongoing one because of the injury to captain Dinesh Chandimal made full use of the opportunity to cement his place for the rest of the series. Being a fine player of spin – he proved it with a match-saving of 74 not out against Indian spinners Ashwin and Jadeja on his Test debut at Delhi last year – Silva took on the England spinners with a lot of confidence the key to his success being able to rotate the strike often that forced the bowlers to change their line and length all the time against a left-hand/right-hand combination.
With Niroshan Dickwella (25), Dilruwan Perera (15), Akila Dananjaya (31) and stand-in skipper Suranga Lakmal (15 n.o.) he forged valuable partnerships of 46, 41, 56 and 28 respectively to frustrate England.
Prior to his arrival at the wicket, Sri Lanka had recovered from losing nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara as early as the third over to post a total of 127 largely through a 97-run liaison between Dimuth Karunaratne and Dhananjaya de Silva who both made fifties apiece.
The pair was motoring along the highway nicely with England getting desperate for a breakthrough when it was handed to them on a platter through a run out. Karunaratne responding to De Silva’s call was run out by a direct throw from point by Ben Stokes, one of the best fielders in the England side.
Karunaratne perished for 63 scored off 125 balls (4 fours) and nine runs later England had another wicket when Stokes was again in the act plucking a blinder of a catch at slip to send Kusal Mendis packing off for one.
England continued their advance into the Lankan batting after the lunch break when in the third over of the afternoon De Silva who had played fluently for 59 off 98 balls (6 fours) got an outside edge to a leg-break from Adil Rashid and was snapped up by wicket-keeper Ben Foakes.
The Foakes-Rashid combination also accounted for Angelo Mathews when he too perished playing a similar shot to be dismissed for 20. At 165-6 Sri Lanka were in danger of conceding a big first innings lead to England.
It was at this stage that Roshen Silva decided to display his batting talent and put an end to England’s push. His display with the bat has placed Sri Lanka in a strong position to go for a series-levelling win if they can reproduce their first innings bowling performance on a pitch that has increasingly become difficult for batsmen to survive.
