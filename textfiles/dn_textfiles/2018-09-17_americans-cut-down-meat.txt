Americans cut down on meat

The long, sizzling love affair between America and meat may finally be cooling off, a new report reveals.
Two thirds of Americans said that they have cut back the amount of meat they eat, according to the results of a newly-published Johns Hopkins survey. Public health officials and nutrition experts have been campaigning for people in the US to reduce their red and processed meat consumption for the last few years.
At long last, it seems the American public is starting to listen, for the sake of their hearts, waist lines and wallets. Second only to Australia, Americans have always eaten a lot of meat. But red and processed meats contain a lot of saturated fat, which turns into an oily waxy substance that can line and block off blood vessels.
This in turn raises the risks of diabetes and heart disease. Studies conducted through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest that eating one additional serving of unprocessed red meat a day raises the risks of death by any cause by 13 per cent. For unprocessed meat, it’s a 20 per cent increase in mortality risks.
But those alarming statistics - and warnings from major medical authorities like the American Heart Association (AHA) - have done little to curb meat consumption in the US.
When the housing bubble burst and the American economy entered a recession in 2008, meat consumption crashed too. Annual intake continued to decline, reaching a 20-year low in 2014.
But beef, pork and chicken are back, and meat is expected to be a bigger business than ever this year. Analysts estimate that the average American will eat a record-setting 222 lbs of meat over the course of this year.
‘Many Americans continue to have a strong preference for meat,’ says lead author of the new study, Dr Roni Neff. ‘But this survey adds to a growing body of evidence that a significant portion of the population may be purposefully reducing their meat consumption without becoming vegetarian or vegan. They should emphasize that meatless meals can be interesting and taste good, and could also provide resources like recipes with other options.’
