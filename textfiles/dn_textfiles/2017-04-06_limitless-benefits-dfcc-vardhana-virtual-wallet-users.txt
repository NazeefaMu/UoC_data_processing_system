Limitless benefits for DFCC Vardhana Virtual Wallet users

DFCC’s Vardhana Virtual Wallet (VVW) offers limitless benefits and DFCC Bank is proud to spearhead this unique digital innovation in the banking industry.
The VVW has now been extended to non-DFCC Bank customers as well, which means that more Sri Lankans can enjoy this cashless convenience. This app is the first of its kind in the country’s banking industry and encourages individual users and merchants to move away from the traditional use of physical cash.
The Avurudu season is a time for families to come together and celebrate the New Year while sharing gifts and unforgettable moments and DFCC Bank is pleased to announce exciting benefits for VVW users during the upcoming Avurudu season.
VVW users can receive money from overseas through DFCC’s Lanka Money Transfer service directly to the VVW from countries such as UAE, Qatar and South Korea in a hassle-free manner. These transfers take no more than 10 minutes to reach the VVW, making the process almost real-time.
Whether it is splitting a dinner bill between friends, contributing to shared household costs, or simply sending a gift this Avurudu season to loved ones, the VVW provides the convenience to send and receive money. The money gets transferred instantly between VVW’s without any fees been deducted.
