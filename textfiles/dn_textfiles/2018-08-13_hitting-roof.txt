Hitting the roof?

Every dog owner knows how much their beloved pets miss them when they’re gone, even if it’s just a quick walk to the post office. At the exact moment you return back, your buddy just bursts with joy, ready to celebrate your arrival.
But this six-year-old Vizsla Murray is not really an ordinary example. This dog has his own creative way to show how happy he is when his owner finally arrives home, and the internet is already loving it. Instead of wagging his tail and preparing for cuddles, Murray climbs to the highest point of his owner AJ Allee’s house to proudly greet him in a unique way.
“We didn’t realize it until neighbors came and rang our doorbell,” AJ Allee told Bored Panda.
“It was terrifying because we were afraid he would jump or fall. He moved so quickly on the roof and ran to the edge, then stopped.”
AJ Allee first tried to get on the patio and try to get Murray from there, then find how he got there and block the entrance to prevent it from happening again.
“That lasted three days,” says AJ Allee.
“He found another place so we accepted it. Then it became funny.”
AJ Allee says that Murray always goes up to talk to anyone who is walking their dog in the neighborhood or driving by their house.
“Then they would come to our door and tell us about it, we have to act shocked,” laughs AJ Allee. The Sun
