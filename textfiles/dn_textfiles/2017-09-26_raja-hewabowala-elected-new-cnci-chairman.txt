Raja Hewabowala who was holding office of the Deputy Chairman was elected Chairman, CNCI at the AGM.Hewabowala graduated in rubber and polymer chemistry at the University of Moratuwa. After completing his studies, he joined a paint company as an employee from where he acquired the practical experience in paints and coatings industry. Later, he firmly decided to achieve his future aspirations with great confidence, hard work and dedication.

Hewabowala is also the Managing Director of Can-tec Printing & Packing (Pvt) Ltd, Speciality Construction Chemicals (Pvt) Ltd and Resin & Polymer Technologies (Pvt) Ltd.
On election as the Chairman of the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries, the pioneering chamber for industries in the country, Hewabowala said that being a national Chamber, CNCI was responsible for representing the industrial sector and must take all possible measures to protect the local industries, encourage them and assist them in developing their businesses.
In this arena, the CNCI plays a number of significant roles: as a facilitator, as a mediator and as a consultant among many others. In today’s business scenario, our industrialists face not only the challenges of the competition, but also various other external threats which are beyond the control of the respective businesses. At the same time, they have important obligations related to society and the environment. He further mentioned that the Sri Lankan industry had to face many negative experiences, due to various reasons in the immediate past. The 30 year war was a major drawback. Now with a peaceful atmosphere, a conducive backdrop has been created for industries. The government is focused on developing the private sector in the country.
"With such a supportive environment and current business trends, I feel that innovation and high technology should be the strategic themes of today’s industry. We currently witness friendly foreign policies and the gaining of GSP Plus facilities and the government’s encouraging of Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) have become opportunities for the local industrialists, especially for emerging businesses," he said.
Hewabowala lastly highlighted that as an estimable national Chamber in the country, their real effort is to establish ethical business patterns and practices while facilitating a beneficial environment for all Sri Lankan industries.
