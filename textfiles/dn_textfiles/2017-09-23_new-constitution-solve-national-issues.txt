New Constitution to solve national issues

All those interested in resolving the national problem accept that a major step was taken by the Yahapalanaya when interim report of the steering committee set up under the Constitutional Assembly was presented by its Chairman Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressing that Sri Lanka should remain one undivided and indivisible country where maximum devolution should be granted. PM explained that it states, there shall be specific provisions included in the Constitution to prevent secession.
The report has proposed provincial councils would be the primary unit of devolution while local bodies have been named as the implementing agency of both the central government and the provincial councils. Under the heading ‘Division of Powers between the several tiers of government to be clear and unambiguous’ the report states; there is general consensus, including among the Chief Ministers who made submissions before the Steering Committee, that powers must be clearly and unambiguously divided. Previous week masses were happy about the implementation of the Office of Missing Persons Act.
Democratic institutions
The independent OMP is expected to inquire into petitions relating to thousands of people who disappeared and give these families at least the consolation of knowing what has happened or not happened to their loved ones. Though it does not include prosecution and punishment for the war time criminals, getting the truth out is a major consolation. One can hope, within the coming months or years, masses will see effective checks and balances among the four main democratic institutions -- the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media. But as the Dharma yuddaya for democracy is starting from the side of the needy, shaking the corrupt bigoted rich people, the past fascistic rulers start their counter strategy. Certainly villains will get defeated; however to reach that vision of democracy, the downtrodden have a long way to go.
Son of Philip entered the Dharma yuddaya when he declared that their proposals included to repeal the executive powers of the President to some extent while to appoint a President elected by the votes of all the communities to uphold the position of unitary state of the country.
Unfortunately same position was declared by Nimal Siripala de Silva. “NGOs do not represent the people. The steering committee therefore should focus on the citizens of the country and consider their ideas as well,” Dinesh Gunawardena said while highlighting that the constitutional steering committee interim report only highlighted ideas of a small group. Further, he said the Joint Opposition would not allow anyone to change the status guaranteed for Buddhism in the present Constitution. In the streets they were helped by the healthcare and education services countrywide strike action. Though they claim it is not connected to this national debate, coincidence is obvious.
“Parliament should not be allowed to reverse the victories which were accomplished by uniting the country after defeating terrorism”, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said speaking at the launch of ELIYA Forum in Colombo recently. He explained that people fear, the accomplished victories would be scraped by bringing in a new Constitution. “This is why experts coming from different fields decided to create the Eliya to enlighten the public about the new Constitution. We want to inform the people that the new Constitution should not be brought in,” he said.
We must be grateful to this fascistic leader for coming out openly challenging democracy that has grown in the Lankan soil in recent history. He candidly admitted that there were shortcomings in the current Constitution but said the motives behind the introduction of a new Constitution were dreadful! Of course it is dreadful for the fascistic gang of Mahinda and Gotabhaya. Then he came out with the stinking lies and filthy distortions they used to throw at militants of democracy. “The same groups which collected funds for the LTTE and supplied weapons to them are today attempting to achieve what they could not accomplish from terrorism. The new Constitution is a necessity of separatist Tamil politicians and international organisations which attempted to hinder the war against the LTTE,” he said.
False propaganda
However according to war leader Field marshal Fonseka, the fascistic gang, which was a small group of Gotabhaya, who with cruelty and hate committed heinous crimes was the greatest obstacle to the regular war conducted by him and other non criminal soldiers and officers in all four forces. Gota has said that they have no faith in the government which is attempting to introduce the new Constitution. We saw how the government assured army leaders that the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) would not be set up. However, it was established later on. The government always said it would protect war heroes but today a large number of soldiers had been imprisoned, Rajapaksa charged.
What rubbish! Of course there were those in the government ranks that got carried away by the false propaganda of fascistic gang but democracy relentlessly fought back and radicals were able to come with democratic proposals for the constitution and for the election process. Having got defeated in the discussions within the constituent assembly; now they want to confront with strikes, demonstrations, backed by violence and terror. Eliya consist of Ven. (Prof.) Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera, Rev. Fr. Wimal Thirimanna, Dr. Dayan Jayathilaka, Sarath Weerasekara, Thamara Kunanayagam, Manohara de Silva PC, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Rushdie Habeeb and Dr. Seetha Arambepola who addressed the forum. Then there were few Members of clergy, a number of politicians, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, few artistes, academics and professionals attended the event. Apparently they wanted to remove the Yahapalanaya by a group of Honorable Trustees of the people appointed to govern the country as trustees for a limited period! They claim the set up today amounts to Executive and Parliamentary dictatorship. Simple, remove both parliament and president and appoint honourable trustees!
Masses that supported Yahapalanaya expected, in order to implement the promised programme, the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) without attempting to undermine each other should collaborate at least few years. They should be mindful of the potential of so called third force of fascistic Mahinda group.
Fortunately JVP has opted for a position hostile to the fascistic camp where as frontline breakaway group is becoming the militant red coloured tail of the fascistic force. They claim the democratic demands of the Tamil speaking people are tied to the American and Indian imperialism. They take the private medical college SAITM as an imperialist project to take over Lanka! They say they are independent but there attacks, strikes road blocks, Hartal have been essential components of the struggle of Mahinda to takeover the country. However apart from SAITM campaign led by medics others have avoided confrontation avoiding mixing with fascistic politics. Bigger problem today is unfortunately internal; while a section of the government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe strongly support the main document of the proposed new constitution which will transfer the Executive Powers to the parliament and the office of the prime minister after 2020.
Executive Powers
SLFP group wants the office of the president to retain the Executive Powers. Latter say that before an overhaul of the constitution is made, the people want the government to deliver on the many other promises they made.
They argue that government should stop itself getting entangled in ‘sillara’ politics or ‘retail politics’ from now on and focus on a few big wins, where high-profile scandals are investigated fully and offenders are brought to justice and judged according to the law of the land. However masses are less interested in robbery and corruption than brutal murders and racist violence against innocent people especially children.
Those who oppose democratic constitution and prepare for a struggle will be the biggest enmity of the people.
