Moragahakanda Mahaweli Development Project: An answer to many a prayer

We live on a parched planet. Despite being an island surrounded on all sides by water, our water woes are far from over. For those farmers living in the Vanni, raiding what’s left of groundwater, or to those in the North Central Province without drinking water, every drop counts. As policymakers fret over empty tanks, dry lakes and thirsty towns, a new structure is silently taking shape.
It is the last and biggest reservoir of the multipurpose Mahaweli Project; the massive Moragahakanda Mahaweli Development Project will be four times the size of the Parakrama Samudraya and is expected to be the answer to many prayers. The project once completed will irrigate parched dry lands in faraway Vanni in the Northern Province on one side, and Rajarata, Wayamba, and the Central and Eastern Provinces, on the other.
Sticking to deadline
Public Relations officer G.G. Dayananda who spoke to the Daily News has lost count of just how many cities or acres of lands would benefit from the project. At this point, keeping track of the numbers is not what makes him or the residents restless; it is how many days away they are from the big opening day.
“The people from the Central and North Central Provinces still grapple with water woes; the lack of irrigation has turned paddy fields into parched, barren lands,” he said, his face forlorn.
“People have been asking for this project, wanting it to see the light of day. There will be four irrigation systems; 24 villages nearby bordering the Kalu Ganga Reservoir and nearly 3,000 families along the Kalu Ganga river valley would directly benefit from this. Sixteen tanks have been constructed; now this structure has to take shape.”
He explained that when water was released from all these reservoirs, it could be used for cultivation during both the Yala and Maha seasons. “There wasn’t sufficient water in the Kaudulla, Giritale, Minneriya and Kantale Reservoirs. But today the reservoirs are filling up.”
Detailing the water channels, he added that the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga projects would provide water for 2,000 large and small tanks in the North Central Province, 303 tanks in the North Eastern and Eastern Provinces and 1,600 tanks in the North Western Province. In addition, 48 new tanks in Laggala and Medirigiriya villages are to be built.”
Filling up the tanks
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer Asela Udayanga added that the Parakrama Samudraya’s water capacity was 116,000 acre feet. Currently, water is released for cultivation during the Maha season. “The farmers have requested us to give another month’s worth of supply this month,” he says. “Now we can readily and willingly do so.”
“Through this development project, the government has saved Rs. 10,000 million.
The project will irrigate 94,500 hectares of lands for cultivation during the Yala and Maha Seasons to enhance the rural economy.”
Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir will be primarily used to support agricultural needs in the area and will give economic benefits to 1.5 million families as well as supply clean drinking water around the area.
The Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Reservoirs will also be able to supply water for the Ihala Alahara project which in turn will irrigate nearly 82,000 hectares of lands and the North-West Alahara project.
Earlier this year, President Maithripala Sirisena unveiled the commemorative plaque at the Moragahakanda Irrigation Project. The project was officially handed over to the government of Sri Lanka by Sinohydro China Construction Company.
The water capacity of the Moragahakanda Reservoir stands at about 460,000 acre feet and today the water limit is at a depth of 330,000 acre feet, said Director of the Kalu Ganga Project D.B. Wijayarathne. The Kalu Ganga dam construction will be completed this year and thereafter, the next step would be to provide water supply to the Anuradhapura townships in 2021, he added.
The third phase would be to supply water to Iranamadu. The total project cost is Rs. 18,100 million. However, the economic benefits include the inclusion of 25 megawatts of electricity to the national grid and the provision of irrigation water to 87,000 farmers in the Matale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts.
Head of the Minneriya Irrigation Department Engineer Anjana Abeysinghe explained that many parts of Polonnaruwa had experienced flash floods in recent times. However, with the completion of the Moragahakanda Reservoir, we have been able to save and store that water.
Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir could be provided to the Giritale, Kaudulla, Minneriya and Kantale tanks.
“Twenty-thousand acres of land is being cultivated and a 40 km road is being constructed from Medirigiriya to Kantale under this project. A 200-acre industrial zone will also be constructed and 3,000 families will be resettled near the Laggala Reservoir in Laggala.
Sixteen new water tanks will be developed for agriculture. Two additional cities will be developed and 400 industrial cities will be built in the Laggala area,” he said.
“The annual rainfall that will feed the Moragahakanda Reservoir is 818 million cubic metres. This project will also help minimise the occurrence of floods in the Manampitiya and Somawathiya areas and has direct economic value for thousands of farmer families in three provinces.”
