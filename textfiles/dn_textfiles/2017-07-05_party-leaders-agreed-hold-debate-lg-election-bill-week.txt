Party leaders agreed to hold debate on LG Election Bill this week

Political party leaders agreed to hold a debate on the Local Government Election Bill within this week.
They arrived at this decision at the party leaders' meeting yesterday.
The agreement was reached following Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena demanded to hold a debate on the amendment within this week to hold the Local Government election soon. He made this demand during a debate following his special statement made under the standing order 23 (2).
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said although MP Gunawardena demanded to hold a debate on the Local Government Election Bill, he did not make the demand at the party leaders' meeting.
Minister Kiriella said he had no objection to discuss the matter at the next Party Leaders' meeting to hold the debate within this week.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya too observed that that matter had to be discussed at the party leader's meeting and action should be taken in accordance with its decision.
Responding to MP Gunawardena's statement, Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said he had taken every effort to expedite the measures to hold the Local Government election within his capacity. It was up to the House to pass the amendment to the Bill to hold the election, he said.
MP Gunawardena said the debate on the Local Government Amendment Bill had not been brought into the agenda of this week.
"Although you demand to hold the debate on the Local Government Election Bill here, you did not make the same request at the party leaders' meeting," Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
"We have no objection to discuss the matter at the next party leaders' meeting," he said.
When the JO Parliamentary Group Leader stated that Minister Mustapha had postponed the Local Government election by way of a gazette notification, Minister Mustahpa said the Extra Ordinary Gazette on Friday postponed the operation of Local Government bodies to a further period of three months.
He assured that if the Local Government election would be held before October 1, he would bring the date in the gazette to an early date by way of another gazette notification.
