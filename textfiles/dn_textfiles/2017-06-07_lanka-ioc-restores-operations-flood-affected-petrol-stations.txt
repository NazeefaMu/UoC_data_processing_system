Lanka IOC restores operations at flood affected petrol stations

The recent flash rains which caused devastating floods and landslides to many parts of Sabaragamuwa and Southern province, also damaged many Petrol Stations of Lanka IOC.
Many of these retail outlets were submerged with water causing a huge damage to costly machines installed at these sheds.
Lanka IOC acting as a responsible corporate citizen gave priority to restoration of the petrol stations irrespective of cost involved which will run into several millions. Restoration of auto fuels availability is the first priority after a natural disaster.
Once water levels receded and it was possible to work in the flood affected areas, several teams of Lanka IOC began working day and night and within 48 hours restored sales of petrol and diesel at the flood affected petrol stations.
LIOC teams are still working in flood affected areas and are committed to restore all affected retail outlets at the earliest.
Lanka IOC is also thankful to government officials who extended their full support at this difficult hour. Lanka IOC also contributed LKR 5 million to Disaster Relief Fund, GoSL for relief measures in the wake of devastating floods.
Lanka IOC is also organizing medical camps for people in the flood affected areas where medicine and spectacles will be provided. A first such medical camp was organized at Akuressa from June 6 onwards.
