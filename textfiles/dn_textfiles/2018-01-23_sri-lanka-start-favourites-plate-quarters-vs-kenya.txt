Sri Lanka start as  favourites in Plate  quarters vs Kenya

Sri Lanka have entered the Plate tournament after finishing third in Group D behind Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their opponents will be a Kenyan side who are winless after the group stage. The teams will face off at Lincoln No.3 on Tuesday 23 January.
Sri Lanka started with a good win against Ireland before defeats to Pakistan and Afghanistan ended their hopes of qualifying for the Super League. However, they were competitive in those losses and had their chances to win both games. They will feel confident of getting back to winning ways against the Kenyans.
Kenya has struggled so far in the tournament. They managed to keep wickets intact in their first two matches but they didn’t find run-scoring easy, succumbing to a 169-run defeat to South Africa and 243-run loss to New Zealand. They haven’t managed to score their runs at a rate of more than four an over in their three matches to date, and in their final group game they were bowled out for 96 by West Indies.
The best Sri Lanka have ever fared at the ICC U19 CWC was in 2000, when they lost to India in the final in Colombo. Thereafter, they have reached the semi-finals in 2010 and 2016. Between 1998 and 2018, Kenya have played 19 matches at the ICC U19 CWC, winning five and losing 14. They have a win/lose ratio of 0.357. These two teams have never met in the ICC U19 CWC before this match.
