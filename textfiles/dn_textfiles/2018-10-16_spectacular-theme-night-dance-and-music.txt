Spectacular theme night of dance and music

A hundred years ago there lived and worked a remarkable woman named Marion de Forest who had a dream. She was an American playwright and journalist from Buffalo, New York. She believed that women all over the world needed a voice, champions to protect their rights, their freedoms. And she attracted a group of Pioneer supporters, with whose help the Zonta International movement was born.
Today there are some 30,000 Zonta women in 63 countries around the world, with some 200 of them in five Zonta Clubs in Sri Lanka. And if there’s one thing that all Zonta women have in common - it’s passion. They possess passion for their beliefs, their amazing projects, and inevitably also for their fund raisers!
Zonta Club 11 of Colombo have put together a ‘Mamma Mia Theme Party’ as a fund raiser for their most significant project. Held on October 23, this party will feature the awesome Abba music of the well-loved musical ‘Mamma Mia’. There will be vibrant rhythms for exuberant dancing, great food, themed cocktails and intriguing surprises. It will truly be a party to be hugely enjoyed and remembered. The Zontians hope for enthusiastic support from fun loving ladies and their male friends. The funds are in aid of the Mithuru Piyasa Councelling Centers. Zonta Club 11 also welcomes e banners for display at the event. Any voluntary donations will be accepted.
