365  days of miniature paper  birds

India-based artists Nayan Shrimali and Vaishali Chudasama create tiny bird illustrations out of hand-cut paper. The incredible paper sparrows, doves, owls, and more are all part of an going paper art project titled ‘365 Days of Miniature’.
For this self-appointed creative challenge, the creative duo have set themselves the ambitious goal of creating one mini paper bird every day for an entire year.
To create each feathery friend, Shrimali and Chudasama hand-cut various layers from watercolor paper before assembling them into the final “2.5 dimensional look.” Taking around 4 to 6 hours to finish, each piece is then hand-painted with lifelike colours and intricate details.
Their portfolio of miniatures include exotic, vibrant birds such as a parrot and a pink Roseate Spoonbill, as well as common woodland birds such as a Barn Swallow and a Gold Finch. They’ve even created a series of adorable, extra-tiny chicks!
The artists say, “We enjoyed each bird everyday and learned a lot about birds and their nature while making them.” Each paper bird is photographed either perching on a twig, walking in sand, or held up to look as if they’re swooping through the air - just as if they were really living in the wild.
Keep up to date with Shrimali and Chudasama’s daily paper bird creations on Instagram, where the artists post interesting facts about each bird alongside their illustrations.
