Railway unions launch 12 noon strike

 
The railway trade unions decided to launch the strike at 12 noon today, as announced.
The strike which was announced to be launched midnight yesterday in protest of salary anomalies was postponed to 12 noon today in compliance to the request made by the Committee appointed by the government.
However the unions launched the strike alleging the government to have not provided adequate solutions.
