9-hour water cut at Kotte, Colombo 5 tomorrow

 
The water supply to Kotte and Colombo 5 will be disrupted for nine hours tomorrow from 9 a.m. due to essential maintenance work, the Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) said.
Apart from those areas, water to Maharagama, Borelesgamuwa and Colombo 4, 6, 7, 8 will be supplied under low pressure.
The WSDB urged the public to store adequate amounts of water prior to the water-cut to avoid any inconveniences.
