Worcs beat Sussex to lift Twenty20 Blast trophy

LONDON, SaturdayL: Worcestershire won the Twenty20 Blast for the first time as they beat Sussex at Edgbaston by five wickets in the final played at Edgbaston on Saturday.
On their first appearance at Finals Day, Moeen Ali’s side chased a target of 158 with nine balls to spare.
Just as in their semi-final win over Lancashire earlier in the day, Worcestershire owed most to captain Moeen and wicketkeeper Ben Cox.
Moeen took 3-30 in Sussex’s 157-6 before hitting 41, while Cox saw them home on 158-5 with 46 not out.
Although sadly watched by a mere 500 Worcs supporters after problems with ticket allocations to the four semi-finalists, it was still a memorable day out in Birmingham.
Cox’s match-winning innings followed to his earlier 55 not out off 34 balls against Lancashire, and his winning hit for four over square leg off Jofra Archer triggered wild scenes among their small band of followers as Worcestershire celebrated their first trophy since 1994.
