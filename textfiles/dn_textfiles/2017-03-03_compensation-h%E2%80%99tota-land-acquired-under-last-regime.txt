Compensation for H’tota land acquired under last regime

Compensation will be promptly paid for the lands acquired for the Hambantota Port Development Project during the last regime, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga said.
According to him measures have already been taken to compensate people who lost their lands due to the Hambantota Port Development Project, in the next few days.
Minister Ranathunga stressed that land owners suffered a lot over the years as the former government did not compensate them. “It has been obesrved that most of the families of these land owners do not have a proper shelter since they lost not only the lands, but their houses too.
Accordingly, the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion as compensations to the community, whose lands were taken over for the Hambantota Port Development Project. Minister Ranathunga who advised ministry officials to expedite the compensation scheme, said that these funds should be handled with transparency without letting any room for injustice.
“The government’s primary objective is to pay a fair amount of compensation to these people based on the valuation of the property. Furthermore, all possible steps will be taken to enhance the living conditions of the entrepreneurs, who lost their lands and businesses due to the port development project” the Minister added.
The First two stages of the Hambantota Port project has already been completed on a land area of 1,115 hectares. Most of this land extent acquired from the project were private lands.
“Through the funds allocated by the Treasury, we have paid compensation in respect of 237 lands which were assigned to Hambantota Port development project by considering the valuation of the land area,” the minister said. “Under the compensation scheme, 75 per cent of the estimated value was paid for another 129 lands at a cost of Rs.892,532,701 allocated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). The balance will be paid to these land owners in the near future,” he said.
“In addition, we will develop the road network to access these lands and provide free water and electricity to these lands, which were given by us. These tasks will be carried out with Treasury funds. A majority who lost their lands due to project are poor people,” Minister Ranathunga added.
