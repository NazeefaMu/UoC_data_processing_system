Soundarie stars : In SOSL Christmas Concert

On December 12 Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" performed by Soundarie David Rodrigo, will be the highlight of the Symphony Orchestra Sri Lanka's Christmas Concert.
One of the most popular works in the entire repertoire, this piece full of catchy tunes and jazz rhythms demands tremendous technique and flair, skills that Soundarie has in abundance.
Soundarie completed her musical career at the prestigious Royal College of Music in London, after having left school, where she was conferred with the award, Associate of the Royal College of Music, in piano performance and piano accompaniment. A soloist who has performed both locally and internationally, Soundarie has in recent times appeared regularly with well known pianist Ramya de Livera Perera on selected repertoire for two pianos. Soundarie also enjoys collaborating with various singers and instrumentalists for recitals.
The SOSL will be directed by Dushy Perera, whose artistic guidance and enthusiasm for music infuses energy and passion into a receptive orchestra. Her recent success at the Music from the Movies concert series has brought her recognition as a skillful and inspiring Music Director. Under Dushy's baton the SOSL will perform a program of festive favourites, light classics and Latin Gold!
The Mary Anne David Chorale will sing their signature piece, the "Hallelujah Chorus" as well as "O Holy Night" and other much loved Christmas songs and carols. Directed by Mary Anne David, one of Sri Lanka's foremost choral directors, this chorale consists of well - known and experienced choral singers. The Chorale will also lead the audience in a rousing sing-along of both traditional and contemporary Christmas fare guaranteed to swing the audience into the Christmas spirit!
Join other Christmas revellers at the Ladies College Hall, which will resound to the sounds of the SOSL and the Mary Anne David Chorale, as they bring you a programme of sparkling Christmas cheer.
