Deferment of Amendments to VAT and NBT

The amendments proposed to Value Added Tax (VAT) and Nation Building Tax (NBT) in the Budget 2016 should not be implemented until the relevant legislative enactments are passed in the Parliament, a statement issued by the Finance Ministry said.
However, considering the cost of living impact, restriction on the exempt supplies applicable on wholesale and retail trade (deemed VAT) is removed with effect from 01.01.2016.
Further, vehicle importers who have imported motor vehicles for personal use on LCs opened before Budget 2016 are permitted to be cleared from the Customs by paying the duties under the rate prevailed at 20.11.2015, without paying any demurrages, the release added.
