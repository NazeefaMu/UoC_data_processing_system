No finality on increasing MPs' allowances: Gayantha

 
No discussion was held at the House Committee to increase the salaries of parliamentarians except to revise the allowances, being paid to them, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
However, certain elements were leveling baseless allegations that the discussion was based on a salary hike for parliamentarians.
All parties represented in Parliament were at the discussion, but no objection was raised by any party. However, no final decision has been taken to increase the allowances of parliamentarians.
Minister Karunathilaka added that allowances of parliamentarians have not been increased for nine years as the final allowance hike was made in 2007. "This is the very reason to increase the allowances of Parliamentarian. The present allowance paid for maintaining an office is not sufficient" he said. The Minister stressed that no final decision was taken on the increase of allowance and the proposal will be subjected to further discussions.However, if a decision is taken to increase the allowances, only the suitable persons will be entitled to receive it. He further added that a form should be filled to claim the increased allowances by parliamentarians.
Then both the public and journalists,who are keen on this, can be made aware who are eligible and who are not not(to get the increased allowances).
