Full face helmet: Interim Order extended till July 13

The Court of Appeal yesterday extended the interim order staying the operation of the police circular banning the use of face-covered helmets until July 13.
A Senior State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the authorities are yet to formulate new regulations, allowing to use full face helmets.
He further informed Court that the respondents are expecting to file objections against the petition on the next mention date. Court of Appeal Justice (President) Vijith K. Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah fixed the petition for mention on July 12. The Court had issued the interim order sequence to three writ petitions filed by a Chartered Accountant, a Retired Army Major, and an Attorney-at-Law who sought an order prohibiting the authorities from taking any action on banning such helmets.
Petitioner Rtd. Major Nalaka Indrajith, Chanaka Dassanayake, and Attorney-at-Law Edward Ahangama had sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the gazette notification No. 644/20 dated 11/1/1991.
In the petitions, the Police Chief, the Public Order Minister, the Internal Transport Minister, and the Attorney General were named as respondents. Counsels Iresh Seneviratne, Pulasthi Rupasinghe, Thishya Weragoda, and Niluka Dissanayake appeared for the petitioners.
