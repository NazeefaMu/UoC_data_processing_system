No action should be taken against war heroes – SP Governor

No legal action should be taken against any war heroes for whatsoever alleged crime committed during war-time, Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera, PC said at the Southern Province Ranaviru Commemoration 2018.
The event was held yesterday at the Ranviru Monument in Galle city under his patronage.
War-time is not a normal time. War is inhumane and it is a struggle between life and death. During war-time the law falls silent, the Governor said.
“We hold this commemoration to remember the sacrifices made by our valiant service personnel of the Sri Lanka defence forces to annihilate the ruthless LTTE to save our motherland. Hence if any crime has been reportedly committed by our war heroes during operations, they should be pardoned.”
“There are many unjust allegations against the valiant members of our defence forces supposedly committed during the last phase of the war in 2009. They are quite baseless and untrue. Many civilians were rescued at the hands of our soldiers. Even the father and mother of Prabhakaran were saved by our war heroes,” the Governor observed
“No country has initiated legal action against any combatant for any reported crime during wartime or in action.”
“During World War II, the two Japanese cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki - were completely destroyed and thousands of people died. No one took legal action against the perpetrators of such criminal acts. So I am against any legal action taken against our war heroes.”
Southern Province Chief Minister said no member of the defence forces has been legally charged for any act done during the war.
Ranviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka also spoke.
