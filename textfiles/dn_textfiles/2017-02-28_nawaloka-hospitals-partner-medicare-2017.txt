Nawaloka Hospitals will be the Official Surgical Care Partner and Official Cardiac Care Partner for ‘Medicare 2017' – National Healthcare Exhibition which will be held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Hall in Colombo from March 3 to 5.
Nawaloka Hospitals have been a lifelong partner of the exhibition, which is being held for the eighth occasion.
There will be plenty of free services available at the Nawaloka Hospitals stalls for visitors on the exhibition days, highlighting Nawaloka Hospitals' bond with Sri Lanka's only healthcare exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine in collaboration with specialist medical associations.
With a proud history of more than three decades, Nawaloka Hospitals' entry into the country's medical and healthcare sector made vast strides from 1985.
It also saw the private health care system take root in Sri Lanka. The launch of the hospital and the overwhelming response it received from the people demonstrated a long felt need for superior healthcare in a pleasant environment.
Nawaloka was set up to mirror reputed hospitals in the region which offered advanced medical technology and expert medical care, thus eliminating the need for people to travel out of Sri Lanka for specialized medical treatment.
Providing access to the State-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment technologies is a hallmark of Nawaloka Hospital. Driven by the “Vision to be the Hospital of Tomorrow” Nawaloka Hospitals give precedence to superior care, accuracy and excellence in services.
By teaming up with the Medicare 2017, Nawaloka Hospitals have once again assured its intentions in providing a world class service in Sri Lanka.
