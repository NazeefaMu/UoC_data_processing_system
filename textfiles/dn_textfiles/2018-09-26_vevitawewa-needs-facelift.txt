Vevitawewa needs facelift

Vevitawewa in Bandaragama requires an immediate renovations, residents in the area say.
They say the tank has been neglected for a long period and is in a dilapidated stage. Human activities too have contributed immensely for the plight.
The villagers said that when the Kesbewa, Kaluthara road was widened a few years ago, the contractors diverted the rodd drainage to the tank and sediments flow into the tank reducing its capacity. One side of the tank is grown with wood.
A villager Gamini Silva said people coming in vehicles throw their garbage into the tank causing an environmental hazard.
Another villager Samith Jayage said some drink alcohol in the surrounding area of the tank. What they do under influence of liquor affect the beauty of the tank. “Some throw plastic, polythene they bring in the catchment area while some dash the glass bottles on stones,” she said.
