NPC asks for report from IGP

The National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday called for a special report from Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara over the manner the police dealt with the anti-SAITM protestors, who invaded the Health ministry last week.
NPC Secretary Ariyadasa Coorey said the Commission expects a detailed report from the IGP over the matter as soon as possible. The InterUniversity Student Federation (IUSF), protesting against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), forcefully entered the Ministry and kept it under their control until a Special Task Force team removed the students.
Around 90 students were injured and hospitalised during the attempt to remove the students.
