Cinnamon Life presents musical Mamma Mia first in South Asia

London’s West end stage play will go on sale July 25 at cinnamonboxoffice.com
The sensational feel-good musical MAMMA MIA will come to the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre for an eight-day run from December 22-30 as part of the international tour.
MAMMA MIA is Judy Craymer’s ingenious vision of staging the story-telling magic of ABBA’s timeless songs with an enchanting tale of family and friendship unfolding on a Greek island
paradise. To date, it has been seen by more than 60 million people in 50 productions in 16 different languages. When it was released in 2008, MAMMA MIA the Movie became the highest grossing live action musical film of all time. A second film, MAMMA MIA Here We Go Again had its’ global release July 2018.
From West End to global phenomenon, the London production of MAMMA MIA has now been seen by more than 10% of the entire UK population. It is one of only five musicals to have run for more
than 10 years both on Broadway and in the West End, and in 2011, it became the first Western musical ever to be staged in Mandarin in the People’s Republic of China.
The hugely successful International Tour, since premiering in Dublin in September 2004, has visited 85 cities across 38 countries and sold over 5 million tickets.
With music and lyrics by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, MAMMA MIA! is written by Catherine Johnson, directed by Phyllida Lloyd and choreographed by Anthony Van Laast. The production is designed by Mark Thompson, with lighting design by Howard Harrison, sound design by Andrew Bruce & Bobby Aitken, and musical supervision, additional material and arrangements by Martin Koch.
The worldwide smash hit musical MAMMA MIA is presented by Cinnamon Life, an integrated development by Sri Lanka’s premier listed conglomerate, the John Keells Group.
Roshanie Jayasundera-Moraes, Executive Vice President/Chief Marketing Officer of the Property Group at JKH stated, “This well-loved musical has touched the hearts of millions across the world over the years through film and theatre, and we are very proud to bring the stage musical to audiences in Sri Lanka to experience and enjoy. Cinnamon Life will be the culinary and entertainment hub of Colombo, and MAMMA MIA along with a series of other events will give you a glimpse of what you can expect at Cinnamon Life. We encourage everyone to stay tuned for more exciting events in the lead up to the launch of Colombo’s life capital.”
