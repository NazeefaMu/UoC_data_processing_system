Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017

1. The Civil Procedure Code introduced on August 1, 1890, has seen several amendments and the latest amendment has been introduced by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)Act No. 08 of 2017with a view to advance the civil litigation procedure that meets the current needs.
2. The prime objective of the new Act can be viewed as follows;
a. Expeditious litigation process
b. Simplification of administrative procedure
c. Enhance efficiency
d. Reduce delay
e. Inexpensive disposal of actions
3. An important feature in the new Amendment to the Civil Procedure code is that it has introduced both procedural and administrative changes which are important for practicing counsels and instructing attorneys, as well as to judges.
4. Salient areas of focus
· Appointment of registered attorneys
· Service of summons
· Pre-trial proceedings
· Consolidation of action
· Substitution process
5. Appointment of registered attorney
I. The previous Section 27 has been repealed and the introductory provision requires that;
• Proxy must be filed in the format of (Form No 7) of the First schedule. (The same provision in the previous section has been imported )27(1)(a))
• In addition to the address of the registered attorney, at which service of any process can be served, the electronic mail address (if any) should also be included in terms of the new Act. (27(1)(b) and (c))
II. Section 27 (2) (a) requires that where a party is a natural person a memorandum must be submitted nominating a legal representative to carry out a case upon the death of the party.
• The memorandum must be in the form set out in Form No. 7A of the First Schedule set out in the new Act.
• The repealed Section 393will apply in regards to the nomination of legal representatives in filing the memorandum.
III. Revocation of proxy is set out under Section 27 (3), thus the appointment of a registered attorney will be in force until;
a. Revoked by the client in writing by his own motion, with leave of Court and after notice to the registered attorney, signed by the client.
b. Revoked by the registered attorney.
The right of the registered attorney to revoke proxy is a new concept which has been introduced to the legal system. Thus, the registered attorney can revoke the proxy;
i. in writing signed by the client and filed in Court; or
ii. with leave of the court having given thirty days’ notice to the client.
c. Where the client dies or upon the death or incapacity of the registered attorney; or
d. Where all proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the client
The ambiguity in the previous section has been cured through specifying the procedure as to the instances where the registered attorney and/or client may revoke a proxy.
6. Service of summons and notice
I. Section 29 has been amended and the existing section has been re-numbered as Section 29 (1) which sets out that, any process served on the Registered attorney, or left at the office or residence of such Attorney is presumed to be duly communicated to the party.
II. With the insertion of Section 29 (2), Service of any process, notice or document in the address of the registered attorney
and sent to the electronic mail address, given under section 27(1) is also deemed as sufficient delivery to the party.
• However, it is important to note that, mere fact of sending service/notice to the mail address does not constitute delivery, and hence service on the given address is imperative and service to the E-mail address is an additional requirement.III. Service to the address in the memorandum is sufficient notice to the nominee
7. Pre-trial procedure
I. Immediately after Chapter X, a new Chapter XA has been introduced. The said chapter can be viewed as an important feature which has been introduced to the legal framework.
II. In terms of section 79(A);
a. forthwith on the expiration of the time allowed for the filing of the answer; or
b. where a replication is permitted, on the last day of the time allowed for the filing of that replication, whether it is filed or not;
a date after 3 weeks and before 2 months must be fixed for the pre-trial. (79A(1)) and all parties must have notice. (79A(2))• Although the section 79A(1) specifically refers to ‘time allowed for the filing of the answer,’ the said section must be read in conjunction with Section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code which facilitates a subsequent date for filing of an answer
III. Section 80 has been repealed and accordingly the new section requires that, after completing the pre-trial process, on a calling date, to fix the date of trial of the action in the trial Court, the Court will appoint a date for trial and give notice of costs of service.
IV. 80A (1) sets out that no application for pre-trial steps is allowed once the matter is fixed for trial, except upon the permission of Court, where Court is satisfied that a grave and irremediable injustice would be caused if such steps are not permitted.
