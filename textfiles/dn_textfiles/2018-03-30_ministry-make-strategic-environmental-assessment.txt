Ongoing reservoir development projects:
Ministry to make Strategic Environmental Assessment

The Irrigation and Water Resource Management Ministry had been entrusted to make a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) related to around 80 projects that involve water diversion and reservoir development pertaining to irrigation and drinking water supply facilities.
An Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry spokesmen told the Daily News that Sri Lanka is aiming to carry out the final phase of water resources development in order to complete the planned water development projects in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and South Eastern dry zone areas. The final phase involves nearly 75 projects that include water diversion and reservoir development within the aforementioned irrigation sectors, in addition to the projects planned by the Mahaweli Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and Ceylon Electricity Board.
The projects would result in a number of negative environmental impacts such as loss of natural habitats and threatened/endemic species,disruption of migratory patterns of wild animals, escalation of human-wildlife conflicts and displacement of people.
Even though these prefects are required to carry out detailed environmental assessments, they, at project levels, fail to take into account the cumulative impact of these projects on the Sri Lankan environment, especially the forest coverage within the country, since an estimated 20,000 – 25,000 hectares of forest lands would be submerged due to proposed water resource development projects during the next two decades.
At the same time, the drinking and industrial water requirements of the country are also on the rise, stressing the need for a countrywide water resource development plan, the spokesmen said further. Furthermore, human-wildlife conflicts within major agriculture development areas are also escalating at alarming rates, threatening life and property of farming communities.
Therefore, under the circumstances, the proposed SEA is planned to be carried out before the finalisation of future water resource development projects.
It would provide an opportunity to address the potentially negative social-environmental concerns in an effective manner as well as help prioritise the maximum benefits of the projects to the country. Under the programme, in relation to around 19 projects involving water diversion and reservoir development within the Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, Vauniya, Mannar, Mullativu and Jaffna districts, discussions were held recently at Anuradhapura, under the patronage of district secretaries.
Some of the projects taken up for discussions are the Yan Oya Reservoir, Palagala – Kotte Ela, Ragangana LB High-level Sluice, Mahagalkadawala Reservoir, Kudawilachchiya Tank reinstatement, Nuwara – Angamedilla, Upper Elahera canal, Pankulan reservoir, Kinniya and Kantalem Kivul Oyas, River for Jaffna, Per Aru Reservoir, Upper Parangiya Aru Reservoir, Pavatkulam Reservoir, Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir and North Central Provincial Canal projects.
After the Strategic Environmental Assessment is complete, a detailed report would be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena in order to take further action regarding the said projects.
