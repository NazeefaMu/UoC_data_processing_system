Why was the Defender’s colour changed?

CID asks Yoshitha
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday interrogated former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s second son Yoshitha Rajapaksa on the reason to change the colour of the defender jeep of the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
Information had been received that Yoshitha Rajapaksa had taken the vehicle for his use. The CID investigations into the alleged murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen revealed that the colour of the jeep had been changed after the Red Cross donated it to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation.
The CID said that Thajudeen had been killed though it was initially purported to be a road accident near Shalika Grounds, Narahenpita. The criminal case is now being heard in court.
The CID has revealed that the said jeep donated by Red Cross Society to the Siriliya Saviya Foundation in 2011 was allegedly used in the abduction and murder of Thajudeen in 2012.
The CID had also recorded statements from Red Cross Society officers in this regard. Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa was also questioned by the CID on Tuesday on this jeep.
Yoshitha Rajapaksa arrived at the CID premises at 9 a.m. and came out around 1 p.m.
