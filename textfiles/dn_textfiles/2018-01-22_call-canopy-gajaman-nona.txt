Call for a canopy for Gajaman Nona

The statue of Gajaman Nona at the triangular highway junction at Nonagama, Ambalantota, is exposed to the vagaries of nature due to lack of a canopy and proper maintenance.
Gajaman Nona was a poetess who was also exceptionally beautiful; she had a talent for composing emotional and romantic verses. She was named Dona Isabella Cornelia Perumal and received baptism at the Milagiriya Church, Bambalapitiya.
There are also important places such as tanks and villages in Ambalantota DS area named after her.
The residents in the area urge authorities concerned to take steps to protect the statue.
