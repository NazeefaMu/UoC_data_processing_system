Invincible War Hero

A retired War Hero who had lost his hands and one leg in action against terrorists launched a fast joined by his family members opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy on March 3, protesting against the failure of relevant authorities to provide pipe-borne water to his residence in Ankelipitiya, Thalathuoya.
The War Hero, Thejan Saman Kumara, said that even though his house is situated a mere 200 metres away from the main pipe-borne water supply line, authorities had failed to heed repeated requests made to provide a water connection to his house for the last eight years. Saman Kumara, who joined the 11th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Gemunu Regiment in 2007, had received serious injuries in battle during an operation conducted in Janakapura, Welioya on June 6, 2008 as part of the Army’s humanitarian operation.
Saman Kumara said he returned home after treatment in hospital in 2010. Ever since he had requested authorities to provide a water connection to his house and all his requests had fallen on deaf ears.
He had been deceived by officers many a time promising to give a pipeline but the pledge had never been kept. Saman Kumara, a father of one, said he had to travel nearly five kilometres to fetch water. His wife was pregnant and in a delicate state of health and she could not come for his assistance either.
Finally, the 11th Brigade of the Sri Lanka Gemunu Regiment intervened in the matter and sent Maj. M.W.P. Abeysekara to meet Saman Kumara on behalf of their Commander and Maj. Abeysekara gave an assurance in writing that they would intervene to fulfil his request after informing the Army Headquarters about the matter.
Thereafter, Saman Kumara gave up his fast and returned home with his family anticipating that his request would bear fruit at last.
