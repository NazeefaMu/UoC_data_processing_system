Disciplinary action against Docs who produce fake MCs
Disciplinary action should be taken against doctors who produce fake medical certificates for their absence to duty on May 5, Power and Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said.
The Deputy Minister made this observation, joining in the Parliamentary debate yesterday.
“If any doctor issues a medical certificate for an individual who does not attend work due to trade union action, then obviously it becomes a fake document.

The medical certificates of those who go on sick leave on should be checked and if proven false, disciplinary action should be taken against such individuals,” he said.
The Deputy Minister made these comments in view of the islandwide strike led by the GMOA scheduled .

Certain public officials obstructing govt’s progress: Finance Minister
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday in Parliament, complained that certain public officials are dragging the Government by its feet and obstructing its progress.
The minister was moving ten Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, two Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance, three Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, Order under the Ports and Airports Development Levy Act and Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Bill to give effect to Budgetary proposals made last year.
“Even though the Government had changed, public officials remain unchanged. While some have made up their minds to support the Government’s endeavour, still there are a few who try to create problems. I ask them to work or resign. We will implement the people’s mandate. We have created ‘seven star democracy’ in the country and are flexible in our work, but that doesn’t mean we are ‘weak.’ We will never hesitate to take disciplinary action against any official,” he warned.
The minister also expressed his satisfaction on the Supreme Court ruling over the Foreign Exchange Bill, adding that the SC has upheld that the Central Bank is not an autonomous institution, but an agent of the Government and that the Government could regulate the activities of the agent through the directions of the minister.
The minister quoting the SC determination, said the CB could not act on their own, but subject to Government regulations and accountable to the Executive and Parliament. “This is what I always said. What is the use of a Government, if the tail can wag the head? Some went to courts seeking to make the CB independent, but they did not utter a word when President Mahinda Rajapaksa held the Finance Ministerial portfolio. They, who meekly approved all Cabinet papers by the former President, were now trying to show off their powers,” he said.

Premier Wickremesinghe said the matter would be taken before the Parliament Oversight Committees by the relevant ministers.
