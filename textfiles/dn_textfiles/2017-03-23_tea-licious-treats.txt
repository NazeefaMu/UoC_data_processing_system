Tea-licious Treats

Waters Edge together with principal sponsor and exclusive dairy partner Anchor Food Professionals is ready to present “Tea-licious” - a twist on the traditional high tea. On March 25, the Grand Lawn at Waters Edge will be transformed in to a garden party extraordinaire complete with the picturesque backdrop of the waterways that surround the hotel. The afternoon is all about fun and entertainment with good food, games and entertainment for the entire family.
The culinary team at Waters Edge will also cook-up an international buffet of hot and cold hors d'oeuvresusing a range of Anchor products. The spread will feature delectable delights from inter-continental, Japanese, Sri Lankan and other Asian cuisines. Waters Edge specializes in serving the best dessert spread in town and the high tea buffet will also include favourites such as éclairs, French macaroons, choux buns, cupcakes and pastries with fillings that are simply out of this world. Many of them will be made using the creamy goodness of Anchor butter which has been trusted as the best for baking for generations.
In collaboration with the Tea Lounge at the Edge and AnchorFood Professionals - the principalsponsor and exclusive dairy partner for the event, “Tea-licious” will also concoct some interesting beverages like tea cocktails and dairy based cocktails to wash down the scrumptious food.
The afternoon will be the perfect setting for a long-overdue meet-up for friends or a lazy afternoon family outing. To make sure that there is something for everyone, a special kiddie's corner to keep the little ones entertained while the adults catch up on the latest news in town or relax to the soothing sounds of the Slipping Chairs.
The British tradition of High Tea began in the mid-1700s as an afternoon meal usually served between 3 and 4 o'clock. It was a meal taken standing up or sitting on tall stools, thus ‘high'. Tea was served with a range of “bite-sized” sweets and savouries.
