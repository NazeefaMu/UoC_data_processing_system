Confifi Group hosts networking event

The Confifi Group hosted a networking event for the second year in succession to felicitate their ex-staff members in Colombo last week.
The Chairman of Confifi Group, Prof. M.T.A. Furkhan participated at the event as the Chief Guest. Some of these employees now own their own hotels, employed overseas and are at decision making levels in the leisure industry.
The Confifi Group was the first large hotel chain to be built in the Golden Mile in Beruwela by the Furkhan family and consisted of Confifi, Palm Garden, Riverina and later Eden and opening out the area for tourists. It was also one of the first hotel chains to employee female employees. Today some of these hotels have being divested with Eden coming under the LOLC leisure arm.
This year the employees hope to create a fund to assist employees in the future.
