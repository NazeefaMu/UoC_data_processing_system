edotco builds bamboo telecom tower in B’desh

edotco Group (edotco) recently became the first towerco to utilize bamboo in the construction of a telecom tower, which was installed on a roof top in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Developed in collaboration with Bangladesh University of Engineering (BUET) and deployed by edotco Bangladesh, the noteworthy use of this renewable resource keeps apace with the pulse of innovation which is in the DNA of edotco.
The research and development which was led by Professor Dr. Syed Ishtiaq Ahmad, Professor of Civil Engineering in BUET, focused on the design and viability of bamboo as an alternative material to traditional steel structures in telecommunications.
Professor Ahmad said, “we are very pleased to see the installation of the first bamboo telecom tower in our country. Bangladesh is a country with plenty of natural resources including bamboo which is a renewable material. 
The natural course of action to take is to use these resources in efforts to contribute to the country’s technological progress. Feasibility studies showed that bamboo is a good material choice for telecom towers due to its properties. We thank edotco for believing in such an initiative that contributes to nation building and conservation of the environment.”
Established in 2012, edotco Group is the first regional and integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company in Asia, providing end-to- end solutions in the tower services sector from tower leasing, co-locations, build-to- suit, energy, transmission and operations and maintenance.
