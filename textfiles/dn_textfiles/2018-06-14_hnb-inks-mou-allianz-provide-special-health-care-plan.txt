HNB inks MoU with Allianz to provide special health care plan

HNB PLC announced a new partnership with Allianz Insurance Lanka Limited to provide a specially designed International Health Care plan that offers a comprehensive pre – to - post hospitalization care to HNB Club and Priority Circle customers by linking them to best healthcare facilities in any part of the world.
“Progress takes on different forms for different people however our partnership with Allianz represents another major leap forward in terms of the value we are now able to offer our HNB Club and Priority Circle members.
“As a result, our most esteemed customers will now have access to some of the most comprehensive and high quality treatment when overseas. Particularly given the flat rate on their discounted premiums up to the age of 64, today’s MOU delivers unprecedented value to our customers and we encourage them to consider signing on to take maximum use of these remarkable benefits.” HNB DGM – Retail Banking, Sanjay Wijemanne said.
The new agreement will provide HNB Club and Priority Circle customers with discounted premiums for the Allianz Global Health-Care plan which entitles them to benefits worth between US$ 800,000 to US$ 1.5 million per annum - including a wide range of in- hospitalization and critical illness treatment including emergency medical evacuation. “As Sri Lanka’s middle class becomes more affluent, there is an increasing demand from some of our customers for medical treatment overseas. Even over the recent past we have seen the continuous growth of medical tourism to India, Singapore and other destinations capable of providing cutting edge treatment and therapy.
“In that regard we are confident that our new partnership with Allianz Lanka will open up new opportunities and empower our valued HNB Club and Priority Circle customers to seek out the best treatment available internationally,” Wijemanne said.
In addition to the discounted flat premiums, the plan also provides a family discount of 12.5% for a family of three or more members.
The Allianz Global Healthcare plan is split into three categories of which the Classic package is limited to coverage in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, while the Gold and Premier packages are available worldwide excluding Canada and the United States of America.
