Treasury Bond commission term extended

The mandate period of the Commission of inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue was yesterday extended until December 31, 2017.
Accordingly, the recieved extension is for 23 days. The mandate period of the Commission was to end on December 8, 2017.
The extension was done by an Extraordinary Gazette notification in terms of the Commission of Inquiry Act Section 4.
The Commission was expected to submit its report on December 8, 2017.
The Secretary to the Treasury Bond Commission, attorney at law S.Udugamasooriya said the no evidence will be called during the extended time period. “Infact, the extension was granted as the tribunal needed more time to prepare its report.” he said.
The Treasury Bond Commission concluded recording evidence last November 20, 2017. On October 24, 2017 the Commission received an extension of six weeks to submit its report. The Commission’s hearing continued for more than 120 days with more than 65 witnesses giving evidence before the Commission.
