Nestle paints Colombo green with finale of Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign

With the participation of over 1,000 children and their families celebrated the finale of the popular ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign ,painting the streets of Colombo green in a mega Milo Cycle Parade.
They cycled from the Sports Ministry Grounds through the city of Colombo and back to the starting point, where celebrations continued with a carnival.
The event marked the third consecutive ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign, which ran from May to June this year. Milo fans took selfies with their moms and a Milo pack to enter a raffle draw, from which 1,000 lucky winners were selected to win Milo branded bicycles.
Nestle Vice President Norman Kannangara said, “As a brand that strongly advocates the importance of good nutrition and an active lifestyle, we wanted to end our hugely popular ‘Mom, Me and My Milo’ campaign with a fun bicycle parade, to show kids that staying active can be fun too. We want to encourage children to lead a healthier lifestyle with their families by cycling, a popular activity enjoyed by many kids. We are truly overwhelmed by the fantastic consumer response we keep getting for the campaign every year. It is a reflection of the strong trust and love consumers have for the brand.”
As part of Milo’s ambition to help nurture a healthier generation, the event focused on not only helping kids bond with their mothers but also on instilling healthy eating habits and a healthy lifestyle via games and other activities. It started off with a Breakfast Movement where mothers and kids learned about the importance of breakfast and ways in which it could be made healthier.
