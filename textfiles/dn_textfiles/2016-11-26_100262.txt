Kandy SC to manacle Cops in the hills

Kandy SC who will host Police SC at Nittawela today are determined to manacle the cops and give continuity to their winning streak treating the defeat to Air Force as a bad dream. The encounter is a first round rugby game of the 2016/17 Rugby league. This season Kandy SC who has two wins in three outings posted the biggest scoreline 96. They will go out attempting to better that score. The defending champions will throw everything into the first half of the battle in an effort to make a big score. A big win on their home ground is essential. Today’s match will be played under the patronage of the Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake. Kandy SC scrum-half and Captain Roshan Weeraratne believes that statistics is about to change in this game and is quietly confident. He will have a huge responsibility on his shoulders and will be expected to bring out the best in their outside backs with their playmaking abilities. Kandy SC is not playing like defending cup winners at the moment. Their performance in all departments of the game is surprisingly ordinary. It looks like the whole team is depending on a few players while others are playing like passengers. This is not the way to play the game. Police meanwhile, failed to record a single win in all three games they played. The Policemen are seeking to field their strongest possible lineup. They have struggled to move the ball quickly enough in recent times and if they are to succeed that will hinge on how they are going to fare. Police have lost all their games in a year they are celebrating 150 years. Skipper Udara Suriyapereuma is blessed with a side with good knowledgeable players, very physical; they should have a game plan and also correct their weak areas. Winning will be hard for them, but they are capable of proving worthy opponents.
