SPMC to increase production up to four billion tablets

The production of the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) will be increased up to four billion tablets by March next year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the new pharmaceuticals production factory of the SPMC will commence production in March next year. Then the total production of the SPMC will go up to four billion tablets.
The minister was addressing the 30th anniversary of the SPMC, recently.
According to Minister Senaratne, the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC), Ayurveda Corporation
and Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital which come under the purview of the Health Ministry make profits now.
“Now Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital does not obtain funds from the Treasury. Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital will be developed as a high standard hospital. State corporations can make profits. I can prove this fact. It is only a myth that State corporations cannot make profits,” he said.
