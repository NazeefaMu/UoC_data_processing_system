Hoops, rings and body piercing things!

 Every day, across the world men and women, boys and girls, get themselves tattooed and pierced. And it’s not just their ears or noses. They are participating in the modern fad of ‘Body Art,’ which has its origins in antiquity, but which in recent decades has developed into some extreme forms that are often quite disturbing.
Many seem to be making a sad cry for attention that they would not receive otherwise and I confess that I draw inferences about their neediness, their judgment, and their impulsiveness. Just imagine, some of these bizarre body mutilating fiascos that include horns, forked tongues, elf ears and feline whiskers. No, these aren’t features from the latest fantasy film.
Today, thousands of people are getting their bodies customized in all sorts of wacky and unusual ways. Tattoos are just the tip of the iceberg for people interested in body modification, referred to as ‘body mutilation’ by detractors.
The only time I wore an earring was when I acted in a school play as Sinbad the Sailor when I was seven or thereabouts. It was a large sort of gypsy hoop which interfered with my swashbuckling performance. Fortunately it was a clip-on thing so I was spared the horror of having my ear punctured.
But there is a kind of moral ring to the story and a piercing one at that. A jealous class-mate, nicknamed ‘The Ouch Grouch,’ who was given an insignificant role in the cast as a running brigand began imitating my performance much to the amusement of our mates. He kept prancing around like an idiot on a pogo-stick with a foot-ruler for a sword and revelled in the mirth he caused. But one day he went too far.
To provide a more authentic flavour to his lampooning act he attempted to devise an earring with a key-ring. He stretched it as much as he could and just as he was about to clip it on his ear lobe a pointed end went clean through it. It bled like a scarlet spigot and the hapless nurse in the school medical room could not remove it.
He was rushed, screaming in agony all the way, to hospital where it was reportedly snapped with the aid of a wire-cutter. Naturally he was conferred with the nickname ‘Key-Ring Kanaya’ which he still carries. Yes Siree, retribution in this case certainly had a piercing ring of poetic justice to it!
The reasons for piercing are wide-ranging. Some pierce for religious or spiritual reasons. For instance, closer home in the holy town of Kataragama Hindu devotees puncture various parts of the face and body with miniature spears representing the weapon of the war god Murugan. While others perforate for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for ahem, erotic pleasure, to conform to their culture or to rebel against it.
Extreme body modification procedures are almost never performed by actual physicians. These treatments are more often associated with tattoo parlours than medical offices. In fact, I’ve never heard of a single plastic surgeon who admitted to performing extreme body modification. And because actual doctors aren’t involved, the patients don’t benefit from modern anaesthetics.
Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to unmentionable parts of their anatomy. Seems to me the amount of metal stuck in them is in inverse proportion to their intelligence. Body piercings are all the rage these days, but people are forever inventing new places to put the little pieces of art. I can just imagine what the parent of some of the kids had to say when they got home with their new piercing; “You pierced your what?”
Look at the range of them, eyebrow hoops, tongue barbells, nose and lip studs and navel rings are among the ones considered more conservative. But who would in their right mind would want to have holes punched in them to accommodate these anatomical accessories.
Pains me to admit it but I am darned scared of any form of piercings. You see, I don’t want anything dangling off any part of me that is held in place by a tiny piece of flesh. Snag it on something and it’s goodbye to whatever part of your frame it is affixed to.
For many, it is a personal articulation of unanimity with a social cause, a trend that attracts predominately young people, driving them to ever wilder and more shocking appearances of personal disfigurement. These include total-body tattoos, pierced eyelids, lips, noses, tongues, foreheads, and even disfigurement of their, well, let’s say ‘doodahs’ of reproduction, in a never-ending quest for the most outrageous form of self-expression through this type of agonizing body ornamentation.
As for piercings some of them are distressingly located in totally unspeakable parts of the subjects’ anatomies. Ouch! And as any mortified Sri Lankan matriarch would exclaim: ‘Cheekay, Cheekay!’ Which in Anglicised parlance would translate to yukky and double yukky.
Experience will soon teach them to steer clear of some inviting clear freshwater pools inhabited with the omnivorous kaviyya fish which fancy taking painful nips at your fingers, toes or any other tempting visible appendages they mistake for a meal. One suspects soon enough that these denizens of the invigorating pools are closely related to the Piranhas of the South American rivers.
I do not contend that the schools of shoaling Kavaiyyas pecking at your pinkies or any other vital part of your anatomy could cause as serious damage as their South American counterparts. Yet their nips are excruciatingly unpleasant to say the least.
Nonetheless no one would want to wade in to their territory seeking a free manicure or pedicure, unless they fancy an attempted type of initiatory rite of circumcision in the process. Worse, one has also to watch out for mud crabs which could sink their murderous sharp claws into anything they perceive as a temptingly dangling morsel to latch onto.
They are the nightmare of all skinny-dippers because when they clamp their claws into your fingers or toes or that unmentionable adjunct of one’s manhood they refuse obdurately to release their hold even if you snap the claw from their body.
Besides, many of these body piercing accessories with their rings and hoops resemble genuine fishing lures. So it would not be prudent particularly for those with a penchant for navel or loin hoops and rings to indulge in diversions such as skinny dipping. They say it’s good clean ‘holesome’ fun. It might be the type of deterrent to make them lose their ‘holier-than-thou attitude’ for good. And of course they will be fishing for trouble. Because there will always be the painful prospect of making them feel less cock-a-hoop, with the denizens of the deep running hoops and rings around their lower extremities. [email protected]
