Sri Lankan High Commissioner to UK has not resigned: Foreign Affairs Ministry

 
Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Amari Wijewardene, has not resigned but will conclude her contract on her volition by March 31, 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a media release.
The release aimed to correct what it called “incorrect reports being circulated in the media” claiming that Wijewardene had resigned with immediate effect.
