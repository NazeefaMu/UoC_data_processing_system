C.W.W. Kannangara statue to be constructed at Presidential Secretariat

Great people such as late Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara would not have entered politics in future due to the destructive media culture practised by various social media in Sri Lanka today, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was doubtful if any other country used social media in a destructive way to sling mud and level baseless allegations against politicians like in Sri Lanka. He added that only those who could tolerate and resist such a political culture would join politics.
He made this comment yesterday at a press conference held at the Information Department on the construction of a statue of the 'Father of Free Education' late Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara at the Presidential Secretariat to mark his 70th death anniversary.
He said late C.W.W. Kannagara set up 54 Central Colleges in the country paving the way for the children of the ordinary people to climb up the social latter through free education.
"Today some politicians and groups make allegations that there is a threat to free education," Minister Amaraweera said. "But the truth is that there is no such threat to free education but the facilities given to free education is increasing gradually."
Minister Amaraweera thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for taking measures to set up a statue of the late C.W.W. Kannangara at the Presidential Secretariat and allocating Rs. 5 million for the purpose.
He said that this government's new mechanism to provide school uniforms has proved a success and saved a considerable amount of money.
He also said government's attention was drawn to introducing job oriented education. He added that due to the existing education, the graduates passing out of the universities are not suitable for some positions.
He also added that there are many opportunities in institutions such as the Meteorological Department, NARA etc with no qualified persons.
Asian Development Bank adviser M.C. Mathupala who was a past student of Central College also spoke.
