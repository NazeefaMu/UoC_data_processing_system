President calls for project to aid drought-stricken Puttalam farmers

President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the commencement of a project to cultivate 600 acres of land with sorghum, to provide relief to drought-stricken farmers in the Puttalam district.
In areas where even a single cultivation could not be completed during the Yala and Maha Seasons, the proposed project would be implemented to provide assistance for more than 500 farmer families where this cultivation is to be conducted using a minimum amount of water from the Inginimitiya Irrigation Project.
In addition, assistance had been provided to farmers for the cultivation of additional crops, while a project to pump water by utilising solar power, a multipurpose weed-suppressing rotary system, small-scale machinery and a programme on providing incentives to young agricultural entrepreneurs, would be conducted soon. The said project, which would be carried out under the Food Production National Programme operative under the President’s Office, would deploy grants for the benefit of framers and consumers.
