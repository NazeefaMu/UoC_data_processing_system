Training programme held on natural disasters

An awareness programme for the public in Rattota - a natural disaster-prone area - was held by the National Disaster Management Centre in collaboration with Matale District Disaster Management Unit.
The programme was conducted centralizing the Madurawela, Dankanda, Madakubura and Dambagolla Grama-seva divisions. The villagers were educated regarding a natural disaster which may occur in the area and they were trained on how to save their lives in such a situation.
Assistant Director of Disaster Management Unit - Matale, Chaminda Amaraweera said the training is vital regarding the natural disaster. "When a natural disaster occurs, we should be determined to save our lives. The people would organise to face such incidents in groups. It is very important," he said.
