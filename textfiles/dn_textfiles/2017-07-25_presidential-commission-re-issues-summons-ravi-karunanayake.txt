Presidential Commission re-issues summons on Ravi Karunanayake

 
The Presidential Commission appointed to inquire into the bond issue has re-issued summons on former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The former Finance Minister and present Foreign Affairs Minister was summoned before the PCoI to give evidence on Tuesday (25), but his lawyer Sandun Gamage informed the Commission yesterday his client would not attend.
Gamage said Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake was unable to attend due to prior commitments and that he would inform the commission on the days he was free to attend the Commission of Inquiry hearings.
