Four suspects apprehended with brass lightning conductors

Four suspects who had four brass lightning conductors worth nearly Rs. 100 million with immense archeological value in their possession were apprehended by a team of naval officers attached to the Western Command and STF personnel, during a combined search operation conducted in an area between Dodangoda and Neboda following a tip-off on August 22.
The brass lightening conductors were being transported in a tipper for sale when they were confronted by the team. The suspects were handed over to the STF along with the tipper and the conductors for necessary legal action.
