Tails of  Hamelin

The grade four students of the British School in Colombo unfolded their latest musical production titled ‘The Pied Piper’ at the school auditorium recently.
The legendary ‘Pied Piper of Hamelin’ script by Malcolm Sircom was magically transformed into an outstanding production by the juniors of the school.
The show was imaginatively produced and directed by Fazla Khaleel who had added extra and modern layers to the existing script to make it yet another fabulous production giving the cast a memorable experience. There were over 100 students involved in the production.
