Knightley  writes history in  ‘Colette’  trailer

The makers of the upcoming biopic ‘Colette’ have dropped its first trailer, which centers around French novelist, who overcomes the constraints of society to later become a Nobel Prize-nominated author.
Starring Keira Knightley in the lead, the trailer shows her overcoming the societal molds in a number of ways. It portrays her as a wife of charismatic Parisian writer Henry Gauthier-Villars (Dominic West). Colette then sparks her creative abilities in the city of Paris as her husband recruits Colette to write a novel to be published under his name. When her works garner huge success, Colette strives to break out of the literal confines her abusive husband yields upon her.
At the end of the trailer, Knightley says, “The hand that holds the pen writes history.” ‘Colette’ was premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is all set to hit the theaters on September 21. ANI
