Mitra to expand in East Africa and ASEAN in 2019

UK headquartered global technology provider, Mitra Innovation plans to rapidly expand its footprint globally with a huge focus on ASEAN and East Africa, company’s founders told the media during their annual leadership and strategy programme in Colombo yesterday.
Ashok Suppiah, CEO and co-founder said they will also increase their employee strength from 200 to over 350 by end of next year and 90% of the new employees would be from their date center in Moratuwa.
However, he said although there are many unemployed graduates they are not fine-tuned to meet the challenges of the ICT sector and this is a major issue as other competing nations produce graduates with industry-related skills.”
“Next year we will be focusing on the UK, Europe, Africa and Asia in our drive to digitize and empower enterprises operating in developing economies across the globe. We have made significant breakthroughs in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning.”
“By early next year we are aiming to roll out a fully fledged machine learning and predictive analytics solution for our enterprise customers.”
In 2018, Mitra Innovation launched client servicing operations in new regions such as Kenya, Germany and Europe.
Derek Bell, COO and co-founder, said, “alongside our core offerings such as digital transformation and cloud integration, we will also be commencing a new service commonly known as DevOps which will help large enterprises manage IT infrastructure and further innovate how they create added value for their customers.”
Dammika Ganegama, Managing Director and co-founder said, “In addition to our operations in Africa, we will also provide similar services to enterprises in Sri Lanka and the neighboring APAC and ASEAN region, which we have been currently monitoring.”
