WHO declared Coronavirus outbreak a public-health emergency

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern Thursday.
The WHO designation, pointing to an increase in the number of cases, indicates that international public-health authorities now consider the respiratory virus a significant threat beyond China, where it originated last month.
The move could further heighten the global response to the outbreak. The agency made the declaration after a meeting of its emergency committee, which declined to do so last week.
Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken.
There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died.
124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.
