A timely and necessary fight against hate mongers

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement on law enforcement authorities being directed to initiate immediate action against those engaging in hate speech, and perpetrators and initiators of violence against religious and ethnic groups is both timely and welcome, considering the delays by the relevant authorities, particularly the Police, to take the necessary action in such situations which have shown a marked increase in recent months.
He made it clear that if someone engages in communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and related hate speech, prompt action would be taken to inquire into such situations, arrest and produce such offenders before the courts.
It was important that the PM said this action as a reaffirmation of the policy of the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, in accordance with the mandate received from the people at the Presidential election on January 8, 2015 to ensure the country never returns to a conflict-ridden past, and instead resolves to guide the nation towards reconciliation. He noted that this mandate was given in the context of the post-conflict situation after the end of the prolonged war with the LTTE, and the restoration of peace with necessary reconciliation.
He also reminded that the country was affected by the religious conflicts in 2014, particularly in Alutgama and Beruwala, with unity among communities damaged. The repeat of such incidents and situations would adversely affect the progress towards lasting peace, with the understanding among communities being damaged, and also affect the image of the country. He was very clear that such a situation could not be repeated in the larger national interest.
Particular relevance
The PM’s statement is of particular relevance because of the image that has been created in recent weeks of political rivalry within the government on the issue of ethnic and religious discord and violence, and the use of the emergence of such violence for both propaganda and action against the government by forces of the opposition, particularly the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It is necessary to recall here the statements made by different ministers of government about knowing who is hiding or shielding the leader of the Budu Bala Sena, Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, who has made many statements very insulting to the Muslim community, as well as provocative against the community, and who is making a show of keeping away from the law by his absence in court where his behaviour in Court of Law is being considered for alleged Contempt of Court. Such ministerial comments do little to show the commitment of government to the cause of national unity with inter-communal harmony. In fact they seemed to support some charges being made by the JO and key movers in the arousal of ethnic hatred attempting, to show emerging dangers of the Sinhala Buddhist majority, which remain largely unreal.
The reference by the PM to the Police being instructed to investigate into the attacking of several Muslim business and mosques was also of relevance because of the strong impression being created of the Police not ready to act with speed and commitment on these matters. This has been particularly striking on the non-arrest of the BBS leader, despite the use of ‘four police teams’ for this purpose, as stated by the Police.
It will be interesting to see the new developments in this regard, following the PM’s statement, with the Colombo Fort Magistrate issuing a warrant against BBS General Secretary Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera for the second time, earlier this week, following his failure to appear before the court on two consecutive occasions, with regard to his alleged behaviour in the Homagama Magistrate’s Court in January this year.
Northern corruption
There are interesting developments in the Northern Province on issues dealing with corruption among members of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC).
While the Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran has called for the resignation of two Provincial Council members over allegations of corruption and fraud, there is also a demand from three parties of the Tamil National Alliance –EPRLF, TELO and PLOTE - that all four ministers of the NPC should be removed. Of the two ministers whose resignation the Chief Minister called for – Education Minister T. Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P. Aingaranesan – Education Minister Kurukularaja has submitted his resignation to pave the way for a “complete investigation”.
It is believed the Motion of No Confidence against the Chef Minister, signed by 21 PC members, is following a call for the removal of all four ministers of the NPC, on alleged issues of corruption and fraud. The two ministers whose resignation were sought by the Chief Minister followed evidence against them being found by a committee appointed by the Chief Minister last year, comprising two retired judges and one retired GA, to investigate issues of fraud and corruption.
The situation with regard to the move of No Confidence in the Chief Minister will have to be seen in the context of wider political developments in the Northern Province.
This is a situation of special importance with regard to Provincial Administration in the country, with action being initiated on corruption against provincial ministers by the Chief Minister, which is a major move ahead in the fight against fraud and corruption in administration. There has been considerable criticism about the NPC and the Chief Minister with regard to the non-use of funds allocated from the Centre for development activities in the North. However, this move against corruption is certainly a good initiative, which should hopefully pave the way for the other provincial councils, too, in taking proper action to fight corruption in the provincial areas of administration. Such action at the provincial level, could certainly give a push to what is seen as the currently stalled action against corruption by the Central Government.
Mangala on MR and GSP Plus
Former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera who is well aware of the negotiations on Sri Lanka regaining the GSP Plus facility of the European Union, has given an effective reply to Mahinda Rajapaksa seeking to belittle the advantages of GSP plus to the country; by stating the government should not create unrealistic expectation about it, as it is trivial, with Sri Lanka being very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country, which will take away this facility.
Mangala Samaraweera states that MR conveniently hides a fundamental issue, which is that a country has to be classified as “upper middle income” by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for GSP Plus. Thus, even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit.
He further states that this period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnership with the European Union!
There is also an effective response to MR’s reasoning that Sri Lanka shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow. As Mangala Samaraweera sees it, this is callous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income? Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present? Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later? Over to Rajapaksa – one would say.
Minister Samaraweera is also critical of the Rajapaksa and JO criticism that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka “under the supervision” of the EU, as simply absurd. He states that: By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).
Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation. How ironic that Mr. Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Don’t our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection? Don’t our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms?
