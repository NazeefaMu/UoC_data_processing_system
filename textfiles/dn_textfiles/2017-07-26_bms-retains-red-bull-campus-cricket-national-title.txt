BMS retains Red Bull Campus Cricket National title

Business Management School (BMS) recorded a thumping 9-wicket win over Saegis Campus in the final of the Red Bull Campus Cricket National 2017 and defended their title at the P. Sara Oval Stadium in Colombo last Saturday.
Put into bat first Saegis were given a torrid ride by the BMS before they were shot out for 100 runs, inclusive of five runs through the Energiser Over, with 17 deliveries remaining. The titleholders on the other hand wasted very little time to race to victory and retain their silverware, with 56 balls to spare.
BMS opener Geshan Wimaladharma, who claimed two wickets earlier on, laid the foundation to a thumping win as he guided his side with a blistering knock of 46 runs off 25 balls. Wimaladharma hit four boundaries and four sixes before falling as the only BMS victim of the final at 66.
Wimaladharma’s partner, Hashan Dumindu, had very little role to play when he was on crease, but accelerated soon after the loss of his partner. He remained unbeaten on 29 off 26 deliveries and hit two fours and a six. Sadeera Samarawickrama, who was in fine form throughout the competition was 17 not out when BMS reached the winning post. Samarawickrama faced 14 balls during his knock and hit a four and a six.
Earlier on, put into bat first, Saegis were made to struggle from the very beginning as they went on to lose wickets at regular intervals. Janith Liyanage bowled only one over and claimed three wickets, off a hat-trick before BMS sealed the deal.
National cap Wanindu Hasaranga and Wimaladharma claimed two wickets each while seamsters Ranitha Liyanarachchi, Koshan Danushka and skipper Dinuk Wickramanayake picked a wicket each. “We are proud and humbled to have achieved our goal of representing Sri Lanka for the 2nd time at the Red Bull Campus Cricket World finals in September. We also owe a lot to Niroshan (Dickwella) for being with us right throughout this tournament despite his commitments to the National team,” said BMS skipper, Dinuk Wickramanayake.
