In memory of Rev. Fr. Mercelline Jayakody
Education centre soon at Dankotuwa

In appreciation of the services rendered by late Rev. Fr. Mercelline Jayakody as a priest, lyrist, musician, journalist, poet, newspaper editor and photographer, an education and research centre would soon be opened under the auspices of the Sarasavi Cultural Association, in Dankotuwa. The centre would also display the Rev. Father’s possessions.
“Rev. Fr. Jayakody promoted religious as well as ethnic harmony, integrity and reconciliation in his literary work.
The centre would be an ideal place for poets and linguists, to study his literary work,” Sarasavi Cultural Association Chairman Ananda Karunaratna said.
He requested anyone in possession of Rev. Fr. Jayakody’s literary pieces or photographs, to donate them to the centre.
Those willing to do so, could call 0773703344 (Ananda), 076 7240225 (Upali) or 071 6856355 (Susantha), or post the items to: Corporate office of Sarasavi Cultural Association, Govi Sevana Secretariat, Singakkuliya, Yogiyana.
