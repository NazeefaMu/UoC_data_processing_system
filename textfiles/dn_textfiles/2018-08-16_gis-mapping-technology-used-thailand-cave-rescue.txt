GIS Mapping Technology used for Thailand Cave Rescue

Rescuers used GIS Mapping to gather data, guiding search and rescue plans to secure monsoon rains trapped a soccer team of 12 boys, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach in a remote cave in Thailand. Rescuers uses 3D terrain and watershed maps to show how and where to divert water during the rescue.
Most search-and-rescue missions start with a map to guide the operation and coordinate tools, supplies, and personnel. Today’s maps, created in a geographic information system (GIS), bring in all types of data to query and explore. In cases of cave rescue, workers rely on maps to correlate the underground world to the land above.
Early on, the Thailand Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) pulled in GIS and mapping experts from Esri Thailand and GIS Company to create a variety of maps to help locate the boys.
DMR staff and the mapping teams had to find a new approach. They added prior cave surveys to the GIS to make maps that showed the complete picture of the cave surface both above and below. Staff from the Royal Irrigation Department surveyed the area’s geology using electrical resistivity techniques. Mapping experts interpreted the data to find sinkholes that might be acting as water funnels and they created 3D maps to show where aboveground streams stopped and went underground. Experts conferred with GIS-based data and analytics to review and model water diversion options.
“We had to calculate the basin, water flow direction, and accumulation using a digital elevation model, geological details…and details about the dense forest cover in order to identify the origin of significant flows of water inside the cave,” said Chanist Prasertburanakul, Senior Aerospace Mapping Manager and Team Leader of GIS Company, Ltd. and Esri Thailand. “With this data, we found two significant sources of water flowing into the northern and southern parts of the cave.”
Responders set up a rescue operation war room at the Geohazard Operation Center. From this central location, they planned and coordinated activities using a digital twin of the cave.
Many responders and experts assembled and with water levels safely lowered, the dive team was ready to set out in search of the missing boys. They first studied maps depicting the cave’s twists, turns, and dimensions to help navigate difficult passages and mentally mark their progress inside the cave.
Engineers, hoping to find a place to drill, explored 3D cross-section maps to calculate the distance to the center of the cave from multiple angles.The boys’ discovery kicked off a frantic phase of extraction plans as rain kept pouring and the team waited in jeopardy. Initially, one government official suggested the boys might have to remain in place for four months until waters receded. However, map-based calculations revealed that cave oxygen levels would not sustain them that long. GIS Solutions (Private) Limited was appointed by Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc. (ESRI) as its sole Distributor for Sri Lanka. GIS Solutions is a group company of the Just In Time Group, a foremost systems integrator in Sri Lanka with a 21+ year history, providing ICT solutions and service support to a niche market in Sri Lanka.
