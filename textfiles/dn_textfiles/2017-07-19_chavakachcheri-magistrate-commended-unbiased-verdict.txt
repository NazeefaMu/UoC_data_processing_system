Chavakachcheri Magistrate commended for unbiased verdict

Founder of the Shanthi Foundation, Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera said yesterday, that the verdict given by the Chavakachcheri Magistrate S. Chandraratnam in connection with the building of a Stupa at the Navatkuliya Sri Samiddhi Sumana Viharaya in Jaffna is a boost for
religious freedom, religious unity and also the protection of the Constitution.
Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday said this verdict will lead to coexistence and communal harmony between Sinhala and Tamil people.
"We have great respect for her verdict which will further preserve the foremost place for Buddhism, according to the Constitution,” The Thera said. "Even though, she is not a Buddhist, the way she respected Buddhism is a great example to everyone. These exemplary acts should be followed by many extremist politicians such as C. V. Vigneswaran, Vijayakala Maheswaran and TNA members in the North. Then, there will be no conflicts and misunderstandings among communities."
National Intellectual Sangha Council, Convenor Ven. Sooriyawewa Sumedha Thera said there are over 57 Buddhist families living in the Navatkuliya village and the temple was constructed as a place of worship for the residents. There was a request from the residents for the constriction of the new stupa for the temple and the construction work began.
However, the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha impeded the construction work on the stupa by rejecting to grant permission for further work. The Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha filed the case against the construction of the Chaithya which was taken up for hearing at the Chavakachcheri Magistrate's Court. The Chavakachcheri Magistrate S. Chandrasekeran ordered the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha to permit the construction of the temple's stupa without any hindrance. The Magistrate has said that she respects Buddhism even though she is a Hindu devotee. The North is the stronghold of separatist Tamil extremists and they are spreading extremism to win the Tamil people.
Hence, this verdict given by a Tamil Magistrate would defiantly a big drawback to the violent Tamil extremism prevailing in the North.
