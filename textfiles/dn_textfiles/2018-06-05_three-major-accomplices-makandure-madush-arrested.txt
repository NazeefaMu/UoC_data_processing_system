Three major accomplices of Makandure Madush arrested

Three persons including a close associate of underworld kingpin Makandure Madush, who is believed to be hiding in Dubai, were arrested by the Organized Crimes Prevention Division (OCPD).
Akila Niroshan Palliyaguru, who is said to be the man managing Makandure Madush’s local drug operations, was arrested along with Dewundara Chamil’s second wife Ishanka Savithri and another person named Manoj Kavinda involved in the drug operations, while they were travelling in a car in the Fort area, following intelligence received from STF sources.
At the time of arrest, the police had recovered 2 grams and 590 mg of heroin concealed in her purse.
On information gathered through interrogation of the suspects, police had found 7 grams and 700 mg of heroin inside Palliyaguru’s temporary residence in Mount Lavinia. The suspects were later handed over to the Organized Crimes Division for further investigations.
Meanwhile, 20 bank cards, details of properties worth Rs.4 million, bank passbooks said to belong to Dewundara Chamil have also been recovered.
Police had obtained detention orders to hold the suspects for seven days for interrogation when they were produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
