Sri Lanka targets 2.5m tourists in 2017

 
Sri Lanka on Monday said that it has set a target of welcoming 2.5 million tourists to the island nation in 2017.
 Tourism Minister John Amaratunga said that the country had already exceeded the 2 million tourist arrival mark in 2016 and now it hoped to attract a further 2.5 million tourists by the end of 2017.
 Up to November 2016, the government had achieved a little more than 1.8 million tourists with the leading markets being India and China.
 He further said that the closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport for certain hours from January to April would have an effect on the number of tourist arrivals this year.
