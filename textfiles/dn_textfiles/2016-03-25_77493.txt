Toppling government, a myth - Gayantha
The toppling of this government by the joint opposition is a myth as the people voted the government to stop the "commission game" in the name of development, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that the previous Rajapaksa government only needed to remain in power by commencing massive scale development projects which did not benefit the public and added that due to this reason the country entangled in a debt trap.
"Due to this reason this government has had to take loans to settle those debts and the interest," Minister Karunathilake said. "But we would settle the loans taken by the previous regime and also develop the economy of the country as we promised during the elections," the minister said.
The minister made these observations during the adjournment debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the economic situation of the country.
He said the Mahinda Rajapaksa government missed a golden opportunity to develop the country and they acted in a manner that paved way for them to leave two years before the expiration of their term.
"When JR Jayewardene was elected in 1977, he implemented the Mahaweli Project to increase the electricity generation by two-fold," Minister Karunathilake said. "But Mahinda Rajapaksa government built ports that ships do not come, airports where planes don't land and stadiums where games are not played."
Karunathilake said the previous government implemented all these projects to boast and to earn commissions and added that the previous government had reduced the exports by 50 percent compared with the exports when the UNP handed over the government in 2005.
The minister also said that the in 2005 the amount of the commercial loans was 4 percent but it had been very high when the UNP took over the government. He said the World Bank and the IMF refused to grant loans to Sri Lanka as it spent money on unnecessary projects, which led the previous government to take commercial loans.
"They had put a number of government institutions in the debt trap during their regime. For example the CEB had to settle a loan of Rs. 10 billion in 2005 but it had been increased to Rs. 200 billion by now," Minister Karunathilake said. "The SriLankan Airlines earned a profit when it was under Emirates. But now it is Rs. 134 billion indebted."
"They asked to hand over the government and they would show as to how the government would be run."
He said that the government had to settle Rs. 44 billion the previous government had taken as loans to construct roads and added that there is a global economic draw back that the government has had to face.
Karunathilake said it was obvious that the government has the international support just by the fact that the Indian government gave a loan to Sri Lanka.
"However as we promised to build a new country within 60 months the Cabinet would do it under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," Minister Karunathilake said. "This government would remain at least for 10 years.
"The government would not be able to be toppled until its term would complete," Karunathilake said.

Unsuccessful Chinese projects will turn into profitable ventures - Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister, Sajith Premadasa told Parliament yesterday that unsuccessful projects funded by the Chinese government during the previous regime will be turned into successful and profitable ventures by the government following a study tour in China.
"The Opposition is asking us whether we are shameless to go to China. But the real question is why the previous government bought a malfunctioning coal power plant for Norochcholai.
They should be shameful for that. Former Power and Energy Minister Pravithra Wanniarachchi herself admitted that the machines of the Norochcholai power plant stopped functioning at least on 30 occasions. "You did not listen to anyone and not allowed any opponent to speak during your regime.
The truth is that we inherited a ruined economy.
The economy was directed for the benefit of the rulers during the previous regime. Our government, the people, even the unborn have to bear the debt burden and the economic misadventures of the previous government," he said.

SriLankan, Air Bus MoU resulted in US$ 1.5 b loss
The MOU signed between the SriLankan Airlines and Air Bus Ltd to obtain wide body aircraft during the previous regime had resulted in losses amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion, Highways and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the adjournment motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the current economic situation of the country.
Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said the agreement was signed in March 2013 and added that the agreement was signed at the then Speaker's Residence.
He said that any agreement that SriLankan Airlines signs should be signed at its head office. He questioned as to why the same agreement was signed at the Speaker's Residence.
He also said the then Speaker had nothing to do with the high ranking politician who was behind the deal present at the occasion. Wickramaratne said it was a financial crime and should be probed.
He said the total loss of the SriLankan Airlines is expected to reach Rs. 150 million at the end of this month.
"Some promote that any state institution should remain with the government, no matter the heavy losses it incurs to the government," Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said. "But actual issue is not the ownership but its probability".

Bringing people to Hyde Park cannot cover up corruption, waste - Ravi
The corruption and waste committed during the previous regime cannot be covered up by bringing people to Hyde Park, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said the details of those corruptions would be divulged to the parliament one at a time and added that there is a disparity between the genuine expenditures of the previous government and what is noted in the accounts. Karunanayake said the missing amounts in the documents have been put into the pockets of the rulers of the previous regime.
The minister made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday and continued until yesterday evening.
This government had to take over a country which was indebted Rs. 1,774 billion. The income of the government was not adequate even to pay the recurrent expenditure.
Karunanayake said during the previous regime 1,800 cars were bought for Presidential Secretariat. The incumbent President even today does not know as to what had happened to them. The loss of this is around Rs. 35 billion.
"The loan that has to be settled on Hambantota Port is Rs 18,800 million," Minister Karunanayake said. "The previous government said the Hambantota Port earned a profit of Rs. 15 billion in 2014. But genuinely it is Rs 1.5 billion".
He said it was impossible to cover up these corruptions by bringing people to the Hyde Park.
The approval was given to spend Rs. 41 billion in 2004 but Rs. 95 billion has been spent. The building of the Finance Ministry is 75,000 square metres. Even the estimate of a square foot of a five star hotel is around Rs 12,000. But a Rs 31,000 has been spent on one square foot of this building.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa government has granted two-fold amount to construct the Norochchole Coal Power Plant that former President Chandrika Kumarathunga agreed.
Karunanayake said the UNP government agreed to construct the Southern Expressway at a cost of Rs. 42 billion in 2004 but the Mahinda Rajapaksa government constructed it at a cost of Rs 95 billion and added that it was an increase of 100 percent.
"Sarath N Silva who said he freed Mahinda Rajapaksa from counts against him when he was CJ is working with him now," Minister Karunanayake said and added that "These people who have double standards are questing the purity of this government".
The minister said that Mahinda Rajapaksa during his speech at the Hyde Park criticised the Courts. It was contempt of Court.
He said that a lead story of a Sinhala language newspaper had said that 100 MPs had liquor permits. But it was misleading and they had been granted since 2004 and none of the members of this government are among those MPs.

'Government working on number of projects to rescue country'
The government is working on a number of projects to rescue the country and the people from a parlous situation where there are a port without ships, an airport without planes and a conference centre without conferences, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said in Parliament yesterday.
The projects we are pursuing include a 1,000-acre industrial zone near the Hambantota port, an aviation hub for Mattala Airport as well as trade and logistics centres in the surrounding area, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The port will also be further developed. These plans are designed to reduce the massive debt burden imposed upon the people by the previous regime. The previous government pursued a policy which was inappropriate for a country like Sri Lanka. The quality of these investments was so poor that they are not earning or saving foreign exchange. Instead they have merely resulted in building up of an unsustainable debt burden. About US$ 8 billion was incurred as external debt, which contributed to financing white elephant projects like the port, airport, conference centre and the cricket stadium in Hambantota.
The minister made these observations during the adjournment debate moved by the Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday on the current economic situation of the country.
"Our government is hopeful that it can transform these projects which have already imposed an onerous burden on the people into viable businesses earning valuable foreign exchange through increased taxes and or a diversion of resources from high priority public expenditure, such as hospitals and schools.
"We are determined to restore the growth momentum in the economy to create high value employment rather than merely increase the size of an already over-sized public service in an unsustainable manner and to invigorate our export performances with the support of increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In this connection, it is extremely counter-productive that our efforts to create the conditions to attract investment and generate employment for our youth are being attacked for no good reason. The Partnership Agreements we are negotiating with China and India have the potential to be the corner stones of our development process.
"These agreements can give us access to capital, markets, technology, training and know-how to transform the economy for the benefit of our people. Those who are leading the campaign to attack our efforts should be aware that they are, in fact, undermining the path to prosperity of our people for narrow and self interested political gain. He said, over the last five years, the previous government substituted foreign commercial borrowing for the declining ODA. As this money was much more expensive, a high premium had to be attached to the prudent use of these borrowed resources. However, the opposite happened. Much of this expensive borrowings, which have to be paid back by the people, was wasted in the pursuit of a highly personalized family agenda.

JVP Leader questions transparency of tender procedure
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday questioned in Parliament the transparency of tender procedure on the project to construct 65,000 houses to resettle the displaced in the North and East.
He charged that a massive financial fraud had occurred during this tender procedure. Dissanayake pointed out the cost of a housing unit, which was earlier estimated at Rs 1.2 million, had been increased up to Rs 2.1 million.
The JVP Leader said this amount was questionable as the cost of a housing unit constructed under the housing project undertaken by India stands at Rs. 550,000 and the cost of a housing unit constructed with the EU funds stands at Rs. 650,000.
Dissanayake questioned whether the lowest bidder had been selected during the tender procedure. He said separate tenders should have been called for the construction of houses and supply of housing equipment to those houses and added that it was wrong to merge the two into one tender.
The MP also queried on an alleged financial irregularity on renting of a building by the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry. He stated the initial government valuation which was Rs. 3 million per month for this building had been revised following a request of the ministry secretary to Rs. 4.2 million. He said the amount misappropriated in this way for the renting period of three years would be Rs. 43.2 million.

'No-Confidence Motion against Amaratunga'
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage yesterday said in Parliament that a No-Confidence Motion would be presented against Land Minister John Amaratunga shortly.
He said the minister presented a false and distorted response to a question posed by him in Parliament on Wednesday, adding that the House lost the confidence on him due to this act.
Aluthgamage said the minister's reply to the House was contrary to the actual answer provided by the ministry secretary for the question posed by him. He also tabled the answer prepared by the ministry secretary with regard to the question.
The parliamentarian pointed out the Minister Amaratunga was deliberately trying to mislead the House. The MP asked in Parliament on Wednesday whether the government is attempting to take over a land known as Imbulpitiya Watta situated in Pasbage Divisional Secretariat Division in Nawalapitiya Electorate in which a Teachers' Village had been constructed.
The minister in response to the question said that he personally visited this location and found out that this particular land belonging to a Maha Vidyalaya had been divided into pieces and distributed among a group of selected people with the involvement of MP Aluthgamage.
He said the school had been deprived of a playground due to this act, adding that 21 land plots had been given to the friends of the MP, while the Principal and the OIC had also received land plots. He said the Land Reforms Commission had not given approval for this move.
However, at this point the MP argued that the LRC approval was given for the purpose.
The minister said the matter would be forwarded to the Attorney General as there are doubts on the legality of the activity.

'Considerable growth in economy'
Special Projects Minister, Dr. Sarath Amunugama told Parliament yesterday that there has been a considerable growth in the economy in 2015 with 4.8 percent growth of GDP.
As for the sub sectors, an agricultural sector recorded a growth of 5.5 percent and 3 percent growth was recorded in the industrial sector.
The service sector too had a growth of 5.3 percent. Sri Lanka has become self-sufficient in rice production. The paddy production is 4.8 million metric tones last year while it was only 4.2 million metric tones in 2014. Paddy has been cultivated in more than one million hectares across the country. Most of the government institutions have obtained huge loans from the state banks during the former regime.
The actual amount has not even been reported in documents. The loss of SriLankan Airlines is more than the amount allocated for education and health.

The Parliamentary sources revealed that the COPE has instructed the CEB high ranking officials including its General Manager when they were summoned before COPE yesterday to inquire into the recent power failures.
This was the first time that CEB officials were summoned before the COPE in connection with a power failure.
It was revealed that the COPE was not contended with the CEB's stance that the interruptionsoccurred not due to their inefficiency. The Parliamentary sources revealed that the CEB officials were of the stance that power had to be cut due to the coal power plant's security measure of turning itself off when a transformer bursts.

Jayakody reprimanded for flashing torch in Chamber
Speaker Karu Jayasuiya reprimanded UPFA Parliamentarian Sisira Jayakody who flashed a torch inside the House on Wednesday.
MP Jayakody was reprimanded and advised in the Speaker's office.
According Parliament sources, the MP had apologised for his behaviour and promised not to repeat such behaviour inside the Chamber of the Parliament in future. MP Jayakody had been summoned to the Speaker's office and was asked to explain as to why he flashed the torch inside the Chamber and pointed it towards the Chair and towards Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya during a parliamentary proceedings on the power crisis on Wednesday.
Jayakody said he did so in an innocent attempt to express his protest over the recent power breakdown.
