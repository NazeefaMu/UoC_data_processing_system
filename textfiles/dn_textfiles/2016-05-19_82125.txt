New Trinity coach Wijesinghe keen to win back Bradby

 New Trinity College head coach Sean Mark Wijesinghe is eager to leave a “great legacy” together with his assistant Saliya Kumara. Sean clearly sees plenty of talent in the current team, and believes that they will give off their best most importantly in the return ‘Bradby’ leg at Pallekele on Saturday and in the second round matches to follow.
Wijesinghe and Kumara are all out to bring back Trinity rugger to its former glory. All what the two coaches got to do is systematically guide the young players to play good rugby with their experience as player and coach.
When you perform well you win and performance is the key. The process is getting that consistency in performance. It's always the process first but, obviously, every team wants to win. Sean was head coach of Kandy Sports Club last season when they won the league and the knockout and Kumara was in charge of the backs.
Wijesinghe represented Trinity College Rugby in 2000 and 2001 under the captaincy of D.H.A. Luchow and T. Jayawardene. As a schoolboy Wijesinghe joined Kandy Sports Club, and he was given the best possible help by ‘Mr. Rugby’ Malik Samarawickrema. He captained Kandy SC in 2009 to win the triple championship and was once again called in 2014/15 season to lead the side when they were not faring well.
He did it in style in 2015. He represented the country in both 15-a-side and 7-a-side
Kumara started his rugby at Vidyartha College and in his last two years as a senior played for Trinity in 2002 and 2003. He played an important role for Trinity in the Bradby Shield encounter with Royal College in 2003 at Bogambara Stadium, where Trinity won 15/13. He kicked Trinity to victory in the dying stages of the game with a 35-meter drop goal.
Leaving school he turned out for Havelock SC in the inter-club rugby tournament. After a two year stint with the Park Club he moved over to CH and FC in 2006.
In 2009 he came over to Kandy on the invitation of Malik Samarawickrema and represented Kandy SC until 2015. Saliya led Kandy in 2012 when they ended as league champions.
He played for Sri Lanka at the Hong Kong Sevens no less than six times and also at the Commonwealth Games Rugby Championship, Asian Games Rugby and Rugby Asiad.
He first started coaching Vidyartha College and later assisted Kandy SC and now he is with Trinity.
The second leg of the Bradby at Pallekelle Stadium will start at 4 pm, the time has been advanced due to fading light. The under 18 game for the Simithrarachchi trophy will kick off at 2.45 pm.
