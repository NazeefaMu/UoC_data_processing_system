Trump invites Narendra Modi to the White House

 
US President Donald Trump has invited India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the United States during a phone call between the two leaders.
Washington said Trump saw India as a “true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world”.
“The two discussed opportunities to strengthen the partnership between the US and India in broad areas such as the economy and defence,” it said.
The US statement added that Trump and Modi resolved to “stand shoulder to shoulder in the global fight against terrorism”.
During the US election campaign, Trump was largely positive about India.
He praised Modi for championing bureaucratic reform and economic growth.
