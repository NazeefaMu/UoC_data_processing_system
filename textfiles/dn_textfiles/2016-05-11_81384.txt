Rankothge to blow at Bradby Second Leg

Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) elite ‘A’ panel and leading ‘A’ Division Referee Aruna Rankothge has been appointed by the Referees Society of the SLRFU to referee the second leg of the 72nd Bradby Shield match between Royal and Trinity at the Trinity Sports Complex in Pallekelle, Kandy on May 14.
Rankothge, a product of St. Sylvester’s College Kandy represented the 1st XV team from 1989-1991 and later turned out for Kandy Youths CC and Kandy Sports Club from 1992-1997 as a flanker.
His first coaching experience was at his alma mater St. Sylvester’s College and under his guidance they entered the Division one of the schools rugby tournament and put up a stunning display in defeating Trinity College at Pallekele in 1998. By a strange twist of fate Rankothge has successfully coached the Trinity junior rugby teams for several years before he quit.
Rankothge has 20 years experience in rugby refereeing both in Sri Lanka and at international matches. He has been in the Asian Rugby referees panel for a long time.
Locally he has officiated at top level club and school rugby matches including the prestigious Bradby clash between Trinity and Royal on three occasions before.
His experience in rugby refereeing has taken him to many countries like India, Pakistan, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Kazakhastan, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi.
He had the honour of refereeing at the under 20 Junior World Cup (IRB) qualifying matches in China (2004), Korea (2008), and Philippines (2009). He was also picked to officiate at the South East Asians rugby sevens tournament in Thailand (2007).
Rankothge was given a promotion and did the big league at the Asians Five nation encounter between Arabian Gulf and Hong Kong in Dubai and the India vs Kazakhstan encounter as an assistant referee.
He did another assignment at the Dubai Sevens in December 2010.
He is only behind Dilroy Fernando and Nizam Jamaldeen in terms of refereeing experience, especially at international level. He recently completed a Level III part-I (in Dubai 2011) and Referees Level III part-II (in Manila 2012).
“It’s a real honour as an experienced referee at my level to officiate the prestigious Bradby Shield which I have done three times before,” said Rankothge.
“I know the good and the bad of officiating at this traditional encounter since I was the referee at last year’s Bradby second leg encounter in Colombo. But personally for me it’s another match taking up the whistle as the in-charge and nothing more than that. I believe it’s the same feeling with other referees as well.” (WAI)
