A thespian’s gift

From the early sixties to mid seventies, thee Sri Lankan theatre scene saw the entry of quiet a number of plays of Tennessee Williams (1911 – 1983) being either translated and / or adapted by most Sinhalese playwrights and producers. In 1960, as I remember, my friend and the theatre course director of Ranga Shipla Salika, Dhamma Jagoda, adapted Williams’ most celebrated play titled as ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’, into Sinhala, naming the work as Ves Muhunu.
The local spectators had the chance of seeing a vibrant human experience erupting on the local stage, where two players, Ravindra Randenyia and Roma de Soysawere seen as gripping the audience spellbound. Perhaps the writer, director, Dhamma Jagoda may have been inspired by the two foreign productions of the original play. The original play came to be written and staged in 1947 in the US and in 1949, the same was produced in the UK. The film version was by Elia Kazan, the celebrated writer director.
The original play, in 11 scenes, by Williams rests on three main characters. Here, Stella Kowalski, living with Stanley, her husband in a poor quarter in New Orleans is visited by her sister Blanche Dubois, who is shocked to find Stella in a two-roomed apartment in desperate condition.
The sister tries to sympathise with her, which is not being either approved or liked by the husband, Stanley. On enquiry, she says that she is on leave of absence from the school in which she teaches, in order to recover from a serious nervous exhaustion. But Stanley feels that she lying to get monetary help from them. The dialogues that ensue seem to be packed with hyper sensitivity.
Stanley, driven by inquisitive nature, finds that the sister is dishonest, weak and possibly dismissed from her teaching career. There are quite a number of layers lying below the mere dialogues. Out of the three, each one of them has a painful story. What happens in the end may sound bizarre. Stanley tries to rape Blanche. But in a physical and mental derangement that is depicted, Stanley assaults her. This bears actual mental derangement that leads her to come out with a girlhood experience of her marriage to a homosexual who at a particular moment shoots himself.
The spectator is made to concentrate on many a living condition.
The visiting sister, or the sister-in-law of Stanley, is taken to an asylum. It is said that the title is used symbolically from the public service vehicle in which Blanche travelled the last stage of the journey to her sister’s place.
It is heartening to see the appearance of the text of ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ in Sinhala by a dramatist of fame, Mahavedage Champa Pushpa Buddhipala. This text for me is translated without changing the tenor of the original title. Titled in as Sinhala as ‘Ashave Veedi Riya’, the text had enabled a local production which had gone to the last round of the State Drama Festival. As I have not seen the local theatre production, I cannot comment on it. But may it be said that in comparison with the original text with a mix of American suburban flavour, it may have been an arduous ask in translation.
Buddhipala has overcome some of the barriers of transferring the meanings of the original text by way of notes and comments. This may enable the student of creative communication to feel that transferring the original textual meanings is not at all an easy possible mode of expression. All in all, I recommend the translation as a supplementary text for a wider field of creative writing.
Though quiet a number of plays of Williams’ is either adapted or translated into Sinhala and theatre production this may be the firs time that the flavour is made to feel as an unamended or abridged text into Sinhala. As such the text of the translation may sand as an independent work of creation. This actually is a Thespian gift in every sense.
