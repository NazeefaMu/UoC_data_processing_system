CIABOC to submit report tomorrow

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) will submit a report to court tomorrow (9) on the investigation nto the recent arrest of a senior official of the Presidential Secretariat and the chairman of a state corporation on charges of bribery.
CIABOC Commissioner Neville Guruge told the Daily News that the report will include the Commission’s findings on the above incident.
Earlier, the two officials were remanded till May 9 after being produced in court. The President’s Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation Chairman P Dissanayake were arrested while they were allegedly accepting a Rs. 20 million bribe from an Indian businessman last Thursday.
It is said that the bribe was a part payment from the total payment (bribe) of Rs.100 million. Although the bribe was allegedly originally decided to be Rs. 540 million, it was decreased to Rs.100 million after negotiations. The bribe was alleged to be about speeding up the process of obtaining approval for shares in the Kantale Sugar Factory. President Maithripala Sirisena issued an order on Thursday to interdict the two officials with immediate effect.
