Ginigathena building collapse due to poor construction: NBRO

The collapse of a two storey building in Ginigathena recently was due to poor construction and not because of an earth slip, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) said yesterday.
The two storey building caved in and later completely collapsed at Peragahamula, Ginigathena last Tuesday.
There were heavy damages to Hatton – Colombo Road as a result and vehicle movement had to be restricted to one lane.
A private business was operating at this site.
The authorities took measures to evacuate several families living close to the building.
NBRO officer Samantha Bogahapitiya after investigating the incident said that the building had been poorly constructed and the cave in had happened to structural deficiencies.
He also noted that the NBRO will conduct further studies in the area to see whether there was a threat to those residing close to the affected site.
