CBL Group recognized among ‘Top 10 Best Corporate Citizens’

CBL Group, one of Sri Lanka’s largest FMCG conglomerates which manufactures a range of food products under the brand names of Munchee, Ritzbury, Lanka Soy, Tiara, Samaposha and Sera was recently ranked as one of the “Top Ten Best Corporate Citizens” for the thirteenth time since the inception of the competition in 2004 by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
CBL Group was awarded a total of three accolades at Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2018, including the prestigious “Top Ten Best Corporate Citizen”, “Consistent Commitment and Continuous Improvement (last three years) - Employees Relations” and for the “Best Sustainability Project Award” for “Bio Fertilizer Production using Effluent Sludge”.
The Group’s award for continuous commitment to employees was the direct result of several long running programs promoting the development and advancement of employees. In fact, CBL enjoys industry-wide respect for its exemplary employee relations track record, with the group also having earned a coveted “Great Place to Work Sri Lanka” accreditation in 2017.
Additionally, CBL Group’s Best Sustainability Project Award was received for the Group Industrial Symbiosis activity - a group-wide initiative, converting biological effluent sludge into a bio fertilizer product.
This recent project, along with CBL’s past eco-friendly efforts, is a strong indicator of CBL’s exceptional commitment to the environment.
To be ranked among the “Top Ten Best Corporate Citizens” in Sri Lanka is a prestigious honor awarded due to the support and commitment given by CBL Group’s various stakeholders spanning across loyal employees to reliable and excellent distributors, retailers and suppliers with special acknowledgement of Sri Lanka’s most valuable and underappreciated resource, the farmers.
Over the past few years, CBL has enshrined sustainability as a pillar of its corporate culture, launching projects in essential areas such as agriculture and education to in-source important competencies that will prove vital in the future. To this end, CBL has also ventured into three fully-owned agricultural subsidiaries through which it has integrated with around 10,000 Sri Lankan farmers.
Organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2018 has been held for fifteen consecutive years.
Its objective is the promotion and recognition of Corporate Sustainability in Sri Lanka, while also encouraging businesses to adopt best sustainability practices in the creation of goods and services.
