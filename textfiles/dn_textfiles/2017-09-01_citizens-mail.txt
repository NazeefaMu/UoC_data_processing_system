Citizens' Mail

Cell phones: tools or toys?
Mobile phones are handy and are very useful if it is used in a proper moderate way. Sadly, it is misused in various ways. Most significantly, cell phones are used as toys by the kids. In the free trade and modern world, it has become an additional and fashionable rather than the real need. In the present days, most commonly, both the parents are employed and engaged in their official matters and other commitments. They rarely find time to keep an eye on their children as they are exhausted by professional and the household chores. As a result, they need some relaxation, by the time they allow their kids to be engaged in any of practices.
In common, children ask a lot of questions with full of energy, enthusiasm and with great mobility. So that parents feel it is appropriate to give a smart phone and let the children watch funny videos or get involved in some game. Knowingly, if they snatch the cell phones, they would start crying or nagging. Further to that, it is extremely a difficult task to pacify them. Therefore, they do not want to interrupt the kids as well as their peace. I have noticed and heard many mothers, simply saying that their child smashed the cell phone on the floor and it does not work. Since cell phones are electronic devices, they should be handled with utmost care at the appropriate stage. On the long run, it may affect the small one’s brain and speech disabilities as well.
Remarkably, parents must be serious about this issue. Noticeably, children strictly should not be given the cell phones as toys they are tools. A humble request for parents.
