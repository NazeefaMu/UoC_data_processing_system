Revolt against tradition

Kapila Balasuriya has trained with an unimaginable vigour and delved into tribal rituals for his bold dance shows. In his latest endeavour to deconstruct the Mohini legend, he is investigating the secret society believed to be brainwashing the modern generation
“I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole,” claims Kapila Balasuriya with somewhat a witty smile. He took time to describe the world of conspiracies, cults and celebrities that he has been exploring for his latest work to reinterpret the traditional version of Mohini. The choreographer has long been known for his brave and sometimes surprising choices, and for the depth of research he undertakes. He spent weeks in training while working with the professional contemporaries. None of his projects, though, has taken him into the popular strata in Sri Lanka. He is better known abroad.
Mohini is the only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. She is portrayed as an enchantress, who maddens lovers, sometimes leading them to their doom. Mohini is introduced into the Hindu mythology in the narrative epic of the Mahabharata. Here, she appears as a form of Vishnu, acquires the pot of Amrita (an elixir of immortality) from thieving asuras (demons), and gives it back to the devas (gods), helping them retain their immortality.
Many different legends tell of her various exploits and marriages, including union with Shiva. These tales relate, among other things, the birth of the god Shasta and the destruction of Bhasmasura, the ash-demon. Mohini’s main modus operandi is to trick or beguile those she encounters. She is worshipped throughout Indian culture, but mainly in Western India, where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa, the consort of Khandoba, a regional avatar of Shiva.
Named after this traditional celebrity, Kapila Balasuriya developed an aesthetic melodrama to portray a shadowy cult believed to be on an elaborate mission of global domination, spreading its agenda through the brainwashing of prominent individuals in politics and the media.
He also expects to expand his horizons with setting a world record by dancing for nine hours without an interval. “I am in the process of talking to the relevant government authorities to make it a reality. I hope they will offer me a helping hand,” Balasuriya said.
