BOC’s Ran Kakulu focuses on a secure  future for Sri Lanka’s children

Bank of Ceylon has an array of banking products and services in order to cater to the different needs of children. Ran Kekulu is a children’s savings account from Bank of Ceylon which is focused on building a secure future for the child. It offers a wide range of financial and non-financial benefits through Ran Kekulu accounts, which can be operated without any risk.
This account provides an additional 1% interest and offers the account holder hospitalization/medical insurance charges up to Rs. 100,000 that covers 10 critical illnesses.
Further an insurance cover is available for the depositor who opens the account up to a maximum of Rs 500,000. The depositor becomes eligible for an insurance cover to a maximum of Rs. 1 million if he or she maintains multiple Ran Kekulu accounts depending on the account balance.
Furthermore, 2,000 scholarships worth Rs. 15,000 each are granted annually to Ran Kekulu account holders that emerge successful at the grade 5 scholarship examination. A minimum balance of Rs. 5,000 maintained in a Ran Kekulu account qualifies the account holder for most of the privileges mentioned here.
“With the stability built over the years as a state owned Bank, BOC is the safest place for your hard earned money especially for a profitable long term investment for your child. The uniqueness in this scheme is that parents can actually aim for a specifically targeted balance rather than saving randomly not knowing, what the final balance might be,” stated the Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara.
This newest investment plan is offered to children of ages one to fifteen. There are four types of investment plans offered by the bank from Rs.500,000 and going to as much as Rs. 1 million, Rs. 2 million and up to Rs. 5 million as the return at the maturity which yields an annual interest rate of 8% per annum over the entire investment period.
The account will have to be maintained till the child reaches 18 years of age to obtain this benefit. The investment duration and the monthly installment will vary accordingly to the final amount selected and the age of the child at the starting point.
However this investment plan will accommodate children who are younger than 15 years of age in order to meet the minimum investment period required. A parent, guardian or any other individual can open the account on behalf of the child.
After opening the account all deposits can be made seamlessly by logging into the Bank’s online banking facility or through any of the available cash deposit machines at any time of the day or at any of the Bank’s 628 branches.
Customers can also simply place a standing order covering the full investment duration to ensure a timely deposit is made to the beneficiary account from the depositors account at one time.
Further information can be obtained through the Bank’s website, Facebook page, through twitter or from the Bank’s LinkedIn page and from the nearest BOC branch. In the case of no installment being made to the account either consecutively and/or intermittently the Bank will give a concession/grace period up to a maximum of six months or if it exceeds the grace period the outstanding will be transferred to a Ran Kekulu account under the name of the child.
14 Plus is another special savings account introduced for teenagers between the ages of 14-17. The account was designed to give users the first hand experience in managing the account and to draw attention away from unwanted spending sprees that are common to this age group.
A voluntary savings of pocket money is encouraged here at an early age and account holders are entitled to a BOC Debit Card to access their accounts from ATM’s island wide.
As the No.1 leading bank in Sri Lanka the Bank believes that it has a greater responsibility towards the country therefore it takes a special interest in empowering children of the country to face their future challenges and invites parents to invest and build a better future.
