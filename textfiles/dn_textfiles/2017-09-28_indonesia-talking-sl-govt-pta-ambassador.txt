Indonesia talking to SL govt for PTA - Ambassador

Indonesia is in discussions with the Sri Lankan government to ink a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) to promote trade and investment opportunities between the two countries, Indonesian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Gusti Ngurah Ardiyasa said.
To this end, a feasibility study is currently being undertaken.
The Ambassador made these views when speaking at a seminar on ‘Bilateral Trade between Sri Lanka and Indonesia’, organized by the National Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday.
“There is vast economic and trade potential that can be explored between the two nations,” the Indonesian Ambassador said.
