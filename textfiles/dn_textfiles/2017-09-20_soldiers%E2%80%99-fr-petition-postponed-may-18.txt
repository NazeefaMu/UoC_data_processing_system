Soldiers’ FR petition postponed for May 18

When the fundamental rights petition filed by former army private Nishantha Mihiraj claiming Rs 10 million as damages for losing an eye in the police attack conducted by disabled war heroes demanding persons rights came up for hearing before a two judge bench of the Supreme Court presided by Justices Eva Wanasundera and Sisira de Abrew yesterday, the Attorney General informed Court that the injured soldier had been sent for treatment to Singapore at State expense.
Attorney Suharshi Herath appearing on behalf of the Attorney General said the disabled soldiers conducted the protest ignoring a court order prohibiting it and the police had to use force to control the situation when demonstration turned violent. The bench after considering the submissions made decided to hear the petition postponed hearing for May 2, 2018 and noticed the respondents to appear in Court on that day.
Attorney Kalyananda Thiranagama appeared for the petitioner.
