NUWAN KULASEKERA -  A Captain’s dream cricketer

He always sported a knowing smile with his team mates and also his opponents. Yet he was a viper with ball in hand. He sent sent down deliveries which had venom written in them. If this was NUWAN KULASEKERA’S way of saying he was a ‘smiling viper’ he did it with calculated ease.
KULESEKERA MUDIYANSELAGE DINESH NUWAN KULASEKERA’s was one of the most likeable characters one could meet. When he was in the thick of things in local and international cricket he proudly sported the country’s cap with great pride and distinction.
Success or failure did not matter to him. What mattered most was playing of the game in the true spirit, always endeavoring to win games for his side, playing clean and hard. What matters most was that the game should be played with grace whether one won or lost.
Winsome smile
As a cricket correspondent I have been with him on many tours abroad and can vouch for his attributes. He always had that winsome smile writ on his face but endearing as he was he was always competitive in the true spirit of the game. That is what is expected from a true sportsman. Winning or losing is not what matters, but how one played the game goes the axiom. And KULESEKERA had these attributes from the time he stepped on to a cricket field. He was a medium pace bowler, yet devastating with his master swing both ways. He had a well disguised slow ball and when letting go a bouncer that was venomous and which batsmen preferred to move away rather than attempt to hook and get hit by his well directed bouncer and suffer anguish and pain.
Second to none
As a batsman, he was second to none. On his day and he could prove as devastating as he is with ball when having bat in hand and fighting to save or having the opportunity to score for his team when victory was beckoning.
As a fielder he had a safe pair of hands, always on the look out to grab the catch, whether it was a sitter or a difficult one. He was aware that catches win matches and a drop would not always mean losing, but it could make winning that much more difficult. He was always a captain’s dream team man.
After walking the cricket fields here and abroad and being a role model and an example every budding cricketer would be fortunate to have and follow, he bid adieu when everyone was asking why and why not. There was no doubt that he enjoyed the spills and thrills associated with the great game of cricket.
Economical bowler
A bowler of KULASEKERAS’S class who had the abilities of bowling economically concentrating on line and length and being miserly in conceding ruins should have been let loose in more Test matches than the 21 he played in his career.
But the selectors and the coaches were convinced that he was especially a bowler who would have been ideally suited for the ‘cowboy game‘ where he would not leak runs and fronted him up in 184 ODIS and 58 T20S. Without a murmur he took what was served to him in his plate and gave of his best.
KULASEKERA is best remembered for bowling a death over spell where along with skipper Lasith Malinga he throttled the Indian batting with some well directed deadly yorkers that the Indian batsmen failed to score off however hard they tried. He was one of the architects when he won the Twenty20 World Cup putting the Indians to second best which would have been galling to them.
Memorable
He will not easily forget his memorable one-day international debut which was against England at Dambulla where he bowled economically to take 2 for 18 and help bundle out the Brits for 88 which the Sri Lankan openers obtained in 14 over to score a 10-wicket victory.
KULASEKERA was born on July 22,1982 in Nittambuwa and educated at Bndaranayake College, Gampaha. He made his Test debut on April 4, 2005 against New Zealand and played his last Test on March 16, 2013 against Bangladesh. He debuted in ODIS in November 18, 2003 against England and played his final ODI on JULY 10, 2017 against Zimbabwe. T20 debut on October 11, 2008 and bid adieu on April 6, 2017 against Bangladesh.
KULASEKERA was in great demand by Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League and also played for Colts CC, Galle CC, Kandurata Maroons, Combined Provinces, Basnahira North.
