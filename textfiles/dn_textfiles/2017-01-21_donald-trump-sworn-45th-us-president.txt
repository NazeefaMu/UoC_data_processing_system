Donald Trump sworn in as 45th US President

Donald Trump has pledged a “great national effort” to be rebuild America after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
The 70-year-old billionaire took the oath of office on the west steps of the US Capitol in Washington and brought the curtain down on the presidency of Barack Obama.
In his inaugural address, Mr Trump promised to transfer power from Washington to the people, and pledged a “great national effort” to rebuild the country.
Mr Trump said January 20 would be remembered as “the day the people became the rulers of this nation again”.
“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” the new President said.
Mr Trump added: “From this day forward it’s going to be only America first.
“We must protect our border from the ravages of other countries. I will fight for you with every breath of my body and I will never let you down.”
Continuing the populist tone of his victorious campaign,
Mr Trump said that a “small group” in Washington had “reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. “Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. SKY News
