Prof Uditha Liyanage commemorated

Postgraduate Institute of Management Alumni Association (PIMA) collaborated with Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) to commemorate and appreciate the late Prof Uditha Liyanage's contribution to the marketing fraternity in the country and beyond.
The PIM library was re-named as the Prof Uditha Liyanage Momorial Library on the occasion.
A review on Prof Liyanage's book ‘Consumer Strategy’ was made by the keynote speaker Deepal Sooriyaarachchi who is a Chartered Marketer, advertising professional, management consultant, trainer and author.
Sooriyaarachchi said Prof Uditha Liyanage as a mentor elevated the standards of management and marketing to higher levels and walked the talk by practising what he preached.
“Prof Liyanage had always advised his students to ‘be brilliant in basics'. Following the footsteps of the legacy he left, we abide by his philosophical and experiential concepts and his teachings.
"I met Uditha in the corporate world. Our discussions mainly revolved around Buddhism and marketing. I see him as a strategist and sociologist who also had a sense for the market as an academic and a philosopher.
"An essential ability of a strategist is his ability to forecast the future. In the chapter on CSR in his book he re-defines how a business should be and invites corporates to re-think the approach towards CSR.
"He wanted students to understand that strategy development is not planning.
"A marketer is essentially a sociologist and Uditha was a fine example. He emphasized looking after the consumer constantly. He has researched the evolving Sri Lankan consumer in his book and his understanding on the local consumer is profound."
"I invite SLIM and CIM to continue this research work as the Sri Lankan consumer is evolving and Uditha has formed a healthy base to build on.
"He once said, “If you do not know who Gunadasa Kapuge is, Mr Marketer...you have lost your plot, since Colombo is not Sri Lanka.”
"In the Sri Lankan context, while on one side we want to be modern, at the same time we are deeply rooted in tradition. This deep rooted reality is unique to us thus marketers and social changers should understand that.
"Tangibalizing the intangible is commonly taught in marketing. Uditha went beyond that and got insights for these facts from the deep Buddhist teachings to opine that there are different levels of tangibility to determine pitching an offer appropriately.
"Uditha said there can be more than functional and emotional values for a consumer on a product or service. He shed light on a five-fold value package, that is, functional, experiential, relational, social and psychological as different value propositions.
"Uditha came up with these concepts after having done significant research.
"I invite SLIM to put some of Uditha's work into the syllabus and allow Sri Lankan marketers to benefit from these theories or else they will remain only in the domain of textbooks. CIM too could treat these as valuable stuff to add value to Kotler's marketing," said Sooriyaarachchi.
Dr Wickrema Weerasooria said, “People regarded PIM and Uditha as one. Uditha was not the traditional academic. He came to academia via business. What propelled him to the high pedestal that he ultimately attained was his ability as an eloquent speaker, communicator and a lucid thinker.
"Being tall, slim and handsome and fit and sporting his well groomed Gallic mustache, he stood out in any gathering. That was his signature look. He had a wonderful sense of humour. He always had the genuine passion for the subject at hand.
"He told us at PIM to go back to basics and teach the elementary stuff which became the theme of every seminar of ours.
Many people jump the basics and try to be very eloquent and important, which people do not understand”, said Dr Weerasooriya.
A panel discussion took place moderated by PIM Director and Chairman of the Board of Management, Prof Ajantha Dharmasiri with Founder of CIM Sri Lanka, Eardley Perera and CIM Sri Lanka President, Asanga Ranasinghe. Prof Dharmasiri defined late Prof Liyanage as a legend and ‘Sage of our Age'.
Eardly Perera who had been a teacher of Prof Uditha Liyanage said, “Uditha commenced teaching with the very consumer centric subject: the behavioural aspects of marketing. He was consumer centric, strategy driven and research oriented.
Thus Uditha blossomed to be one of Sri Lanka's most sought-after lecturers in management and marketing.”
Sriyani Liyanage and Chathuri Liyanage, beloved wife and daughter of the late Prof Liyanage attended the commemoration along with a gamut of marketers and past and present PIM students.
