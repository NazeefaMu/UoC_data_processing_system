Stolen diaries found in Berlin

They’re among over 100 items belonging to The Beatles icon to be recovered John Lennon’s diaries have been found in Berlin – and are among over a hundred stolen items belonging to the Beatles musician to be recovered by police.
Lennon’s diaries are currently on display at Berlin police headquarters – along with two pairs of his iconic round specs, a tape recording of a Beatles concert, sheet music and a cigarette case. The collection of items were stolen from Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono back in 2006.
According to the BBC, German media have reported that Ono has identified the goods from photos she was shown at the German consulate in New York.
Many of the items were confiscated in July after being found at an auction house in the German capital, which prompted police to hunt for the remaining stolen goods.
Police said that a 58-year-old man has been arrested, while a second suspect – who used to work for Ono – is currently “unattainable”, according to Martin Steltner, a spokesman for the Berlin prosecutor’s office.
Back in October, a collection of previously-unseen John Lennon photographs were unveiled at The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool.
26 negatives, dating back to 1970, were revealed at a memorabilia day at The Beatles Story Museum in the band’s hometown.
The 1992 letter, written to Chapman’s pen pal ‘Michael’, contained Chapman’s claim that “Jesus is a real, living person I have come to know.”
“Jesus is everything,” he wrote. “I have found this through the many long years here at Attica [the New York state jail where he was imprisoned until 2012].
“He chose to die so that our sins – even mine – could be forgiven. Twelve years ago I shot and killed the rock superstar John Lennon, formerly of The Beatles. Let me say here that it was a horrible occurrence, I have never forgotten it.” NME
