Girl not expelled from school, Gampaha education director asserts

The alleged expulsion of a girl suspected to be HIV+ from her school has once again drawn much public outrage and criticism mostly against public officials and the school for not being supportive of a student despite false accusations.
The Grade 5 schoolgirl, who was studying at the Gampaha - Ganemulla Kudabollatha Sri Sumangala Vidyalaya, was allegedly expelled from school over fears that she maybe HIV+. Her mother along with a relative staged a sit-in protest outside the Zonal Education Director’s office in Gampaha since Monday, accusing the department for their failure to ensure that the school permits the child to study.
The Daily News, however, contacted the Zonal Director of Education, W. Mallika who emphasized that the school had not made any decision pertaining to the student and it was the student who failed to turn up at school.
“The school has not expelled nor suspended the child. We checked with them and there have been no issues, as those suggested by the child’s mother,” the director said. “The student had not turned up at school at all. Neither have the parents persuaded the child to attend school.”
The director added that Gampaha Police also intervened in the matter and arranged for the Principal to meet with the child and her parents in the presence of the police. “We requested them to come and discuss their issues. Although the Principal of the school turned up, the child or her mother failed to attend the meeting.”
The director said the child’s mother has to realize that their efforts such as these protests would have far reaching consequences on the child’s future. “It is up to the child’s parents to realize the extent of the damage their actions would have on their child.” The director added that the child’s mother was a member of a movement supporting HIV+ persons and it was unclear if the mother was intentionally trying to draw public ire and attention so that they may benefit financially from the organization and its international partners.
