JO requests Speaker for two day debate on Bond issue

The Joint Opposition (JO) said on yesterday that they will request a two day debate from the speaker on the controversial gazette notification in connection with the Central Bank Bond issuance and the current economic situation in the country.
Speaking to the media in Colombo JO MP Dinesh Gunewardene said there were a lot of confusion with regard to the Bond issue and there was an impending economic crisis, adding that the JO will challenge the government to go for a parliamentary debate.
Gunewardne said the joint opposition had told the Central Bank Governor during the recent meeting that one cannot be satisfied with the measures taken to probe the Bond issue.
He noted that there was an impending economic crisis due to the imprudent management of the economy and questioned what the government has done to avert the crisis.
“The government should come up with answers to these issues.
The people deserves to know the truth and Parliament is the best forum to discuss them,” he added.
He said the JO will call for the removal of the Finance Minister as his conduct and performance so far has not been satisfactory.
