Cash bonuses are presented to Life policyholders who have completed their 10th, 15th, 20thand 25thpolicy years as at 31st December 2016. These bonuses are computed at Rs 100 for every Rs 1,000 of the sum assured for policyholders who have completed 25 years, while policyholders who have completed 20 years are eligible to receive a cash bonus computed at Rs 75 per Rs 1,000 sum assured, those who have completed 15 years Rs 50 per Rs 1000 sum assured and those who have completed 10 years Rs 25 per Rs 1000 sum assured.
