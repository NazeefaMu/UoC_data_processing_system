EPC needs more power: Chief Minister

The Eastern Provincial Council should have Police and Land powers as ensured by the Provincial Councils Act of 1987, Eastern Province Chief Minister Hafiz Nazeer Ahamed said.
He was speaking to US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Biswal when she called on him on Thursday.
Chief Minister Ahamed further stressed that in 1987, power was decentralised in our country under the 1978 Constitution with the establishing of Provincial Councils.
The Chief Minister told Biswal to urge the government to ensure the province will receive Land and Police powers.The Eastern Provincial Council administration is a role model to the other Provinces. “The resettlement process of displaced people after the war have not been carried out properly,” he said.
Eastern Province Ministers and Provincial Council members were also present.
