Passengers stranded without extra trains for festive season

A large number of long-distance commuters were heavily inconvenienced during the weekend due to the lack of trains from Colombo Fort and Mt. Lavinia.
Although it was a long weekend, the Railway Department had not scheduled any extra trains for long-distance terminals such as Badulla, Jaffna and Kankasanturai, and Batticoloa.
The usual trains to these terminals were crowded and it resulted in many passengers facing difficulties and travelling on footboard.
Long queues formed in front of the ticket counters at the main stations. Some passengers were unable to get on the trains although they had purchased tickets after being in the queue from early morning.
At some stations such as Ragama, Polgahawela and Maho, Railway security had to be summoned to control the situation.
However, this situation was highly criticised not only by the passengers, but also by Railway workers.
Locomotive drivers and guards who did not wish to be named said there were many passengers who couldn’t get on the trains. Trains had to run late due to this situation. According to them, extra compartments could have been added to some long-distance trains to ease the situation.
A Station Master speaking to the Daily News said it would be better if some extra trains were run during the festive season.
Some trains were delayed at the station by nearly 20 minutes. This situation was experienced, not only during the weekend, but from Friday night.
Passengers said they were in the queues from the early morning, but it was very difficult to get on to the trains. This is the festive season and with the Unduwap Poya falling on Saturday, the Sripada season too has started. It is also the school vacation.
The lack of extra train services during this period was not only a difficulty for passengers, but also a huge loss of income for the country’s most popular transport service.
Railway’s General Manager Dilantha Fernando confirmed that no special trains have been deployed so far for the festive season.
But, considering the prevailing congestion, only a few ad-hoc solutions were provided by deploying an extra train to Nanu Oya and attaching three extra compartments to the Rajarata Rajina express train.
Lack of sufficient resources including drivers on duty during this season has been the reason for this situation, he said.
We wish to bring this to the attention of the Transport Minister, Railway General Manager and relevant authorities on behalf of inconvenienced passengers.
