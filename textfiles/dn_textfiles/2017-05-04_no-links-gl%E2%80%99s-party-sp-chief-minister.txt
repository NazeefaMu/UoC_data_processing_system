No links with GL’s party: SP Chief Minister

SLFPers do not wish to maintain any political connection with the party led by former Minister G.L. Peiris, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
The Chief Minister said: "We are concerned over Sri Lanka Freedom Party members who joined the May Day rally organised by another group."
He was addressing the media at Dakshina Paya, Southern Province Ministerial Complex yesterday.
He said there is an ideological conflict in the party.
"We extend our earnest solicitation to SLFPers to unite under the blue colour banner of the party. Party doors are open to all," he said.
"We conducted the 2017 May Day celebration more impressively than all our past events with a record number of participants. Party cadres from all over the country took part in the rally," de Silva said.
