St.Joseph’s, Wattala emerge U15 Division two Champions

St.Joseph’s College, Wattala romped home with the 2016 - U15 D11 Championship after a superb game of cricket with two players making the headlines. Wattala school after scoring a mammoth 401 for seven in just 90 overs in reply to the meagre total of 112 scored by Prince of Wales, who batted first on winning the toss, won the first innings advantage that was sufficient for them to become Champions as an outright win was highly unlikely in this high-scoring two-day final concluded on 12th September in front of a partisan crowd at Wesley ground.
Prince of Wales led by Yohan Kariyawasam opted to bat first after they won the toss, but they were soon in trouble as their batsmen looked decidedly uncomfortable against an attack led by skipper, Isuru Pinto from the front.
Cambrians’ innings imploded in just under 49 overs for a paltry score of 112 as their batsmen failed to put-together any batting partnership. Other than Savin Appuhami (28) and Akalanka Peiris (22*) no other POW batsman could come out with a sizable score as Isuru Pinto completed a masterly five-for conceding mere 32 runs.
Prince of Wales chances for a first-innings triumph which was the most important achievement in this two-day game immediately faded away after Joseph openers, Isuru Pinto and Pasindu Jayath got off to a dominant start that produced 130 runs for the first wicket before a glorious 228-run stand between Pinto and Kavishka Zenith for the second wicket deprived the Moratuwa school of any hopes of an outright win either.
Isuru Pinto’s 107 scored off 250 balls with 14 fours that actually paved the way for a bigger total was however over-shadowed by the entertaining 113 Shashika Umayanga scored from just 91 balls with 13 fours and five well-hit sixes that helped St.Joseph’s go past the enormous 400-run mark proving their absolute dominance in this all important final.
Prince of Wales: 112 in 48.5 overs (Savin Appuhami 28, Akalanka Peris 22*, Isuru Pinto 5/32)
St. Joseph’s, Wattala: 401/7 in 90 overs (Isuru Pinto 107, Shashika Umayanga 113*, Pasindu Jayath 52, Kavishka Senith 51, Akalanka Peris 2/49, Yohan Kariyawasam 2/90)
