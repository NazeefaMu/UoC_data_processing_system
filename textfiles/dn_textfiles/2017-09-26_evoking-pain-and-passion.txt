Evoking pain and passion

Some say there is a reason for everything. And there is reason why Roshan Jayakody is on this earth. By profession he is an IT engineer working in Europe – France and UK. Jayakody is here to evoke emotion in his audience. He is here to bring us into contact with our innermost desire and our innermost fears. Why would a man of computers be interested in music? It can only be this passion he has to give some meaning to the chaotic life that we all live in. Melodies talks to Roshan Jayakody who needs to make other people feel what he is feeling.
“I have released two CDs on August 26. One CD is called ‘Supun Sandak Paaya Bodu Bathi Gee’ which has about 16 tracks, all of which are Buddhist devotional songs and the second one is a semi classic also with around 16 songs called ‘Neela Nayana’.
If you take the tracks on ‘Neela Nayana’ it touches on themes of family and love. There is a track 13 on ‘Neela Nayana’, where it talks about the importance of having a good wife who will take care of the children. Track 14 talks about the transient nature of life and the final inevitable outcome which is death. In which one becomes just a memory,” explains Jayakody.
Jayakody does not desire fame. He only wants to make other people feel his pain and his passion. He wants to share how he sees life with others. He wants his music to appeal to people because music is the medium he uses to communicate his vision. It is how he communicates his perception of life to his fans.
“I am not planning to be famous artist in the future. My idea is to give out high quality creations to society. When I select songs I always consider the lyrics and the meaning it brings out. I also pay a lot of attention to the way they have put the words together. For Bodu Bathi Gee, I have composed all the music – the melodies. Some of the songs are written by me as well. Tharindu Jayathilake composed the music tracks for all of these,” said Jayakody.
In ‘Neela Nayana’ features many famous names who composed the music for Jayakody. Some of the songs were written by Jayakody as well. So it is a mix of professional and novice artistes. Jayakody says that a lot of people have put very high quality lyrics on FB, and don’t really know it will become a song one day.
Jayakody makes you think when you listen to his lyrics.
What you do for others might have little significance to you but it means a lot for that person. For example his song about mothers has received very positive feedback. Jayakody’s underlying theme is love. When he sings about death he sings about the pain one experiences when having lost a loved one.
“When I chose the lyrics they were really surprised and grateful. Most of the songs have gained much acceptance and love by my fans. One track 16, is an appreciation of the country we live in which was actually written by a Muslim girl. She has written a few songs for me. The talent she has is really marvelous and her name is Shamila Hussain. Some songs have evoked emotions of pathos within people. They have called me up saying the songs have reminded them of their mothers, saying the songs are sad but beautiful,” pointed out Jayakody.
Jayakody’s journey in music started at a very young age. At the age of three he began to show an ability to reach out to others. He started to show a certain way of tapping into the way others felt and started to experience so many emotions.
“Music is in me, and I started showing signs of promise at the age of three. Then I learnt to play the Piano on my own. I started to study Hindustani music while at school. I really dedicated myself to studying these Indian forms of classical music and then I went to Europe. I studied Classical Music as well in Europe. So I plan on putting out some more creations in the near future,” said Jayakody.
People really know of him through word of mouth. Even though his career is in IT, music is his driving force. He also expressed a desire to do what he can for the music industry in Sri Lanka
“Last year, February 10, I recorded/ voiced 63 songs in one day. I consider that quite an achievement. Some of them are in my CDs. I am also working on some more songs which I find exciting. Now my themes are becoming more complicated with deeper meaning. I am very selective now,” added Jayakody.
His endeavors have been well received. This is because he genuinely loves his music.
“This is not a very commercial venture for me at all. I just want to give something back to society for what I have received from life. For the CD release, I had a big concert and on the same day I released the CD,” stated Jayakody.
Performance wise and music wise the concert was a success, but the crowd turnout was quite moderate. Apart from FB and YouTube, he does not have much of a local crowd. But has a considerable following on FB and YouTube.
