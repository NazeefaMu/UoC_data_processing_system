GMOA requests for NFTH ownership agreement copy from government

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) expressed its disapproval of the Government's failure to provide a copy of the agreement signed which saw the ownership of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) handed over to the Government, yesterday.
The GMOA sent a letter to the Health Ministry Secretary, asking him to issue a copy of the agreement under the Right to Information Act.
The GMOA also charged that the nationalization of the NFTH is only the fulfillment of the wishes of Dr. Neville Fernando and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and not the people of this country.
Addressing the media at the OPA yesterday, GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen de Zoysa said the nationalization of SAITM is not a people-friendly decision and it was a decision by Minister Rajitha Senaratne only for the betterment of Dr. Neville Fernando.
He predicted that Minister Dr. Senaratne and those who are involved in the SATIM financial fraud would be summoned by a special commission to obtain statements.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the Government had placed the lives of people in danger by allowing people to receive treatment at NFTH without recruiting trained doctors and nurses.
He said that SAITM needs 200 medical officers, 6 dental surgeons, 30 consultants and 350 nurses. The entire health sector of the country would be badly affected, if the government will take measures to transfer medical officers, consultants, nurses and others from government hospitals to the NFTH.
Addressing the occasion, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Chandana Dharmaratne said SAITM was not an issue of the medical fraternity, medical students or the university students; it is the public's issue.
"If this SAITM saga continues, it would have a detrimental effect on people's lives and free healthcare system in this country, as well as the free education system," he said.
"We doubt the hospital was actually taken over by the government. Because the Chairman is still the same person and the medical director says he is still the medical director, though a new director has been appointed by the health minister," he added.
He further said the health ministry is spending Rs. 240 million per year as operational expenditure. The loan amount is Rs. 3 billion. Neville Fernando has paid Rs. 1 billion up to now another Rs. 2 billion still remain. The loan amount will be paid by Nevil Fernando, Rs. 300 million per year and the government will spend Rs. 2.4 billion per year.
“We ask the rationale behind the taking over of the NFTH, instead of nationalizing the entire SAITM institute. NFTH is not providing free treatment for the people of the country. If 150 students are enrolled to SAITM, Neville Fernando will collect Rs. 1.8 billion as fees,” he added.
He further said the hospital was running at a loss, but SAITM has profits. So what is at a loss has been taken over by the Government and is being run with the people’s money for the benefit of an individual and his family. "The deans of all medical faculties have agreed that SAITM has to be abolished and the recruitment of students as well as degree awarding has to be stopped.
"As a democratically-elected government, listen to the voice of the people and nationalize SAITM; bring about a solution to this burning issue as soon as possible for the benefit of the people of the country," Dr Chandana added.
