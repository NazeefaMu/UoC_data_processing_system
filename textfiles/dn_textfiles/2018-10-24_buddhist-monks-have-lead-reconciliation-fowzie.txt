Buddhist monks have to lead reconciliation - Fowzie

Buddhist monks should lead the reconciliation process in the country, National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting held in the Moneragala Public Library Auditorium on Monday on institutionalize national unity and co-existence. He said that religious leaders should work together to bring in reconciliation.
“We must create a safe human-friendly environment for our young generation.
They will blame for us if we do not achieve it”, the State Minister said. The State Minister said that labeling schools as Buddhist, Hindu and Muslims is the main cause for aggravating the ethnic issue and it directly affects the reconciliation process.
“Politics in our country causes ethnic issues as many of the power-hungry political elements mislead the public and they become extremists to do any wrong thing for their own benefit without thinking the repercussion,” Minister Fowzie said.
Minister Fowzie said Sri Lankans never become Sinhala, Muslim or Hindu by birth and these religious consciousness is within themselves because of cultural effect, but all born to serve the human beings.
It is a timely need to lead our lives sans class, creed and caste to enjoy reconciliation, Fowzie said. “The teachers of religious institutions play a key role in shaping children,“ he said.
The State Minister urged the teachers to render their service to inculcate good morals in children. He said the government take all measures to bring in peace among all religions in the country. National Unity and Co-existence Ministry Secretary Sujan Nanayakkara, Uva Provincial Council Member Kuda Bandara Medawela and Moneragala District Secretary D.S. Pathmakulasuriya spoke.
Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim religious leaders, teachers of religious schools and other dignitaries participated.
