No proper administration today - MR

People have now realized the true form of the so-called Good Governance Government they elected with open arms. The issue regarding the appointment of the Central Bank Governor itself has created a grave crisis within the government, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Bentota on July 01.
He said more crises have erupted in the government due to lack of unity and mutual understanding among members of the government who are acting according to their own whims and fancies.
Rajapaksa expressed these sentiments when confronted by the media, while he was engaged in his morning constitutional along the Bentota beach yesterday.
Asked for his comments on Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma’s statement expressing a desire to join him (Rajapaksa) if attempts to admit a group of children to a school in Matugama failed, Rajapaksa replied, “That’s why I said this is the true form of Good Governance Government.”
Rajapaksa said there is no proper administration in the country today.
No one knew who was governing the country. All local councils have been dissolved and education was in shambles. This was a strange system of governance people had never experienced.
