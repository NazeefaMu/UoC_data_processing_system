EV charging points in  Tenaga parking locations

Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd, has collaborated with JLanka E-Mobility (Pvt) Ltd, to make urban life easier for electric vehicle drivers. Through this partnership JLanka E-Mobility will deploy EV charging points in designated Tenaga parking locations.
Motorists will use a single interface for both parking and charging – with charging an EV (Electric Vehicle) also means parking it. What Tenaga’s Park Smart offers drivers of EV’s is one single interface for convenient start, stop and extending of charging and parking transactions. Letting charging become an integrated part of the Park Smart parking experience makes life for EV drivers easier. Keeping both charging and parking together in one user flow means there is no need for dual user interfaces and separate flows and for drivers who use the mobile app for parking; making the task so much easier.
“Our vision is to make it as convenient as possible for drivers to find and pay for parking in the city. With our app you can already start, stop and extend your parking – no matter whether you are at a meeting, in a café or shopping. Now we are looking to make it easier to be an EV-driver as well, by allowing users to pay for parking and charging through just one transaction”, said Duminda Jayatilake, Managing Director of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd.
“Sri Lanka is somewhat slow in adapting to EVs, mainly due to lacking infrastructure. This initiative will contribute to the creation of smarter and more sustainable solution that helps create greener and a more livable city” said Sujeeva Premaratne – Head of Business of JLANKA E-Mobility (Pvt.) Ltd.
The user experience starts off with a registration flow, either through one of the smartphone apps, the web or a call to the call centre.
With the GPS enabled ParkSmart App, motorists will be able to check location of charging points and if they are available or not. Customers will be able to pay for their EV charging through the Park Smart app in which payment options such as eZcash, M-Cash, FriMi, Visa, MasterCard, and Amex are all available.
