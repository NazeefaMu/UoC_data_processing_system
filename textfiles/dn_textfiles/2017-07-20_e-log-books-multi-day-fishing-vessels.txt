E-log books for multi-day fishing vessels

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to provide e-log books for all multi-day fishing vessels to enter fish harvest information, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The ministry will provide e-log books for 2,328 multi-day fishing vessels at a cost of Rs. 78 million. “According to international laws, it is compulsory to maintain records of fish catch information by multi-day fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in international waters and provide the information to the European Union (EU) to avoid the mismanagement of fisheries resources,” said the minister.
“Having recognition among the international community as a country which follows international rules and regulations related to the fisheries industry is important to avoid future issues related to the industry such as bans on fishing imports as we experienced recently,” the minister added.
The software used in e-log books had been developed by the University of Colombo and the e-log books would be handed over to the owners of multi-day fishing vessels free of charge.
Vessel owners would be trained to use the e-log books, he said.
