Natural gas power plant to supply Chinese funded Industrial Zone

The Chinese will build a 400MW Natural Gas Power Plant in Hambantota to supply power to the Chinese funded Industrial Zone in the area.
Cabinet this week granted approval for a joint venture project between the company China Machinery Engineering Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board for the plant. According to the Cabinet paper on the subject, the agreement at present, proposed a 70:30 percent shareholding between the two entities.
As all power plants need to be approved by the Public Utilities Commission, this too would be included in the 2017-2037 long term energy plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission.
In May 2017, two agreements were signed between the Government of Sri Lankan and that of China. One was the ‘Framework agreement between the government of the Peoples’ Republic of China and the Government of Sri Lanka for the proportion of investment and economic cooperation’ and the other was the ‘outline of the medium and long term development plan for investment, economic and technological cooperation’.
The agreements agreed for the establishment of a power plant in Hambantota and a natural gas receiving terminal as a joint venture project between a company nominated by the Chinese Government and Sri Lanka.
The power plan is expected to provide electricity to factories set up in Hambantota by the Chinese companies.
The Chinese had pointed out that an uninterrupted and reliable power supply was needed for industries and that industries could not be built without power- thus the power plant will be built first.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management which had studied the project, had also decided that the power plant be constructed as an Independent Power Producer power plant on government to government basis first and once the factories are established, a suitable plan could be formulated thereafter as to the mechanism of how power would be purchased or sold.
Last week, Sri Lanka and China jointly launched the “Sri Lanka-China Logistics and Industrial Zone Office” at the Hambantota Port to overlook the operation of the 50-square-kilometer Industrial Zone established in January.
