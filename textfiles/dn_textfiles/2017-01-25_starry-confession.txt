Starry confession

It’s the stars. Millions of miles away, staying at the dim abyss of the universe, they keep on staring (glaring may be). I knew it. There were moments, when I felt the unbearable weight of their stare upon me, sometimes like a prickling thorn, going deep and deep into the core of me, piercing the layers of my skin, deeply perforating my flesh, an aching journey through my veins towards the bones and finally it was in.
I was always afraid of the one who slept at the dark depth of me, a creature longed to break the manacles and to tear down the neat boundaries around. I knew its power, if unleashed, the destruction and turmoil it can create in the story of life, disarraying the orderly chapters. At times, when it came out, unbolting the locked doors, I remember, how greedily it sucked the raw air around. When realized that it’s high time not to let it overwhelm my conscience, it was sent back to the same old corner, sometimes by force, whipping it mercilessly until it subdues or sometimes with deception, singing a little lullaby until it tames and agrees to sleep. But I never had the spirit to kill it; the wild, unrefined, pure creature, always conquered by self conscience and the written and unwritten laws of the world we belong to.
But finally it was in, the penetrating stare of the stars above. It didn’t halt at the bones, the painful journey continued, piercing and piercing until it reached its destination. It knocked on the locked doors softly and urged the creature who was fast asleep to wake up.
I repeat, it’s the stars. The conscience and the urge to break free were at a dilemma, an aching sensation to break the doors and a moral plea to impede at the border. But far above the dark universe, it was written, it was written to break free (or maybe it was ‘ruin’ which was written). So I let it happen and I let the stare of the stars to surmount. Passing the border, now it’s the expedition through the no man’s land, the gravest distance, until I meet the border at the other end.
