Cabinet approves LRT projects’ feasibility studies

The feasibility studies of the first two Light Rail Transit (LRT) projects from Colombo Fort to Battaramulla and Malabe, received Cabinet approval this week.
Cabinet approval was also granted for the signing of the loan agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Government of Japan (GOJ). GOSL had request GOJ for an Official Development Assistance Loan under the Special Term for Economic Partnership (STEM).
The estimated cost of the project is 253,028 million JPY, which includes 206,106 million JPY from JICA component and 46,922 million JPY from the GOSL.
The LRTs come under the Megapolis Transport Master Plan proposed in the Western Region Megapolis Master Plan - 2030 prepared by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
Seven LRTs had been proposed, and two which connect Colombo Fort with other main centres, while extending to the Battaramulla and Malabe areas, had been chosen as the priority lines to be implemented first. The two lines are to be constructed as elevated lines due to the high-density of development in the area.
JICA had conducted preparatory survey with the Megapolis Ministry’s cooperation, to come up with a feasibility study for the project. Based on findings of the final report of the Preparatory Survey, a New Light Rail Transit System in Colombo with a length of 17 km from Malabe to a Multi-Modal Transport Hub at Fort consisting of 16 stations and a depot, had been declared feasible. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) too, is at its final stage and the Resettlement Action Plan had also been completed by Project Management Unit and submitted to JICA for their concurrence.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka pointed out that JICA expected the loan agreement to be signed by end of 2018 to complete detail design in 2019 and for civil works to be commenced by 2020, with commercial operations to begin by 2025.
The loan is to be provided at a concessionary rate of 0.1 percent per annum for civil works and procurement of equipment and 0.01 percent per annum for consultancy services, with 0.2 percent of the loan amount as fronted free. The repayment period of the loan is 40 years, including a grace period of 12 years.
