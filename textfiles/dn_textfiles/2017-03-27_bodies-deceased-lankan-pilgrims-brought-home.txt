Bodies of deceased Lankan pilgrims brought home

The bodies of three Sri Lankan pilgrims who died in India were brought back to the country last week with the assistance of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The Airport Police Division said the postmortem carried out by the Judicial Medical Officer confirmed that they had died of heart attack. He said the bodies had been handed over to the families. The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson declined to provide details of the pilgrims stating that she was unable to share further information respecting the privacy of families concerned.
According to the reports, the three individuals belonged to the same group and they had embarked on the pilgrimage on March 13.
Two bodies had been received at the Katunayake Airport on March 23 and the third body on March 25. It is suspected that extreme cold weather could have caused the deaths.
