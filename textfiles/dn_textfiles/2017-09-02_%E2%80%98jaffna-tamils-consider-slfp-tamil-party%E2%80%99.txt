‘Jaffna Tamils consider SLFP a Tamil party’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Jaffna is considered a Tamil party run by Tamils, SLFP Jaffna District MP Angajan Ramanathan yesterday said as he called for the SLFP 67th Convention to be held in Jaffna next year.
Angajan was addressing a SLFP media briefing held at SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road.
He said the President had given them much freedom and autonomy within the party.
"The Jaffna people have welcomed the President with open arms," the National List MP said assuring that a Convention in Jaffna would attract a large gathering.
Responding to a query about a recent LTTE propaganda material asking Tamil women not to marry Sinhalese men, the Jaffna District MP said it was a hoax. "The Tamil people had no interest in reverting to an armed struggle," he said.
`They have suffered enough. I can assure you that no one wants another war," he said.
