Functions of AG's Department hampered due to lack of relevant documents - DSG

Deputy Solicitor General Sobhitha Rajakaruna said that certain officers conducting investigations into several malpractices, seek the advice of the Attorney General's Department without forwarding the relevant documents to the Attorney General's Department.
"Therefore, it is not fair for people to level allegations against the Attorney General's Department that certain reports relating to cases are delayed, since such a delay occurs due to the producing of false details to courts," he said.
The Attorney General's Department cannot intervene in various other sectors and fields, which are not under its purview. Without knowing the real situation, certain persons level allegations against the Attorney General's Department in this regard.
Deputy Solicitor General Rajakaruna was addressing the media when Attorney General Y. J. W. Wijayatilaka called on the Asgiriya and Malwatte Mhanayake Theras to receive their blessings yesterday.
He added that the Attorney General has not instructed to stop inquiries into the Avant Garde case.
The Attorney General has pointed out that there is no room for file a case under the Firearms Act.
