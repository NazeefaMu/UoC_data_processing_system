LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING by Henry King
Love, as portrayed and dramatized in this fine and sensitive Buddy Adler production based on the Han Suyin bestseller, is indeed a many-splendored thing. It’s an unusual picture shot against authentic Hong Kong backgrounds and offbeat in its treatment, yet as simple and moving a love story as has come along in many a moon. William Holden as the American correspondent, and Jennifer Jones as the Eurasian Doctor, make a romantic team of great appeal. The film won several awards including Best Picture Buddy Adler, Best Actress Jennifer Jones, Best Original Music Score Alfred Newman.
