The government is in the process of formulating a national policy regarding the disposal of garbage in the country, the Attorney General informed Supreme Court today.
Additional Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made this remarks pursuant to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by an environmental activist and an environmental organization challenging the gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena in the capacity of Minister of Environment over the garbage issue in the country.

Ranjith Sisira Kumara, an environmental activist and Centre for Environmental Justice filed this petition through counsel Ravindranath Dabare and Nilmal Wickremasinghe and Prabhani Samaraweera naming Central Environmental Authority, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The petitioners sought an order declaring that the gazette notification bearing No.2015/53 is null and void and of no force avail in law.
