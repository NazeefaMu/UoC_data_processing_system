No sale of Srilankan Airlines - Minister Lakshman Yapa

The Government has no intention of selling SriLankan Airlines but only wants to restructure its management under a Public Private Partnership, Public Enterprise development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He added that SriLankan Airlines will remain the national carrier even though the airline has become a huge burden to the country’s economy. According to the Minister, the airline has incurred a huge loss amounting to US $ 12 billion last year. The Minister said that 27 percent of the airlines’ total revenue is spent on operational activities, 25 percent on fuel, 20 percent on leasing installments of Airbuses, 13 percent is spent on salaries,12 percent is spent on maintenance and 3 per cent on catering services. “At present, SriLankan Airlines makes profits only from ground handling activities and catering services,” the State Minister said.
“However, it has incurred an estimated loss of Rs.4.80 for every Rs.100,” he said.
