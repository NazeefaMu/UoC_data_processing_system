SLFP has no option other than support NCM - Lakshman Yapa

Public Enterprise and Kandy Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday said the SLFP has no option other than to support the No Confidence Motion (NCM) moved against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Abeywardena added that there won’t be a unity government if the No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister is defeated in Parliament.
Addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, Minister Abeywardena said that they do not have any personal grudges with him.
The Minister further said no political party has officially revealed their stance on the NCM and added that MP’s should vote according to their conscience.
“If the No Confidence Notion is defeated on April 4, there will not be a Unity Government on the following day,”he said.
MP Dilan Perera said that the Prime Minister by refusing to resign from his post is trying to break the Unity Government.
