NDB Wealth focuses on  International Women's Day

With International Women's Day only a few days away, the time to 'Be Bold For Change'. What better way to take that big leap towards ultimate financial freedom and parity than finally taking charge of your own financial future.
"Since 2017's theme for International Women's Day is ‘Be Bold For a Change’ the boldest step you can take as a woman is undoubtedly securing your own financial future. So, empower yourself by actively taking control of your financial planning", advised Christina Wesley, a financial adviser with NDB Wealth.
In fact, the need for smart financial planning is even more relevant today despite woman now enjoying a greater degree of hard-won independence. This is because of the lack of corresponding parity in terms of earnings, savings, which means that true financial freedom is still an elusive ideal.
However, one way to circumvent the many obstacles faced by women, such as lack of equal pay, or having to spend fewer hours at work because of taking care of children or having to take maternity leave, is to effectively utilize financial planning tools to not just accumulate savings but actually use them to generate a greater degree of sustainable wealth over the short and long term.
Wesley, "Sri Lankan women also have to confront the troubling reality that, while they typically have longer lifespans than men, with an average life expectancy of 77 years, they are often paid a lower wage than men.”
