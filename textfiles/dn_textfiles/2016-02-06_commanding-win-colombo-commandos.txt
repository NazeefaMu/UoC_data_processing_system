Commanding win for Colombo Commandos

Shehan Jayasuriya outshone Dinesh Chandimal with a calculated unbeaten knock of 62 off 47 balls to guide Colombo Commandos to a commanding eight-wicket win over Galle Guardians in the Super T20 Provincial final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Man of the Final Shaminda Eranga ripped out four Galle batsmen for 27 runs.
Chandimal played a captain's innings of 68 off 53 balls to take his team to a score of 143-7 after being put into bat first.
But Colombo chased down Galle's moderate total to win with 20 balls to spare scoring 147-2.
Despite losing inform Niroshan Dickwella for 11 in the second over Jayasuriya who smacked two sixes and seven fours and Dhananjaya de Silva (41 off 32 balls) shared a partnership of 94 off 65 balls to put the game beyond Galle's reach.
De Silva was run out with the team needing 36 for victory. However captain Milinda Siriwardana who joined Jayasuriya finished the match off in style with two successive fours off Dilhara Lokuhettige to remain 24 not out.
Apart from Chandimal's innings none of the other Galle batsmen could get to terms with fast bowler Shaminda Eranga who continued to impress on his return from a back injury that kept him out of competitive cricket for almost the entire 2015.
Eranga was a model of accuracy finishing with excellent figures of four for 27 and no would have begrudged him being named the Man of the Final.
