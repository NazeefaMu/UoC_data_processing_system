Amãna Takaful conducts road safety workshop for student of Matara

Amãna Takaful organised a highly successful training programme on road safety targeting the owners and drivers of three wheelers and school vans in partnership with the Traffic Police Branch of Matara.
The programme saw the participation of a large number of drivers being present at the YMBA hall in Matara, making it a very successful initiative. Divisional Traffic IP A.W.P Sudesh Nalaka and SI B.H Lal Wijethilake together with officers representing the Matara Traffic Police Divisionwere present at the event.
The opening key note was delivered by Janaka Wijeyakumara Area Manager,Amãna Takaful, who drew the attention of the participants to the importance of discipline when driving and the consequences of irresponsible driving, the leading cause for majority of accidents.
The keynote address on behalf of the Department of Police was delivered by A.W.P Sudesh Nalaka Inspector of Police, Traffic Police Division, Sri Lanka Police Matara. A very comprehensive account of road accidents, the leading causes and prevention of the accidents were discussed during his speech.
Commenting on this timely initiative, Sumedha Mirihana, Manager Marketing Activations, Amãna Takaful had this to say “Sri Lanka records one of the highest death rates by road accidents annually, mainly due to the negligence of the drivers, riders and the pedestrians. ATL as a responsible insurer that places great value on human life has a greater social responsibility towards awareness creation. We hope to carry out more programmes of this nature in the future, and also take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to the Matara Traffic Police Branch for their support and assistance.”
