Barkley inspires Everton to eighth straight home win

LIVERPOOL, Saturday - Everton midfielder Ross Barkley ended a troubled week off the field by inspiring his team to an eighth straight home win with a 3-1 victory over Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday.
Barkley's shot, deflected off Burnley defender Ben Mee, put Everton 2-1 up in the 71st minute and the league's top scorer Romelu Lukaku made sure of the win three minutes later with his 24th strike of the season.
England international Barkley had been the victim of an assault in a bar on Sunday and was then at the centre of a controversial column in The Sun newspaper. He was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the final moments. Barkley, who also cleared off the line twice, was booked for over-celebrating with fans when he put the team ahead. “Of course, I can understand. Because I think what happened last week had a really big impact on him. I think he was focussed on the football side this week and also this afternoon,” Everton manager Ronald Koeman told reporters, adding that he did not consider leaving Barkley out of the team. – Agencies
