Ravi challenges MR to go to courts over Jan 1. 2015 Gazette notification

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go to Courts if he can over the controversial Gazette notification dated Jan 1, 2015 on the issuance of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank. “This is exactly what we want for the truth to come out,” Karunanayake said. He was speaking at a press conference at Finance Ministry yesterday.
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Kumaraswami was also present on the occasion.
Former President Rajapksa had reportedly stated at a public ceremony in Horana on Monday that he is seeking legal advice from his lawyers to take Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the Central Bank to Courts over the issue concerned.
Minister Karunanayaka said, it has been observed that the previous regime had issued Treasury bills without publishing their details in the Gazzette, which is a legal requirement in raising loans by way of issue of Treasury bills under the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance.
“The former regime had not published details of Treasury bonds in the Gazzette from the outset of 2005 as per law under the office of President Mahida Rajapaksa who had also been the Minister of Finance then,” Minister Karunanayake pointed out.
“They had followed a practice of dodging the publication of details in respect of all issuing of Treasury Bonds by publishing them all in just one gazette notification,” he said.
Minister Karunanayake also expressed his concern why that this has not been brought up in the recent COPE report.
