Lanka’s ‘wordy’ cop with longest name

Sri Lanka Police recently discovered that they may have within their ranks an officer who probably has the world’s longest name -- 14 in all -- and certainly a colleague who takes longer to fill forms.
Superintendent Hakmana Dissanayaka Wasala Bandara Amunugama Wijeratne Gunathillaka Rajanayaka Bandaralage Hakmana Walawwe Anuruddha Bandara Hakmana figured in a police statement announcing routine transfers.
Hakmana was sent to Embilipitiya Police Division from Gampola, according to Police Headquarters.
A senior officer said Hakmana with 13 initials and surname was certainly the man with the longest name in the department and could not remember any other “wordy name” in the 150-year history of the department.
Hakmana’s 14 names would be better than the 28 of an Edinburgh man who has 28 because most of those names had been added by the man over several years unlike the Sri Lankan policeman who has a birth certificate to prove his 14 names.
It is not clear if SP Hakmana attaches a separate sheet with his full name when filling out official forms.
