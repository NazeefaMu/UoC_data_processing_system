Case against Fowzie fixed for trial

The case filed against National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie for allegedly causing a Rs. 1.07 million unlawful loss to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
The case was fixed for trial on April 5 and 6 by the Chief Magistrate. The first and second witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Court on the next trial dates.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the state minister was not present in Court.
The defence counsel appearing for the accused informed Court that his client was receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing on behalf of the accused moved the Bribery Commission that its decision to frame charges against the state minister be re-considered ,since the charges levelled against the accused cannot be maintained.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed the corruption case against the state minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015, while he was serving as a senior minister during the previous regime.
The value of the vehicle was estimated at Rs. 19.5 million.
