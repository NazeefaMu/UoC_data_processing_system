Health Minister orders probe into incidents at state hospitals

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to conduct separate investigations into the incidents which took place at Galaha Rural Hospital and Thammennawa Rural Hospital, which were reported in the media, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to media reports, a woman had gone to Galaha Rural Hospital recently to obtain treatment for her four-year-old child. They had reportedly been sent away after a doctor allegedly scolded them and an attendant allegedly assaulted them.
The media had also reported that three accident victims of one family had not been accepted by the Thammennawa Rural Hospital because no doctor was available to treat them. They had been sent to the Mihintale Hospital, but the child and father had died before admission. The mother is now receiving medical treatment at the Anuradhapura General Hospital.
