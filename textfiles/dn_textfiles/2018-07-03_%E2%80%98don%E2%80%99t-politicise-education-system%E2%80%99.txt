‘Don’t politicise education system’

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday urged people not to sabotage country’s education system by politicising it.
Refuting some media reports which claimed that all government schools will be closed on July 4 due to a trade union action, Minister Kariyawasam confirmed that the schools will not be closed on that day.
He was addressing the media at Isurupaya yesterday.
Some media reports claimed that a trade union action is scheduled to take place on July 4 against the decision taken by the ministry to promote education officials allegedly for political revenge.
“All these promotions have been done through a proper legal procedure by a committee and only 1,011 officials have been selected from 12,000 applications,” said the Minister.
Political revenge is common under any government and it is not illegal to give promotions for the officers those who lost their promotions due to political revenge. Every government does that, he said.
UNP Trade Union Secretary and Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera charged that all the promotions have been undertaken through a proper procedure.
“Nobody can close schools as they wish and we will never let anybody do that,” said the State Minister.
