SriLankan Aviation Collegeand Kingston University London have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the launch of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) top up degree in Aircraft Engineering in Sri Lanka, providing an exciting new dimension in airline-related education in the region.
Kingston University London has been delivering this programme in the UK since 2001 and has had hundreds of graduates who now work with major airlines in the UK and around the world. SriLankan Aviation College (SLAC), the training arm of SriLankan Airlines, is the first institution in Sri Lanka to provide professionals the opportunity to acquire this qualification in Sri Lanka.
This programmewill enable students who are qualified up to an ‘EASA B License Training Certificate’ to achieve an honours degree which is accredited by the Royal Aeronautical Society. Working professionals who have obtained the EASA Part 66 / CAASL IS 66 license or equivalent Category B Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Course are eligible to apply for the top up degree on a part time basis. It will commence from May 2018. The degree will enhance the knowledge that degree aspirants have already gained and provide them with another internationally recognized qualification. This will demonstrate that the degree holder has both the vocational and academic skills required to make a great contribution to the aviation industry.
An Associate Member in IATA’s prestigious TRAINAIR PLUS Programme, SLAC provides services for hundreds of students at any given time, including a large number of foreign students.
