GMOA threatens stern action if SLMC election not allowed to go ahead

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will take the toughest action possible if anyone tries to stop the holding of the legitimate election of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he alleged that the Health Minister is trying his best to stop the holding of the election to fill four vacancies in the SLMC.
“The Health Minister is reported to have sent a letter at the last moment to stop it. The letter is alleged o have neen delivered by a doctor appointed by him to the SLMC who also holds the position of his Public Relations Officer” the GMOA Secretary said. According to Dr. Aluthge, the majority of SLMC Members have decided to go ahead with holding the election rejecting the Minister’s request to postpone it.
“The Minister and a few of his supporters are determined not to hold this election because they are sure about their defeat, like during the previous election,” Dr. Aluthge said. During the previous election, the GMOA recorded a landslide victory with its President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya securing 6,254 votes of the total 8,000 votes.
The GMOA secured 3,750 votes which is 77.7 percent of the total number of votes casted during the election and won all four seats in the SLMC. Others secured only a few hundreds of votes,” he added.
