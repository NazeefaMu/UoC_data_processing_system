Keheliya’s GI pipe case re-fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others was re-fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
This relates to causing an unlawful loss to the government after purchasing 600 of GI pipes using Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the previous Presidential Election.
Attorneys appearing on behalf of MP Rambukwella informed court that his client was not appearing yesterday due to Parliament sittings.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against former Minister Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under Section 70 of the Bribery Act. The Bribery Commission alleged that the three accused in the case had incurred a loss of Rs.990,000 to the SLRC after purchasing 600 of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. The Magistrate fixed the trial for January 11.
