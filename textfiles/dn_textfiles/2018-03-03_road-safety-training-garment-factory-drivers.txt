Road safety training for garment factory drivers

The National Council for Road Safety will conduct awareness and training programmes on road rules and road safety for drivers working in garment manufacturing companies located in various investment zones in the country.
A spokesperson at the National Council for Road Safety said drivers who transport employees of garment manufacturing companies are also included in this programme.
Drivers will receive the national certificate on road rules and road safety once they successfully complete the training.
A review will be made after six months of training. Officials will make note of any accidents the trained drivers were involved in.
The first training programme will be conducted in the garment manufacturing factories attached to Brandix.
“The programme aims to reduce the increasing number of road accidents occurring in Sri Lankan roads every day,” the spokesperson added.
