SLFP now, a formidable force - Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that SLFP is becoming a formidable party and they see the upcoming local government election as an opportunity to bring all SLFP supporters together.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, Minister Jayasekara said at present there are issues in implementing decisions taken by the President.
He said the President is trying hard to maintain stability within the country while some are plotting against him. “The upcoming local government elections will be a huge boost to support the President and all decisions taken by him’, he said.
Jayasekara assured that the SLFP is back together and supporters have no plans to leave the party and requested the public to extend their support to the President to take the right decisions in both local and international issues.
“Some people tried to take advantage out of the minor conflicts that prevailed between the supporters. The President made a huge sacrifice to bring new blood into the party.The SLFP received more than 7,000 nominations including nominations from youth and women”, he said.
Jayasekera said the SLFP leadership changed over time but the UNP leadership remains the same and added that the ground level should be strong to make an influence in the higher level.
The Minister said the SLFP will not hesitate to take action if any of the candidates violate election laws.
