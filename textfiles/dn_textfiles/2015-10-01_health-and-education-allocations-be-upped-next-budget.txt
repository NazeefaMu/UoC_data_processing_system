Health and education allocations to be upped in next budget

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said three percent of the GDP will be allocated for the health sector and six percent for education in the next budget.
Only 1.2 percent is allocated for health and a mere 1.5 percent for education, the minister added.
The government will make several crucial decisions soon to solve several issue in the education and health sectors.
He expressed these views while addressing the gathering during a World Children's Day event at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo yesterday.
According to Dr. Senaratne, private tuition classes which are aimed at school children are similar to communicable disease and there will be private tuition classes even for pre-school children in the future if the trend continues. "Children also need democracy," he said.
"Do not bribe the gods. Treat children well. Only then the gods will shower their blessings."
