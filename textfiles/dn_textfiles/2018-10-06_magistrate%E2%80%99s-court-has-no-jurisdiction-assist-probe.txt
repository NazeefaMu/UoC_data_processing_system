According to the ‘B’ report filed by the CID, Korean Police Officials had investigated into the alleged accidental death of an 18-year-old Korean girl who died on an expressway at Deagu City in South Korea in 1998.
Twelve years later, the Korean Police had suspected it to be a murder and informed the CID to investigate into the matter since they suspected that might have been committed by three Sri Lankan youth.
According to the ‘B’ report,the Korean Government had informed Sri Lanka August on 28, 2017 to conduct investigations into this matter.
Later a Korean delegation arrived in Sri Lanka on May 30,2018 and met the Attorney General, Justice Ministry and CID officials.
