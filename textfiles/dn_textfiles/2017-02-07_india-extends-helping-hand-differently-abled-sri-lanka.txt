India extends helping hand to differently abled in Sri Lanka

India donated a bus to facilitate the transport of differently abled people of the estate sector in Sri Lanka. The presentation was made by Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu, to Chairperson of the Sunera Foundation, Sunethra Bandaranaike.
The Foundation is a government-approved charity that was first set up in April 2000 in recognition of the need to address the psychosocial needs of differently abled people. It uses performance arts as a therapeutic tool.
The 28 seater Tata bus will replace the bus donated by India in 2010, which was funded by a grant of Rs. 2.9 million from the Indian government.
The bus will be utilised to transport disabled persons in the tea estate plantations from their homes to workshops conducted by the Sunera Foundation and back.
