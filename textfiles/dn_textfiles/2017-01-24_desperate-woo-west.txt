Desperate to woo the west?

While everyone has been talking about the sizzling chemistry between Deepika Padukone and Vin Diesel, off and on screen, there has been speculation about an affair between them.
In fact, in the US, the rumours have been flying fast and furious. Which is why when the actress made her debut on American television on the very prestigious Ellen Degeneres Show on January 17, the host asked her if there was any truth to those rumours. Deepika smiled mischievously and said, “Well, there is no smoke without fire, is there?” She then added how in her “head” she is in a relationship with Vin Diesel and has “amazing babies” with him. The statements are shocking, given that she is in a relationship with Ranveer Singh.
One of her senior female colleagues succinctly summed up the situation.
“I’d like to ask her, would she like it if Ranveer spoke about having babies with a female co-star? And would she speak about any male co-star from India in the same way? It is a very indelicate statement to make. Why is she fanning the rumours instead of killing them? Unless of course there is some truth to them.”
A filmmaker who has worked with Deepika adds, “Why this desperation to woo the west?” DNA
