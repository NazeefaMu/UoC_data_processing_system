Previous regime  created robbers:  Paranavithane

Although the previous regime boasted about a “one project for each village” programme, what it actually did was to introduce “one robber for each village”, said Vocational Training and Skills Development Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithane.
However, all political parties in this country tried to produce cultural individuals whom we should strive to protect and bring to the forefront, he said.
Paranavithane who said that the January 8 revolution could never be reversed, added that fraudulent people who defrauded public assets had no place in society again.
He said the Yahapalana Government never feared to face elections. Paranavithane said a recent statement made by him regarding the wild elephant menace had created a public dialogue. What he emphasised was that despite the threat, elephants could not be killed as they were intertwined with our culture.
