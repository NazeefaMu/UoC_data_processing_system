EDB to stamp Brand Sri Lanka in global Batik map

The Export Development Board (EDB) has stepped up its efforts to stamp ‘Brand Sri Lanka’ in the global Batik map-and linking with top institutional stakeholders.
The EDB is directly accessing the SMEs of the country in this new initiative. “24 leading Lankan SME Batik manufactures are displaying their samples to gain access to high end markets while sharing experience and knowledge with experts in the industry,”EDB's Acting Director General Himali Jinadasa said yesterday.
“Sri Lankan Batik products are premium products. Our Batik sector is so good that once Unilever purchased a Lankan made Batik saree for no less than 15,000-not rupees but dollars!” said Erik Sooriyasena (leading exporter) and added: “With today's initiative, we begin a long process of linking Lankan batiks to global market.”
Addressing the “EDB Seminar and Sample Display Event of Lankan Batik Manufactures” on 8th October at the auditorium of EDB where 24 leading Lankan SME Batik makers splashed the Forum with the best of their wares and designs.
The session was assisted by Erik Sooriyasena (leading exporter and artist), Colvin Settinayake (veteran art and batik master craftsman) and Selyna Peiris (Director - Selyn Exports) as resource persons. Representatives from two leading giftware and lifestyle companies were invited to explore possibility to market linkage of the products manufactured by SME batik manufacturers to high-end markets.
Indonesia is recognised today as the world's leader in Batiks with UNESCO acknowledging Indonesian Batik as cultural heritage. It is believed that Batik was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Dutch colonial masters and was promptly adopted by women of Kandyan kingdom, thereby kicking off the Batik tradition in Sri Lanka.
