[Governor TALES]
Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore

We now come to the phase of the last governor who also went on to become the first Governor General of a self governing Lanka. He was born in March, 1887 to a family who priced education and religion. In fact he was the son of an Anglican Clergyman.
He belongs to that genre of White administrators of the island who served it twice in different capacities. Remember, it was See-Saw time for those qualified to go about at random throughout the expanding empire in various capacities savoring vivid experience. No doubt the elders advised the young, “GO East, young man and you’re your mark”.
Moore who succeeded Sir Andrew Caldecott, and gained the epithets of the last Governor and the first governor general had earlier worked here as a member of the Ceylon Civil Service, .that is from 1910 to 1919 including the first world war years.
He became much acquainted with the people of the island, and was aware of the island’s keenness to gain independence and the political developments connected to that aspiration. From the days of the Legislative Council the leaders of the country had been hankering after that aim, even when divided racially.
But the gentleman was suddenly appointed as Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. Then he got promotions as Chief Secretary of Nigeria and then of Kenya, then of Sierra Leone.. But it may be no exaggeration to say, that he still loved Ceylon. So the Colonial office did make a wise judgment when it decided to appoint Moore as governor here when issue regarding the grant of independence was coming to a heady tangle
Those at the imperialist end were in favour of another commission to decide things while those at the colonial end were arguing and quite rightly too that it has had a surfeit of commissions. Anyway the last commission was opted for the Soulbury Commission.
All what happened after this is a tangled history of the activities of the Soulbury commission and Monk Mason Morre’s concurrent administration in the years 1944-48 (incidentally going on to the Second World War too) things are presented here for clarity sequentially.
22.12. 1944----Lord Soulbury and others of the Reform Commission arrive
1945 Sept. –The report of the Soulbury Commission is published 1946 ---State council adopts the Whit Paper embodying the reforms 1947 ----Last meeting of the State Council
D S Senanayaka becomes Ceylon’s first Prime Minister
1948 –Formal announcement that February 4 would be appointed day under the Ceylon Independence Act. 1886 prisoners granted amnesty on this day.
Ceylon’s first Governor General Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore sworn in.
1950 --- The Lion flag adopted as the national flag.
It should be noted that in 1949 Sir Moore leaves and is succeeded by acting Chief Justice Wijewardena and then by Lord Soulbury. Incidentally a long postscript written by Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore and encased at the end of British governors of Ceylon reveals the affection Moore had for the island.
