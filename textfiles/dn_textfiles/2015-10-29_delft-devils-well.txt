Delft Devils Well

I discovered there is a lot more to Delft than its wild royal horses left behind by the Portuguese.

Delft kovil
“Zero visibility over, do you read me?” the voice at the other end sounds desperate as the radio crackled and a clear order was made “abort landing do you read me?” Not a great thing to hear while heading for Jaffna’s Delft Island in the middle of a storm that has steadily got worse as the trip had progressed from the ferry from Kurikattuwan to the meeting place of the seven seas.
I could see from the hunched up cowering position of the usually cocky boat driver that this was really as serious as it gets. We could not see anything ahead, and were quite literally sailing blind and he was only just managing to keep the boat from turning over from the crashing waves, which were sometimes twice the height of the ship and freak cyclone style rain that was smashing us on all sides. Looking out of the window of the cabin where I had taken cover from the stormy conditions I hoped desperately searching for a sign of land as I swayed at alarming angles.
Pretty much hopeless
The fog instead was getting thicker, rain lashing us from both sides was now filling the cabin and the conditions of the sea made me realize that our situation was pretty much hopeless, after all when I could not even see the helm of the boat how on earth was the guy supposed to sail into a rocky harbour and not dash us into a million pieces. The operational guys based at Delft island kept saying “it’s too dangerous to come in. Abort landing and over and over are you reading us?” and despite our close proximity the captain did not want to risk making a run for it and going back was equally dangerous. I was glad I was wearing my orange life jacket and for not skipping my school swimming lessons to go shopping. The radio crackled and went dead and the silence that followed was chilling and it was obvious the captain and his crew had totally lost control of the situation even with all their military marine training they had never seen weather conditions like it.
As the boat turned in, ever decreasing circles it was as if we had vanished into a cloud of smoke, akin to the Bermuda Triangle and would like the time machine be jettisoned into another world. Even the non-religious among us started to pray, Amzar my youngest son was enjoying all the drama and pointed out a bird sitting on the deck, “follow the birdie” he said and although I thought my two year olds thing for birdie boats was verging on the ridiculous, and not exactly helpful in the current situation, the crew thought otherwise and keeping the bird as it took off in sight made a run for it. As if the bird had some magic power the mist, like an opening night curtain call rose for a brief minute or two and gave us just long enough to see the land and make it in one piece.
Even if Delft Island, the largest inhabited island of the Jaffna peninsula had been a hell hole we would have loved it as a location, after a near death experience on the unpredictable high seas. The island interestingly located almost equidistant from the city of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, India and Jaffna. It is an intriguing place with incredibly friendly people, classic old school tuck shops, ancient Buddhist ruins and a strange, bleak, windswept landscape that wild horses trot across daily.
The island which once had its own royal ruler, King Vaidyarasan has a population of Hindus, Catholics and Protestants. King Vaidyarasan is credited with having built the canal across Delft linking two large tanks, an indication that agriculture flourished on this island, along with mercantile trade.
However, the problems of recent times and the political turmoil of 26 years of war led to many people migrating further south until 2009, when there has been a slow return to the island. Most of the well water is salty, so if you plan on going bring plenty of water with you. It takes a couple of hours to circle Delft in a four wheel drive with its ancient coral walls and unusual ancestral homes it is easy to see why people are charmed by the place, which only now is being reclaimed by the original island families.
Originally called ‘Pasuthivu’ or ‘Nedunthivu’ (the island of cows) and renamed Delft by the Dutch, after the town in the Netherlands, where they make blue and white china. Today it is hard to see the connection, although lots of the houses have lovely azure blue frontages. Delft is known in all the guide books for its horses left behind by the Portuguese colonialists and some rather unusual historic buildings, which include a messenger pigeon house.
Delft has emerged unlike the other islands relatively unscathed from the conflict and has kept its old world charms. Except for the bus, there are only a few military vehicles and Singer style bikes available to explore the place, which is the preferred form of transport and with one liners like it’s magic, one can easily see why peddling one’s way across this picturesque almost Scots like island is an experience to savour.
Wild horses and ponies

Where time stands still
Houses are fenced by coral-stones piled up or by palmyrah leaf fans giving Delft its particular unique architectural aspect and inside are walled gardens. It has a haunting beauty, which is made even more appealing when you find out that its barren plains are still heavily populated with wild horses and ponies, which were introduced by the Portuguese in the 1600s. These horses are forbidden by law to leave the island and despite the ruling, the population is now into the lower hundreds and can mainly be found in the open lands near the now fenced off giant baobab tree with its doorway like opening that they suggest should never be used in a storm, as the tree retracts in size and might leave you crunched up inside its bowels. The Quindah Tower, the wells of Sarapiddi, the old stables and village shops are all worth checking out.
The most pleasant season is probably July-August when the roughest weather has gone and when there are still enough breezes. January and February are cooler like in the rest of the island but January can be wet. The ferry from Kurikattuwan on the southern tip of Pungudutivu takes about a 45 minutes drive by car from Jaffna old town along the Quays, which is a magical experience watching the time old fishing traditions.
On a good day there are two ferry services a day. One in the morning and one in the afternoon but check first prior to planning your trip; timetable is subject to important changes due to the day’s weather conditions which can leave you stranded on an island without even one hotel and that’s if you even make it! Although the local people will take you in and the shops are full of great goods, so you won’t starve however bad things get and the good bit is you will get to try real Jaffna Cool island style. They say the dish came from the island and was another thing inherited from the Portuguese, whose influence is clear in the beauty of the people.
Good fortune
The coral crags and their rocky arches with the nestling pigeon nests, money putting into cracks of rocks for good fortune that grow on religious ground and the littered scrap remnants of a temple from the Chola dynasty period fetter the path of this island, which can only be reached upon passing the suckling current of the ‘meeting place of the seven seas’ and inside past the lighthouse which allows one a glimpse to India.
The most sort after place is the ‘Devil’s Well’ which is the only fresh water source on the island with its bottomless abyss and the ‘Giant’s Footprint’ after which one reaches the cemetery stone wood blocks which look to the distance like morose mute gargoyles demarcating the single moss covered wall of the stable: the men lasso the ponies and the wild horses who bray and prance like praying mantises. Then its tea and another boat ride on the high seas before the storm starts again playing havoc with us seeing more of Jaffna’s out islands.
Back on the boat mottled with sea spray and bile – the island fades out of view, not out of mind, passing the western shore in and out of time. Kenneth Pinyan of Enumclaw, the patron saint of horses, looms large, his spectre perforating the mood of the insidious Puck, wandering in search of the jackass, fulfilling his duties with his spells cascading. Jaffna’s Islands known as Sri Lanka’s crown jewels are well worth all the danger and tomfoolery. All be it a travellers cliché it really is the perfect place to vanish from the world into the mists of time.
