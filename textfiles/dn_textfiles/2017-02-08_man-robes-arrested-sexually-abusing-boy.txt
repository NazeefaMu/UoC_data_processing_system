Man in robes arrested for sexually abusing boy

A man in robes was arrested by the Anuradhapura Police Emergency Unit for allegedly sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy given to a temple in the 5th Canal area at Sravastipura by the boy’s parents for ordination.
This follows information provided by the vihara dayaka sabha members who agitated after knowing the offence.
Police said the man was under the influence of liquor at the time of arrest, and he was produced before the Anuradhapura hospital JMO who confirmed following a breathalyzer test that the man was drunk.
The investigations revealed the man had two child abuse cases pending against him in the Anuradhapura Magistrate’s Court.
Police said the man’s sexual habit came to light when the boy had visited a residence of a dayaka sabha member to work to earn bus fare to return home.
Thereafter, the boy had said he could not withstand the sexual harassment meted out by the man and wanted to get back to his parents.
