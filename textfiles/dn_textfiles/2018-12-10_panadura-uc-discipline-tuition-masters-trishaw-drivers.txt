Panadura UC to discipline tuition masters,  trishaw drivers

Panadura Urban Council (UC) Chairman Nandana Gunathilaka said tuition masters cover walls and bus halts in the town with huge posters but police is silent.
The Chairman was addressing UC members on the issue at the recently held UC meeting.
He said Police could file action against the tuition masters for their reckless poster pasting but so far they have not taken any action.
The UC must allocate places to paste posters and deploy UC employees to remove unauthorised posters, he said.
UC member Anura Wijepala said action must be taken immediately against tuition masters who paste posters everywhere in the town.
The Chairman said he would consult the relevant authorities and take action.
The councillors suggested that the UC must tax tuition masters.
A tuition master earns over Rs. 5 lakhs monthly and about 40 students attend a class, they said.
Panadura is a hub for foreign universities and thousands of students attend them day and night, the UC members said.
The members said the UC must adopt a procedure to streamline the operation of three wheelers as well since many drivers transport illicit liquor and engage in other criminal activities.
Panadura has 450 three wheelers and the owners of them have a union. The UC must discuss the issues with their union and employ a procedure that benefit both three wheeler drivers and the public.
SLFP Councillor Rajive Weeraman, J V P Councillors Chadana Hettiarchchi and Waduge Piyasena, UNP Councillors Sumanadasa Janakade Soyza and Kumudu Fernando spoke.
