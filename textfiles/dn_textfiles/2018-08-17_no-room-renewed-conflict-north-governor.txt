No room for renewed conflict in North - Governor

There is no room for the recurrence of an armed conflict in the North even though a weapon or two may be detected from time to time, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray said.
He added that there won’t be another war in the North like in the past which wreaked havoc in the country. Nobody will be ever allowed to create a war situation in the North again.
The Northern Province Governor made these remarks while addressing a public welfare programme at the Mullaitivu public grounds recently.
It was organised by Security Forces Headquarters in Mullaitivu under the guidance of Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera. Women and differently abled persons engaged in self-employment projects in the Mullaitivu district were provided material aid by the Bodhiraja Padanama of Mullaitivu Security Forces Headquarters under this programme.
“It has been reported that a few firearms have been detected in the Rameshwaram area of Mullaitivu by the Security Forces recently. No room will be left for another armed conflict even if a weapon or two is detected from time to time in the North and East,” Governor Cooray said.
He added that finding a weapon is nothing new to an area that was subjected to a 30-year terrorist war.
“The Security Forces have been maintaining a peaceful atmosphere and a cordial rapport with the Northern people after eradicating LTTE terrorism. The Blood Banks of the hospitals in the North and East are filled with the blood of Tri-Forces personnel and Police officers. These personnel are predominantly Sinhala,” the Governor said.
The Governor asked the Northern politicians whether there is any issue when the blood of two ethnic groups is mixed. He added that several ancient Sinhala kings got married to women who came from Madras. Moreover Muslim merchants who came to the country had married Sinhala or Tamil women and stayed here. When considering these historical happenings, it is observed that the blood of Sri Lankans have been mixed from ancient days. He further said that Sinhala Police officers are providing security to all the Tamil politicians living in the North. “Regardless whether these Tamil politicians are represented in Parliament or at the Provincial Council, Sinhala officers are providing them security,” he noted.
The Governor further said that Security Forces personnel are holding an Olive branch instead of a weapon now.
