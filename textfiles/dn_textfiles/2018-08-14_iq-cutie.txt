IQ cutie!

A three-year-old has been dubbed Britain’s brainiest child with an IQ of 171 making her ‘smarter than Einstein’.
Ophelia Morgan-Dew, of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire spoke her first word at eight months and quickly learned numbers, colours and the alphabet.
Her mum realised she was bright and took her to experts who have given her an IQ score - of 171. That is a score of 11 above genius Albert Einstein - who had an IQ 160.
Ophelia’s score is higher than Arnav Sharma, 11, (162), and Rahul Doshi, 12, (162) previously hailed as Britain’s cleverest kids.
She can even remember things that happened before she was ONE - most adults have no memories before the age of three.
Ophelia is now Britain’s youngest member of MENSA and is said to have the intellectual capacity of a child more than twice her age.
She is now in the top 0.03 per cent of the population in terms of brain power.
Proud mum Natalie said unusually her first word ‘hiya’ had TWO syllables.
Natalie said, “She loves reading books with me or her dad, and she loves number work and letters and the computer. She is quite an active child, always likes to be doing something and is very spirited. She loves playing with her cousins and going to the park. Ophelia is such a beautiful girl and I would be proud of her no matter what she achieved, as long as she was healthy and happy. A lot of people, including myself, almost shy away from celebrating their children’s intellectual achievement. There seems to be a stigma around it. But then I thought it is no different to parents celebrating a medal in a sports event, so she deserves praise for being so clever.”
She added, “She has an amazing memory and remembers events that happened before she was 12 months old.”
Ophelia attends Abacus 2000 Nursery School in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, three days a week.
She was exceeding all her early learning goals, so her family took her see a child psychologist in London.
