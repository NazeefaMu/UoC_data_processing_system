Intervenient petition filed against Gammanpila’s petition

JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath yesterday filed an intervenient petition in the Supreme Court against the Special Determination petition filed by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila.
Filing this petition in the Supreme Court, Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath sought a determination that none of the clauses of the bill titled ‘Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution’ are inconsistent with any of the sections referred to in Article 83 of the Constitution and therefore the Bill does not need to be submitted for the approval of the people at a referendum.
Meanwhile, nine petitions challenging the Bill entitled ‘Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution’ were yesterday taken up for argument before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court. Further arguments fixed for today (13).
The petitioners stated that the Bill entitled ‘Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution’ was presented to Parliament by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on September 5.
The Petitioners state that several clauses of the said Bill, are in violation of, and inconsistent with several Articles of the Constitution.
