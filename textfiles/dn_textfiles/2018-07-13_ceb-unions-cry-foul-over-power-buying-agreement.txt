CEB Unions cry foul over power buying agreement

The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry officials have entered into an illegal agreement with a private power generating company to buy power for three years from a power plant in Embilipitiya causing a huge financial loss to the country, Joint Union Collective Convenor Ranjan Jayalal said.
Addressing the media Jayalal said the Sri Lanka Electricity Board had agreed with that illegal agreement to obtain power for three year period violating the directives of the Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).
The MOU had been signed between the private company and Ministry Secretary on April 5 this year. As per with the agreement, the Electricity Board purchases electricity from the private company at a cost of Rs 26 per unit and sells at Rs 16. The net loss is Rs 10 per unit, he said.
Owing to this transaction the private company receives a net profit of Rs 1,100 mn annually while the Electricity Board is run at a huge loss becoming a severe burden to the Treasury and the entire country.
Considering this situation, the PUCSL had recommended not to enter into this transaction as there is no justifiable reason to purchase electricity at this moment, he added.
“As per electricity purchase regulations, electricity should be purchased only for a short period probably for six months from the private sector. But when it comes to this so called agreement, the Electricity Board had agreed to purchase electricity for three years continuously, assuming there will be a severe drought for three years in the country.
"Now electricity generating reservoirs are full and there is no need to purchase a single unit from the public sector,” he noted.
Jayalal queried whether there were weather forecasters at the Electricity Board to assume that there will be a drought for three years.
CEB's former Power Purchasing Deputy General Manager Sujeewa Abeywickrama said there is a huge racket behind this transaction.As the result of him opposing this illegal transaction, Electricity Board authorities had suspended his services, he said.
Jayalal said the monetary loss to the Electricity Board will not be less than the bond issue losses.
