Ramesh Pathirana cries foul

The Government is causing innumerable obstructions to disrupt the holding of Joint Opposition’s public rally scheduled to be held in Habaraduwa, Galle on Saturday under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Galle District Parliamentarian and Joint Opposition Galle District leader Dr.Ramesh Pathirana alleged
“We planned to hold the rally under the theme Peraliyake Peramaga (forerunning for change) at Modarawatte, on the Colombo- Matara Highway, near the SLAF, Koggala, for which we obtained the required permits from the police,” Pathirana said.
“The government is shocked over the apparent success of the rally and is plotting to disrupt it. The police who issued the needed permits to hold the rally at the above land later requested us to shift the venue to the Koggala BOI grounds.
“The Police are influenced by a certain minister who hails from the area, Dr.Pathirana alleged. Now it is too late for us to change the venue of the rally as we have already made preliminary arrangements. On the other hand our former request to hold the meeting at the BOI grounds was first turned down by the BOI authorities.
Therefore, we will not change the venue of the meeting and it will be held as planned at Modarawatta in the Galle district,” Pathirana reiterated. However, when questioned, Habaraduwa Police OIC IP Udaya Kumara, denied any political influence over the issue.
“We do not want to disrupt the rally. We first granted permission to hold it at Modarawatte as the BOI authorities first refused to permit the organisers to hold the meeting at their ground. However, later they agreed to allow the meeting to be held at their grounds”.
“Therefore, the consideration of the anticipated big crowds expected by the organisers at the rally would not materialise due to the insufficient space availble at the ground.
The venue is located between the Colombo – Matara highway and main coastal railway. As we felt that the location was insecure for such a large rally to be held, we made a polite request from the organisers to rethink over the place of the public meeting.Furthermore, holding a meeting with a large public participation along the highway would result in traffic congestion during the meeting, causing immense obstacles to the public,”IP Udaya Kumara said. When contacted, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkody,said that he did not initiate any move to disrupt the rally but tried his best to help the organisers find a spacious place to suit the rally which is to be held under the patronage of former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa.
