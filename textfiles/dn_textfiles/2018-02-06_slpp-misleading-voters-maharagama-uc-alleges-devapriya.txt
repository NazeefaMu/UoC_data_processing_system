SLPP misleading voters in Maharagama UC, alleges Devapriya

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is carrying out an illegal election campaign and misleading voters in Maharagama Urban Council, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said.
Devapriya also said a complaint has been lodged over the violation of election laws and that they are to hand over a petition against the matter after the election as well.
Devapriya also condemned the SLPP for misleading the public by using photos of candidates who were in their rejected nomination list for Maharagama UC.
He observed that it is a violation of election laws to use the images of those persons when their nomination list got rejected. Devapriya alleged that the SLPP has given Rs. 5 million to an Independent Group that is contesting the Maharagama UC in the coming election, to stand on behalf of the SLPP.
According to Devapriya, the SLPP has forced the independent group to sign affidavits and take SLPP members as their own members.
Devapriya said the SLPP is misleading voters saying that if they vote to this independent group, the SLPP candidates can replace the list of the independent group which was accepted by the Election Commission. Devapriya also pointed out that this independent group is using the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in their leaflets as well.
Chief Minister Devapriya was speaking at a press brief held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institution yesterday afternoon.
“The SLPP usually projects itself as a party that works against the United National Party. However, in this case, they seem to support the UNP instead. We condemn the SLPP for violating the election laws and misleading the public,” he said. Asked if there would be changes in the government following the LG poll, Devapriya said that “This is not an election where we are looking to change or replace a leader or any such thing. This election is to select qualified politicians to work at village levels.
"President Sirisena recently said that he is ready to form a SLFP government if all 96 members would stand with him. If those who have walked away from the SLFP are ready to come back, then we can think about changing the government,” he said. Devapriya also commended President Sirisena for redefining patriotism as practicing financial discipline. He said it is a new political tendency and all are in supportive of President Sirisena in the fight against corruption.
