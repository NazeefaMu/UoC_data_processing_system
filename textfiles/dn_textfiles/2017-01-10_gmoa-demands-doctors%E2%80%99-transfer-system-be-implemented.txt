GMOA demands doctors’ transfer system be implemented

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will be forced to take trade union action if the Health Ministry does not take immediate action to implement the doctors’ transfers and transfer system. The transfer list for 2017 is still not ready, (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Transfers granted since 2012 are held up due to the non-implementation. Some state hospitals face the danger of closure due to the non-implementation of doctors’ transfers as directed by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary, he said at a press conference held at the GMOA Head Office, Colombo.
According to Dr. Zoysa, hospital directors of some state hospitals ignore and overlook the directives issued to them by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary. Action should be taken against them according to the Establishment Code as stated by the Health Ministry Secretary, he said.
The Directors who implement the orders of the Commission and the Health Secretary are now in trouble because they do not get doctors for their hospitals once they implement and transfer doctors attached to their hospitals, Soyza said.
The Hospital Directors who obey the rules and regulations and follow the orders of the Commission and the Health Secretary’s orders get into trouble and face various difficulties, he said.
The GMOA is now in the process of collecting details of the Hospital Directors who do not implement the orders given to them by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary.
The details will be handed over to the authorities soon, he added.
