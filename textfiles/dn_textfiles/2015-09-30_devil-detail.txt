Geneva consensus
Devil is in the detail

The much awaited outcome of the on-going sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva is becoming clearer by the day: a 'consensus' resolution co-sponsored by the United States and Sri Lanka will emerge, despite vociferous opposition both locally and internationally. This resolution will sanction a 'domestic' inquiry with the 'participation' of foreign personnel into alleged violations of human rights during the final stages of the Eelam war not merely by the Sri Lankan security forces but also by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
There was much angst in Colombo when the UNHRC sessions began. That was because the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Hussein made some scathing comments regarding the Sri Lankan judicial system in his opening remarks at the sessions and called for a 'hybrid' inquiry incorporating both local and international personnel stating that a purely domestic inquiry will lack credibility and will not be able to convince a sceptical audience.
There were sighs of relief when the United States intervened, supporting Sri Lanka's call for a domestic inquiry but that euphoria was short-lived as some European Union countries, spurred on by the Eelam lobby, persisted in calling for an internationalised probe.
What then evolved was a resolution that called for a domestic inquiry but included the participation of 'commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators'.
'Domestic' inquiry
This was to cause even more confusion. Locally, even as the President and Prime Minister were holding a briefing to reassure the public that a domestic probe would be conducted, groups and political parties opposed to the Maithripala Sirisena - Ranil Wickremesinghe government were claiming that the term 'domestic inquiry' was an eyewash for a full scale international probe because there would be international participation. This was in fact, the 'hybrid' probe that High Commissioner Hussein had called for, carefully camouflaged with a play on words, they claimed.
The wording confused not only the average citizen in Sri Lanka, it appears to have stumped the country's envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, career Foreign Service officer Ravinatha Aryasinha as well. Aryasinha went on the offensive regarding the wording, raising eyebrows in the United States diplomatic contingent. It is learnt that Aryasinha was later cautioned by Colombo to tone down the rhetoric and adopt a more accommodating approach.
Some clarity emerged this week when, after meeting with President Sirisena in New York, US Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement. In it, Kerry said that the inquiry would be "one that is led and owned by the Sri Lankan people and is conducted in cooperation with the UN and with international support".
Reading between the lines, what will eventuate is an inquiry where Sri Lanka will be the decision makers in the process of the inquiry itself: it will choose who the judges and prosecutors are and set the agenda for the probe. In that sense, it will indeed be a 'domestic' inquiry.
However, Colombo will be obliged to include international participants in the probe. Who they are, what their roles would be, whether they will be active participants or mere observers and the framework within which they will operate will be for Sri Lanka to decide. This is what Kerry means when he states that the inquiry will be 'led and owned by the Sri Lankan people'.
The devil though is in the detail. It is still unclear what the exact mechanism of the probe would be although Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has been elaborating on a multi-tiered reconciliation mechanism involving religious leaders and a South African style Truth Commission. The specific modus operandi of these processes will finally determine whether Sri Lanka can truly control the inquiry process or whether the 'foreign participants' will be the key decision makers.
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government however is clearly happy with this outcome. It sees this as a major diplomatic victory and indeed, the Eelam lobby, which had been campaigning for a no holds barred international probe spearheaded by the UNHRC is disappointed. Already Premier Wickremesinghe is on record stating that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa led the country to this crisis by providing assurances to United Nations Secretary General Ban-Ki-moon in the aftermath of the war victory and then not honouring them. He sees the current scenario as a way out of that predicament.
International community
However, sections of the Tamil political movement in Sri Lanka are unhappy. A joint statement signed by all other three constituent parties of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) except the Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchchi (ITAK), comprising of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), Democratic People's Liberation Front (DPLF), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) and the Tamil National People's Front (TNPF) have already written to the UNHRC pleading for the probe to revert to an "international criminal justice process".
At the other end of the political spectrum, the National Freedom Front led by Wimal Weerawansa has called for a referendum before the probe goes ahead. Weerawansa said that if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues.
Weerawansa's vociferous partner in opposing the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila has said that their party is contemplating legal action in the Supreme Court against such a probe. This would be on the basis that having international judges participate in a probe of this nature would violate the country's sovereignty.
Even if the government feels that it has won over the international community with its offer to co-operate with the UNHRC, it must be aware that the battle is hardly over. The pro-Eelam lobby in the West will monitor and interpret every move the government makes with regard to the inquiry- and cry foul at the slightest hint of impropriety.
UNHRC probe
To avert this, Colombo should act on the recommendations of the final resolution that will be adopted in Geneva promptly, efficiently and sincerely so that it will convince its supporters at the UNHRC - the US and India being among them - of its bon fides.
In doing so however, it is likely to run in to opposition from the more nationalistic elements in Sri Lanka. These groups identify themselves mostly with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. A significant proportion of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party also support them, at least tacitly if not overtly.
Rajapaksa, confined to the benches of the opposition after being the all-powerful President of the country for ten years, is spoiling for a fight. It is too soon after the general election to take the government on issues such as the economy. The UNHRC probe will be a godsend to Rajapaksa and his loyalists to try and re-establish themselves as a force to reckon with in the domestic political equation.
The UNHRC session in Geneva will conclude this week. However, the drama related to Sri Lanka's prosecution of the Eelam war to a finish will be played out in the corridors of power in Colombo for months to come-and there will be no shortage of eager spectators from around the globe who will no doubt provide critical reviews and see whether the saga follows the script to the letter.
