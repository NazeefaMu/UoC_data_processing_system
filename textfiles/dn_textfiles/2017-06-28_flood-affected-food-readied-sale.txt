Flood-affected food readied for sale

A health team led by Ketaliyampalla PHI Chaminda Vithanage found a stock of dampened food stuff subjected to floods, being readied to be released to the market, from a store house in Ketaliyampalla belonging to a major firm, recently.
The stock worth nearly Rs. 300,000 was found during an inspection of residences and establishments with regard to the dengue eradication programme.
They found that the agent concerned had tried to release the flood affected food stuff including tins of salmon, onions and soya meat to the market ignoring instructions given to destroy it.
The health officials who summoned the Ratnapura District Manager of the firm to the venue issued a severe warning to the sub agent for his wrongful act and took steps to destroy the entire stock by taking it to Kanadola garbage management centre.
