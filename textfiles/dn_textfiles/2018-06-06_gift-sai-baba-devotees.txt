Gift for Sai Baba  devotees

For the first time in the world, an abridged version of the book “Sai Sat Charithram” has been translated in Sinhala and being released on 10th of June 2018 by Sai Nathanin Saranalayam a Shirdi Sai temple located in Kotahena, Colombo.
Sai Sat Charithra is considered as the holiest book of Sai devotees. The book describes the life history and teachings of Sai Baba in simple terms.
It is believed that those who read the book with complete faith in Baba are relieved of their troubles and bad karmas not only from this birth but also from previous and future births.
Shirdi Sai movement is spreading fast across the world and Sri Lanka is no exemption to this. Sai Baba appeared from nowhere at the age of 16 under a neem tree in a small village called Shirdiin Maharastra, India.
He showered unconditional love on people not only from Shirdi but also on all who sought his help. Like the Buddha, he was so humble and was free of any ego that he had no hesitation in begging food from others. He shared whatever he received with those in need.
He blessed his devotees with unlimited miracles and happiness in their lives. He promised that he would answer the calls of devotees even after leaving his physical form. He is sticking to his wards till date.
A temple for Shirdi Sai Baba in the name of “Sai Nathanin Saranalayam” was set up under unplanned circumstances in the first floor of Iyngaran Hall at Sri Varadaraja Vinayagar Temple, Kotahena, and Colombo in April 2017.
Within a year of inception, Sai Baba in this temple has blessed a lot of devotees with peace prosperity and several miraculous experiences.
With his grace, several spiritual events have also been conducted, attracting flocks of devotees from all over Sri Lanka.
He has also brought in several spiritual gurus and devotees from India and abroad for discourses.
The trustees of Sai Nathanin Saranalayam are now releasing this Sinhala book, an abridged version of
“Shirdi Sai Sat Charithra”, in order for our Sinhalese sisters and brothers to get to know Sai Baba and experience his abundant love. The trustees invite the public to attend the ceremony and get Baba’s blessings.
