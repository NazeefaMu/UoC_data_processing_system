‘SL can be among world’s top startup ecosystems’

Sri Lanka’s budding startup ecosystem has huge potential to be among the top ecosystems in the world, says Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman Ruwindhu Peiris.
According to Peiris, an event like Disrupt Asia has managed to bring the entire ecosystem to one gathering. Disrupt Asia proved to be a massive success in both its years.
“Events like Disrupt Asia are fundamentally important in terms of setting the stage, exposing the country to what the possibilities are and in many ways a celebration of what we are. No one else would’ve done it apart from ICTA and they’ve done a great job in bringing together the entire ecosystem in a very meaningful way.”
Sharing his views on the the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka, which is the apex ICT institution in the country, Peiris noted that ICTA is positioning Sri Lanka to be a knowledge and innovation hub in the global space.
"ICTA collaborates with the IT industry in the country as a whole and works towards the development of the entire industry, thus promoting Sri Lanka’s ability in the international marketplace. It’s a tough role when you have to deal with multiple stakeholders especially when you have competing stakeholders."
According to him, only an organization with maturity and finesse will be able to do this and ICTA is the most suitable organization for this task. "In my experience, ICTA has done very well, in terms of playing that role."
“ICTA has carried out many initiatives in bringing the private sector together. ICTA has been able to infuse a vision of where we should be heading as a nation, enabling infrastructure for the government and the country overall to be really digitally enabled, which is the starting point; if you don’t have this, everything else just falls behind.
The agency has provided a foundational platform for the private sector to stand upon and reach the stars in many ways, of which we are all very appreciative and ICTA has done a fantastic job,” he said. He also points out the role of ICTA in clearly charting the national agenda that is aligned with the country's vision.
“Over the last two years, ICTA has truly set the bar at a high level when it comes to the quality and magnitude of how they look at stuff. It has helped the industry set a bar as a whole," the SLASSCOM Chairman said. "ICTA will continue its support for the IT industry for the foreseeable future and will play its catalytic role in transforming the economy."
Meanwhile, at the recently concluded SLASSCOM annual general meeting, Peiris urged the need to pursue bold initiatives for the future while celebrating the success story of the local IT industry.
"With the rise of disruptive technologies along with countries such as Vietnam and Thailand entering the fray, there’s a short window of opportunity to seize the future. And to seize that future, we need to be bold," Peiris said.
Sri Lankan ICT exports are expected to reach Rs 5 billion in 2022 with 200,000 ICT professionals. (IH)
