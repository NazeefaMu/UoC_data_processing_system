Ostapenko falls to US qualifier Lepchenko

Toronto: Qualifier Varvara Lepchenko rallied to stun French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 1-6, 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/5) on Monday in the first round of the WTA hardcourt tournament in Toronto.
American veteran Lepchenko, 31-years old and ranked 68th in the world, trailed 6-1, 3-0 before turning things around against the 12th-ranked Latvian, who had followed up her Roland Garros triumph by reaching the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.
“I think I woke up, I was a little bit in the sleeping mode for a set and a half,” said Lepchenko, a former top-20 player herself. “All the credit to her, she played amazing tennis - she hardly missed any ball from the very beginning.
“Once I gave her a little push back, that’s when the game started. I pretty much focused on my game. AFP
