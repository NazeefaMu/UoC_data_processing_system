Senarath Bandara appointed CEO/GM, BOC

The Board of Directors of Bank of Ceylon (BOC) appointed Senarath Bandara as the Bank’s General Manager and Chief Executive Officer on yesterday.
This was upon receiving approval from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and other relevant authorities. The appointment comes in the wake of the retirement of D.M. Gunasekera, a career banker completing 34 years, who was appointed GM-CEO in January 2013.
A senior banker with an illustrious career at Bank of Ceylon spanning 28 years, Bandara was the Bank’s Deputy General Manager (Sales and Channel Management) before assuming duties in his new position. He joined the bank as a management trainee in 1990 and now becomes the 20th General Manager of the Bank and has gained considerable experience in key areas of banking such as treasury and international, retail and corporate banking, development banking, electronic banking and technology initiatives associated with these areas. He was the CEO of the Bank of Ceylon (UK) Limited from 2011 to 2012.
“In BOC’s role as a commercial bank my focus is on proving a customer centric service and my mission would be to infuse the Bank’s products and services with the latest technology so as to meet and exceed the expectations of Bank’s customers ranging from individuals to corporate clients and to expand our overseas presence beyond its present level.”
Commenting on his new role, Bandara said “BOC’s role in the economy goes beyond that of being a commercial bank. It plays the vital role of being a catalyst in the country’s economic development. In recognition of this role, BOC will continue to strengthen developmental and SME lending.”
