Arrest warrant issued on Gnanasara Thera

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant to arrest Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera for not presenting in Court in connection with a case filed against him.
Gnanasara Thera was not present before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara over an allegation that he (Thera) had allegedly made a hate speech tantamount to hurting the sentiments of the Muslim community in the country. The Organized Crimes Prevention Division had filed a B report in Court in this regard.
