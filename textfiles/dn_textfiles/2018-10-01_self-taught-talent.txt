Self-taught talent

Eighteen-year-old Angela Clayton adores historical fashion and costumery. Taking her love one step further she sews her own garments. The seamstress crafts long, flowing dresses fit for royalty and exquisite gowns that would make Cinderella the belle of the ball (without a Fairy Godmother).
Her projects take an incredible amount of skill, featuring complicated ruching, hand appliqu, and bodice forming. When each garment is complete, Clayton models her handiwork, taking on the look and attitude of the character who has inspired her.
With such complex patterning and construction, it might surprise you to learn that Clayton began sewing only three years ago. Originally, she was interested in creating things for cosplay, since it combined her love of creating, makeup, photography, and dressing up.
Since then, she has also translated her interest in history into garments that were worn many centuries ago, including the Renaissance and mid 1800s. Clayton is almost entirely self-taught. Thanks to the Internet as well as some trial and error, she dove into the hobby head first.
Despite her lack of formal instruction, she’s not afraid to tackle the hard stuff.
“If I want to create something,” she writes, “I’ll do something regardless of how complicated it is.”
This attitude will undoubtedly keep her learning and growing, leading her to her future goal of working in the costume industry.
“I’m not sure what job would suit me best, but I know I want to spend my life doing what I love, so it has to somehow involve sewing and dresses.”
