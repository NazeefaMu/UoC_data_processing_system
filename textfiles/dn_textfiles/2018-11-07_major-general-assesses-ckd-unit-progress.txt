In order to assess the progress of the Army-undertaken construction of the four-storied building for treatment of kidney patients at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, on the directions of the Commander of the Army went there on Monday and met members of the Corps of Engineer Services of the Army who are engaged in the project.
