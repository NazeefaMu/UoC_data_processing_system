AISHWARYA RAI  goes the Beyonce way

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s introductory song in ‘Fanney Khan’, ‘Mohabbat’, which has been directed by international choreographer Frank Gatson Jr, is being touted as one of the highlights of the musical drama.
Atul Manjrekar, who makes his directorial debut with the film, told Mirror, “The concept of the song came through Aishwarya’s character in the film. She plays a diva, a singing star. She’s the number one singer and the most beautiful woman in the country. The song sees her character touring across India and performing in front of a live audience. For the sequence, we referenced recent concerts that featured Arijit Singh, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay. That was the starting point.”
Recently, during an interaction with a tabloid, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra spoke about the efforts he has put while developing the script of the film. He revealed that for him the journey of ‘Fanney Khan’ began when he first saw the Belgian film, ‘Everybody’s Famous’. He revealed that over the years, he along with his wife Bharathi and Atul Manjrekar have been working on the script of the film. He added that the story of the film revolves around passion, parenting, and friendship, which need to be told to the audience. ‘Fanney Khan’ is a one of its kind musical comedy, revolving around a father who wishes to fulfill his daughter’s dream of becoming a singer. The film is slated to hit the screens on August 3. TNN
