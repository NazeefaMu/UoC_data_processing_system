20th Amendment to the Constitution bill to be presented before NPC today

 
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution will be presented before the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) today, NPC Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam said.
He said that a debate will be held to decide whether to hold Provincial Council Election polls on the same day, as the 20th Amendment suggests.
However NPC Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran expressed his uncertainty at a previous instance on receiving the approval of the NPC.
