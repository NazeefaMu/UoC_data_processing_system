Trinity OBA 125th anniversary celebrations

The Trinity College Old Boys Association will celebrate its 125th Anniversary with a vintage car rally on September 10 starting at 10 am from the junior school. It will proceed along William Gopallawa Mawatha to Getambe and return via Old Peradeniya Road and end at Asgiriya grounds.
To mark this historic occasion a 125th anniversary souvenir will be launched. The motor rally will be followed by a series of events on September 9 and 10. The programme includes presentation of awards to old boys who have distinguished themselves in different fields of endeavor and a dinner dance. The Trinity College OBA was formed in 1892, twenty years after the school was established when the then Principal, Rev Napier-Slavering, requested the old boys to form an association. A preliminary meeting had been held in December, 1892 at the principal’s bungalow at which the principal was made the pro-tem president, JH Sproule the vice president with JW Wirakoon as the secretary cum treasurer.
The first general meeting was held on 12 August 1893 and the program included a cricket match. The principal of the school continued to hold the position as president of the OBA until 1918 when for the first time an old boy of the school, TBL Moonemalle, took up the post.
He continued as president until 1924. Thereafter it was always an old boy that held this position. In August 1922 the OBA celebrated its jubilee. The foundation stone for the chapel was laid the same day. At the 2017 OBA, 15 Old Boys who have excelled in their fields will receive the Trinity Prize - the highest award that an Old Boy can receive.
These awards will be presented at the 7th night of the Lions ceremony which will be held on September 9 at 4.00 pm at the Trinity College Hall.
