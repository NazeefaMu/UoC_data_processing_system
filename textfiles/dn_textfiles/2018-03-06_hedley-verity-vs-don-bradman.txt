Hedley Verity vs Don Bradman

‘His ideal physique and his lovely, economical, run-up were coordinated to put him in a perfect delivery position with a superb command of length and direction.’ – Don Bradman on Verity
Don Bradman was in terrific touch as he thrashed three successive fours off England’s slow left arm spinner, Hedley Verity, in his first over during Australia’s first innings of the 1934 Lord’s Second Test. It was 23rd June and a sunny Saturday states Roland Perry in his book ‘BRADMAN’S BEST ASHES TEAMS.’
Australia one-up in the series, reached 1 for 141 chasing England’s 440.With Bradman in such murderous touch in partnership with a set Bill Brown, Australia looked likely to lead in the first innings. Bradman had started the series poorly at Nottingham scoring just 29 and 25.
His steel trap mind was programmed to concentrate as only he could do for a big score - something in order of his last effort at Lord’s in the second Test in 1930 when he made 254. Australian skipper Bill Woodfull, who had been dismissed for 22, was in the dressing room fretting about Bradman’s ‘terrible power and splendour,’ as writer Neville Cardus described it recalled Perry. Woodfull remembered Verity’s dismissal of Bradman at the notorious Adelaide Test in 1932-33 Bodyline series
It was in that Adelaide Test that Bradman, in a similar mindset of unrelenting aggression and brilliance, had seen off Harold Larwood and had celebrated by hitting Verity for a six. Bradman was going for another boundary when he was caught and bowled for 66, just when an innings of 266 was needed from him.
Woodfull was at the other end when it happened and annoyed at Bradman’s rush of blood. Woodfull thought that it cost Australia a Test and never forgave his charge for it. Now he was having nervous premonitions of Bradman, who had already hit seven fours in an innings of 36, being again impetuous against Verity and getting himself out. He sent a message out to Bradman, imploring him to be less aggressive.
‘He [Woodfull] thought Bradman was going to throw his wicket away,’ and he was under instruction to “calm down.” It threw his concentration. The very next ball he restrained himself when his natural inclination was to keep attacking. In so doing, he checked a shot against his better judgment and was caught and bowled.’
Australia still had most of the final session to play in the sun on Saturday. Bradman felt that he had been allowed free rein, Australia would have saved the follow on by reaching 290, despite the storm that hit London on the rest day, Sunday, and the subsequent rain into Monday morning. Bradman’s disgruntlement had some merit, but it was merely conjecture. The scoreboard showed the hard fact that Verity had removed him again at a critical point in a Test, noted Perry. Australia was two for 192 at stumps on day two.
At the team’s London hotel Verity awoke on Monday morning and was delighted when he looked thru his window on to the street. It was bleak and damp, just the way he loved it. The pitch would be wet after being left uncovered (as they were then). He drove team-mate Charlie Barnett to Lord’s at St John’s Wood for the game and, on the way, had the misfortune to run over and kill a black cat. To Barnet’s amazement, Verity parked the car and went on knocking on doors on both sides of the street until he found the cat’s owner and apologised.
‘A couple of people recognised Hedley,’ Barnett recalled,’ and they were stunned that a famous English cricketer should be so concerned moments before he was due at Lord’s. But it was typical Hedley. He was humane and humble to the bootstraps.’
That dead black pussy was an omen not for Verity, but for the Australians. He was so confident of the conditions he was about to bowl in that he could let himself be distracted in such a bizarre way, moments before a big occasion.
When play resumed under overcast skies, Bill Bowes removed Bill Brown, caught at the wicket for 105 with the score at 203.Then Verity continued the rot by having the dangerous Stan McCabe (34) caught by Hammond at slip. Australia was four for 205. Len Darling didn’t last long. He was caught by Sutcliffe off Verity for a duck. Five for 204.
Australia still 86 short of avoiding the follow on. Bradman’s dismissal the day before now seemed like the game’s turning point. Verity’s figures were 36 overs, 15 maidens, seven wickets for 61 runs.
He was known in England as the master of sticky wickets. Debate ensued about how bad the Lord’s wicket was, an indication that Verity conjured problems for the batsmen by playing mind games with them by using calibrated changes in pace, spin and direction, along with adjustments on the field. Verity played on the fact that most batsman thought he was easy to hit because he was a slow bowler. He left gaps in the field, inviting them to take him on.
The great and the not so great fell for this more often than not, and Verity walked away with wickets by the bucketful in first class cricket, added Perry.
Now at Lord’s at the age of 29 and near his peak, Verity had demonstrated his subtle skills against top international opposition. England skipper Bob Wyatt enforced the follow-on. Australia began its second innings just before 3 p.m. They soon lost Brown caught for two. In came Bradman at 2 for 43. Subdued again by his skipper, the state of the game and the wicket, Bradman was cautious.
He took 30 minutes to score 13. He became restless. Verity cunningly left cover open and deep behind it unoccupied. Bradman took the bait, jumped down the wicket and mishit. The ball flew high straight above the wicket. Seven players could have taken it. Bradman stepped aside. Keeper Les Ames moved under the ball and caught it. Bradman always stood between England and victory. By 6 p.m. Verity had obliterated the Australians (all out 118), taking 8 for 43.
