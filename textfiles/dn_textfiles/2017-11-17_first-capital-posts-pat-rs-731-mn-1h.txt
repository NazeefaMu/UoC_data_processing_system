First Capital posts PAT  of Rs 731 mn for 1H

First Capital Holdings PLC (the Group) recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 731 million for the first half of 2017-18, a substantial increase compared to Rs. 406 million in the corresponding period of the previous year. Total comprehensive income for the first half was Rs. 641 million (2016-17 – Rs. 406 million).
The primary dealer business dominated the Group’s earnings reporting a profit after tax of Rs. 538 million for the first half (2016-17 – Rs. 371 million), displaying an impressive performance.
First Capital Treasuries PLC capitalized on opportunities created by declining interest rates in the secondary market, realizing significant trading gains. With a track record of over 25 years, the company was the first licensed primary dealer appointed by the Central Bank, and is also the only listed and rated primary dealer in Sri Lanka, with a capital base of Rs. 2.2 billion. A strategic approach has led to improved activity in the corporate finance business, mobilising Rs. 13 billion for clients through structuring and placement of corporate debt securities and recording a fee income of Rs. 42 million (2016-17 – Rs. 30 million) during the period under review.
First Capital Asset Management Limited recorded a substantial growth in funds under management to end with Rs. 6.7 billion as at September 30, 2017.
The Group’s equity arm, First Capital Equities took several steps to strengthen its business by establishing strategic partnerships with brokering houses based in Asia and the United States, in addition to reinforcing its local efforts through the Group’s expanding branch network. “Whilst we are pleased with our performance to date, we expect earnings to moderate in the second half with interest rates stabilizing resulting in lower trading opportunities for the primary dealer business,” said Director/Group CEO Dilshan Wirasekara.
“However, we will continue to work throughout the year towards ensuring that our fundamentals remain strong to sustain our business in the long term. Our main focus is to enhance the fee-based activities and the management of risk,” said Wirasekara.
The credit rating of First Capital Holdings PLC and First Capital Treasuries PLC was reaffirmed by ICRA Lanka Limited in October 2017 at “A-”.
