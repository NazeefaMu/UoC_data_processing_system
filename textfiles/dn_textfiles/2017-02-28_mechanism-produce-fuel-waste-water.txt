Mechanism to produce fuel from waste water

N. M. T. Nissanka, an environmental scientist attached to a development project of a construction company in Nuwara Eliya has conducted successful research on utilizing waste water discharged from small and large scale rubber factories to produce fuel.
The residue water after treatment can be used for cultivation to ensure a better crop.
Nissanka who has earlier worked as an officer attached to the Central Environment Authority said he succeeded in making this invention after laborious experiments conducted over almost one year.
He used the waste water discharge from a rubber sheet manufacturing plant at Nelumdeniya owned by M. R. K. Jayakody.
