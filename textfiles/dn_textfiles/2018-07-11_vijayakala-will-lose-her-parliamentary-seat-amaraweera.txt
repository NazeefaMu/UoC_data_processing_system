Vijayakala will lose her parliamentary seat: Amaraweera

Vijayakala Maheswaran will lose her seat in Parliament, Agricultural Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was participating in a blood donation programme held at the Sri Whardanarama Temple in Sitinamaluwa, Tangalle recently organised by the Mahinda Amaraweera Foundation and youths of Sitinamaluwa. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said Vijayakala made a wrong statement.
"It was unpatriotic. She has resigned from the minister post but it was not enough.
"I think she will lose her seat in Parliament. We do not tolerate terrorism. We condom her statement," the Minister said.
