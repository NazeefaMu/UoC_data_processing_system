Ideal solution for cholesterol
Three Soyfresh products to local market

Milk food, animal meat based food, chicken and other red meats are considered as food containing cholesterol. Intakes of such food directly supply cholesterol into the human body.
In addition the human liver also produces certain amount of cholesterol using saturated fat and transfat contained in the human food. Nevertheless high levels cholesterol in blood increase the risk of heart attacks and other complications in the human blood circulation system. High level of cholesterol falls under non contagious diseases and it has become a cause for people to suffer from cholesterol related complications. To combat above situation, H.E. Marketing has introduced ‘Soyfresh’ a soya milk product into the local market. Soyfresh is produced in Malaysia using herbal soya cereals imported from Canada and marketed in more than 30 countries around the world and has won the confidence of cholesterol patients. ‘Soyfresh’ contains ingredients successful in controlling cholesterol levels of patients showing high percentages of Lactose. Soyfersh stands high from other Soya milk products in the market due to its rich milky taste and it is free excessive Soya bean taste. It is available in strawberry and chocolate flavours.
HE Marketing has now introduced the three new soya products, protein plus, low sugar, and added calcium to the Sri Lankan market.
The selection of Soyfresh to serve in local star class hotels and in the outlets of Barista Coffee chain and the merging of Soyfresh as a natural herbal drink is a unique feature. Soyfresh provides the required protein amount to the body helping in maintaining an attractive slim body shape. As Soyfresh contain calcium and is free of fat it is an ideal drink for elders too. Particularly for elders suffering from calcium deficiency Soyfresh is an ideal supplementary drink.
