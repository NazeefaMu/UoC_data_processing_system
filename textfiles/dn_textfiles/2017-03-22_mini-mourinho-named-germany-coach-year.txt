Mini-Mourinho named Germany coach of year

BERLIN: Hoffenheim’s Julian Nagelsmann, 29, the youngest head coach in Bundesliga history, has been named coach of 2016 in Germany.
The German Football Association (DFB) award is just deserts for the work Nagelsmann did by keeping Hoffenheim up last season, then turning them into title challengers.
He joins the likes of Borussia Dortmund’s Thomas Tuchel and Bayern Munich’s assistant coach Hermann Gerland, who were named Germany’s coach of the year in times gone by.
“This has come quickly, but that’s typical of him,” said Horst Hrubesch, the DFB’s director of sport.
“Julian Nagelsmann is a great example of some of the talented young coaches we have in Germany.” Hoffenheim were the last team, in any of Europe’s top leagues, to be beaten this season and under Nagelsmann’s steerage they currently sit fourth and are challenging for a Champions League place for 2017/18.
Eyebrows were raised in February 2016 when Nagelsmann, then aged just 28, was made head coach of Hoffenheim. AFP
