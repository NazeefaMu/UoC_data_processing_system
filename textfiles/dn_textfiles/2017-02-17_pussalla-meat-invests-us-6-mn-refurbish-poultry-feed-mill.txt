Pussalla Meat invests US$ 6 mn  to refurbish poultry feed mill

Pussalla Meat Producers has invested US$ 6.06 million to refurbish and upgrade their poultry feed mill at Dompe to international standards. Managing Director Dilshan Wewita said the feed mill is technically advanced right from the handling of raw material to the loading of finished products.
This fully automated mill is the only such one owned by a Sri Lankan entrepreneur.In September 2015 the company’s feed milling operations at Udamapitigama, Dompe, in the Gampaha district came on stream which helped the company to a great extent.
With the demand increasing they had to reinvest to increase capacity as Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR) were not adequate.“This was the case until we built our own feed mill,’’Wewita told to Daily News.
Pussalla has the distinction of being the first Sri Lankan company to operate a 20 tonne per hour plant. It is also the country’s first fully automated facility, capable of producing 12,000 tons of feed per month which would fulfill our current requirement. “Today we are running the poultry feed at 60% capacity.”
Running its own feed plant meant that Pussalla could have better control on the quality of the raw material. This is in turn will give good quality, end products.
Pussalla started seeing “big improvements” as early as April last year when FCR dropped to1.6. Prior to that FCR was fluctuating at around 1.75-1.85. Pussalla Meat
“Where breeders were concerned, Pussalla started seeing better egg weight, which contributed to uniformity in the flock.”
“We were never able to stay in the weight ranges recommended by the breeder company. Now we can maintain the right weight. We were also able to cut down breeder feed by 10-12%,” he said.
“The customers who buy chicks from us now used to purchase feed as well and they are also happy with our feed and this would bring additional revenue to us.” “In addition the broiler contract farmers who use our chicks are experiencing their profits growing,” he said.
Pussalla Meat Producers feed products are doing well on the market. The company has sold around 30-35% of its volume to commercial farmers during the last six months.The company creates specialized feed products such as antibiotic-free feed to produce antibiotic-free chicken. “We are already practicing withdrawing antibiotics in the feed, seven days before harvest. We hope to launch antibiotic - free Chicken by mid-2017,”, Wewita said.
