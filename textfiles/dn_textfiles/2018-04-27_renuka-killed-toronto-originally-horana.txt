Renuka, killed in Toronto, originally from Horana

The Sri Lankan, Renuka Beatrice Amarasinghe, 46, who was among those killed when a van plowed into a crowded Toronto pavement in Canada on Monday, was originally from Uduwa, Horana.
She had been living in Canada with her seven-year-old child after obtaining Canadian citizenship after her husband deserted her with her newborn infant. She had faced the tragic death while she was on her way to fetch her child after school.
Renuka, who visited Sri Lanka for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year with her family and friends, had returned to Canada only on April 17. Renuka had two other siblings, an elder brother named Hemantha Amarasinghe and a sister named Pushpa Amarasinghe.
Hemantha occupies their ancestral home at Kidelpitiya Uduwa in Horana while sister Pushpa lives with their mother at Kumbuke, Gonapola in Horana. Her family members are deeply shocked and grieved to hear of her untimely death.
