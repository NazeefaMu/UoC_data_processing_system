Case against Gammanpila, Jayasinghe fixed for January 26

Further trial into the case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction, was fixed for January 26 by the Colombo High Court, yesterday.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case, was cross-examined by the defence counsel. The accused are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that the accused had cheated Rs. 20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman named Dhammika Perera.
The AG further said the alleged business transaction had taken place by abusing the power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses to the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne, appeared for the Attorney General.
President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando, with Jayantha Weerasinghe and Senior Counsel Nalinda Indatissa, appeared for MP Gammanpila.
