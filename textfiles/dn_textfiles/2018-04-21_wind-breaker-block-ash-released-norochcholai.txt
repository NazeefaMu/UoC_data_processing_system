Wind breaker to block ash released from Norochcholai

Power and Renewable Energy, and Disaster Management Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday assured the people in Puttalam that a new wind breaker would solve the issue of ash released from the Norochcholai Power Plant.
The minister was attending a meeting at the Puttalam District Secretariat to discuss the issues of the people as a result of the prevailing drought in the Puttalam District. “We have taken all necessary steps to construct a wind breaker at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant to minimise ash released into the atmosphere and it would soon be in operation. Through this, a sustainable solution to the problem will be provided,” he said.
Drought-affected families in the Puttalam District numbering 167,000 have been provided with relief worth Rs. 485 million thus far, said the minister. He explained that they were preparing a Cabinet paper to look into the families who have been left out.
He added that the Ministry was working to provide 25,000 families with drinking water.
Disaster Management Ministry Secretary, Puttlam District Secretariat and officials were present at the meeting.
