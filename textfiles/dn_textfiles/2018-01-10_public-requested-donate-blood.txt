Public requested to donate blood

The National Blood Transfusion Service and the National Blood Transfusion Centre appeal to the general public to donate blood as much as they can to meet the country’s demand for blood.
Director of the Centre Dr. Rukshan Bellana said decreasing in the number of blood donators was evident during January to April every year.
The public can donate blood to the centre at the Narahenpita Junction, Colombo 5 (TP No. 0112369931- 4, http://www.nbts.health.gov.lk/) or to the blood bank of the nearest state hospital. A donor can donate blood once in every four months and one donor’s blood can save three lives.
While saving many lives, donating blood improves the donor’s overall cardiovascular health. It enhances producing new blood cells and reduces the cancer risks. It also helps burns calories, medical experts point out.
