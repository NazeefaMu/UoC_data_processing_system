Ranil urged to step down from UNP leadership

A group of former United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians yesterday called on party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down and hold a special UNP convention to decide on the party’s new candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The group which includes former party General Secretary Tissa Attanayaka, former ministers, deputy ministers and MP’s said urgent measures should be taken to restore democracy in the party.
The former UNP MP’s stressed that it was imperative for Wickremesinghe to be replaced as the party leader to ensure democracy in the party and its success at future elections.
The group said they have been calling for party reforms for a long time but it had fallen on deaf ears.
They said the party was in its death throes today since Wickremesinghe is running the party dictatorially for the last 24 years.
The group questioned how a leader who had undermined democracy in the party could talk about democracy in the country. They said the best way forward was to call for an urgent party convention and let the membership decide who the next leader and the prime ministerial nominee.
