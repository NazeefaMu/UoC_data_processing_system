Healthcare at trade fair

Lanka Hospitals was the official healthcare partner of the 8th Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF) that took place at the Municipal Grounds Jaffna, recently. JITF is a successful event that takes the Jaffna Peninsula to the rest of the country and the region, strengthening business partnerships and building new business relationships among various disciplines.
Lanka Hospitals made JITF a platform to educate the people of Jaffna and surrounding areas as well as other stakeholders on its international standards and Centres of Excellence that have recorded many firsts in the country’s health care industry.
Spectators at JITF were given an opportunity to get their blood sugar and blood pressure tested at the Lanka Hospitals trade stall while Information on Cardiac, IVF, Gastroenterology and ENT services were readily available for everyone who visited the JITF.
Making ample use of the opportunity Lanka Hospitals, presented three First Aid boxes with 11 essential medicinal items to Our Children’s Home, SOS Children’s Village and Central College Jaffna during the culminating day of the trade fair and exhibition. The CSR activity was carried out following free medical checkups at the Lanka Hospitals stall on location
