England tour:  CID takes over SLC fraud case

IGP Pujith Jayasundara yesterday, ordered the Criminal Investigation Department to take over the investigations into a complaint made by the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) over an attempted financial fraud of US$ 5 million on television rights for England tour.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) had been able to successfully thwart a fraudulent attempt to transfer US$ 5.5 million of SLC’s Media Rights Sponsorship funds, which was due from an International Media Network; to an offshore account on Monday .
The fraudulent act was discovered, before it was executed through bogus means.
Issuing a statement, SLC said immediately upon finding of the attempted fraud, Sri Lanka Cricket’s CEO Ashley De Silva had lodged a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) under the direction of the Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa on Monday evening to probe the attempted fraud.
