Sri Lanka launches dedicated student  and youth online platform

The International Student Identity Card (ISIC) - a UNESCO endorsed lifestyle and photo identity card for students and youth launched its new online platform www.isic.lk the first ever for the local market, dedicated to benefits and discounts for students and youth.
“The main objective of creating this site is to offer students and youth real and tangible discounts on air travel, accommodation and other products and services that enrich a student’s lifestyle. “Additionally, we have ‘book now and pay later’ options that further provide financial flexibility enabling students to explore some of these options that they may not have considered before,” said Thisum Jayasuriya, Group CEO for United Ventures.
The card has been successful in providing value to students and youth in countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Europe and Latin America to name a few.
The ISIC is the only internationally recognized proof of full-time student status issued in close to 130 countries. The card allows students to prove their student status worldwide, as well as gain access to over 150,000 discounts and benefits.
The concept and benefits of the ISIC card is yet to gain traction in the locally in the active and vibrant student population exceeding 1.5 million, as per the Census and Statistics of 2016. This is due to the lack of awareness of the benefits.
ISIC currently maintains benefits and discounts with approximately 50 partners and is constantly working to improve and add value to the student lifestyle.
With the right partnerships, valuable benefits can be provided to this entire student and youth segment. The benefits and discounts provided are both local and international which no other card is able to offer currently. Besides we are providing them access to a global student community.
The ISIC card is owned by the ISIC Association, which is a Member Association of the World Youth, Student and Education (WYSE) Travel Confederation, a not-for-profit organization based in Amsterdam. Each country therefore has got to develop the benefits using its own initiative with the support of stakeholders who see value in the product.
Beneficial for students studying at home or traveling overseas, the discounts and benefits are extensive and range from air travel and transportation, museums and cultural sites, restaurants and cafes, theaters, hotels and hostels, online discounts, educational software, e-learning platforms and many other areas.
The biggest and most attractive discounts are the ones that are offered on travel. Through their partner STA Travel in Sri Lanka, ISIC is able to offer students discounted air travel on one-way and return tickets to London, Europe, Australia, USA and Russia, on major airlines.
United Ventures (PVT) Ltd is the sole representatives of ISIC in Sri Lanka. Visit www.unitedventuressl.com
The card is available to full time students at school, college or university, aged 12 years and above. There is no upper age limit. Youth who are not currently studying and fall under the age of 30 are eligible for the International Youth Travel Card (IYTC).
