Kelaniya Uni’s Inter School Best Speaker Contest Finale tomorrow

The Grand Finale of the Inter School Best Speaker Contest 2017 organised by the University of Kelaniya Gavel Club will be held on May 3 (tomorrow) at the University of Kelaniya.
The preliminary round for the 2017 competition was held on April 25 while the Semifinal was held on April 30.
The contest is held for the third consecutive year, as part of the club’s Unleash Yourself – Phase VI Inter School Best Speaker Contest and School Workshop Series, which extends a helping hand to schoolchildren who have the potential to become public speakers with exceptional leadership qualities.
As the first Gavel Club in South Asia, the University of Kelaniya Gavel Club aims to uplift public speaking, communication and leadership skills of local undergraduates and schoolchildren who wish to conquer the professional arena in the years to come.
The Inter School Best Speaker Contests are held focusing on the schools from Gampaha, Colombo and Kelaniya zones while the Unleash Yourself workshops series’ are organised island-wide.
The contest is held in three stages such as the Preliminary round, the Semifinal round and the Grand Finale where the contestants have the free will to choose and prepare to a topic of their choice. Additionally, the contestants are given the opportunity to present a speech to an impromptu topic which creates the ground for them to test their ability to think and speak spontaneously.
Furthermore, the Best Speaker Contest 2017– All Island Inter University Speech Contest will be organized for the 13th consecutive time by the University of Kelaniya Gavel Club towards the end of the year.
