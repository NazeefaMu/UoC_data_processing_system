[CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVES]
The Indigolla Shrine of St.Jude

The Indigolla National Shrine of St Jude Thaddeus is well known among Catholics, Christians and non-Christians alike for the favours they have received through His intercession in their hour of need.
The devotees in large numbers flock at the Shrine at Gampaha, Indigolla every Thursday pleading Him to intercede on their behalf to God and to attend the healing ceremony. The devotees who had received favours also come to the Shrine to offer thanks. The healing service was commenced in 1992 when Rev Fr. Modustas Fernando OMI served as the Parish Priest of Indigolla Church. The healing service is conducted on every Poya day.
The Catholic Church took steps to build a Church dedicated to St. Jude way back in the year 1952 at Indigolla, Gampaha, on a suggestion made by late Rev. Fr. Philip Dissanayake OMI and the little church came up with the blessing of late Colombo Archbishop Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray OMI, who purchased five acres of land from the “Indigolla Watte”.
The foundation stone was laid by the late Cardinal himself. Until the Church was built, the statute of St. Jude brought from Italy was kept in a devotee’s house and venerated.
There were only eight Catholic families living there at that time. It was the very first Church dedicated to St. Jude in Sri Lanka.
In the year 1960 on the directives of the Archbishop of Colombo the administration of the Church was entrusted to the Carmelite Order.
With the passage of time the small church was insufficient to accommodate the ever increasing devotees who come all four corners of the land on festive days and Rev Fr Elmo Dias serving as the administrating took steps to reconstruct and enlarge the Church building, with the help of local and foreign Catholic philanthropists.
This year the feast of St. Jude Thaddeus was celebrated on a grand scale and the concelebrated festive High Mass was offered by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo as chief celebrant.
The Solemn Vespers Service and Eucharistic Procession was held on Saturday presided over by Rt. Rev Dr Maxwell Silva Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo.
St. Jude is the Patron Saint of Hope and impossible causes and one of Jesus’ original twelve Apostles.
He preached the Gospel with great passion, often in the most difficult circumstances.
Through the power of the Holy Spirit, he made profound differences in people’s lives as he offered them the Word of God.
