National Esports team competes with worlds best at 18th Asian Games

This year’s Asian Games saw history being made as Electronic Sports (Esports) were included as a demonstration sport at the event for the first time in history. Electronic Sports, the world’s fastest growing sport today, is the competitive play of video games. Much like traditional sports, Electronic Sports are structured around athletes, either solo or coming together to form teams competing in tournaments, leagues and championships.
The Sri Lanka Esports Association with the support of strategic partner Gamer.LK, along with the Sports Ministry and the National Olympic Committee sent a contingent of Sri Lanka’s best Esports athletes across 5 titles to compete at the games. The titles included in this year’s games were League of Legends, Hearthstone, Pro Evolution Soccer, Starcraft 2 and Clash Royale.
Sri Lanka’s Esports athletes taking part in the respective eSports titles were as follows: LEAGUE OF LEGENDS: Akthar Hafeez, Shalitha Chandrarathna, Ashik Saleeth, Achintha Konara, Hilal Jismy, Abith Latiff. HEARTHSTONE: Ramesh Uthayakumar. PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER (PES): Mufeed Miskin, Shihab Rizan. STARCRAFT 2: Amruth Alfred. and CLASH ROYALE: Joel Joung.
Sri Lanka faced a South Asian regional qualifier, where the top country from each game would qualify to take part in the main event in Jakarta, Indonesia in August. PES, Hearthstone and Starcraft two qualifiers were played online, while League of Legends and Clash Royale were played in Vietnam and Hong Kong respectively. Out of the 5 titles, Amruth Alfred playing Starcraft 2 beat the rest of South Asia to qualify for the main event in Indonesia, where he would go on to face the best Starcraft 2 players in the world. Sri Lanka didn’t qualify for the other 4 titles. Amruth Alfred Coming from Peradeniya, Kandy, is an alumnus of Gateway College Kandy, and is currently following an MPhil in Astrophysics at the University of Hong Kong where he completed his BSc in Physics and Astronomy with Second Upper Honours.
“I really like 1 v 1 games, because it just depends on you. Your skill determines if you win or lose. Amruth, with previous competitive experience in Call of Duty, Dota 2 and Overwatch, picked up Starcraft 2 and steadily progressed with the game by watching pro twitch streams. Amruth climbed to the top of the Sri Lankan Starcraft 2 leader board within 2 months of picking up the game.
Winning 2 weekend tournaments, he soon caught the attention of Gamer.LK which led to his selection as national representative for Starcraft 2. Amruth came out in first place in South Asia with a clean sweep of 2-0 beating the best from both Pakistan and Maldives. Amruth would go on to not only represent Sri Lanka, but South Asia as the regional winner.
The main event consisted of the best Starcraft 2 players in the world, including South Korea’s ‘Maru’ who was enjoying #1 ranking worldwide. Amruth faced off against Taiwan’s ‘Nice’, losing to him 3-0 but gaining invaluable experience and drive for competition. ‘Nice’ went on to win Silver, behind Korea’s ‘Maru’ who won gold - an experience of a lifetime for Amruth and just the beginning to a whole new Esports journey.
“Never expected that I’d represent Sri Lanka as its first official Esports athlete and represent the South Asian region as well. It was just great to see Esports being recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia. Didn’t think we’d come this far, this fast. Was an absolute honour and privilege to be surrounded by gold medal athletes! I even managed to meet the God of Starcraft 2, Maru! As for future plans and being Sri Lanka’s first Esports athlete, Amruth plans to keep playing Starcraft 2 as preparation for the next Asian Games and play more competitive DotA 2 and Overwatch. He also intends on trying out League of Legends as the title was present at the Asian Games.
