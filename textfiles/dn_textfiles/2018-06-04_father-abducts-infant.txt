Father abducts infant

An eight-month-old child abducted from a house at Goods Shed Road in Vavuniya was found in Pudukudiiruppu in Mullaitivu, a spokesman for the Vavuniya Police said.
Police said the child was traced following information that two were searching for a woman who could breastfeed an infant. The two women suspects were arrested and were to be produced before the Mullaitivu Magistrate. Following investigations, the child was handed over to his mother at the Vavuniya Police Station.
Investigations revealed that the infant, Vasudaran Vanishan, was abducted by a gang of six who came in a van and stormed into the house in Vavuniya on May 31.
The boy’s mother, in her complaint, said she was estranged from her husband who was living in London. Meanwhile, the boy’s father had said he abducted the child because his wife refused to even show him the child through video technology.
Investigations also revealed that a relative of the boy’s father had executed the abduction and given the child to the custody of two women suspects arrested by police. Further investigations are continuing.
