Case against Tiran Alles and three others fixed for Oct. 20

The case filed against four persons, including former MP Tiran Alles and former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) in 2006, was yesterday fixed for October 20 by Colombo High Court.
On a previous occasion, the High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan.
Meanwhile, High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi yesterday allowed defence to inspect documents pertaining to the case in the presence of the High Court registrar.
The Attorney General had filed criminal proceedings against four accused-former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with the RADA fraud. On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court did not bar the Attorney General filing indictments against the petitioner (Tiran Alles) based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is evading courts. The Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest, in connection with attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC with Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleke appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty appeared for first accused Tiran Alles. President’s Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe appeared for Emil Kanthan.
