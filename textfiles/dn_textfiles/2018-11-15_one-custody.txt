Police raid illicit brewery at house:
One in custody

North Central Province Police Flying Squad raided a mass scale moonshine brewery carried out in a luxurious house with air conditioning, on Monday.
The brewery was set up in the kitchen. The house is located at Selesthimaduwa in Thirappane.
The Flying Squad operated under the guidance of North Central Deputy Inspector General L. P. S. P. Sadungahawatta. They took into custody one suspect and seized Goda and other equipment.
The North Central Province Police Flying Squad conducted the raid when an informant told an officer of the squad that Thirappane Police did not take action to raid the place.
The Flying Squad officers said the house had several CCTV cameras and electric fences around the house with a notice stating trespassers would be electrocuted.
When the Flying Squad raided the house, a son of the suspect, allegedly a soldier, objected to them entering the house. Later, Police raided the house.
Police said the suspect is one of the main distributors of moonshine in the area.
