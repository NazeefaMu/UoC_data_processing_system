Some post offices open despite strike

Some post offices and sub post offices in 30 divisions islandwide were operational without engaging in the postal strike, Post Master General Rohana Abeyratne said.
The Post Master General told the Daily News that over 200 staff officers attached to the administration work of the postal services also refrain from engaging in the strike.
However, Abeyratne said all services, including mail collection and distribution were disrupted by the postal strike by over 30 postal trade unions.
“Postal workers have launched the strike voicing opposition to several issues, including plans to lease out postal buildings with historical value to build hotels and failure to restructure the staff recruitment process even when the Government provided them with solutions. There is no reason for the strike,” he said.
