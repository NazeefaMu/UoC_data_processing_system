Canada grants CDN$ 900,000 to UNFPA Sri Lanka

High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, David McKinnon, and Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Sri Lanka, Ritsu Nacken, signed a letter of agreement in reference to a grant arrangement of CDN$ 900,000.
The grant is provided by the Government of Canada to UNFPA Sri Lanka for the delivery of the project, 'Addressing Sexual Gender-based Violence through Public Institutions', by March 31, 2020.
The purpose of this project is to increase the capacity of the government of Sri Lanka to advance Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) and to effectively respond to sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka. As the lead UN agency in advocating for universal SRHR, and the Chair of the National Forum Against Gender-based Violence, UNFPA is well placed to ensure delivery of this project.
This CDN$ 900,000 grant to UNFPA is part of Canada's CDN$ 650 million comprehensive approach to address gaps in funding SRHR globally, and is a continuation of Canadian support in Sri Lanka for women's empowerment, political participation, and ending gender-based violence in line with their Feminist International Assistance Policy.
