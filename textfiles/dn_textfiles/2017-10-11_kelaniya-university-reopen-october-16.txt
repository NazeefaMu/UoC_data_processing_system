Kelaniya University to reopen on October 16

 
University authorities have decided to reopen the Kelaniya University on October 16 after a lapse of more than one week.
All faculties of the Kelaniya University except the medical faculty were temporarily closed on October 5 until further notice following a clash which erupted between two undergraduate groups by the university administration.
