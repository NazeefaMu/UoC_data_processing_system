Towards a nation of integrity
CIABOC’s high hopes and moderate expectations

“Everyone is waiting for us to catch the next whale. Well, if you want to catch whales, then whales have to be willing to give evidence,” said Sarath Jayamanne, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), at a forum of civil society activists and the media at Colombo’s Movenpick Hotel last Monday.
Jayamanne was referring to this past May, when CIABOC arrested President Sirisena’s Chief of Staff Dr. I.H.K. Mahanama, and the State Timber Corporation Chairman Piyadasa Dissanayaka, for accepting an initial bribe of Rs. 20 million from an official of an Indian company. Dr. Mahanama was the highest-ranking official to be arrested in Sri Lanka in 60 years. And yet, CIABOC’s success this May is now perceived with a slight sense of disappointment. One CIABOC official at the event explained how they thought the arrests would have a chilling effect in the government, a potent deterrent for those who partake in bribery or corruption.
It was merely one indication of how CIABOC is evolving to distinguish its ‘hopes’ from its ‘expectations,’ the difference between the Commission’s goals, and the many obstacles in its reality.
Problems and penalties
The opening speeches from three officials within the government - Jayamanne, CIABOC Commissioner Chandranath Neville Guruge and Additional Secretary to the Finance and Media Ministry Thilaka Jayasundara - depicted the profound importance of CIABOC at this moment. At one point, Guruge shared findings of CIABOC surveys, which found that 25 percent of public sector officials are allegedly corrupt and 75 percent of officials “have no opportunity to raise their voices.” He added that within the 25 percent of allegedly corrupt people, there is an even smaller 10 percent who are simply intractable unless faced with legal action. Jayasundara emphasised the importance CIABOC’s efforts: “I think it is a very timely and important discussion we are having.” She then shared statistics from Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking Sri Lanka in 91st place worldwide (behind China and India).
The event later morphed into a wide-ranging discussion of the causes and implications of corruption and bribery in Sri Lanka, as well as possible solutions. Every member of the media and civil society organisations present was given the opportunity to speak and offer recommendations.
The gathering was split into six groups, each of which focused on a different core area of CIABOC’s National Action Plan. Core areas in need of development under the NAP included strengthening the CIABOC, the effective use of media platforms, the establishment of greater integrity in the public sector, deterrence in the private sector, prevention through education, and finally, the mobilisation of communities.
Participants thought of ways to rank public and private sector organisations on the basis of their due diligence and on the transparency of their assets. Civil society activists pointed out existing legislation that could be enforced better. Many focused on the importance of education in order to instill the values that prevent corrupt practices.
Director General Jayamanne addressed many of these issues: “We must attach importance and gravity to punishments,” he said, with regard to Chapter 63, Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act 1975, which provides that a person who is convicted of an offence under the Act will be liable to a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. Transparency International Sri Lanka added that, often, the magistrates with the responsibility of imposing either penalty discriminate between government officials and private citizens. “In our country, the system takes several years to prosecute. The system has to change.”
Roadmaps for NAP
From the beginning of the discussion, the Director General used Bhutan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore as examples where systems are used effectively to check bribery and corruption.
Topping the list, Bhutan was put forth as roadmap for the NAP’s success. On the corruption index, Bhutan consistently fares better than its South Asian counterparts, said Jayamanne, waving a Bhutanese booklet of guidelines to handle corrupt practices. Separately, Jayasundara noted Bhutan’s happiness index as an indication of the country’s value-driven governance.
The speakers commended Hong Kong, a bulwark amongst Asia’s anti-corruption institutions, and remarked upon Malaysia’s increasingly determined effort to eradicate corruption. In fact, Malaysia’s 2004 “National Integrity Plan,” is echoed even at the level of language in CIABOC’s National Action Plan, with its slogan of “Towards a Nation of Integrity.”
Again and again, the speakers mentioned Singapore, which holds seventh place on the global index of corruption, and has numerous safeguards, as well as strict audit controls that have allowed the country’s free-market economy to flourish.
Jayamanne suggested that Singapore’s economic success - securing the investments of more than 3,000 multinational corporations over the past few decades - is deeply tied to its corruption-free government. With references to Singapore, CIABOC expressed the desire for Sri Lanka’s rapid economic growth, and the understanding that such growth will only be possible with a greater level of transparency.
High hopes, realistic approaches
The forum revealed that, at the present moment, there is a distinct tension between what is necessary to eliminate corruption in the future, and what is possible in the present moment. The scope of the discussions highlighted the sweeping reforms that the NAP hopes to accomplish over a long period of time. On the other hand, the Director General maintained a practical understanding of CIABOC’s reality: “We have 29 legal officers. We have 200 police officers.”
By the end of the week, CIABOC will have completed five consultations in Colombo alone, and 16 such forums nationwide. One official at the event said that they were facing stacks and stacks of proposals that they must consider before implementing the NAP.
Ultimately, the onus to improve will be placed not only upon officials within CIABOC, but also upon the same individuals who agreed to participate in CIABOC’s forum, and, gradually, more active participation will be required from the citizenry.
In order to eliminate corruption and bribery in the country, said Guruge, “We must set an example on all fronts - we must be exemplary.”
