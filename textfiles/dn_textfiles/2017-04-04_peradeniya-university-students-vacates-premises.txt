Peradeniya University students vacates premises

 
Peradeniya University students vacated the university premises today following the order made by the University board of governors as precaution to stop further spread of the viral flue.
Vice Chancellor of the University, Dissanyake explained that they had hoped to close the University for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year on April 9 but they were forced to close earlier given the grave health situation.
The date on which the university would be re-opened has not been decided and will be informed to the students at a later date.
Approximately 1,500 students have been admitted to the Kandy and Peradeniya Hospitals who are suspected to be suffering from the H1N1 influenza.
