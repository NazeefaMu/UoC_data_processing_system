Foundation stone laid for 700th reawakening village

The foundation stone to the 700th reawakening village which was named after renowned Sri Lankan film director Lester James Peiris, was laid at Tissamaharama on April 28; a day prior to the passing of film director Dr. Lester James Peries.
The village was named as Sinepathi Lester James Peiris Gama. The said project would aid families suffering from poverty by providing a sum of Rs. 500,000 for the construction of houses.
The funding for this project was donated by the Indian government, which provided Rs. 600 million for the construction of 50 reawakening villages following a request made by the Housing and Development Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The reawakening village would be the 700th village to commence construction work and is the 139th reawakening village in the Hambantota district, while being the 65th village in the Tissamanaharama electorate.
