Ranjan’s take on lawyers and clergy

One time Sports Minister in the Rajapaksa government C.B. Ratnayake made the famous claim that the most corrupt bodies in the country are the education sector, the police and the Cricket Board, in that order. Film star turned Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has a different take on the rankings. The intrepid politician, who is known to call a spade a spade, says, in his book, the most corrupt are the members of the clergy followed by the legal fraternity. Ramanayake is reported to have told an English daily that the most corrupt lot are the clergy of all religions and then comes the lawyers. “Many lawyers have defended the criminals right from the time of Dr. Colvin R. De Silva”, he has gone on to say.
Well, the Deputy Minister is not going to endear himself to the black coated gentry who are bound to challenge his contention. They may have defended criminals in the court, but even a criminal has recourse to the law and the right to be defended. No one is deemed guilty unless proved otherwise and the lawyers too work along this dictum. In other words, the presumption of innocence is the accepted norm in criminal law, whatever the nature of the crime and the record of the perpetrator. If crime suspects are denied the service of a lawyer on the grounds that the latter is deemed corrupt it will lead to the collapse of the courts system and put lawyers out of their jobs. A criminal has the right, as any other litigant, to be heard and it is the jury which arrives at the verdict, with the defending lawyers collecting only his retainer. Hence it is unfair to ostracize lawyers as a corrupt breed, simply because they appear for criminals for a fee.
Dr Colvin R. De Silva may have successfully defended Sathasivam, indicted for the murder of his wife, a crime which generated much emotion among the elite Tamils in Colombo and lost for him an election. But who in their right senses would describe the giant legal luminary as corrupt?
However, while defending a crime suspect before a court cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as a corrupt act, there are indeed lawyers who prolong cases interminably by requesting court for ‘dates’, an act which can bleed their clients, since payment is made based on every appearance. It is such manipulations that smack of corruption and Ramanayake’s guns should be trained on such types and not lawyers defending criminals.
That said, one cannot entirely disagree with him on his contention that clergy of all religions are on top of the pile of corrupt elements. One has only to see the disparity between some temples and churches, compared to others, to realize this fact. Certain Buddhist monks today openly engage in business activities, especially those in temples in the cities and travel in luxury vehicles. More often than not, they receive political patronage to further their business ends, with some of them even holding important posts in government institutions, an act at complete variance with their primary duty to attend to the spiritual needs of the faithful.
The collapse of the Ceylinco group exposed a long list of, both, Buddhist and Christian clergy, who had deposited millions in the failed venture. One has only to consider the current resistance shown to the government's decision to audit the funds of certain historic temples to understand the extent to which the malaise have taken root in our religious institutions.
Not only that, there are charges of large scale corruption associated with school admissions in institutions run by the Christian clergy and there was an instance where the finger was directly pointed at the head of a leading school, by parents and Old Boys, pertaining to the siphoning off of millions from the school building fund, the details of which was published in the newspapers. Such deeds are not only viewed with disgust but also lead to those among the flock losing faith in their own religion. Hence, the various anti-corruption bodies now probing politicians and laymen should also extend their long arm to schools and religious institutions to scrutinize the happenings under the roofs of these bodies which are run like kingdoms by those in charge.
Welcome nosedive in dengue
It is indeed heartening to note that dengue has dropped by as much as 66 percent in the month of August compared to the July figures and the assurance given by the Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that there will not be a let up in the ongoing dengue control programme in the country. It must be said that the massive drive that was undertaken to clear the city and suburbs of garbage too contributed immensely in the dengue control exercise. Thankfully, there are no more hospital wards overflowing with dengue patients. Rains, though, are due and precautions should be taken against the spread of the epidemic once again.
