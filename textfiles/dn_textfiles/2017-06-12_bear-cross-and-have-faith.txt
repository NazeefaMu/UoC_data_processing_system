Bear the cross  and have faith!

 Sri Lanka is a multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-racial plural society. In this vein, national harmony is of paramount importance for her forward march. This aspect is frequently heard over the media emphasised not only by the chief prelates but also by the Head of the State. Even though the title of my writing originates from the Bible in a vastly Buddhist atmosphere its pertinence bears surgical accuracy, I opine
Sri Lanka in particular and the rest of the world, in general, are passing through one of the cataclysmic periods in the annals of history seemingly due to irrational human behaviour and natural catastrophes, the latter, quite inevitable. Yet, man is not left alone. He is facilitated by established religions in which he takes refuge and myriads of beliefs that mitigate his suffering.
Our mundane life is softened by them and there is always a way out from this vicious circle, but the flora and fauna and avifauna are at the mercy of nature and man. In all these happenings, there seems to be a hidden message to mankind, yet it is palpable to me that the signal is not heeded in the proper spirit as it is projected to him by the uncanny forces. The tragedy lies there to a certain extent. At random thinking, it came to the mind of the writer how to react to this gigantic task taken as a bounden duty as a journalist and a literary lover, above all a lover of the fellow beings, a philanthropist, in the most humble sense.
In the recent flood havoc, it was quite discernible that our motherland is blessed with umpteen melting hearts at the hour of need. The sacrificial dedication of our tri-forces and the helping hand extended to us by our brethren off the shores ought to be bowed with the nation’s salute.
Spiritual guidance
In my deep perusal into the ocean of literary writing by our pathfinders, I was able to find an everlasting panacea for similar situations such as this insurmountable calamity. The writer would like to share it and put into trial with the general public under the able guidance of the intelligentsia. Our motherland is gradually depriving of the intellectuals such as in the calibre of the late Professor Siri Gunasinghe who mastered the quintessence of oriental wisdom through Sanskrit to derive inspiration for finding spiritual guidance for our nation’s decadence, other than political refuge. May his tribe increase!
Maxim Gorky’s ‘AMMA’ Garshin’s ‘RED ROSE’ and another penetrative penning by Russian writers gave the necessary impetus to the BOLSHESHVIK party to oust the land owning wicked Tsar regime when the proletariat took up the arms for their liberation struggle as they had nothing to lose and win a lot by struggle. ANTON CHEKOV tops the list in dealing with the human problems and ‘THE SEAGULL’ provides us with a broad dimension to understand chaotic situations man is embroiled with.
In the array of the cast and credits of this play, there is a progressive character by the name NINA. In a very crucial dramatic situation, she does some mentoring on another character named TREPLIOVE to ‘BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH.’ This biblical allusion reminds us how JESUS CHRIST collapsed on his way to Calvary to be crucified.
As a non-Christian the writer is subjected to be corrected by any authority if the reference is erroneous, he had collapsed fourteen times on the tortured journey for the final Crucifixion. Each time he collapsed, he was assaulted to the hilt. Yet, he stood on his feet and carried the cross to the hill. The words ‘crusade’ and ‘crusader’ gained currency among the sufferers around the world thereafter. In this sense, NELSON MANDELA, MAHATMA GANDHI and also LENIN, MAO, and many others could be reckoned with.
National harmony
Sri Lanka is a multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-racial plural society. In this vein, national harmony is of paramount importance for her forward march. This aspect is frequently heard over the media emphasised not only by the chief prelates but also by the Head of the State. Even though the title of my writing originates from the Bible in a vastly Buddhist atmosphere its pertinence bears surgical accuracy, I opine.
After the regime change in 2015, our country has been facing more than fourteen collapses. Most of them are natural calamities. Yet, some of them are poignantly man made and its traces are quite repugnant to tell the world as the printed word takes wings to far away corners in a blink. Meethotamulla tops the list.
This is the historical hour that reveals the calibre and the disposition of the leaders, I mean the president, the premier ant the legislators. Yet, the final responsibility rests on the head of the state. The playwright gives a slice of life in THE SEAGULL. It could be viewed as the head of the country ought to know the day to day life of the ordinary people who sleep on the mat these days giving priority to the innocent children whose future is bleak now. Some people are under the trees, in makeshift shelters, temples and schools.
The future of the people whose houses went under water double and treble of the height of their roofs is beyond our imagination. Everything they had saved for a rainy day was taken away by the torrential rains. If the illiterate rural people are to be required to fill computer forms or any other cumbersome bureaucratic paper loads to get a pittance from the government which was elected to power by themselves even though the government machinery does not seem to have a close rapport with them now, it would be like the funny tongue twister we recited to practise our mouth for mastering QUEEN’s LINGO
‘’LONDON MATRICULATION IS A GREAT BOTHERATION TO KANDYAN NATION WHOSE CHIEF OCCUPATION IS PADDY CULTIVATION.’’
Solving this problem is not easy. Yet, the government ought to BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH till the country comes back to normal.
Romantic life of the marriageable age young generation was put into lurch by the sudden spate. Even a carrot thrown to them would take them an extra mile. Our country should have a strong posterity as two generations of the crème de la crème of the population were taken for guinea pig from the south and north by experimental revolutionaries. Under these circumstances, the young generation should be given a shot in the arm to do the needful. Yet, in my resource play, there were five bushels of love and all doomed because of unrequited love. Romantic planning by the state would be a brand new idea.
Dissatisfaction and frustration should be eliminated from the flood victims. Appealing counselling would catapult the nation to dizzy heights. They ought to be injected with new vigour. Children’s future should essentially be made certain. Hope and aspiration are to be renewed. Children’s potentials have to be fully tapped.
Nation building
New lifestyles have to be initiated. Quick resilience has to be invited. Emerging from the ashes should be made a collective effort irrespective of caste creed or faith. Plural harmony is to be boosted. The traumatic and loathsome aspects of life such as ageing, fear, illness, unseen future, present complexities and uncertainties and other psychological foibles have to be attended to by relevant experts. The intelligentsia is to be entrusted with the Himalayan task of nation building.
As Abraham Lincoln wrote to his son’s teacher, this is a big order by the nation. People seem to be ready to march when the command is given to set and go. The rich and the privileged live in the city. The poor people who climbed the trees to hoist the flag were victimised by the wrath of the rain God. The innocent garment girls who add to the national income and the farmer who go down waist deep in the muddy field and also the women under the tea bushes are to be well compensated in national planning in the wake of the great deluge.
What our great playwright pointed out in ‘THE SEAGULL’’ and other basic themes of human significance could be translated into practice in our development strategies.
There is no any alternative at sight.
Whole nation,
BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH!
It is the` need of the hour. In this play, the above-mentioned character committed suicide. Continuous torment took his life. In the same light, in the wake of this great deluge, most of the flood victims will have to face an unimaginable problem. People in rural areas will have to be guided in the proper manner unless the number of committing would definitely increase as categorically pointed out by our universally acclaimed psychiatrist Dr ROOMI RUBAN in one of his recent publications. Psychological ailments couldn’t be treated with politics.
The shock wave around the country should essentially be converted to energy as one of the former presidents of China told the nation at the demise of their pathfinder MAO TSETUNG.
Dear President, BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH!
