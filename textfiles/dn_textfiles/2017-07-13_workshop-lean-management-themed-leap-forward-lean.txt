Workshop on Lean Management themed 'Leap Forward with Lean'

 
A Workshop on Lean Management applications to Construction, Consultancy and Manufacturing sectors will be held on July 25, at Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
This is a novel concept introduced to the Industry for the first time in Sri Lanka and promises to improve the Organisations bottom line by enhancing efficiency of the total product process in saving on materials, effort and time.
This revolutionary philosophy evolved as Japanese Car Manufacturers (especially Toyota Corporation) were challenged by their rivals to make ‘Leaner and Meaner Cars’ especially with reducing Costs of Production.
Legendary Engineer, Ohna of Toyota Japan studied the whole process flow of production and devised a new System that was called ‘Toyota Production System’ (TPS).
The entire process was meticulously analyzed to minimize waste, excessive inventory, defects, rework, overlapping and ‘just in time ordering’.
The whole Toyota Corporation worked as a Cohesive Team and all Departments were taken onboard and planning and scheduling were dovetailed as one seamless process. The 'push' and 'pull' between Departments was set in a permanent state of dynamic equilibrium.
As this concept was copied by others thus the ‘Lean Production’ was born.
Lean Production commenced with manufacturing Industries, it was later adopted by the Health Sector and the Construction Industry.
A Study in the UK has found that in the Construction projects approximately 20% is Wasted, or lost considering the many variables encountered unlike the mass production factory process. Thus it was postulated that by applying Lean Management Techniques an appreciable saving on overall costs could be achieved even in the Construction Sector
Unlike the manufacturing process which targets mass production the Construction Industry has many more variables to be considered such as weather, the ground conditions, environment impacts, social issues, etc.
Since the Lean Management concept is new to Sri Lanka, a world renowned authority Dr. Iris D Tommelein who is Professor of Engineering and Project Management at the University of California Berkley, USA was invited by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka to conduct a workshop on Lean Management techniques for the Manufacturing, Construction and Consultancy Sectors of Sri Lanka.The workshop will commence at 1.30 pm.
This opportunity is available for the first time in Sri Lanka to all those engaged in the Manufacturing, Construction and Consultancy sectors
Tickets could be obtained from Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka. (E mail: [email protected])
