School heads instructed to submit A/L admission cards ASAP

All school heads countrywide are instructed by the Examinations Commissioner General W. M. N. J. Pushpakumara to submit admission cards of students sitting for the G.C.E. (A/L) Examination 2017 in August, as soon as possible.
He was addressing a conference of school heads of the Kurunegala District, recently.
A special circular has been issued to school heads in this regard. The admission cards have been posted to school heads and private candidates.
If amendments are required, candidates can notify the Department on or before July 20.
About 237,443 school candidates and 77,284 private candidates have qualified to sit for the examination this year.
“If there are obstacles for school candidates due to non-delivery of admission cards by school heads on time, the responsibility must be taken by the school head,” Pushpakumara had emphasized in the circular.
