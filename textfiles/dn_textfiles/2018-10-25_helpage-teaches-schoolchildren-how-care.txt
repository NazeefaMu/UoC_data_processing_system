HelpAge teaches schoolchildren how to care

The message of caring for elders was brought to the attention of over 130 state schools principals by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) at a seminar recently.
The objective of the seminar was to pass this message to schoolchildren through the principals. Zonal education directors in the Colombo district participated in the seminar.
“Caring for elders and creating an environment for them to live with dignity” was the theme of the seminar, conducted with funds granted by HelpAge International through the ‘Sponsor a Grandparent’ (SAG) programme.
HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said 99 percent of elders in the country live with their families and it is the duty of children to look after them.
He said keeping in line with the religious and cultural values in Sri Lanka, HASL does not promote elders homes and requested students, through their principals, to extend love and care to their parents and grandparents without isolating them during the latter part of their lives.
Colombo Zonal Director G.N. Silva requested all school principals to pass this important message of caring for and providing much-needed protection for their parents and grandparents to schoolchildren.
