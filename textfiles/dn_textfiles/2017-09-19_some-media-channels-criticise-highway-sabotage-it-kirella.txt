Some media channels criticise highway to sabotage it: Kirella

During the last couple of weeks, some media organisations continuously criticise the Central Highway Project to sabotage it, Leader of the house, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony in Kandy of the 9th stage of Marga Development Project in Pathadumbara, Pubuduwa recently. The ceremony was organised by the Higher Education and Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority.
Minister Kiriella said some people of the area were against the highway project since they were unable to implement the project although they were in power more than two decades.
"Madam Chandrika was in power for 10 years and Mahinda Rajapaksa for 10 years. But they could not make it a success. The Prime Minister replied to all the allegations made by some media and the opposition in Parliament last week," the Minister said.
"A media channel asks what is the value of the project. These are very silly and low type of queries and the Government has no time to answer them. They discourage investors. We must make them understand that the Colombo-Kandy highway project gives immense benefits to the people. It is a sin to sabotage the highway. People can visit Dalada Maligawa easily along the highway, the Minister said.
