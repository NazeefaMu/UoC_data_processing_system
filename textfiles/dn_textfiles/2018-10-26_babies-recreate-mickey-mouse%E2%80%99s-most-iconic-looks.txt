Babies recreate Mickey Mouse’s most iconic looks

To celebrate Mickey Mouse’s 90th birthday which will fall on November 18, 2018, Babble teamed up with Karen Marie of Belly Beautiful Portraits to recreate his most legendary looks using some of the cutest models around - sweet newborn babies.
Marie, a longtime Disney fan - whom you might remember from her previous Babble collaboration where she dressed babies as Disney villains, or when she transformed them into Disney princesses - pays beautiful homage to Mickey in her latest shoot. She says she was particularly excited about this project for personal reasons.
“A famous Walt Disney quote that really resonated with me while researching this project was, ‘I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse,’” says Marie.
Marie explains that, like many of us, she grew up watching Walt Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and visiting Disneyland with her family - traditions she now shares with her own children. These memories also provide “emotional inspiration” for her work.
“For all of these [memories], I can thank Mickey Mouse,” she says.
The photographer tells Babble that each image was created in painstaking detail (with help from Sew Trendy Accessories and Off My Hooks) in order to capture the essence of each Mickey Mouse persona. According to Marie, it takes a village to create each photo, which includes hand-sewn costumes and custom-made props.
“There are so many moving parts that need to line up just perfectly,” says Marie.
So, without further ado, let’s take a look at some of the outfits that made Mickey’s most well-known film and TV appearances so memorable!
