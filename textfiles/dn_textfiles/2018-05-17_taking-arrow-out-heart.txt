Taking the Arrow out of the Heart

This Sunday, going through the news-feed on Facebook where everyone was posting pictures of their mothers and vigorously proclaiming they have the best mother in the world, I couldn’t help but wonder if any of those great mothers out there were writers. What kind of mother’s day card did Susan Sontag’s son, David, give his mother? Especially when Sigrid Nunez who wrote a memoir of Sontag says in ‘Sempre Susan,’ “She was not a mom. Every once in a while, noticing how dirty David’s glasses were, she’d pluck them from his face and wash them at the kitchen sink. I remember thinking it was the only momish thing I ever saw her do.” Did Sontag need to be more “momish”? And if she had been—or if she had more children to drop off with the in-laws or the babysitters—would she have been the same writer? Would we have the legacy of her numerous work to read today? Sontag aside, how do the rest of us mortals who are writers and mothers negotiate the balance between selfhood and motherhood?
Ask Alice Walker. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author believes the secret behind successful writers is having only one child. “They (writers) should have children—assuming this is of interest to them—but only one.” Why? “Because with one you can move,” she says. “With more than one you’re a sitting duck.”
Having avoided being a ‘sitting duck,’ by having only one daughter, Walker went on to become an internationally celebrated writer, poet and activist whose books include seven novels, four collections of short stories, four children’s books, and volumes of essays and poetry and most recently a Tony-nominated play based on her signature novel – The Color Purple. It was Color Purple, which catapulted her into an international celebrity, making her the first African American woman to win the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1983. The book also won the American Book award and was adapted for film by Steven Spielberg with a cast that included Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey.While the book and film brought fame and money and established Walker in the canon of American literature, it also brought criticism, the most wounding of which she dealt with in her book about the film, ‘The Same River Twice’.
‘Of all the accusations, it was hardest to tolerate the charge that I hated black men,’ she wrote. ‘From infancy, I have relied on the fiercely sweet spirits of black men; and this is abundantly clear in my work.’
Which no doubt, is true. Growing up as the last of eight children of Minnie Lou Grant Walker and Willie Lee Walker Alice was precocious, outgoing and adored by all. Her father was a sharecropper on a white-owned farm. Braving the Ku Klux Klan, he was the first black man in their county to vote. Her mother worked in the cotton fields and later as a maid. Alice remembers her as the source of her own strong sense of purpose. In a moving essay, she once wrote about how her mother gave her a suitcase, a typewriter, and a sewing machine so that she could do what she wanted; write, travel and make her own clothes. “She saw to it very thoughtfully out of her meager earnings and provided those things she felt that I needed to get away from this town that was very racist, very backwards, where we had been living. So that is part of what infuses my work: this deep sense of gratitude to her and actually to my father as well. To start me out on my education in whatever way that they could.”
She also laments that not one of her seven brothers and sisters became the person they should have been — “because of poverty, because of racism, because of poor diet and drugs, because of the war. The boys went off to the Army.”
She escaped the plight of her siblings when she won a scholarship to Sarah Lawrence where her writing skills were praised highly by acclaimed writers. After graduating with honours she worked briefly for a welfare office in New York City, but soon realized that it left her little time for writing. So she accepted a summer job in Mississippi with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, working to establish the civil rights of poor blacks in the deepest of the segregationist South. Here she met and fell in love with her co-worker, the young Jewish civil rights lawyer Melvyn Leventhal. They married in 1967 despite the sharp disapproval of his mother and the fears of her family and their friends for their safety – in Mississippi “miscegenation” was condemned and biracial marriage illegal. Daughter Rebecca was born in 1969. Walker often felt overwhelmed trying to combine motherhood with writing and teaching (she held positions at Jackson State, Tougalou College, and later at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Wellesley College and Brandeis University): “I was afraid I could not be a successful writer and a mother at the same time,” she has stated often.
A claim her daughter endorses. Yet, even though there are doubts and possible misunderstandings about Alice Walker’s success as a mother, as a writer and an activist she managed to scale great heights. In 1983, the year after The Color Purple appeared, she published her most famous collection of essays, In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens: Womanist Prose, in which she set forth her concept of “womanism” as “a black feminist or feminist of color.” The term helped broaden the women’s movement (the word, ‘feminism’ tended to focus on white women) to include women of color and appreciate their traditional cultural and creative roles.
As for not succeeding as a mother, she has her excuses. “I believe you mother everybody, not in a cloying, hovering way, but taking care of what is around you. We have suffered from building a country on the bones of the children of Indians. So true motherhood is accepting that everything needs to be cared for, not just your own child.” Having entered into an ‘Earth Mother mode’, she confesses that her strength comes from a belief in Nature (“also under incredible stress”), and that her own spirit “is tuned more to the natural world than to electoral politics.”
Today, she sees herself as a dedicated nomad. “I sometimes think it’s having grown up as the daughter of sharecroppers. That pattern of having to move from one shack to another — after the family has been exploited for its labor. It’s in the rhythm of my being. Now, I have places here and places there. I go from one to the other. I want to feel that the planet is my home, but I know there are parts of the planet where I’m really not wanted...”
She has her own theory on how to overcome this pain – the pain of being an outcast in a world bound by conventional beliefs. “No one escapes a time in life when the arrow of sorrow, of anger, of despair pierces the heart. For many of us, there is the inevitable need to circle the wound. It is often such a surprise to find it there, in us, when we had assumed arrows so painful only landed in the hearts of other people. Some of us spend decades screaming at the archer. Or at least for longer periods than are good for us. How to take the arrow out of the heart? How to learn to relieve our own pain? That is the question. Like many such questions it is one delved into by Buddhism, but also by anyone who has lived long enough to see, by trial and error, for the most part, that the futility we begin to feel, as we attempt to bring down the archer, leaves our wounded heart untended and the medicine of life that abounds wherever we are, is left unapplied.”
This kind of wisdom comes with age. At 74, Walker says she is now an elder. “When you get to be my age you accept being an elder. And there’s great freedom in that. So much of your life is already lived. You feel empowered to say exactly what you think. And to share what you have gleaned whatever wisdom there is. And it’s actually quite beautiful, a wonderful place to be in.
