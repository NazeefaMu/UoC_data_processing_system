20A will not be taken up in House tomorrow: Kiriella

The 20th Amendment to the Constitution will not be taken up in Parliament tomorrow as planned,said Chief Government Whip and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
He said that the UNP Parliamentary Group decided not to take up the draft bill in Parliament tomorrow.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, aiming at holding elections for all Provincial Councils on the same date, was scheduled to be taken up for debate in Parliament tomorrow.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is expected to announce the Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution when Parliament meets at 1 p.m today.
A Senior UNP Parliamentarian who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News that the UNP Group decided to bring the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill to increase the number of female representatives in Provincial Councils in Parliament tomorrow
“We will bring this Bill in Parliament instead of the Draft Bill on the 20th Amendment tomorrow,” he said.
The Government gazetted the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill to increase the number of female representatives in Provincial Councils,in July this year.
The Bill seeks to amend the Provincial Councils Elections Act No. 2 of 1988 to make it binding on all political parties and independent groups to field at least 30 per cent female candidates at Provincial Council elections.
