Only judiciary can decides legality of Govt.- Vasu

It is the judiciary that decides the legality of the government. No one else has the right to determine it”, National Integration, Reconciliation and languages Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
He said that the United National Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna or the Tamil National Alliance cannot determine if the incumbent government is illegal or unconstitutional.
Addressing a press conference at the Dr.N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo 8 yesterday, Nanayakkara added that the UPFA is the only group that has the highest number of Members in Parliament.
Nanayakkara added that President Maithripala Sirisena has invited former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to form a government as the latter represents the only group that has the highest number of Members in Parliament.
He said that the UNP is still struggling to collect the signatures of UNP Parliamentarians to get Parliamentarian Ranil Wickemesinghe as Prime Minister, though the party boasts that they have majority in Parliament.
The Minister added that the appointment of new Prime Minister and the Ministers has made in compliance with the Constitution. The President has also apprised the Commonwealth that the appointment is made in keeping the with the country’s Constitution.
“UNP and its sinister allies – the JVP and TNA are harping on that this appointment the government is illegal and unconstitutional,” he said.
He said that the UNP and its NGO bandwagon are in a desparate attempt to incite the people against the government
“The people who faced untold hardships due to the economic policy of the previous government and the people who are against the imperialist policies of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have now rallied around President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rapaksa,” he said.
Nanayakkara added that those who were against President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 with the support of imperialist elements, have regrouped again to work against the incumbent government.
“We boycotted Parliament as clashes may erupt due to the arbitrary and undemocratic decisions of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
