Man abducts teenage girl, exploits her at estate house

“Sri Lanka has a population of only 20 million people. There is no use of a government if it cannot feed this 20 million,” stated Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday.
The minister made these remarks at an empowerment programme organized for workers in the coconut industry, at the Coconut Cultivation Board. “Coconut production has decreased due to weather fluctuations and so prices have increased. Now the citizens are blaming the ministry and the Cultivation Board. Although I cannot change the weather, I have appointed various societies to provide coconuts under the controlled price. Experts now say production of coconuts would be stabilised by June and we can obtain a harvest of 3,000 million coconuts,” said the Minister
The minister donated 33 vehicles for each kapruka society established in the Pradeshiya Sabhas of Kurunegala, Marawila, Gamapaha, Polonnaruwa and Kuliyapitiya. These societies are in the process of distributing coconuts under the controlled price. The minister also distributed grants totalling Rs.10 million and tablets to regional managers. “Coconut enjoys high demand in the local and international market. It is our duty to increase the resources and the manpower for this industry. If we can develop cultivation using modern technology and new cultivating methods, we could bring back this industry to its former glory. This duty falls on the Cultivation Board. Although they are doing a good job, I’m afraid more is needed,” said the minister.
The minister criticised the thinking patterns of the state agencies as well. “The state companies should change to meet the demands of the new markets.”
“We need new leadership with honesty and teamwork.”
“We should do our best for the future of this industry, irrespective of our parties and our personal agendas.”
Referring to the glyphosate issue, the minister said, “It’s simple. Glyphosate is a weedicide. How can we cultivate without using weedicides?”
