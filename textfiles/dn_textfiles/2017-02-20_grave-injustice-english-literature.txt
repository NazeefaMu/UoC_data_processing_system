A grave injustice for English Literature

The other day, I had to peruse through A/L English Literature past question papers to guess what questions our learned professors would set for the forthcoming August examination , 2017 for the above subject bearing the subject number 73. Since they have prepared question papers for six years consecutively, they might find it not easy to set appropriate questions for the next. An in-depth analysis of the pattern of question papers shows that they have indirectly expected from the candidates the same answers several times.
It has been the old wine in new bottles. The increased number of passes at the second and third attempts bears ample testimony in this regard. Yet, in my opinion, they have failed to test some of the vital areas of the syllabus including poetry, drama, short stories and fiction. They seemed to have skipped very important aspects for testing.
The examinations are necessary evils. Yet, they have come to stay as no any other alternative has surpassed them yet. My concern here is not to bring forth any of that sort, but to focus your attention to an unpardonable crime the relevant authorities have committed in one of the question papers that they have prepared. These days almost all the question papers are not immune to errors. These errors have not been pointed out by most of the teachers due to visible and invisible reasons.
Private practice
Quite understandably they are not competent enough to write to the newspapers to show them, on one hand and on the other hand, they are fully involved in the lucrative business of private practice as present day disciples of Hipocrates. They have no time to bother about defective question papers. It is reliably learnt that some very reckless teachers throw away even the teachers’ guide and teach whatever comes to their mouth. The huge number of failures at the last examination would ring alarming bells to the sensitive authorities.
‘Unseen’ is a major question in the A/L English Literature question paper and it carries 20 marks. The allocated marks to this particular question could decide the destiny of the candidates since all of them are sitting for a very decisive examination. They are competing for a seat at the university with a set target. It is heard that some are seeking to pursue law, some others foreign affairs while some others merely want to read for English as a subject. All are high academic pursuits. Therefore, the authorities are duty bound to leave no stone unturned to bring justice to all the candidates irrespective of their milieu.
International school students
The bone of contention is that all are alike at examinations. No favouritism is allowed. In our country, two syllabi are in function, as far as I am aware of, namely the local syllabus and the EDEXEL. The latter is meant for the international school students who mostly come from the affluent families, I mean the moneyed. In this sense, if the authorities pick up a poem from the EDEXCEL syllabus for the unseen question in the G.C.E A/L ENGLISH LITERATURE question paper it is a gross injustice to the candidates who appear for the same examination with those students who had studied the same poem for their Grade 10.
EDEXCEL INTERNATIONAL GCSE in English literature. The case in point is that some students study for their GCSE at the international schools and sit for A/L Eng. Lit at a government school. The disadvantage for the students who follow the local syllabus is unimaginable. I would like to focus your attention to the particular question of the relevant examination. It is as follows,
The year: 2015 -The unseen poem - ‘Poem at Thirty Nine’
EDEXCEL syllabus: GSCE -section ‘C’ Grade 10-‘Poem at Thirty Nine’
The die is cast. The situation is palpable.
As a parent, I would like to know what has to be done in a situation like this.
What redress could be offered to the victimized party.
What has gone wrong or had it been done on purpose with a sinister aim.
So many particulars, so many questions.
