JUMBO 17 at MAITC

JUMBO 17, the centenary camp of Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association (SLGGA) was held recently at the Minneriya Army Infantry Training Centre (MAITC). More than thousand two hundred Girl Guides and their Guiders were present at the event. The camp was in such a way so as to ensure that Girl Guides from different companies located in schools in different provinces live together in one sub - camp. They had many activities to choose from and they enjoyed many days’ fun and friendship. Here are some highlights of the event.
