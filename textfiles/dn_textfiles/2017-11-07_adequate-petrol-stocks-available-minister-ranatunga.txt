Adequate petrol stocks available: Minister Ranatunga

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said an oil tanker with 40,000 MT of petrol is expected to arrive on November 8 and assured that existing stocks are adequate till November 9.
“There are enough fuel stocks to meet the demand until the next shipment arrives. The distribution of petrol will begin on November 9 and the situation is under control,” he said.
The Minister said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is tracking the vessel closely and all relevant staff is ready to immediately receive the shipment and commence distribution to the public by November 9.
The CPC rejected a shipment of fuel by the Lankan Indian Oil Company(LIOC) on October 17 as it failed to meet the required gasoline import specification of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, another shipment ordered by the CPC, which was expected to arrive between October 31 and November 2, did not reach in time.
According to the Minister, the situation could have been easily controlled but a SMS which went viral that there was a shortage in fuel triggered the situation prompting the public to buy more petrol than usual.
The daily fuel consumption in the country ranges from 1,800 MT-2,000 MT, while the CPC issues 2,500 MT of stocks. The rejected shipment vessel still remains at the Trincomalee Port.
The LIOC in the meantime, had offered a shipment combined cargo, consisting of gasoline and diesel, of which the diesel stock failed to meet the required standards. As a result, the CPC had to reject that as well.
Minister Ranatunga said substandard oil will not be unloaded at Trincomalee and added the Ministry was monitoring the process.
The Minister meanwhile said that he was pressurised by several businessmen and politicians to unload the shipment and added that he would never allow substandard fuel to be unloaded in the country. Yet, he refused to unveil the names of the politicians who demanded to unload substandard fuel.
However, a request by LOIC to refine oil was also rejected by the CPC, and one of the officials attached to the Ministry said that there was no guarantee that refined oil would meet the standards.
“We have not tried the “Ship to Ship” (STS) system before. The standard operating procedures and the Tender procedure also does not allow us to followthe STS system. Therefore, we decided to object to it,” he said.
Minister Ranatunga assured that the Ministry is taking all measures to manage the current shortage in 92 and 95 Octane Petrol in the country.
Further, there was an interruption to the CPC’s Sapugaskanda refinery operations due to an electrical failure, which resulted in a production loss for 3 days.
The Minister said it was an odd coincidence and added that the situation was rectified immediately and it is in full operation now.
Minister Ranatunga further said they intend to conduct an inquiry on the issue but their first priority was to resolve the existing fuel issue with in the country.
He said that stern action will be taken against the fuel station that refuse to sell diesel.
“There are enough diesel stocks available, there is no problem with that. But, some fuel stations have stopped selling diesel. Their licenses might as well be cancelled if needed. We have informed the Police to look into that,” the Minister said.
