Parliament adjourned as Joint Opposition protest slashing of Samurdhi benefits

 
Parliamentary sessions were adjourned today following a tense situation created by a protest led by Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarians today.
The JO members wore black armbands and held placards at the well of the Parliament, in protest of the slashing of Samurdhi workers allowance.
Lands and Parliament Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka told the JO protestors that measures have been taken to restore the allowance to Samurdhi workers.
He also pointed out that Samurdhi workers weren’t given any allowance for the past twenty years.
