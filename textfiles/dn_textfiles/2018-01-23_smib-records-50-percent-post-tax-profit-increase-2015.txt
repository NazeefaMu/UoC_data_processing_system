The State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB) has recorded a 50-percent increase in post-tax profits during 2015, when compared to the profits earned in 2014, bank Chairman Tissa Jinadasa said.
He said the actual profits earned after taxes in 2015 is almost 65 percent over the profits earned in 2014. Curtailment of unnecessary expenditure had been one reason for the increase in profits.
The bank, which is a profit-making State venture, paid more than Rs. 600 million as taxes to the government.
