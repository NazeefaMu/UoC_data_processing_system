Fire erupts in Jaffna  bound luxury train

A luxury train plying from Colombo to Jaffna stopped at Chavakachcheri yesterday evening after a fire erupted in its engine. Seeing the emanating smoke, the frightened passengers jumped off the train with their baggages.
Chavakachcheri Police said no passenger was injured. Informed by the train driver and the guard, the Fire Unit of the Jaffna Municipal Council came and doused the fire.
Police said residents in the area helped control the fire till the fire unit arrived at the scene. A technical fault may have caused the fire, police said.
The train has started travelling to Jaffna after an hour. The Jaffna railway officials are investigating the incident.
