Champika demands strict action against hate speakers

Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Jathika Hela Urumaya Leader Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday demanded to take strict legal action against those who are attempting to destroy harmony by making statements that arouse religious or racial dissension.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU Office in Battaramulla, Minister Ranawaka said the General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena organisation Galagodathe Gnanasara Thera is not the only person who makes statements that arouse religious and racial dissension and such statements made in Tamil language were not publicised.
“Things done by Gnanasara Thera have not violated the democracy of the country and he will also appear before courts. But if any person or a group deals with international terrorist organisation by exceeding the boundaries of democracy, that will be very harmful for all the ethnic groups living in this country, and it is a threat to the national security as well as the future journey of the country,” the Minister said.
He said the behaviour of some Tamil politicians badly affected the development of Jaffna. Jaffna was not able to attract investors and it remains isolated due to harthal and other things done by political extremists.
The Minister said the ‘Mahinda gang’ is attempting to sling mud at the JHU claiming that they are helping BBS General Secretary Galagodathe Gnanasara Thera to remain in hiding.
He said Ven. Gnanasara Thera’s lawyer is the best person to ask where the Thera is. He said the Attorney who is defending Gnanasara was the chief Attorney of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“Gnanasara Thera left the JHU 13 years ago and then he backed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka during the elections. Therefore, it’s better to ask them about the BBS leader before questioning the JHU,” the minister said.
“Gnanasara Thera was a very good member of the JHU and he contested for the general election. The Thera contested the 2004 general election from the JHU, but didn’t make it to Parliament. Then he left the party. Sometimes, he was used to attack the JHU,” Minister Ranawaka said.
