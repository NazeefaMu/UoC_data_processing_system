Tests your power of endurance

 
Ever since Marvel launched its 'Avenger' series superhero movies seem to be in the newest success formula for Hollywood movies. Now after productions like 'Ironman', 'Captain America', 'Wolverine', 'Spiderman', 'The Incredible Hulk' etc comes the latest addition to the fad, 'Deadpool'.
We have encountered the being with regenerative powers before in 'Wolverine'. However the protagonist of the newest superhero movie is poles apart from the one we met in the previous production.
Based on a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the non-linear comic book film recounts the life and times of Wade Wilson, a mouthy ex-Special Forces operative turned sociopathic mercenary who finds his world forever changed when he meets the beautiful Vanessa, a prostitute whose entire life has been the same level of dark and awful as Wade's. The couple draw close but then tragedy strikes!
Talkative and quick-witted, Wilson opens the movie by choosing a name for himself and in costume. Then a series of flashbacks takes us on a horror ride to show him in pre-disfiguring mutation. Once he discovers that he is riddled with cancer, Wilson does not give up life without a fight. He submits himself to an experimental, off-the-books treatment which grants him powers but also severe disfigurement. He swears revenge on Ajax and all sorts of merry mayhem follows.
No big names
Tim Miller, who did the title sequence for 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' makes a directorial debut with Deadpool. What Deadpool is up to is less important than the quips he makes as he's doing it. He is a perfect example of a character who doesn't need world-threatening danger to foil. This is where the movie fails because some of the best moments are restricted to incidents like Deadpool wondering whether it'll be James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart in charge at the X-Mansion.
In Marvel movies, 'Deadpool' has one of the smallest budgets, with no big name stars. The filmmakers try to use humor to turn this into a positive production. However the jokes are a huge let down and hardly bring o the laughs. On paper, it sounds like a lot of fun. Though the film starts out strong with a cheeky self-awareness, this starts to wear thin very quickly. If you're into raunchy and over the top humor, this film is for you.
The violence is carried out with such smirking glee that it becomes a bit uncomfortable to watch. This makes the entire experience a trying one, especially for the uninitiated who are not familiar with the character's unique take on superheroes, and who might be blindly expecting another 'Avengers' or 'X-Men'.
Refreshing in genre
The background is pretty much the same as what we found in the 'X-Men' franchise. However 'Deadpool' is at least refreshing in its willingness to try something new. It is unlike anything we've really seen before in the genre. No heroes are born. No worlds are ending. No cities are destroyed.
Ryan Reynolds is good though as he portrays Wilson, fulfilling all that's required of him in a role where he must surpass at everything, whether standing up, horizontal in air or lying down. Morena Baccarin is tolerable as Vanessa.
Deadpool's script has spent about five years on the shelf waiting to get made. Now that it is finally out the move is going to endure a whole new audience to the vivid and weird character. However, whether it is worth the wait, only the box office figures will tell.
