Amendment to MP allowances soon : Karu

The House Committee recently met with the participation of all parties representing Parliament to discuss the proposed amendment to the allowances currently paid to the MPs, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker said he hoped to thwart any false information likely to be generated as a result of the proposed amendments by addressing the media squarely on the issue.
In a statement to the media he said that although the need to increase the allowances of MPs exists, especially after the salary was increased for public servants, the matter had not been taken up owing to the elections. He said it was only after the Parliamentary election that everybody expected to take this matter into consideration.
For several years now, the statement read, MPs had pointed out that their transport allowance, document allowance, office allowance and other allowances were not timely or adequate in formulation. They proposed amendment to the allowances, noting that it was in 2007 - 9 years ago - that the allowances were last amended.
The statement added with the implementation of the 19th amendment, the duties and responsibilities of the Parliament and its members have become extensive: In addition to the days of Parliamentary Sittings, the participation of the MPs has become compulsory for the Sectoral Committees, which is the most recent formation initiated with the representation of MPs.
Salaries and allowances made to MPs in Sri Lanka is relatively low compared to the salaries and allowances paid to South Asia and other countries, the statement read. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the House Committee has proposed that:
(1) Rs. 50,000 allowance is paid only to the MPs who are unable to get a house from the Madiwela quarters. In order to participate in Parliament sittings, they have to spend money out of their own pockets and stay at hotels or in private houses. Therefore the aforementioned allowance is to be paid to only seven MPs who applied for lodgings from the Madiwela quarters but were not provided it.
(2) Although telephone bills up to Rs. 40,000 are reimbursed at present, wi-fi and internet facilities have not been given to the MPs. It was proposed to pay an allowance of Rs. 10,000 in place of all these services. It is the responsibility of Parliament to provide modern technological services to MPs. Attention of the House Committee was drawn to the fact that it would enable an improved service and make affairs of Parliament administration more convenient.
(3) It is essential to maintain an office to provide services to the public. This proposal was made because it is absolutely impossible to do so with the salary that is paid at present. A sum of Rs.75,000 has been proposed as the allowance for maintaining an office after taking the maintenance cost of the building, office equipment and other things into consideration.
4). Members will receive the allowance for the meetings of the Constitutional Assembly and meetings of Sectoral Committees only if they participate in such meetings on non-sitting days. As members have to incur additional expenses to travel to the Parliament complex in order to attend such meetings on non-sitting days, it has been proposed that each participating member be paid an allowance of Rs. 4,000/-, while a Chairperson will be paid an allowance of Rs. 5,000/- per meeting.
(5). It was proposed that each member be paid an allowance of Rs. 2,500/- for participating in sittings of the Parliament as a Constitutional Assembly on non-sitting days for the purpose of acting as a legislative assembly. Payment of this allowance will be terminated after the task of preparing a new Constitution has been completed.
(6) Although there have been reports regarding provision of special meals, the recommendation of the Committee was to provide a tasty, low-cost meal instead of providing a variety of food items and curries.
The meetings of the House Committee and Committee on Parliamentary Business during which these decisions were made was attended by representatives from all political parties who were in agreement regarding these decisions. The Speaker said in his statement to the media however, that the government has not yet reached a definite conclusion regarding the aforesaid proposals.
