Date of massive islandwide strike to be announced on April 3: GMOA

The date on which the islandwide trade union action is to be launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) along with 150 other trade unions from ten political parties against SAITM, will be announced on Monday, April 3, 2017. The GMOA expects that President Maithripala Sirisena would intervene and offer a solution to the SAITM issue even at the last at moment, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that political parties and their trade unions that never unite on one platform, have united against SAITM under the leadership of the GMOA, while some of them are the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), JVP, Front Line Socialist Party., etc.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the Government had two months time to prevent the islandwide trade union action, but did not do so. Now the responsibility concerning patients and the public who undergo various difficulties, should be taken by the Government.
In Sri Lanka, only education and health have standards so far and now politicians try to destroy the only two fields that had some standard. Today shamelessly politicians support SAITM and not the public.
Dr. Zoysa pointed out that health ministers received International awards because of the standard maintained in the health sector and not for their personal achievements. If strike action is the only language they could understand, the GMOA and 150 trade unions are ready to give it to them in the best possible way.
Only the current Health Minister stands by the SAITM, while all others including former health ministers have opposed it. May be the current Health Minister is having a more stronger relationship with SAITM than as Health Minister.
A fraudulent institution could not be forgiven in the name of victimized children, he added.
