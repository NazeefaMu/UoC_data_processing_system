PM ALLAYS  FEARS OF RUSHING  THROUGH WITH  NEW CONSTITUTION

The interim report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly is not the draft of the new constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said that although some quarters are alarmed that the government will pass a constitution tomorrow, that is wrong. He added that the Interim Report contains only the views of the sub committees and not the views of the Steering Committee.
He also said that during the course of the formulation of the draft of the new constitution, the views of all the stakeholders other than politicians will be given consideration.
This stage which is very significant will commence early next year. He said the new electoral system also has to be tested in the impending election due to be held in January next year.”
Addressing the inauguration of the Eighth Conference of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians Association held at the Hilton Hotel, Premier Wickremesinghe said Speakers and parliamentarians of the SAARC region are here to mark this occasion and secondly to commence the drafting of a new constitution.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation is due to hold bilateral talks with the Prime Minister of Finland Juha Sipila and other high level leader in Helsinki.
