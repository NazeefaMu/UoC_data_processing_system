Witness Damith Suranga had told court that Duminda Silva came in a jeep with several other vehicles carrying T56 weapons being displayed from inside the vehicles, the DSG said.
He said this incident was a conflict between inter-party activists Prasanna Solangaarachchi and Sumudu Rukshan during the local government election held in October 2011. "Duminda Silva has given his support for Sumudu Rukshan. Bharatha Premachandra had given his support for Solangaarachchi's election campaign.
