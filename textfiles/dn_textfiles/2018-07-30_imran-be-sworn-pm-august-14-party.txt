Imran to be sworn PM before August 14 - Party

Imran Khan will be sworn-in as Pakistan’s new Prime Minister before the country’s independence day on August 14, his party has announced as it is trying to reach out to smaller parties and independents to form the next government.
Though the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has emerged as the single largest party in the National Assembly after the July 25 elections, the party is still short of numbers to form its government on its own. Leader Naeenul Haq told media last night that consultations are on to complete the numbers game.
“We have done our homework and he will take oath as Prime Minister before August 14,” Haq said. According to the complete preliminary results announced by the ECP, the has obtained 115 general seats - 12 short of a simple majority - while the PML-N and PPP have won 64 and 43 seats, respectively. Pakistan’s NA - the lower house of Parliament - comprises a total of 342 members, of which 272 are directly elected. A party can only form the government if it manages to secure 172 seats in total.
