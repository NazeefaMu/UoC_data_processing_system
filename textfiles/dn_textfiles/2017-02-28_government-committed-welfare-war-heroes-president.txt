Government committed to welfare of war heroes: President

The government has taken important steps to cater to the welfare of war heroes and help them win over their rights and privileges during the last two years after coming into power.
Without resting on its laurels the government will do much more to further promote the welfare and the cause of war heroes, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President was addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Navy’s Western Command Headquarters at Mullikulam, Mannar to mark the passing out parade and official badging ceremony of the first Naval Marine Battalion held yesterday.
The President said since assuming power the government had taken every possible step to restore the honour and credibility of the Sri Lankan armed forces both locally and internationally.
The government had also restored opportunities for training facilities in developed countries for the armed forces which had been denied earlier.
The United States and the US Navy had now agreed to provide higher technical training for the Sri Lanka Navy.
The President also commended the Sri Lanka Navy for its mission rendered for the motherland during the war and the efforts taken to ensure national and regional security with the use of high technology during the post war period.
The Sri Lanka Navy has for the first time established a marine battalion under the leadership of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegoonaratne. It joins marine battalions the world over as a nascent marine battalion.
It has a strength of 165 men and officers. The President who watched a mock marine landing and attack on a ground enemy camp staged by the battalion.
