Colombo-Chittagong joint container ship feeder operation soon

The Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSC) and Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) will enter into an agreement to establish a joint container ship feeder operation between the Port of Colombo and the Port of Chittagong.
In July 2017, President Maithripala Sirisena, during his official visit to Bangladesh, signed a MoU between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to work together on container ship feeder operations.
Due to its limitations in port facilities and limited depth, the Port of Chittagong does not have vessels of Main Line Operators (MLOs) call there. Instead, many are diverted to either Colombo, Singapore or Malaysia.
In the meantime, under the Flag Protection Ordinance of Bangladesh, ships of BSC enjoy priority berthing facilities at the Port of Chittagong. Under the present MoU, this priority berthing facility can be obtained for CSC vessels registered under the Sri Lanka Flag.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe pointed out that this agreement could have a competitive advantage to both CSC and BSC over other feeder operators.
Bangladesh officials who visited Sri Lanka recently were able to prepare together with Sri Lankan officials, a draft Standard Operating System (SOP) to move ahead.
Accordingly, “each line will operate one vessel initially having round voyage duration of about 14 days to maintain a weekly service frequency. Both parties share 50 percent of the cargo space/ slots on each other’s ship”.
The CSC, however, has no vessels on its own.
The minister received Cabinet approval to call for interested parties to come forward and work within the MoU and a suitable business plan to have priority for Sri Lankan Flag registered vessels when berthing at Chittagong for a year.
The Cabinet, in addition, granted approval to exempt seafarers working onboard vessels registered under the Sri Lankan Flag Registry from PAYE taxes.
