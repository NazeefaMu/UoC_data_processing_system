Shah Rukh Khan's Birthday Bash In Alibaug

 
Birthday celebrations had begun for Shah Rukh Khan at his farmhouse in Alibaug on Wednesday evening.
The superstar blew out 52 candles on his birthday cake at midnight yesterday but ahead of that it was party time with friends! You say the word 'party' and Karan Johar is there... so are Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Katrina Kaif, the Arora sisters - Malaika and Amrita,  Sidharth Malhotra, Riteish Sidhwani and Farah Khan, all of who feature in jealous-worthy snippets from the guests' Alibaug diaries.
"Eve of the birthday!" Karan wrote for the photos on Instagram. Gauri Khan, Suhana and AbRam have also checked in already and are having a blast too - we know this because the little one was already photobombing Katrina and Alia's pictures.
 Other guests at Shah Rukh's birthday bash included guests like Shweta Nanda Bachchan and Sussanne Khan while Bhavana Pandey and Maheep Kapoor joined with their daughters Ananya and Shanaya.
 During the party, Shah Rukh also stepped out of his Alibaug residence to meet and greet the line of waiting paparazzi.
This is how the celebs were unwinding ahead of the big party.
