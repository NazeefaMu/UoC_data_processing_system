Abuzz with bibliophiles

The 44th consecutive term of the World Book Fair 2017 took off on January 7 at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi. The theme this year was focused on women’s writings.
The cold climatic condition, though predicted, did not affect the Fair at all. The worldwide book lovers, publishers and many more organizations thronged in large numbers. This venue was a meeting place for authors and an apt audience for discussions and conversations.
The venue provided shelter to many activities: drawing competitions, storytelling sessions, skits, meetings, discussions and many more literary valuable affairs. The delegates, exhibitors, visitors and publishers from over 20 countries, including Sri Lanka, took part in the fair. The showcases and racks were filled with books, publications, journals, children’s books, sports books, magazines, old books and many other international books.
