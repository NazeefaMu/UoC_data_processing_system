Sri Lanka Sevens team off to France
“It's an honour to represent my country in rugby” says Nishon Perera

Dialog Inter-club Sevens overall champion CH and FC's dashing centre three quarter cum former St.Peter’s College Bambalapitiya vice-captain Nishon Perera has been selected to represent the Sri Lanka national Sevens squad for the first time.
Nishon’s exceptional performances at the recently-concluded inter-club Rugby Sevens (both legs) saw him obtaining a position in the 15 member Sri Lanka national 7s squad that was picked to represent Sri Lanka
“It's an honour and a privilege to represent my country in rugby 7s. This is an opportunity that I have been waiting for,” Nishon told the Daily News. “First of all I thank God and my family for encouraging me in various ways and all the coaches who have been there from the beginning of my rugby career.
“I don't forget the support of my team mates and friends. I will take this opportunity with both hands and do my best for the country,” he said.
The Sri Lanka national sevens rugby squad left last night to France to participate in the World Games in Paris, which is due to be held on 7 and 8 July. By taking part in this tournament the national sevens rugby team will gain necessary experience for the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia, which is due to take place in August.
Meanwhile it was shocking to see the selectors overlooking the best player of the ‘Dialog’ inter club 7s second leg former Isipathana College, CR & FC and national sevens granite hardy forward Omalka Gunaratne who had an outstanding tournament both in attack and defence.
The selectors have instead opted for Dinuk Amerasinghe of Havelocks, who captained St. Anthony’s College, Kandy and is also a former national under 18 and 20 sevens rugby player.
Sudharshana Muthuthanthri has been once again selected as captain, while all senior players like Danushka Ranjan, Srinath Sooriyabandara and Jason Dissanayake secured their places.
Due to reasons best known to the selectors, they have not selected CR & FC’s nippy utility national sevens players Kevin Dixon and Rehan Silva in the squad.
