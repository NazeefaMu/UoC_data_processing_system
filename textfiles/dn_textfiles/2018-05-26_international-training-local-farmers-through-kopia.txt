International training for local farmers through KOPIA

For the third consecutive year, the Korea Program on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre organized a training and exposure visit to South Korea for 10 selected farmers from the Galenbindunuwewa, Bulnewa and Hambantota model-villages, together with two officers from the Department of Agriculture (DOA).
The "International Farmer Group Leaders Training” hosted by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of Korea took place from May 13 to 19, in the city of Jeonju-si.
It provided a platform for members of the farming community from Sri Lanka and Paraguay to share and enhance their knowledge and experience in international agricultural practices adopted in onion farming.
Since opening its resident office in Sri Lanka in 2011, KOPIA has worked together with the Ministry of Agriculture of Sri Lanka and the DOA to introduce modern Korean agriculture technology and know-how to Sri Lanka, and to improve the quality and productivity of the local agro sector.
KOPIA employs special survey methods and selection tools to identify key areas that require development in the local agriculture field and based on these findings, utilizes tailor-made methods to improve each sector.
KOPIA continues to provide assistance to local farmers in multiple forms including but not limited to, the transfer of advanced technology, provision of materials and equipment, assigning Korean experts for selected agriculture sectors, organizing field trainings and workshops in Sri Lanka as well as hosting international training and exposure visits for the benefit of local farmers and DOA officers.
Through these efforts, KOPIA aims to help Sri Lanka achieve self-sufficiency in the field of agriculture.
