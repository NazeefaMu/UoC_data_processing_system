Faizer Mackeen passes away

The funeral of Sri Lankan Consul General in Jeddah, Faizer Mackeen, 64, who passed away at a city hospital in the western province on Saturday morning, took place after noon prayers in the holy city of Makkah.
From the hospital morgue, his body was brought to the Al-Amoudi Mosque, located opposite the Sri Lankan Consulate premises, for Janaza prayers, and the remains were taken to Makkah for burial.
A large number of community members and the island's Ambassador Azmi Thassim also paid their last respects to Mackeen, who was dearly loved by Sri Lankans and well-wishers.
Mackeen suffered a cardiac arrest when he was addressing the members of his community at a morning event held at the Consulate premises to mark his country's national day on February 4.
Subsequently, he underwent an open heart surgery and was warded at the ICU at the hospital.
During his ailment, the External Affairs Ministry in Colombo appointed U.L.M. Niyas, a diplomat from its Riyadh embassy, to act as the Consul General of the Jeddah office. Niyas said, the death news sent shock waves among the members of the community since Mackeen had earned the goodwill of the people by way of his dedication and amiable manners.
Former Sri Lankan Ambassador Mohammed Hussein Mohammed,who is also the President of Colombo based Islamic Center, told the Daily News from Colombo that the country has lost a devoted diplomat who was doing so much to the community during a brief period.
Traveler Global Managing Director Rizmi Reyal said he could still recollect how Mackeen fell from the lectern during his speech. "We have lost a devoted son of the Mother Lanka who would have taken the consulate to new heights," he said.
In the past, he had been a director of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, contributing his expertise to the industry.
