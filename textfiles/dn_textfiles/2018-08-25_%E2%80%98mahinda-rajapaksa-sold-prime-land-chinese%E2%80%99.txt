‘Mahinda Rajapaksa sold prime land to Chinese’

It is none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who sold valuable lands in the High Security Zone to the Chinese, said Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim.
Mahinda Rajapaksa’s policies were detrimental to the country, he added.
The minister was addressing a public gathering presided by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to hand over land deeds to 1,560 persons who live in crown lands in Kegalle.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa, without showing any concern for the country or its interests, sold 50 acres of precious land of the Army Headquarters in the heart of Colombo, and the Fort to build a hotel and Port City,” he said.
“However, the country was fortunate that those deeds were converted into leases by the present government, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s efforts,” the minister said.
The minister added that the previous government did not settle the payments due to those whose lands were acquired by the government.
“When we took over power in 2015, we also took over a legacy of monumental debts piled up by the earlier regime. In 2015, a debt of a staggering Rs. 7,400,000 million had to be settled.
Yet, we did not curtail the welfare of the people nor did we halt our development projects. All these continued smoothly. Yet, the ‘cocktail society’ of Colombo is critical of the government,” he said. It is the fervent objective of the Premier that every citizen should have a house, land, job and an income. This was the first time in Sri Lanka’s history that the two major parties were united to solve the country’s problems, which could not be solved by the previous government despite its tenure of 20 years, the minister said.
Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatileke and State Minister Champika Premadasa also spoke.
