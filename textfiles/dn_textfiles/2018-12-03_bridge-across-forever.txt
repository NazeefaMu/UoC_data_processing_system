Bridge across forever

Flashback to the year 1887. The British empire is anticipating many celebrations. Queen Victoria has reached her 50th year on the throne. As part of the Golden Jubilee festivities, she hosts dozens of foreign rulers at a lavish banquet, leads a grand procession to Westminster Abbey in open carriage, and enjoys fireworks in the royal garden. But of all the jubilee’s memorable events, only one encounter makes a lasting impression on her royal highness. By status and designation he is insignificant among the distinguished guests. Yet, Abdul Karim, the new servant brought all the way from Agra to join the royal retinue is the one person that catches the queen’s eye.
Fast forward to the 1990s. Enter Shrabani Basu, an Indian journalist on holiday. She pays a visit to the Osborne House, the former private home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the Isle of Wight. Inside the house’s Indian wing, she comes across an unexpected portrait. She sees the dark eyes of the young man from her motherland, painted “beautifully, in red and gold,” with a book in his hand, gazing down at her. Intrigued by his presence among the portraits of the nobility, she decides to find out more.
In an interview with the TIME magazine, Basu says “I knew that Abdul Karim had come from India to England to serve Queen Victoria in 1887, but the portraits told me he’d been painted as a noble man. Later, in Queen Victoria’s dressing area, I saw two pictures: one of the Queen’s confidant John Brown, and below it, Karim. He was obviously someone very special to her.”
Karim’s photos raised several questions in Basu’s mind. What was this young Muslim man from Agra, doing at the heart of Britain’s royal court? And what kind of relationship did he have with Queen Victoria?
In 2006, Basu committed herself to finding the answers. Her task wasn’t easy. Upon Victoria’s death on January 22, 1901, her children had worked swiftly to evict their mother’s favorite adviser. Edward VII sent guards into the Karim’s cottage, seizing all letters from the queen and burning them on the spot. They instructed Karim to return to India immediately, without fanfare or farewell and zealously edited the queens journals to remove references to Karim. But thanks to the documents that had somehow escaped the wrath of the royals, letters Victoria wrote to her viceroys and the diary of Karim which had recently been unearthed, Basu managed to construct the true story behind Abdul Karim’s controversial relationship with queen Victoria.
As Basu recounts in her book, Victoria and Abdul: The True Story of the Queen’s Closest Confidant, Abdul Karim, was born in Agra, north India. His father, Haji Wuzeeruddin, was a hospital assistant, a skilled position that required some medical qualifications. While this occupation did not place Wuzeeruddin in the upper class, it was a good job, one that allowed him to hire a Maulvi, or Muslim scholar, to tutor his son. Under the Maulvi’s tutelage, Karim learned both Persian and Urdu. He eventually secured a clerk position at a jail in Agra. It was there that Karim was handpicked to serve the somewhat recently christened Empress of India, Queen Victoria.
He was “tall with a fine serious countenance,” Queen Victoria recorded in her diary, after her first encounter with Karim. When their jubilee duties were over, Karim and the other Indian servant, traveled with the queen to her summer home on the Isle of Wight. There, Karim distinguished himself by surprising the sovereign with one of his favorite recipes. Using spices he had brought from Agra, Karim cooked a chicken curry with dal and pilau. It is said that the queen declared the dish “excellent” and added it to her regular menu rotation.
Eager to immerse herself further in Indian culture, Victoria asked Karim to teach her Urdu, or, as it was known at the time, Hindustani. Their lessons initially seemed somewhat relaxed. “Am learning a few words of Hindustani to speak to my servants,” Victoria wrote. “It is a great interest to me, for both the language and the people.” That interest soon turned to zeal. In an effort to improve communication between teacher and student, the queen doubled Karim’s English lessons, and he was a fast learner. Within two months, Victoria had ceased sending Karim instructions through her staff and begun writing him directly. Within a few more, she had bestowed upon him the title of Munshi Hafiz Abdul Karim, making him her official Indian teacher and relieving him of his menial duties.
There is no denying that Karim was offered perks few servants could fathom. He enjoyed homes at the royal residences of Windsor, Balmoral and Osborne and was also given a land grant back in Agra. The queen also gave him his own personal carriage and the best seats at the opera.
Not surprisingly these developments alarmed the royal household. The royal physician, Sir James Reid described Victoria’s warmth towards Karim as “Munshi mania.” Lady-in-waiting Marie Millet rued, “Why the plague did not carry him off I cannot think, it might have done one good deed!” Private secretary Arthur Bigge wished Karim and his father “a happy and lasting retreat in the Jail!”
As Karim became the most despised member of the royal court, he also became the queen’s most trusted confidant. The two turned heads when they spent the night at Glassat Shiel, a remote cottage in Scotland that the queen had previously shared with John Brown. (After his death, she had vowed never to return.) And yet, Karim’s diaries suggest nothing romantic in his relationship with the Queen. Basu notes that Victoria signed letters to Karim as “your closest friend” and “your loving mother,” and that upon hearing Karim is married, she allowed him to bring his wife over to England.
And yet, due to reasons of their own the British tried to erase from history this exalted friendship between the queen and the young Muslim man from India. Today, however, thanks to Basu’s work things have changed. Ever since it was published the story of Victoria and Abdul has thrown light on a friendship that lasted for fourteen years and came to an end only when the queen died. Together Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim had formed a bridge that crossed class and racial lines, a bridge that opened up the splendors of the east to a lonely, sad old lady who yet, happened to be the Queen of Britain with a whole empire at her command.
Their story is fascinating because (to quote Basu) “it’s not some cooked-up ‘jewel in the crown’ Raj nostalgia story. It’s not fiction — it’s fact.” It really happened.
