DIMO to design solar  powered jeeps for Yala

Diesel and Motor Engineering Company (DIMO) for the first time is planning to design a solar battery powered jeep to be use for Yala Safaris.
This was disclosed by the company at a meeting they had with Minister of Finance recently. DIMO officials had pointed out that this move will help to reduce ‘noise’ from jeeps and would also help to eradicate emissions.
DIMO had said that they are now further studying this project to make it a commercially viable venture and also to increase the distance of the solar powered vehicle. (SS)
