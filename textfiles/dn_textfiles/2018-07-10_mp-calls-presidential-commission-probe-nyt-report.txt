MP calls for Presidential Commission to probe NYT report

UNP Kurunegala District MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena yesterday said a Presidential Commission should be appointed to investigate into revelations made in the New York Times report which alleged that a Chinese company funded former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha, MP Amarasena charged that the President has not yet taken any action with regard to this issue like he did for the bond issue.
He urged the president to appoint a presidential commission without delay to look in to the allegations levelled against former President Rajapaksa claiming that the China Harbour Engineering Company had paid USD 7.6 million to fund the former President’s 2014 Presidential campaign.
He further said that a parliamentary debate on the NYT news report will be taken up in parliament next week.
MP Amaraseka also alleged that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is attempting to strike a deal secretly with MP Vijayakala Maheshwaran.
