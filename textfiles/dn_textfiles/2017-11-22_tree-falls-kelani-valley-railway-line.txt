Tree falls on Kelani Valley railway line

A tree fallen on the Kelani Valley railway line between Maradana and Baseline stations caused delays to the trains on the line, yesterday.
The tree had fallen on the line on Monday, 20, night, but due to the Colombo Municipal Council not removing it even by this morning, it had caused several delays on the line, stated the Ceylon Government Railways (CGR).
The Colombo Municipal Coucil (CMC) had informed the CGR that the removal of the tree could cause damage to the houses in the vicinity.
As a result trains traveling from Dematagoda to Fort have been delayed and all trains on the Kelani Valley line were only able to travel up to Maradana.
