Asalanka’s all-round blitz puts Sri Lanka U19s in the lead

Charith Asalanka launching to a typical captain’s role put his side in the lead of the three-match one-day series against their English counterparts when his all-round blitz that included a match-winning 70 runs and two wickets propelled Sri Lanka U19 to a big win over England U19s in the opening match of the series concluded on Wednesday at Sir Paul Getty's Ground, Wormsley.

This was Sri Lankan youth’s second win against hosts on this tour after Sri Lanka won the two-match Youth Test series 1-0.
Sri Lanka won a good toss to take the first lease on a perfect batting track before they scored 257 for seven in their 50 overs thanks to two good knocks from skipper Charith Asalanka (70) and Sammu Ashan an unbeaten 60 from just 62 balls.
Though Sri Lanka lost their first wicket in the very first over, Avishka Fernando and Asalanka carried their score to 67 before Avishka got out for a patient 30 and then Asalanka shared another good stand of 77 with his school-mate, Wanindu Hasaranga for the third wicket before Sammu Ashan’s brilliant knock helped Sri Lanka reach a challenging total after their allotted 50 overs.
Despite skipper Max Holden’s 40 at the top, England’s reply never achieved the necessary momentum against the Lankan spin-attack led by Damitha Silva who took 3 for 28 as hosts succumbed to 149 all out in slightly less than 41 overs losing their last eight wickets for just 53 runs to award Lankans the victory with a big-margin of 108 runs and also the lead of the three- match series.
Three Lankan spinners Damitha Silva, Charith Asalanka and Wanindu Hasaranga shared 7 wickets among them making things extremely difficult for the England batsmen.
Sri Lanka U19 : 257-7 in 50 overs (Charith Asalanka 70, Sammu Ashan 60*, Wanindu Hasaranga 37, Avishka Fernando 30, HR Bernard 2/43, BGF Green 2/46)
England U19 : 149 in 40.3 overs (MDE Holden 40, Z Malik 32, Damitha Silva 3/28, Charith Asalanka 2/27, Wanindu Hasaranga 2/28, Thilan Prasan 2/32)
