‘Parents’ struggle over SAITM should aim to send goverment home’

"The protest of university students' parents against the SAITM should be conversted to a struggle to send government home, National Freedom Front Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the media at the N.M. Perera Centre, Borella recently.
Samaraweera said the Joint Opposition will support university students' struggle against the SAITM.
He said the government lost Rs 15,000 million income due to the tax reduction on imported milk powder. The parliamentarian said the Colomb city has become a garbage dump due to the absence of proper garbage disposal procedure. "The whole country was poluted with poisonous gas," he said.
