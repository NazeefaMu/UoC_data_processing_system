OMEN by HP supercharges the PC gaming experience

HP announced the OMEN by HP notebook PC, a gaming notebook that combines performance, portability and style in a package that is designed for gamers.
The Omen by HP was launched at the annual Inter-University E-Sports Championships hosted by Gamer.lk, with OMEN by HP as Technology Partner.
The product was featured at the event with one of the main gaming titles, the Mortal Kombat XL Title being battled out on the OMEN by HP notebooks at the OMEN booth.
Gamers who experienced the notebook first hand were impressed by its power and prowess. “The design is simply amazing and the performance and frames per second are very smooth” said Masur Hussain another gamer at the eSports championship event.
The event was further highlighted by the winner of the OMEN by HP Mortal Kombat Challenge to score the best combo gamer RaSsyCzar from ICBT receiving an Omen by HP notebook awarded by Manjula Jayasinghe, Country Business Manager of HP in Sri Lanka.
Video gaming reached the mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games (think Centipedes and Space Invaders), gaming consoles (like Atari) and home computer games (remember Pong?) were widely available and popular in the United States. As the technology and available gaming platforms have evolved, gamers themselves have become increasingly sophisticated and demanding when it comes to their gaming experience. For PC gamers, that means performance, customizability, and design.

 The OMEN portfolio boasts power for battling on the go, graphics for smooth game play, and advanced thermal cooling to tackle the latest AAA games—the highest-rated and best-selling games. And the new portfolio makes it easier for gamers to find the right device for the experience they want.
“Omen by HP its really cool laptop, it looks very nice, and this laptop has amazing graphics” - Mortal Kombat Gamer at the event.
In gaming, performance must be balanced across a number of key attributes including the processing power to deliver fast, stutter-free frame rates, quick load times and great graphics. 
The OMEN by HP is powered by the latest NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and Intel® Core™ i7 Quad Core 7th Gen processor for high performance with stunning graphics. Most games are designed to run in full HD(1), the OMEN by HP offers a 15.6” diagonal, 1080p display optimized for smooth frame rates and 72% color gamut shows vivid, rich colors the way games were built to be seen.  
The custom chrome hinge is designed to elevate the display out of the way of hot exhaust air. Ports include power, HDMI v2.0, 2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB2.0 with RJ45 is also included. The 15.6” diagonal OMEN by HP will be available in Sri Lanka from April.
