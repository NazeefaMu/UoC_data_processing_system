Ceylon Chamber to host seminar on new trade remedy laws on April 5

The Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act and Safeguard Measures Act that were passed by the Parliament of Sri Lanka recently are considered important enablers for strengthening trade related framework of Sri Lanka.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is to hold a seminar on April 5, 2018 at the Chamber auditorium to discuss the salient features of the newly enacted laws. This will assist local enterprises on how to correctly identify unfair dumping practices. Further, firms will be able to understand the procedures for complaints against such instances, so that applications are effectively processed and accepted, and for investigations for the imposition of trade remedial action. In view of this, the seminar will feature presentations by experts from the Department of Commerce and Attorney General’s Department providing insights on the new laws covering legal provisions, trade remedial action, implementation process. The panel will feature Hussein Esufally, Chairman, Hemas PLC, Tuli Cooray, Secretary General, JAAF, and additional resource personnel from the Department of Commerce. The panel will be moderated by Shiran Fernando, Chief Economist of the Ceylon Chamber.
