Motha introduces double-layered pudding mix to local market

Motha Confectionary Works (Pvt) Ltd., one of Sri Lanka’s leading producer of dessert and beverage mixes and baking ingredients has introduced a novel range to their pudding mixes portfolio in the form of the Motha Double-Layered Pudding Mixes.
The mixes are available in two flavour combinations; Almond Chocolate and Mint Chocolate.
Following a timely addition of innovative creativity to their list of desserts as well as through extensive research and surveys that led to the need to introduce the layered dessert concept for Sri Lankans, Motha decided to include these two products and further expand their product portfolio.
Lending his insight about the initial strategy behind this new product range, Motha Confectionary Works, Managing Director and CEO, Nihal Wijeratne said, “Following market research, surveys and positive feedback that were subsequently accumulated, we moved forward to bring to life this novel idea.
This double-layered pudding mix concept is probably the only one of its type to be found in the country to date.”
Speaking about the new product launch, Motha Confectionary Works, Director/General Manager, Adrian Fonseka stated, “Motha has over the years elevated its brand status as a household name amongst Sri Lankans from every walk of life and with the aim of maintaining our market stance whilst adding novelty to our products, we worked on introducing the double-layered pudding mix, which is a new concept to this portfolio of dessert mixes.”
With guaranteed offerings of high-quality, convenience and affordability into their products, Motha is tied up with Sri Lankan standards and manufacturing entities that are on par with global standards.
With the imposition of import restrictions by the then government, Julius Motha, the current Chairman, commenced local manufacturing in 1960 and this family owned business has grown to be a leading heritage brand having won the confidence of over three generations. Motha products are currently being exported to countries such as the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Maldives, India and the Middle East.
