Photographic competition on Reconciliation by ONUR

The Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) with the assistance of the European Union delegation to Sri Lanka and Maldives will jointly hold a photographic competition under the theme national reconciliation. Both Amateur and professional photographers are invited to submit any number of their interpretations of the theme of reconciliation to the exhibition. “The initiative of the competition is a means for Sri Lankans to capture and share their ideas on what reconciliation means to them, in the context of reaching 70 years since independence and the way forward towards a just and equitable society,” ONUR Director General M.S. Jayasinghe said.
Out of the submitted, 70 best entries will be evaluated and selected by an expert panel of judges. The evaluated photos will be featured in a public exhibition which is going to be held in September this year under the title “Hope”.
Besides, selected photos will also be published in the EU Delegation calendar for 2018 and a booklet produced by ONUR. The organizers encourage submissions from amateur photographers including photos taken with smartphones, ONUR Assistant Director Mohomad Hisham said.
It has been planned to give valuable prizes to the winners of both the amateur and professional categories, he added. “Supporting reconciliation in Sri Lanka is a key priority for the European Union,” Councillor at the EU delegation Paul Godfrey said.
The EU has partnered with the ONUR aiming to encourage Sri Lankans to reflect on their hopes for the future of the country. "We want this exhibition to generate discussion about empathizing with fellow Sri Lankans on the need for national reconciliation. The exhibition will pave the way for such a discussion on reconciliation after reaching seven decades since independence. Through reconciliation we believe there is hope for more inclusive identities that value the diversity of people and culture in the island," Godfrey added.
The ONUR is working on various fronts aiming to take the message of the national unity and reconciliation forward, Jayasinghe said.
Contestants of the photo contest are requested to email their entries to [email protected] along with the name of the photograph, location of it and preffered title. An entry should not exceed 25MB.
