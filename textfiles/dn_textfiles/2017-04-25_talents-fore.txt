Talents to the fore

A celebration of talent on an extraordinary scale filled the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium to capacity recently when employees of Brandix witnessed the crowning of the best singers, dancers and announcers among themselves at the grand finale of the Group’s annual talent competition.
A dazzling exhibition of aesthetic skills on the scale of some of the most popular local reality television talent shows demonstrated the depth of non-work-related talent stirred and nurtured by Brandix as part of the Group’s ‘Rasadiya Mangalya’ (Mercury Festival) to inspire associates to be the best they can be in multiple aspects.
Conducted by Brandix every year across the Group’s factories in Sri Lanka, the three competitions saw the four finalists from 250 that competed in the preliminary rounds of the ‘Rasadiya Gee Tharuwa’ (Singing Star) competition, six troupes of dancers shortlisted from the 18 teams that participated in the preliminary rounds of the ‘Rasadiya Narthana Tharu’ (Dancing Stars) contest and the three finalists selected from 60 that vied for the ‘Rasadiya Nivedana Tharu’ (Announcing Star) prize performing on stage before panels of celebrity judges.
At the end of an evening of high quality entertainment watched by 5,000 Brandix associates, the coveted title of Brandix ‘Rasadiya Gee Tharuwa’ for 2017 was won by Sanjeewa Pushpakumara of Brandix Casualwear, Ratmalana, with Nimesh Chathuranga of Brandix Casualwear, Seeduwa, Sanath Indika of Brandix Essentials, Koggala and Ishara Sewwandi of Brandix Fast Fashion, Welisara taking second, third and fourth place respectively.

The Brandix ‘Rasadiya Nivedana Tharu’ - a new competition introduced this year - was won by H. G. Ajith Priyantha of Brandix Athleisure, Polonnaruwa, with Samith Rangana Fernando of Brandix Casualwear, Ratmalana and G. P. Eranga Premakumara of Teejay Lanka PLC, Avissawella, being adjudged first and second runners-up.
