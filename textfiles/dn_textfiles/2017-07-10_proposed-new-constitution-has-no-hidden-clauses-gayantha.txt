Proposed new Constitution has no hidden clauses: Gayantha

Lands and Parliamentary Affairs Minister and Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday assured that the proposed new Constitution will not include any hidden clauses harmful to the country and it will not create division.
He said the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country will not be compromised and Buddhism will not be threatened with the new Constitution.
The Minister said the joint opposition was attempting to create a fear psychosis among the people about the new constitution unknowing its content.
Speaking to journalists at UNP headquarters Sirikotha, the minister said the government was acting very responsibly when it came to the Constitution making process. “We have appointed a Constitutional Council and six committees are holding discussions on the subject. We will fulfill the promises made in our election manifestos in this regards,” he further said.
The minister said the new Constitution will be drafted taking into account views from all stakeholders, and it will not happen without the blessings of the Mahanayake Theras.
Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahuman said a new Constitution was one of the main pledges given by the government during the 2015 presidential election.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his election manifesto pledged Constitutional changes such as doing away with the Executive Presidency but now he was commenting contrary to those promises. He said the intention of introducing a new Constitution was to strengthen unity and harmony among people and drive the country towards socioeconomic prosperity.
