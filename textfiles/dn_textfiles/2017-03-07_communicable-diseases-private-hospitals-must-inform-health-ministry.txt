Communicable diseases: Private hospitals must inform Health Ministry

 

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had ordered all private hospitals to inform about patients with communicable diseases to the Health Ministry, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, hereafter all private hospitals should inform the Health Ministry details of their patients who suffer from communicable diseases.
They should do this by contacting the  Private Health Services Regulatory Council.
This should be done to assist the Health Ministry to identify new viruses, start treatment swiftly and prevent the spread of disease.
Minister Dr. Senaratne issued this order to health officials during Institutions’ Heads’ meeting at the ministry recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne took the decision to issue the order on being informed that a viral flu had spread at Cheenakotua area in Beruwala and the patients had obtained treatment from private hospitals without informing the state bodies.
