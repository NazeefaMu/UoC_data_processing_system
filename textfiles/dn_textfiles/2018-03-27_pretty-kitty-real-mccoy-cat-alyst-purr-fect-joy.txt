Pretty kitty: Real McCoy cat-alyst of purr-fect joy!

Following my last column on the track of the cat I have been constrained to write on the same subject this week as well. And it’s not because I am enamoured over the subject of felines but basically because the column elicited a great deal of reader response.
I am referring to the type of cat fanciers whose road to their hearts has been paved with feline paw prints. Whether you are an ardent cat lover like my long time boon buddies Delys and Dilu or detest these sophisticated fur-lined quadrupeds you must admit that they are among the smartest creatures on earth.
Both these delightful dames who are intimately acquainted with the domestic cat are among the most gentle, generous and genial souls one could ever encounter. No surprise then that the charming duo of ‘cat-ladies’ constantly wonder why no effort has been made to develop the animal’s intellectual powers. There is no doubt, they contend, that the cat possesses a strong and subtle intellect and the capacity to use it for the benefit of mankind.
Their contention made me wonder too why yet this able creature is currently believed to waste its vast abilities in the frivolous pleasures of the chase, or in more questionable forms of dissipation. His obvious fondness for mice has been pointed out as a proof that low propensities may accompany luxurious habits. Additionally, his musical genius and romantic tendencies, which are so frequently displayed on the back fence, have actually been cited as evidence of his depraved and riotous activities.
Not so, say Delys and Dilu, who assert that no animal has been more thoroughly misunderstood by the careless and prejudiced observers who constitute the majority of mankind. They maintain vociferously and with perfect diction – they were both former celebrated broadcasters whose mellifluous voices radiated over our airwaves – that the cat is a creature of refined tastes, accustomed to wear neat and elegant fur and preferring to sleep on cushions rather than door-mats.
As a result, they argue, it has been constantly classed among useless and brainless dandies, or in the female equivalent, of dumb blonde mannequins sashaying the catwalk.
Then the cat is averse to all labour and delights in the luxuries that wealth commands. She loves to lie in the most costly chairs and on the softest pillows, and is never so happy as when she walks on plush carpets and is surrounded by lavish furniture. Love of luxury and elegance is the strongest passion of her nature.
She has all the instincts of a leader of fashion, and is the only animal that is thoroughly aristocratic in its tastes. The cat that has once been received into a palatial Colombo Seven mansion scorns the vulgar cats of Mariakade boarding-houses and associates only with her particular elite ‘set.’
As a cat owner you’ve probably found this out the hard way by now, but naming a fur baby can be just as hard as naming a baby human. Beyond the old favourites both my cat-loving buddies have christened their feral charges with unique monikers. Delys is totally smitten by her big tom Mishka, son of Mouser.
Mishka has lived a pampered life, along with his feline foundling brother Maputo, who unfortunately became a victim to a neighbour’s rat poison. Mishka’s owner was heart-broken when he went missing for a week. Search parties eventually discovered the swashbuckling adventurer self-employed at a nearby gym keeping law and order over the rat population with his usual ‘claw enforcement’ tactics. He returned sheepishly a week later after completing his mission.
Dilu in her way, provides a lifeline for several homeless felines who survive because of her loving care. Among her whiskered wards are Bumbo, a three-legged stray who loves cuddles. Others include Kalu and the unsociable Nirami who gits the heck out of the place after stuffing her face. Her all-time favourite, however, is the shy tabby, KittyCoy.
I mentioned in my column last week about the she cat who adopted us. Marmalade as she was christened, we called her Marmie for short, sported deep reddish orange splotches interspersed with black and white. She was the most colourful tabby we had ever encountered.
The problem was that she was also a promiscuous feline who paired frequently and often with different males that had fought each other to win mating rights. Her resulting kittens had obviously been sired by different males which accounted for littermates that looked surprisingly different from one another. One of her litters included an all male menagerie that included two orange kittens, another tiger-striped feline and a white one with black spots. We named the orange ones Ginger and Puma, the striped one Tiger and the spotted chap Caesar.
They were all given up for adoption except Caesar. But he was a skittish devil who was darned hard to pin down. Our houseman Siva had a time chasing it all over the place calling out its mistaken moniker “Jesus ... Jesus” in sheer desperation as the cat skittered away.
Ok so we’ve all heard about how cats love catnip found mostly in western climes. They drool, run around happily, and sometimes just space out with joy when they get their paws on the stuff. It’s nature’s opium for felines on which they get on one heck of a high. But did you know there are other plants that might have the same effect on your cat here in Sri Lanka in your own backyard? The effect of catnip only lasts about five to 15 minutes, so it might be good to have some other plants in your arsenal of cat opiates.
I am talking about the humble Kuppamenia plant (Indian Acalypha). Throughout the area where the plant grows, it is widely known for its effect on domestic cats, which react very strongly and favourably to the root of the plant. In this regard it is very similar to catnip, but the effect is much more pronounced on felines. Due to this ability it is called as Poonamayakki in Tamil.
A gentleman cat of my acquaintance was nicknamed Stoner the night he got a snootful of truly fine kuppamenia. He sat just a bubble off upright, eyes closed and swaying to music only he could hear.
Both mother cat Marmie and her offspring Caesar indulged in late night ‘slaughter-thons’ of murdering mice and large rats and trotting back to drop their latest headless victims at our feet or doorstep. They then looked up at us expectantly as if to say: “Come on, tuck in!” It was their implication that we were too weak, inexperienced or stupid to catch our own prey.
