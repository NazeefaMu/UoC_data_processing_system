Abans Service’s launches quick service hub

Abans Service has always emphasized on introducing unique facilities which offer greater convenience and ease.
This was the motivation behind Abans Service’s decision to formally launch an all new quick service hub at their flagship service centre in Wellawatte.Perfect for time-strapped customers, the quick service division aims to deliver high-quality after-sales services in the shortest period possible.
How the process works is that the client must first bring his/her poorly functioning unit to the service centre for repairs. Once there the consumer will be presented with the opportunity to get their unit fixed at the quick service hub. The product will then be serviced by a proficient technician in 30 minutes or less, while customers can relax, enjoy a hot cup of coffee or tea, and watch their appliances undergo repairs on the spot. If they cannot easily reach the service centre, clients have the option of handing over the products to their nearest Abans showroom.
So consumers will receive the assurance that they will attain the required after-sales services for their particular products in a time-efficient manner.
Since its inception, Abans Service has always striven to provide enhanced convenience for loyal customers. With a vast island wide network of 16 regional service centres and over 50 authorized service agents, Abans Service allows customers across the country to readily access its quick and effective services that feature the sole use of genuine spare parts.
Each centre provides after-sales services for the world-renowned brands presently offered at Abans including LG, Hoover, Mitsubishi Electric, Electrolux, Elba and so forth. Further, every Abans Service technician has received foreign qualifications that specially focus on the repair of appliances and electronics.
As epitomized by its mission, “Always There to Serve You Better,” Abans Service predominantly focuses on tailoring its facilities to suit Abans customers’ needs, and ensure that they receive the ultimate hassle-free experience.
