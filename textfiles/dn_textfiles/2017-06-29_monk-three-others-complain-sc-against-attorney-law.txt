Monk, three others complain to SC against Attorney-at-Law

Four people including three Buddhist monks yesterday, filed four complaints in the Supreme Court urging that necessary legal action be taken against Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias for allegedly making a false statement to the media.
These complaints had been filed by four people, including Ven. Hobariyawe Rathanasara Thera of the Kandaketiya Sri Dhammarama Viharaya.
Filing the four affidavits before the Chief Justice, the petitioners stated that Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias had claimed during a television programme telecast on June 14, that there were 195 attacks against Christian places of worship from January 8, 2015 until to date.
They alleged that Lakshan Dias asserted that some Buddhist monks were responsible for these attacks. The complainants further informed that Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith had also went on to say that he was not aware of many such attacks on Christian places of worship.
The complainants alleged that Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias was attempting to incite racial or religious hatred among communities in the country.
