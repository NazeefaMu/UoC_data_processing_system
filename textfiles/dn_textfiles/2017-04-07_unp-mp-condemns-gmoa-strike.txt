UNP MP condemns GMOA strike

UNP MP Mujibur Rahman condemned the GMOA strike and added that the poor patients are the worst affected by these strikes. He was speaking at a press conference held at Sirikotha yesterday. MP Rahman said that the GMOA was practicing double standards. “Some interested parties with personal or political agendas are carrying these out. They do not speak about the standards of the KDU medical college or the private hospitals and how they function,”he said. He said it is the responsibility of the government to provide standard education.
“If there are any issues with the standard of education at SAITM, GMOA can propose measures to solve it. Launching strikes whilst causing trouble for patients and public is not the solution. They are trying to fulfill their agendas by threatening the government”, he said.
MP Rahman speaking about the May Day Celebrations said Joint Opposition has been given the Galle Face grounds to hold the event and now they cannot blame the government. “Their statement to bring 20 lakhs of people for the May Day celebration is not practically possible,” he said.
