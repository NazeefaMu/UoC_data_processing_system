UNP LEADERSHIP CRISIS
We want Ranil - Akila

UNP General Secretary and former Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday said that UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe will continue as UNP leader.
He said that the party leadership will not change at this movment. Meanwhile, UNP Chairman Kabir Hshim said that no discussion has taken place to change the party leader.
“The Working Committee of the party has to take this decision and no one else,” he said.
However, the UNP members representing the Sajith Premadasa’s faction strongly demand that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe should step down paving the way for Sajith to take over the baton.
