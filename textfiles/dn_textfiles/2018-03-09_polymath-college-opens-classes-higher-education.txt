Polymath College opens classes for higher education

Polymath College in Nawinna, Maharagama has expanded to offer GEC O-L and A-L education as well.
They also have intentions to introduce university education in the near future. Polymath College have commenced local syllabus as well as British syllabus curriculums.
Principal Upali Gunasekera (former principal of Royal College Colombo) Vice Principal Sudath Liyanagunawardena (former Assistant Principal/Senior Games Master of Royal College Colombo) started the institution with kindergarten and now opened up to advanced level, in Sinhala and English medium as well.
They have taken another bold step to train kids to enjoy a nourishing meal instead of unhealthy instant food. Consultant Nutritionist Dr. Renuka Jayatissa has volunteered to advise the management of Polymath College for this worthy cause. Further, plans are drawn to provide it from school itself.
“You will find vegetables, fruits, greens grown all around the school premises”, an official from the School said. It is more than a school. They provide additional backing for parents by maintaining a ‘Day Care Centre’.
They will take care of your children till 9 pm in all 365 days.
That is a great relief for most of working parents. Kids love to be in the day care center as same as with their parents, probably more. They call the matron ‘mom’ and most of the kids wish to spend even their holidays with her. It provides evidence for her care and enormous love. “This green environment together with the Butterfly Garden indirectly makes kids fall in love with nature. Polymath College is heading for a healthy nation. Our teachers conduct extra classes, preventing parents spend on extra tuition classes.
Tamil, Yoga, Scrabble and Chess are taught in school within the school curriculum. Being a private school, they have the provision & capacity to offer something better than government schools.
They use exclusive methods to maintain healthy relationship with the school and parents. Teachers visit their children twice a year to have a better understanding about the family background. “
“ Polymath College honours, encourages, appreciates and respects inventions and innovative ideas as a part of school culture. Polymath College aims to prepare an international personality with Sri Lankan identity.” ‘ Polymath means – ‘having learned much’ in Greek or ‘Universal Man’ in Latin.
