Navod Dinusri, an emerging all-rounder from Mahinda College

A 15-year student from Mahinda College, Galle, Navod Dinusri Paranavithana has many feathers in his cap including the award for Best Player in Prima Cup U-15 tournament, 2017.
Navod is an all-rounder who created history by playing in the Richmond - Mahinda annual encounter when he was just 13 years, thereby becoming the youngest player in the big match history of the two schools. This left hander is the opener for his school team and playing consistently for the third year in the first-eleven squad this year with sparing many more years to play for his Alma mater.
In 2015, Navod Paranavithana led the U-13 team in the division one Singer Inter-School Tournament and received two special awards as the Best Player and the Best Batsman.
He scored 1,182 runs including six centuries and four half centuries with an average of 78.8 and also bagged 23 wickets in the tournament.
In the following year, this promising cricketer scored 567 runs in the same tournament including two centuries and five half centuries.
In the current Singer Inter-School Tournament, Promod scored 958 in 12 matches including five centuries. He also captured 20 wickets. His aspiration of passing 1000-run milestone has been put on hold due to a court order, which suspended the tournament.
Navod sharpened his cricket skills under the coaching of Lucky Arambewela, Rodney Pradeep, Suneth Kudahetty, Danushka Denagama and Anil Rideegammana. He has shown great promise in cricket at a very tender age and proved his potential to become a national asset in years to come.
